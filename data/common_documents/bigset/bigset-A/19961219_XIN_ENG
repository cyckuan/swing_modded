<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Lauds Egypt's Peace Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official in
charge of talks with the Israelis today praised Egypt and
President Hosni Mubarak for their support to the Palestinian side
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egyptian radio Sawt el-Arab (Voice of
Arab) today, Palestinian Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat
said that Egypt has salvaged the peace process more than once, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Israel's futile attempts to marginalize Egypt
from the peace process in the region. "It will not succeed in
that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with the
Jewish state in 1979, has been accused by Israel of lining up with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Israel makes mistake tactically and strategically in trying
to keep Egypt from playing its role and shouldering its duties in
the peace process," said Erekat.
</P>
<P>
On the stalled Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, he said they
are still in a vicious circle as Israel has not presented
anything new.
</P>
<P>
The two sides renewed talks Monday on the long-delayed Israeli
troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Hebron is the last of the seven West Bank towns from which
Israeli troops are supposed to be redeployed under previous
accords, but the talks are bogged down over security arrangements
for Hebron's 400 Jews who are living amid some 200,000 Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official called on the U.S. to play its role to
salvage and bolster the peace process. So far, Washington, the key
player in the process, has failed to broker a deal between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the U.S. has expressed disappointment with the pace
of the talks and hardened its stance on Israel for its expansion
of Jewish settlements on the occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is currently
on his European tour to Austria, Albania, Italy and the Vatican,
seeks to urge the western states to play their role in the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> EC Grants Aid to British Coal Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has decided to grant a total of 371 million pounds (about 614
million U.S. dollars) in aid to the United Kingdom's coal industry
for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The aid will cover the environmental damage caused by
production activities carried out by the British Coal Corporation
and its obligations to its former and present workers.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made on a proposal from EC Energy Commissioner
Christos Papoutsis, will also help the corporation pay exceptional
social-welfare benefits to redundant workers and cover the costs
arising from the residual activities following the privatization
of the corporation.
</P>
<P>
The EC said that the aid was granted because the UK government
was compelled, before the privatization of the corporation, to
meet obligations arising from the restructuring, rationalization
and modernization of the UK coal industry.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the aid is to ensure that inherited liabilities, in
particular those resulting from the large size of the British Coal
Corporation, do not place a burden on mines with prospects of
economic viability.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Urges Support in Selling Ivory to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has called on
foreign governments to support a proposal under which it could
sell its ivory stockpiles to Japan.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, the call was made
by Botswana's Minister of Commerce and Industry George Horoba
when he told diplomats in Gaborone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister Horoba said there are about 79,000 elephants in an
area of 80,000 square kilometers in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The elephants have ravaged vegetations, crops, properties of
villagers and have killed six people since last year, the
minister said, adding that the conflict between elephants and
people have become so intense that is becoming a major political
issue.
</P>
<P>
The ivory trade has been blocked by the international wildlife
convention since 1980s. However, the convention makes elephant
population increases by a big margin in some areas of southern
African countries, such as Botswana and Zimbabwe. These countries
want to sell ivory stockpiles and control the number of elephants
in their national parks.

LAGOS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A press court to try
journalists who write false reports is to be set up in Nigeria
next year, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Information and Culture has sent a memorandum

erring journalists can be taken to press court".

<P>
From next year, the minister said, all newspapers and
magazines in the country must, without exception, subject
themselves to formal registration with the Newspaper Registration

<HEADLINE> Russia, NATO Can Have Constructive Dialogue, Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) can have "constructive dialogue" over
disputed issues, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman
Sergei Yastrzhembsky said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing in the Kremlin, Yastrzhembsky said
that "the purpose of the dialogue is not to subjugate Russia to
fit the NATO interests but to find a solution that will suit not
only the partners in dialogue but Europe as a whole."
</P>
<P>
He said Russian Defense Minister Igor Rodionov's current visit
to Brussels has confirmed that "there exist possibilities for
constructive dialogue between NATO and Russia on the entire set of
concerns."
</P>
<P>
Rodionov arrived in Brussels earlier today for a one-day visit
to attend a "16-plus-1" meeting involving his 16 counterparts of
NATO member states. The meeting is expected to focus on a number
of issues including the disputed NATO's eastward expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
"Any expansion of NATO military infrastructure beyond the
boundaries fixed today raises a question about ousting Russia from
Europe and the strengthening of the NATO military potential,"
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO should provide Russia with "full guarantees"
instead of assurances that the alliance will not deploy nuclear
weapons on the territory of its new members.
</P>
<P>
The present situation is vague, the spokesman said, because "a
statement that nuclear forces will not be deployed on the
territory of the new NATO member-countries is made on one day and
Washington disavows such statements a day later."
</P>
<P>
On different views that exist among Russian officials on NATO
expansion, Yastrzhembsky said that only three men have the right
to formulate Russia's official viewpoint on international matters
including the NATO issue. They are the President, the head of
government and the Minister of Foreign Affairs as stated in the
relevant presidential decree, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman recalled that prior to the Lisbon summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, President
Yeltsin met with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov "to work out the tactics of work" in the
Portuguese capital, primarily as concerns "the NATO set of
problems."
</P>
<P>
The Russian president, during the meeting, confirmed "Russia's
rigidly negative position with regard to NATO's expansion to the
East," Yastrzhembsky said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Spy Suspect Remanded in Custody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The North Cairo Court today
remanded an Egyptian suspected of spying for Israel into custody
for 45 days pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
Emad Eddin Abdel Hamid, 24, appeared at the court this morning
under tight security measures.
</P>
<P>
The accused, looked very nervous, pleaded innocent during the
court hearing that was attended by a multitude of local and
foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the half-hour hearing, the accused was keen to hide
his face from cameras and refused to answer any questions by
reporters before the start of the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the Egyptian prosecution authority said there
is solid evidence that Hamid is guilty as he previously admitted
in clear and unequivocal statements that he spied with Israeli
agents and received money for his service.
</P>
<P>
But the official said he would only bring out all evidence in a
camera hearing later.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said the man had
admitted selling information to Azam Azam, who had been caught in
Cairo with invisible ink and other unspecified items.
</P>
<P>
Azam, a 35-year-old Israeli of Arab origin, was also put in
custody for 45 days on suspicion of recruiting Egyptians to spy
for Israel's Mossad secret service on November 28.
</P>
<P>
The indictment will be brought against Hamid and Azam within
the coming few days, the prosecution official added.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Azam has strained the already tense relations between
Egypt and Israel, which insists that he is not a spy and should be
freed.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen SEZ Celebrates 15th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said
that the development of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone has
spurred on the economic expansion of southern Fujian, and promoted
economic exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory letter to the east China SEZ on its 15th
anniversary, Li Peng said that the establishment of SEZs was a
strategic decision of foresight made by Deng Xiaoping as part of
the opening up drive.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chen Mingyi, secretary
of the Fujian Provincial CPC Committee, and Acting Governor Dai
Guoqiang attended today's anniversary celebration, along with more
than 400 guests from at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Tian Jiyun said Xiamen has made great progress
in adopting an economic development pattern focusing on
cooperation with overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
"The achievements of the Xiamen SEZ undisputably prove that the
strategic decision to set up SEZs are completely correct and also
successful," said Tian, who is also vice-chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Xiamen SEZ to continue to explore further
reform and strive for breakthroughs to provide good experiences
for the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Tian added that SEZs should not only be the pioneers in reform
and opening up, but also serve as models for promoting socialist
ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the Xiamen SEZ in 1981, the city's
GDP has grown 14-fold, the per capita GDP 10 times over, and
financial revenues 20-fold. In 1992, Xiamen ranked 10th in terms
of comprehensive economic strength among Chinese cities.

PHNOM PENH, December 18 (Xinhua) -- King Norodom Sihanouk of
Cambodia said he is not in a position to pardon exiled Prince
Norodom Sirivudh because he does not have a say in the matter, a
press release of the royal palace said here today.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the affection I have for my half-brother, I never
envisaged granting him an amnesty," the press release quoted
Sihanouk as saying.
</P>
<P>
The king said he had officially stated he would not grant an
amnesty without a prior, joint agreement from the two prime
ministers, prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Sirivudh, a half-brother of King Sihanouk and former deputy
prime minister and foreign minister of the Royal Government, was
sentenced in absent to 10 years jail on February 22 this year on
charges of plotting to assassinate Second Prime Minister Hun Sen
and illegal possession of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Recently the prince said he would return to Cambodia despite
the risk of being arrested on return.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen insists that Sirivudh could
return to Cambodian only if the king grants him an amnesty.

Stephanopoulos will leave Friday for a four-day official visit to
Egypt at the invitation of his Egyptian counterpart, Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
According to an official announcement here today, the two heads

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Falls to 6.9 Pct in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Britain fell by
95,800 in November, taking the total below 2 million for the first
time in almost six years, according to figures released by the
Office for National Statistics today.
</P>
<P>
The number of people out of work fell to 1.93 million, the
largest monthly drop since records began 25 years ago and the
first sub-2 million figures since February 1991.
</P>
<P>
The fall was much greater than analysts had expected and took
the unemployment rate down to 6.9 percent of the workforce from
7.2 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has now fallen by 315,200 this year and by over 1
million since it peaked, just below 3 million, in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
The figures were a boost for the Conservative Party and Prime
Minister John Major, who said that the fall in the number of
people unemployed to under 2 million was a "great Christmas
present for Britain."
</P>
<P>
"The years of hard work are now paying dividends, delivering
lasting prosperity for more and more people right across Britain,"
Major said.
</P>
<P>
Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard said, "Britain is now the
only major European country with unemployment below 2 million,
well below the 2.25 million in Spain, 2.75 million in Italy, 3
million in France and 4 million in Germany."
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said that the unemployment figures would add
to the pressures for a rise in interest rates before next May's
general election.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Discusses Bilateral Ties in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Russia are ready to
develop partnership in order to maintain peace in the Black Sea
region, said the visiting Turkish foreign minister here today.
</P>
<P>
Tansu Ciller, who arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for a three-day
official visit, told reporters after her 90-minute talks with
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin that both of them had
expressed their readiness to develop such partnership.
</P>
<P>
The talks focused on "a wide range of problems in bilateral
relations including cooperation in the energy sphere," said Ciller
who also serves as Turkish deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, she said, also discussed the Chechen and Cypriot
issues and called for "unconditional compliance with territorial
integrity of all countries of the Black Sea region."
</P>
<P>
Before her departure for Moscow, Ciller had said in Ankara that
she planned to inform the Russian leadership of Turkey's
discontent on a number political issues.
</P>
<P>
She said that during the talks, she would express her concern
over Russia's intention to supply arms to the Greek Cypriot
community, discuss the Chechen issue and the problem of navigation
in the Black Sea straits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a high-ranking Russian official said some Turkish
officials are trying to establish "special relations" with
Russia's Turkish ethnic groups, and "many Islamic organizations in
Turkey and many commercial organizations operating in Turkey
support separatism in Chechnya."
</P>
<P>
All these issues will undoubtedly be discussed during Ciller's
current visit, during which she is also expected to hold talks
with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and meet with
speakers of Russian parliament's two houses Yegor Stroyev and
Gennady Seleznyov as well as Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
Despite differences on political issues, Russia and Turkey have
been successfully developing trade and economic cooperation, said
diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the trade volume between the two countries reached a
record high of 3.5 billion U.S. dollars. This year, the figure is
expected to reach 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ciller has visited Moscow twice, first as Turkish Prime
Minister in September 1993 and then in May 1995 to participate in
the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of anti-fascist Victory
Day.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Grain Output Reaches Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's grain output
reached 1.37 million tons in 1996, the highest in eight years,
according to a report from the state-run news agency today.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted Mahomed Rafique, Deputy Minister of Industry,
Trade and Tourism, as saying that the country exported food for
the first time in 1996. In November, Mozambique exported 15,000
tons of maize to Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rafique said in some of the northern and central
provinces, farmers found it hard to sell their grain owing to the
lack of markets, shortage of fund in banks and poor roads.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 347,000 tons of grain have been purchased by the
government.

<HEADLINE> Russia Offers to Set Up Moscow-Pyongyang-Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia is offering to set up a
Moscow-Pyongyang-Seoul "economic and political triangle," which
could positively influence the intra-Korean peace dialogue,
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Ignatenko said today.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with visiting South Korean Deputy Prime
Minister Kwon Oh-Kie, Ignatenko also said, "Moscow's proposal to
call a multilateral conference on Korea with the participation of
the North, South, and all the sides concerned, remains in force."
</P>
<P>
"We also deem it necessary to enlarge the format of the
`2-plus-2' talks (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South
Korea, the United States and China), which are proposed by
Washington and Seoul," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Ignatenko, Russia "expects to play a more positive
role" in the settlement effort on the Korean Peninsula, and
"possesses unique opportunities" for its successful achievement.
</P>
<P>
Russia's active participation in the intra-Korean dialogue, he
said, will "straighten out the road" to a settlement in the region
and will save time.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that the role of China and the other countries
in the effort to normalize the situation on the Korean Peninsula
is also great, but our influence is marked by a serious
stabilizing factor," Ignatenko noted.
</P>
<P>
In response to the concern expressed by South Korea over
Pyongyang's "strong army armed with Soviet weapons" and Seoul's
call on Russia "to do all in order not to strengthen Pyongyang's
military potential even further," Ignatenko said Russia has been
cooperating with the countries of the Korean Peninsula in the
military-technical field on a commercial basis.
</P>
<P>
He told Kwon Oh-Kie that Pyongyang, for its part, was seriously
concerned about the development of military-technical relations
between Russia and South Korea, including the deliveries of
Russian equipment to Seoul within the framework of debt repayment.
</P>
<P>
Kwon Oh-Kie, also minister of national reunification, arrived
in Moscow Sunday for a four-day working visit.

<HEADLINE> Russian Gold Production Dropped in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia's over-disseminating
gold mining ventures have reported a drop in the production of
this precious metal, a Ministry of Industry official said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national gold industry conference in Moscow,
Vladimir Piskunov, the official in charge of precious metals and
stones said the Ministry of Industry proposes to start setting up
large amalgamations or financial and industrial groups, which
small gold mining units would be invited to join voluntarily, with
an aim to promote gold production.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1996, Russia's gold production will only reach
117 tonnes, 11 percent less than in 1995 while the production from
scrap and wastes will be down at around three tonnes from the 4.4
tonnes in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that Russia's gold output will continue to
fall in 1997 to some 90 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
The gold industry crisis has "reached its peak," he said,
attributing the problem to the dissemination of the industry which
consists of hundreds of small mining units.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, over 130 mining companies are operating
in Russia's northeast region of Magadan, the country's second
biggest gold producing region next after Yakutia.
</P>
<P>
Of the 254 mining companies that received government advances
to finance preparations for this year's mining season, 15 has so
far failed to produce a single gram of the metal, the official
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani caretaker Law
Minister Fakharuddin Ibrahim resigned today due to rift with Chief
Justice of Pakistan and with the government.
</P>
<P>
The law minister tendered his resignation to President Farooq
Leghari here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said in the resignation letter, "You were asking me to
relinquish the portfolio of Law and Parliamentary Affairs because
the Chief Justice of Pakistan found it difficult to get along with
me.
</P>
<P>
"This difficulty is on the question of appointment of Law
Secretary.
</P>
<P>
"It passes my comprehension how Chief Justice of Pakistan could
have any interest in the appointment of a federal law secretary."
</P>
<P>
He said what was more alarming was Chief Justice Sajjad Ali
Shah insisted upon the appointment of his own nominee as the
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim said it was regrettable that the government made
changes in the amendment of election law, which passed after the
caretaker government took office and had won praised country-wide.
</P>
<P>
"Because of certain pressures the government thought it
necessary for political reasons to further amend the amendments
introduced in the election law.
</P>
<P>
"I was unhappy with the proposed amendments and had to put to
you my submissions in a forceful manner.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of regret that my point of view was not
accepted and the government promulgated certain amendments which
have made the earlier amendments controversial."
</P>
<P>
According to the law minister, the president offered him the
portfolio of education, but he chose to resign rather than to
accept the post.

<HEADLINE> Airport Employees in Greece to Stage Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Airport employees in Greece
will stage a 24-hour nationwide strike Friday to demand higher
wages and other better fringe benefits, the Federation of Civil
Aviation Employee Associations announced today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the employees are demanding the
exclusion of four benefits they receive from the new salary scale,
an 8 percent salary increase, and legislation of overtime and
holiday remuneration.
</P>
<P>
Greece has witnessed a wave of strikes since Monday with
hundreds of thousands of civil servants, bank employees,
diplomats, school teachers, customs officials, municipality
workers, seamen and many factory and construction workers stepping
up their protests against the government's economic austerity
measures.
</P>
<P>
The 300-member parliament is to vote on the budget, which the
government has described as the toughest in the last 15 years,
after midnight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The strike action in Athens and major cities around the country
follows a farmers' revolt that has blocked the country's main
roads for the 20th day today. The farmers are planning to take
their protest to the streets of Athens Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Facing the unrest and strikes, the government refuses to budge,
saying its policy is the only way Greece will catch up with its
partners in the European Union.

<HEADLINE> British Airways Decides to Sever Alliance With USAir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- British Airways (BA) announced
today that it is ending links with the American carrier USAir and
is selling all its shares in the airline, according to local press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
BA has a 24.6 percent stake in USAir, for which it paid 400
million US dollars in 1993, in an alliance which has given it a
foothold in many new American destinations.
</P>
<P>
But USAir is taking legal action over BA's proposed merger with
an even bigger US firm, American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Under a deal governing BA's investment, it must offer the
shares to USAir before selling them. The US carrier has 60 days to
decide whether to buy them.
</P>
<P>
BA, which would not disclose the offer price, stressed that the
sale had not been prompted by USAir's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
BA's chief executive Bob Ayling said in a statement that it had
taken the action "with regret," but it would "clearly be unwise to
pursue an alliance with an unwilling partner."

<HEADLINE> Robben Island Officially Transferred to Arts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Robben Island, South
Africa's most notorious prison during apartheid era, was today
officially transferred from the Department of Correctional
Services to that of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Documents transferring authority over Robben Island with
effect from January 1, 1997, were signed by the concerned
ministers, Sipo Mzimela and Lionel Mtshali, during a special
ceremony held on the island, reported the South African Press
Association from Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
With the recent closure of the prison on the island, the
ceremony formally ended correctional services' control over
Robben Island for the past 30 years, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Mtshali said the conservation, protection and promotion of
Robben Island's unique historical, cultural, political and
environmental heritage was of paramount importance to his
department.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, a Robben Island Council would be appointed
early next year to govern the island, set policy and appoint a
director and staff to run the new institution, said Mtshali.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the section where political prisoners were held
would be converted into the Museum of the Freedom Struggle in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela spent most of his 27-year
imprisonment on Robben island before he was released in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Namibia, Botswana Dispute Over Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government
said today it would consider approaching the International Court
of Justice if Botswana continues to object to its plan to pump
water from Okavango River.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Piet Heyns, Director General of the
Ministry of Water Affairs, according to a report from Windhoek by
the Southern African Broadcasting Association.
</P>
<P>
Heyns said his country will take the matter to the World
Court, based in the Dutch capital of the Hague, for a ruling on how
much water Namibia can draw from Okavango.
</P>
<P>
"Namibia is entitled to a reasonable share of the Okavango
River and will request a ruling to this effect from the court if
necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Drought-prone Namibia plans to draw 20 million cubic meters of
water from the Okavango River each year, and to use the water to
supply its capital city of Windhoek and the drier central areas
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Heyns said Namibia will request Botswana not to object to the
design phase of the pipeline project to draw Okavango water
scheduled to begin in March next year.
</P>
<P>
But Botswana has opposed to the plan, citing likely adverse
effects for its northwestern tourist center of Maun, adding that
such huge amount of water will also damage the Okavango's
wetlands in its territory.
</P>
<P>
Last week, officials of the two governments met in Gaborone,
capital of Botswana, to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed to carry out environmental studies to
determine the suitability of the project.
</P>
<P>
The two southern African countries have already referred
another dispute over the ownership of a tiny island along their
common border to the World Court.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Jewellery, pieces of ivory,
coins and debris of residential houses of the 6th century have
been found in Axum and its environs, about 600 kms north of the
Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Professor David Paulipeson of an excavation team said today
that the findings also included clays, sharp stones, human and
animal remains in five spots where excavation were being
conducted.
</P>
<P>
He said the different ivory designs were believed to be
residences of royal families. And monuments, tombs and
residential houses of ordinary Axumite citizens were significant
indicators that the axumites used to export ivory products.
</P>
<P>
According to the professor, relics displaying the Axumite
civilization were excavated after six weeks of study and
exploration on the spots.
</P>
<P>
He said the underground building named by the team as
"Mezalem" was 17 meters wide and had a corridor and 10 rooms.
</P>
<P>
The cave named as "Brek Arc" with a gate built from clay was
10 meters high from the ground and had a tunnel of 20 meters and
a stair with 20 steps, said the professor, adding that human
skeleton, clays, broken glasses, bronze pieces and jewelleryn,
ivory and nails were also found in the cave.
</P>
<P>
Axum is the cite of Ethiopia's most ancient city. The Axumite
empire probably began about 100 a.d. and lasted until about 700
a.d.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Interior Minister to Approve Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Despite warnings of
violence, Israeli Interior Minister Eli Suissa today said he
would approve the controversial plan to build Jewish homes in an
Arab neighborhood in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The plan to build 132 housing units in the heart of Ras
Al-Amund Arab neighborhood was first approved by the Jerusalem
District Planning Commission last Tuesday. It is waiting for the
final approval of the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
It immediately aroused strong protests from the Palestinian
Authority and Israeli opposition parties which warned against
sparking Palestinian violence if the plan was carried out.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside the warnings, Suissa said today that he
expected to approve the plan within three to four months. He
said that after the all necessary procedures were completed, he
would hold consultations with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the sensitivity of the issue, Suissa
denied that Netanyahu had instructed him to delay approving the
project.
</P>
<P>
Suissa, from the Orthodox religious Shas Party, rejected the
warnings, saying that if Jews could not build housing in eastern
Jerusalem, then why Arabs could live among Jewish communities
like in Haifa and other places.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that he grew up in Morocco where Jews and Arabs
lived together in harmony. After all, he added, now there was a
peace process going on.
</P>
<P>
Ranan Cohen, the opposition Labor Party's faction head in the
Knesset (Parliament), today demanded that Suissa delay the
approval of the controversial housing plan to avoid confrontation
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Knesset Member Abdul Malik Dahamshe of the Arab Democratic
Party warned both Netanyahu and Suissa that approval of the plan
could spark new Palestinian violence and threaten the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace organization Peace Now also denounced the
housing project, saying it could be more explosive than the
Hebron issue and trigger Palestinian violence worse than the
September bloodshed that killed more than 70 people.
</P>
<P>
In another development, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin
Indyk met this afternoon with Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual
leader of the Shas Party. The meeting was reportedly aimed at
persuading Yosef to press Suissa to halt the housing
project. But Indyk diplomatically denied he had discussed the
issue with Yosef.
</P>
<P>
The issue of settlement expansion has caused deep concern
from the U.S. government, which is pressing Israel to soften its
hard line so as to continue the peace process. U.S. President
Bill Clinton criticized Monday Israel's recent moves to expand
settlements as not helpful to the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Air Raid on Hezbollah in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes rocketed
the bases of Lebanese Shiite Moslem guerrillas in south Lebanon
this evening, the second air strike on the same targets in
12 hours.
</P>
<P>
However, no casualties were reported by the security
authorities for the time being.
</P>
<P>
At 5:25 p.m. (15:25 GMT), the Israeli warplanes carried out
the air raid targeting the bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, in Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, some
60 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that the Israeli planes fired
air-to-surface missiles at Telal Mlita, but they gave no words on
casualties or damage.
</P>
<P>
This was the third attack at Hezbollah bases since Israel claimed
that three Katyusha rockets fired into northern Israel from
south Lebanon Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the air raid, other Israeli warplanes hovered over Iglim
Al-Toffah carrying out reconnaissance missions and providing over
for the strikers.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Israeli warplanes launched three successive air
raids at Telal Mlita in Iglim Al-Toffah, a mountain area often
used by Hezbollah guerrillas as a springboard to launch attacks at
the Israeli self-claimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes fired six air-to-surface missiles at targets,
black smokes were seen rising high into the sky and loud
explosions were heard in the south Lebanese market town of
Nabatiyeh, security sources in the area said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said that its combatants in the area blocked the
invading warplanes with anti-air weapons, preventing them from
hitting the targets.
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Israeli client South Lebanese Army militia
alleged that the Israeli warplanes attacked a group of
guerrillas after observing them moving on the hill of Telal
Mlita.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio quoted an army spokesman as saying that the
warplanes "precisely" hit the targets.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that one group of its guerrillas attacked the Israeli
positions of Bir Kalab and Kfar Arouj at 8:45 a.m. (06:45 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces also bombarded Iglim Al-Toffah
Tuesday without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
One of the shells hit a civilian house at Arab Salim village,
causing serious damages, while another hit a Mercedes 230 at the
same village.
</P>
<P>
Tension escalated in south Lebanon since Israel announced
the Katyusha attack at northern Israel last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Prolongs NATO's Transit to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss federal council
decided today to prolong its authorization a year ago to allow
NATO to transit resources to Bosnia-Herzegovina for peacekeeping
purposes via Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
This is a major cooperative action taken by Switzerland after
it formally joined the partnership for peace of NATO, the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, on December 11.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs
and the Federal Military Department of Switzerland said that the
decision is "compatible with the neutrality" that Switzerland has
kept because the SFOR (Multinational Stability-keeping Force),
like the IFOR (Multinational Peacekeeping Force), is carrying out
a peace mission authorized by the United Nations Security Council
and approved by all parties in the Bosnia-Herzegovina peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Under Security Council Resolution 1088 adopted on December 12,
1996, the SFOR of 30,000 men, mainly conducted by NATO, takes over
the mandate of the IFOR of 53,000 men in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its
mandate ends in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
On December 20, 1995, Switzerland permitted NATO to transit
troops, vehicles and equipment to Bosnia-Herzegovina via
Switzerland's air, road and railroad.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the prolongation of the transit
"manifests Switzerland's support for the peace process in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and its solidarity with other countries which
take an active part in the peace mission there."

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Outshoots Iran 4-3 on Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi Arabia defeated
Iran 4-3 on penalties Wednesday to head into the final,
reappearing the scene and results of their semifinal battle on
Asian Cup some 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two top Asian teams crashed in a spectacular thriller
featuring all the excellent skills and brilliant teamworks, tough
defense and hard shots but a goal in the 120 minutes marathon
match.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabia defeated Iran in the semi-finals at the ninth
Asian Cup at Singapore in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia should open the scoring in the 15th minute when
two players missed a crossing ball just in the very front of the
gaolmouth.
</P>
<P>
It was 0-0 when the regular time ended, though the Saudi Arabia
hitte the cross bar twice and Ali Daei's nine-meter header in the
67th minute was saved by Mohammed Al-Deayea, goalie of Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Nima Nakisa was the lucky man in the overtime as he kept the
Iran goal clean with the help of his teammates despite of Saudi
Arbaia's headers, drives and bully shots.
</P>
<P>
Nakisa was replaced by 30-year-old veteran Ahmad Abedzadeh with
three minutes left in the overtime for the preparation of the
penalty shotout.
</P>
<P>
Abedzadeh surely did what the coaches sent him for in the
penalty kicking. He successfully saved shots from Khalid Al Temawi
and Abdullah Zubromawi of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
But Al-Deayea also blocked away two balls from his Iranian
opponents while watching Ali Daei kicked away Iran's first penalty
shot into open air.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Arabia will play host the UAE on Saturday for the
title.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Ahmed scored a header in the 79th minute to boost the
UAE into their first final spot since the continental soccer event
started in 1956.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's goalie Hussein Fairouz, with a showy play Wednesday,
won his 100th cap in the match important both for his side and
himself.
</P>
<P>
Iran will take on Kuwait for the third place in the 12-team
tournament in Abu Dhabi early Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Defense Minister Speaks Tough Words on NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov spoke today tough language expressing his country's
strong opposition to NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that Russia would be forced to take appropriate
measures to counter the negative influence of the enlargement.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with the 16 NATO defense ministers today in
the traditional "16 plus 1" form, Minister Rodionov restated at a
joint press conference with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
aside that NATO's enlargement to the east was unacceptable for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
By giving reasons for Russia's position, Rodionov said that,
first, enlargement to the east would disrupt the strategic and
military balance and international disarmament treaties would be
violated.
</P>
<P>
He argued that if Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia joined NATO, NATO's land forces would increase by 15 to
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly," he said, "even taking into account the CFE
(Conventional Forces in Europe) Treaty adaptation, the correlation
of armed forces and armaments in Europe would shift into NATO's
favor."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said that the "buffer zone" between NATO and
Russia, which at present decreased the risk of arms conflict
between NATO and Russia, would disappear.
</P>
<P>
The third reason given by the Russian minister was that NATO's
infrastructure in Eastern Europe would be adapted and enlarged for
NATO armed forces, which consequently would allow tactical nuclear
weapons to be placed in these countries. "The list can be much
longer," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Rodionov, the measures Russia was considering to
take if NATO went ahead with enlargement would involve political
and economic relations between Russia and NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
"We can't rule out that enlargement would stall implementation
of certain existing treaties and make it much more difficult to
ratify new agreements and treaties," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov stressed that the "real partnership" between Russia
and NATO should be based on "realistic and practical"
understanding of each other's interests. He listed a number of
"directions" for its partnership with NATO, which includes
harmonization of the two side's strategic doctrines, development
of pan-European security for all Europeans and, upon this concept,
provision for specific purpose-built programs such as crisis and
conflict prevention, disarmament and arms control.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister reaffirmed Moscow's idea of making the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) the
"key player" in building the security architecture in Europe,
which was underscored by Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin at the OSCE Lisbon summit more than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
However, NATO Secretary General described their meeting today
as "very constructive," saying it helped construct trust and
confidence between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
He told the press that NATO was prepared to begin consultations
with Russia and eventually to finalize an agreement or charter
governing all aspects of NATO-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO wished to have this agreement ready by the time of
the NATO summit in July next year, when invitations to Central and
Eastern European states to join the NATO alliance would be issued.
</P>
<P>
The NATO secretary general again confirmed the decision made by
NATO foreign ministers at their meeting last week that NATO had no
intention to base nuclear weapons on the soil of new members.
</P>
<P>
After the press conference, a NATO official commented that the
tough stand expressed by Rodionov was "disappointing to many
people," which contrasted the rather mild tune of Russia Foreign
Minister Yevgnev Primakov when he met his NATO counterparts here
last week.
</P>
<P>
"We don't underestimate the role of the Russian Defense
Ministry, but it is the (Russia) foreign minister who takes charge
of these matters and to negotiate (for a NATO-Russia charter) with
NATO," he said.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Stresses Arab's Adherence to Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Arab
League (AL) Esmat Abdul-Meguid stressed here today adherence of
the Arabs to the accords signed with Israel, and accused the
Jewish state of impeding the peace process.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
the Arab League chief attributed the current crisis in the Middle
East peace process to the "Israeli intransigence and
provocations."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on a prospect in the region, the
secretary general said, "It is undoubted that we are upholding
the accords signed between the Arabs and Israel, and are
determined on that."
</P>
<P>
He expressed a desire of the Arabs to expose the Israeli
attempt of obstructing the peace process, and underlined that any
Israeli attempt outside the framework of the 1991 Madrid peace
conference is to be refused by the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
"We are persisting in the decisions and principles of the
Madrid conference, the most important principle is that of
exchanging land for peace, and any Israeli attempt outside this
framework is refused by us," Abdul-Meguid told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On the Arab League's action in advancing the peace process,
the secretary general said, "We act in the framework of the
resolution taken by the Arab summit conference in Cairo last
June, and this summit was a major turning point for the Arab
position."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the next stage is one of challenges (in
which) we are upholding our rights, we must be conscious that we
are the owners of truth and we will obtain our rights by all the
means," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid arrived in Beirut Tuesday afternoon to attend a
Euro-Arab arbitration conference, which opened here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit to Lebanon, the Arab League's
secretary general is also expected to hold meetings with House
Speaker Nabih Berri and other senior Lebanese officials.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Overseas
Development Agency (ODA) of Britain today promised to assist the
Tanzania Harbors Authority (THA) in commercialization of Tanga
Port.
</P>
<P>
The commercialization process, which includes training, is
scheduled to start early next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Daily News, ODA Permanent Secretary John
Vereka made the promise today when the phase one project of the
Tanga Port container terminal was officially commissioned.
</P>
<P>
Vereka said that in the commercialization preparations which
will start next year, the ODA will also offer skills to the THA
at Tanga Port.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary said his agency also intends next year
to make a thorough study on the East Africa region transportation
system with the aim of making the region more competitive in the
commercialization era.
</P>
<P>
Earlier,the Tanzanian Deputy Minister for Communications and
Transport, Maua Daftari, said the THA plans to commercialize the
Tanga port in a move to increase efficiency, profitability and
quality services to its customers.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the ODA provided to the Tanzanian government 4.695
million Sterling Pounds to support the Tanga port in a period of
three years for its rehabilitation and institutional capacity
building.

<P>
BRUSSELS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today expressed its deep shock over the recent assassination of
six Red Cross staff members by unidentified gunmen in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The six aid workers of the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC), five women and one man, were two Norwegians, one
Dutch, one Canadian, one Spaniard and one New Zealander.
</P>
<P>
The EC strongly condemned the assassination as a "flagrant
violation" of the most basic principles of international
humanitarian law and of human decency.
</P>
<P>
Emma Bonino, EC commissioner in charge of humanitarian affairs,
and Hans van den Broek, commissioner in charge of relations with
the Russian Federation, have made an appeal to the authorities
concerned to find the murderers as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that this "unprecedented" event in the history of
the ICRC cannot put into jeopardy the search for a peaceful
settlement of the conflict in Chechnya, notably through the
implementation of the peace accord recently signed between the
warring parties.
</P>
<P>
The attack on the ICRC, a neutral humanitarian institution that
provides protection and assistance to the victims of armed
conflict around the world, with the aid workers deliberately
targeted, marked a turning point in the history of humanitarian
operations in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Not To Accept Britain's Proposal on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish official said here
today that Turkey cannot accept a renegotiation of its guarantor
rights as British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind has proposed
for the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli told reporters that
Turkey welcomed Rifkind's meetings with the leaders of the two
communities of Cyprus during his visit to the Mediterranean
island on December 15-16.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said: "Cyprus's unique international identity, the
definition of political equality, border arrangements and these
kinds of factors should be discussed by both sides on the island
at comprehensive negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He added that Rifkind was well aware of the Turkish
determination to maintain its guarantor rights and that Turkey
would not accept any initiatives which were aimed at changing
them.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind has proposed an international guarantee of the rights
of the two sides to the dispute, saying that the border
demarcation should also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
He said that if a political settlement could be reached in
1997, the negotiations for the accession of Cyprus to the
European Union would start.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Greek government said that the 10-point
proposal put forward by Rifkind for a Cyprus solution contained
"positive elements" which corresponded to positions of Cyprus
and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since 1974 when
Turkish troops landed on the island and took control of its
northern third following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Parliament Accepts Motion To Cut Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish parliament today
accepted a motion, put forward by the deputies of the ruling
Welfare Party (RP), to cut around 500 million U.S. dollars in
the Defense Ministry budget for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The motion said the funds cut from the Defense Ministry budget
would be added to the Prime Ministry's budget for defense
research and development purposes.
</P>
<P>
The RP deputies made the move to express their dissatisfaction
with the recent Supreme Military Council decision to sack 69
officers, Turkish sources said.
</P>
<P>
The RP deputies pointed out that these military servicemen
were removed from the armed forces only because of their
personal religious belief.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Military Council, however, stated that these
officers were expelled due to their involvement in Islamic
fundamentalist activities or improper behavior.

<HEADLINE> Former Sudanese PM to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Former Sudanese Prime Minister
Sadeq al-Mahdi has announced his plan to visit Egypt and Saudi
Arabia, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Arabic Weekly Al Mussawar,
Mahdi revealed that following his escape from Sudan to Eritrea, he
received a telephone call from Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali, who inviting him to visit
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi, a towering figure in Sudanese politics as head of the
largest Umma party and spiritual leader of the Mahdist movement,
slipped out of Sudan's capital Khartoum to the Eritrean capital of
Asmara last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi accused the Sudanese government of inciting sedition
between Moslems and Christians as well as Arabs and
Africans. Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir overthrew the
then president and Mahdi in a bloodless coup in 1989.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt can play an important role in finding a solution to the
crisis in Sudan without bloodshed and in maintaining stability in
the countries of east Africa," he said in statements to be
published by an Egyptian magazine Friday.
</P>
<P>
Slamming the Sudanese government as practicing "a military
dictatorship," he warned that troubles in the Nile Valley will
have a negative effect on stability in the area.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has accused Sudan of having orchestrated the 1994 failed
attempt on the life of the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Addis Ababa and granting asylum to Egyptian extremists. Tensions
between the two countries escalated as Sudan's demand to have
larger Nile water quota sparked an outcry from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi stressed that the present dangers required an
understanding of the problems and then making a move which
would lead to a positive solution to the problem with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Umma leader said he would consult the U.S. about the
dangerous situation in the area. Washington has welcomed "this
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he was against foreign interference in Sudan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Al Mussawar gave detailed information about Mahdi's escape from Sudan.
It said that Mahdi's son, Abdel Rahman, arranged and supervised the
escape after studying border roads with Egypt, Libya and Eritrea.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Turkey Sign Accord in Fighting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and his visiting Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller signed
here today a memorandum of cooperation in fighting terrorism,
according to television reports here.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers signed the document after their talks
focusing on bilateral political and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Primakov and Ciller agreed, in principle, to
open consulates general in Izmir, Turkey, and Novorossiisk,
Russia, and to continue talks on visa-free trips for diplomats and
business people and on the elimination of restrictions on the
number of personnel in embassies and consulates.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers said they were pleased with the fact that
their countries are the second largest trade partners for each
other.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic relations between Russia and Turkey are
developing dynamically and their bilateral trade turnover is
expected to reach four billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still some imbalance in the field of
construction. The contracts signed by Turkish companies with
Russia are estimated at seven billion dollars, while the value of
Russian companies' contracts in Turkey has reached only 70 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moscow hopes to close the gap by increasing the participation
of Russian builders in the construction of Turkish facilities to
operate on Russian gas.
</P>
<P>
Ankara calls for expanding cooperation, primarily in industry
and power engineering. Ciller told reporters after his talks with
Primakov that working groups on energy will meet on Thursday to
discuss Russian oil and gas supplies from the Caspian Sea area to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, who arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for an official visit,
also discussed political relations between the two countries with
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters, Primakov said his talks with Ciller "were
not only productive and useful, but also pleasant."

tourism rose by 30.9 percent to more than 3 billion U.S. dollars
compared with last year's figure of 2.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest increase realized by any source of
national income, said the annual report of the Central Bank of
Egypt for fiscal 1995/1996.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Among such crises, the ministers named the situation in
Chechnya and Nagorno-Karabakh as well as the Kurd issue in Turkey

<HEADLINE> Crisis Hits Nigerian Liquified Natural Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- A serious crisis has hit
Nigeria's 3.6 billion U. S. Dollars Liquified Natural Gas (LNG)
project, as one of the biggest buyers has unilaterally pulled out
of the project, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted a statement issued by the Nigeria Liquified
Natural Gas Limited (NLNG) as saying on Tuesday that it has been
recently informed by the ENEL of Italy that ENEL does not intend
to build the LNG receiving terminal at Montalto Castro and that
ENEL does not intend to receive the LNG under the supply contract
it entered into with NLNG in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the Italian receiving terminal has
been opposed by domestic environment protection activists.
</P>
<P>
The contract in 1992 says that ENEL will buy 3.5 billion cubic
meters of LNG annually from the NLNG, or 50 percent of the NLNG's
total production.
</P>
<P>
The NLNG statement said ENEL's commitment has been a crucial
consideration in the decision to launch the NLNG project, the
construction of which has begun on the Bonny Island of Rivers
State in southern Nigeria and is expected to be completed by
1999.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that ENEL's out will not affect the
construction of the project, nor the contracts with other buyers.
</P>
<P>
The NLNG Limited is jointly owned by the Nigeria National
Petroleum Corporation, Shell, Elf, Agip and other shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Lagosians Shocked by Two Bomb Blasts in Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Lagosians, who are yet to
recover from the shock caused by a bomb blast last Monday, were
woken up this morning by an explosion which injured 12 people.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, believed to be planted in a roadside rubbish heap
just opposite the Lagos Fire Service Complex and 100 meters off
the secretariat of the state government, exploded at 8:00 local
time this morning when a bus carrying soldiers of the Lagos State
Environmental Sanitation Task Force to work passed by. Twelve
passengers were injured.
</P>
<P>
It was the second bomb blast in three days. A time-bomb
exploded at around 7:50 monday morning near the location of the
Lagos state government, and destroyed a car in the convoy of
state Administrator Muhammed Marwa, leaving three persons
seriously injured. The administrator escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
The two bomb blasts have brought into public focus the growing
insecurity of life and property in the city when cases of
robberies have just been reduced.
</P>
<P>
Though police investigations are going on, there is strong
indication that the bomb explosions might be meant for the
administrator.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the blasts, security has been tightened at the
secretariat and all roads leading to the adminitrator's office
closed to traffic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police have intensified investigations for an early
discovery of what is behind the bomb explosions.

<HEADLINE> New Secretary General on UN's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The newly elected
Secretary-General Koffi Annan said during his first press
conference here today that the strength of the United Nations rely
on the belief of the member states in the organization.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the United Nations needs to get new strength,
the most important thing is the reaffirmation by the member states
in the belief of the organization.
</P>
<P>
He said "We need to encourage them to develop the sustained
will to support the organization." He also said that the U.N.
should get closer to the general public and win support of the
people as it moves to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Annan, 58, will take office on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
As for the role of the Secretary-General of the U.N., he said
some people referred to the position as an administrator and
manager. That is the essential part of his work. The
Secretary-General also has political and diplomatic role, he
added. Annan again said that his predecessor Boutros-Ghali has
made a major contribution to the organization. "I think history
will judge him much more kindly and much more realistically."
</P>
<P>
He said his first job is to set up an effective team to manage
the organization with him. He would work with the member states,
large or small, in a harmonious manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the contribution the U.S. owed to the U.N., Annan said he
expected to work with the Clinton administration "and through them
the Congress" to get the money, adding: "It is not really in the
interest of the United States not to pay its contribution to the
United Nations. It offends friends and foes alike.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. needs the U.N. and the U.N. needs the U.S.," he said,
adding that the international organization cannot operate
effectively and efficiently without a sound financial basis.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. side, he added, it also has to push forward the
on-going reforms. He said he had not set an objective for lay-out
of staffs. But if it is in the need of reforms and restructuring,
some departures and separations are necessary, he said, adding
that such kind of reforms should be carried out through dialogues.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the 15-seat Security Council, he said its
composition reflected the political and economic realities of 1945
and had to "be brought in line" with current situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decision for which countries could enter the
Council was not up to him but to U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N.'s peace-keeping role, he turned down the saying
that the peace-keeping efforts have decreased. The reality is that
peace-keeping has increased, he said. It has become diversified in
different regions. He pointed out that NATO and CIS (The
Commonwealth of Independent States) currently involved in
peace-keeping operations in Europe cannot, in principle, operate
outside their region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, if there is any crisis the international
community decides to get involved in, the only organization it
has is the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Annan also answered questions on the crisis of the Great Lake
region and in Liberia and the situation in Sudan and on-going
conflict in Angola, as well as the globalization of world economy.
"If we could not put an end to the conflicts (there),
economically, not much could be done," he said. He reaffirmed the
importance of political dialogues in solving regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. will have to channel the resources it has within the
U.N. system effectively to those governments that need
assistance most, he said. African states also have their parts
to play, he added.

<P>
PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The 29th Congress of the French
Communist Party (PCF) opened today in Paris to discuss the new
role of the PCF when facing an evolving domestic and international
situation.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, PCF National Secretary Robert Hue said
that the PCF must play an important role in the French social and
political life and in solving the social problems of France.
</P>
<P>
He called on the 300,000 members of the PCF to renew their role
to build the PCF into a "mordern, open and democratic party of a
new type."
</P>
<P>
On the perspective of joining the 1998 legislative elections by
the PCF, Hue said that the party has "the vocation for
participating the government of France."
</P>
<P>
He said that the PCF will "spare no efforts to put into place,
from now to the time of the next general elections, a basis of
common engagements for the citizens."
</P>
<P>
Hue said that differences persist between the PCF and the
Socialist Party over the role of money in the French society and
the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the possibility of drafting a common leftist
platform with the Socialist Party in near future.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 delegates of PCF from across the country are
attending the four-day congress, held in the modern financial
district of la Defense west of Paris.

<P>
CAIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Egypt will boost
their agricultural cooperation under a protocol signed here today
by the ministries of agriculture of Egypt and Israel within the
context of the joint committee meetings, which opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The protocol provides for cooperation in agricultural
projects, including farming in arid and semi-arid areas,
architectural engineering in desert and developing fish farming
in the Bardaweel Lake in Sinai.
</P>
<P>
The joint agricultural committee meetings will wrap up work
Thursday. The meetings are held twice a year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Egyptian Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali
denied any link between Israel and the deterioration in some
grades of Egyptian cotton.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian cotton seeds are produced locally and are not
exported or imported except by a republican decree, Wali told the
local agricultural experts attending a seminar in Ein Shams
University.
</P>
<P>
"It is not in Israel's interest to carry disease to crops in
Egypt because Israel is a neighboring country and any disease can
easily return to its crops," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wali, who is also deputy prime minister, said there is
Egyptian-Israeli cooperation in some vegetable and fruit crops
only.
</P>
<P>
Planting bananas of the Israeli "silliams" brand has been
successful in Egypt. It is now available in abundance on the
market and leads to reduction in banana imports, Wali said.
</P>
<P>
He also denied Israeli connection with projects to reduce
Egypt's quota of Nile waters.

<HEADLINE> British PM Optimistic about N. Ireland Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said today that he is optimistic about the future of
Northern Ireland peace talks, but warned he will not bow to
pressure from Dublin or Washington, according to BBC Television.
</P>
<P>
Major, on his traditional Christmas visit to troops and
community leaders in Northern Ireland, said there was a pause in
the move forward, but he did not think it would last for ever.
</P>
<P>
"It may be slow, it may be painful but progress I am confident
there will be," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said he was totally committed to the three-year drive to end
a decades-old conflict which has claimed more than 3,200 lives.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister insisted that Britain would not be
swayed by bombs into allowing Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), to join in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"If the IRA continues with violence for the next 50 years then
Britain would not change its policy in the face of that violence
for the next 50 years," Major said.
</P>
<P>
The IRA shows no sign of restoring a cease-fire it abandoned
last February and multi-party talks that have limped along since
June were adjourned today for Christmas until January 13.
</P>
<P>
Britain insists the IRA must declare a truce before Sinn Fein
is allowed into the talks, while Sinn Fein wants talks without
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Joint chairmen of the multi-party talks from the United States,
Canada and Finland regretted more headway had not been made.
</P>
<P>
But Major said he would not be pressured over the multi-party
talks, and adding that Sinn Fein could only join if he thought
there was a genuine IRA truce.

KAMPALA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Charcoal industry has become
an important sector in Uganda's economy.
</P>
<P>
Charcoal industry here includes charcoal and firewood
production, transportation, distribution and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has a growing stock of around 900 million tons of both
trees and bush. Its total yield of woody biomass is around 70
million tons. Fortyeight million tons are available in practice
yearly.
</P>
<P>
The country today consumes around 13 million tons of air-dry
firewood per year. Of these, about 3-4 million tons are used to
produce 400,000 tons and 450,000 tons of charcoal. Charcoal
industry is a very important part of the forestry sector which
contributes nearly six percent of Uganda's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
Though most charcoal in Uganda is a by-product of clearing
land for agriculture, environmentalists here accuse the employees
in the industry of destroying the environment and the urban elite
call charcoal and firewood a backword source of energy. Because
of charcoal burning and firewood production, the country's forEst
cover has dwindled from 14 percent of its total land area in 1967
to four percent at present.
</P>
<P>
However, the production of charcoal and commercial firewood
accounts for tens of thousands of jobs and millions of US Dollars
in income for both rural and urban residents in the country
today. Charcoal and firewood themselves are still very important
rural cash commodities at present in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
According to ''study of woody biomass derived energy supplies
in Uganda'' published recently, more than 20,000 people work full
time with charcoal production and an equal number on part-time
basis. Furthermore, a large number of people are employed in
transporting, distributing and marketing charcoal. Production and
distribution of firewood provides thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the value of charcoal output in 1995
was close to 47.4 million US Dollars in Uganda. The annual growth
rate, which depends on both urbanisation and economic growth, is
currently estimated to be 6-8 percent. Around one third of the
value of charcoal output ends up in rural areas in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The potential revenue from charcoal production fees, licenses
and other taxes is estimated to be between 3.8 and 7.8 millioin
dollars per year, or 8-16 percent of the total charcoal value,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
The study also indicates that firewood, charcoal and other
biomass materials like crop residues deliver far more neat energy
than electricity and petroleum combined, not only to households
but also to indstry and manufacturing. Some 92 percent of energy
consumption in Uganda is woodfuel, 7 percent petroleum and one
percent electricity.
</P>
<P>
Woodfuel is dominant in the key industrial processing
industries such as tea, tobacco, sugar, fish-smoking. The
fish-smoking industry, for instance, consumes an estimated
130,000 tons of firewood yearly.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry, which has grown at over seven
percent since 1990, consumed 230,000 tons of firewood in 1994
through brick and file production, which have doubled in the past
six years. Lime production guzzled over 650,000 tons of firewood
in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the bread making industry, hotels and restaurants
consumed thousands of tons of firewood every year.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan energy experts say woodfuel will continue to be the
primary source of energy in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Facing this reality, experts here hold that steps should be
taken to ensure that more trees are planted to make up for those
cut, so that woodfuel and charcoal can be the country's most
important renewable energy source in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
They also advise that the national tree planting campaign
launched in 1992 should no longer degenerate into an annual
ritual with little or no impact on the ground. enditem

<P>
PARIS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The opening of the 29th Congress of the French Communist
Party on Wednesday was marked by the resignation of Louis Viannet,
secretary general of the Confederation Generale du Travail, and
Philippe Herzog, a member of the European Parliament, from the
party's leading national bureau.
</P>
<P>
-- The Revolutionary Movement of Tupac Amaru, a Peruvian
extreme leftist guerrilla group which has been dormant since the
arrest of their leader four years ago, staged Wednesday the most
spectacular hostage-taking operation in history by seizing 500
hostages at the Japanese embassy in Lima.
</P>
<P>
-- The International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) was shaken
to its root after six of its representatives in Chechnya -- five
women and one man -- were assassinated Monday night in a hospital
south of Grozny. The attack is not only the most serious attack on
expatriates in the history of the ICRC, but also has broken the
taboo of targeting the most essential symbol of humanitarian
action.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While inquiry into the bombing of the Paris underground
train early this month remained at a standstill, the discovery
last Saturday of a bag containing a gas bottle and nails in a
shopping center of Paris has led to intensified questioning of
suspects by police over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
-- An aggressive type of flu virus has arrived in Paris for
three weeks and touched more than one million people in the
region. The Parisian hospitals are overcrowded with patients
suffering from the epidemic, a phenomenon unseen for 15
years. Doctors said it is too late to launch a vaccination
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Navy to Assist in Law Enforcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Malaysian Navy
(RMN) will play a greater role in assisting the relevant agencies
with law enforcement in the country's territorial waters, Deputy
Defense Minister Abdullah Fadzil Che Wan said today.
</P>
<P>
The RMN will establish closer cooperation and coordination with
agencies and departments such as the Marine Police and the
Immigration, Fisheries and Environment Departments to deal with
piracy, sea pollution and entry of illegal immigrants, he was
quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the four-day Maritime Malaysia
Conference '96 organized by the RMN in Malacca, some 150
kilometers southeast of here, that the RMN is capable of playing a
greater role as it has better equipment and a larger number of
personnel than other enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
It would be the RMN's secondary role in this time of peace, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of Navy Ahmad Ramli Mohamed Nor said on the
occasion that close cooperation and coordination between various
agencies and departments is important for carrying out certain
tasks, according to Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The navy chief said the cooperation forged should be further
extended to other projects such as infrastructure development and
the promotion of the maritime industry.

<HEADLINE> Indian President Urges Agro-scientists to Work Harder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Dr. S.D.
Sharma today urged agricultural scientists to work harder and help
enhance production in agro-related areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The continuing challenges faced in our agricultural sector
call for a corresponding effort by our agricultural community to
intensify their research and understanding of the diverse factors
which impinge on agricultural development," the president said
while opening the golden jubilee celebration of the Indian Society
of Agricultural Statistics here.
</P>
<P>
The president in his speech emphasized the importance of
expanding the spatial spread of high yielding crops and devising
more efficient cropping patterns in the country. He also asked the
agricultural scientists to make full use of biotechnology and
tissue culture.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid growth of our population has eroded some fruits of
the green revolution and even today there is widespread
malnutrition and under-nourishment in our population," he said.
</P>
<P>
India has made good progress in agricultural production since
independence in 1947, especially since the launch of green
revolution in the late 60s. It has changed its position from a net
importer of agricultural products into an exporter.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Eliminate Protectionism in Law Enforcement (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee of Political Sciences and Law
requires Party committees and governments at all levels to
"completely realize the seriousness of the problem of local and
departmental protectionism, and earnestly solve it with a high
sense of political responsibility," Ren said.
</P>
<P>
"Rigorous law enforcement against local and departmental
protectionism must be an article of the political disciplines for
our whole party, and not be challenged by anyone," Ren stressed.
</P>
<P>
The cleaning-up drive should start now, from within the
judicial bodies, he added.
</P>
<P>
A responsibility system for case handling as well as other
systems such as the systems for investigating and affixing
responsibilities on those making wrong judgments, and
reinvestigating cases, must be developed and improved, according
to the top judge.
</P>
<P>
Tight rules must be made to govern all the steps of case
registration, trial, mediation, making judgements and enforcement,
with supervisory mechanisms strengthened, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local and departmental regulations and administrative decrees
containing contents intending to protect self-interests must be
re-assessed and abolished, according to Ren.
</P>
<P>
To counter the widespread refusal to execute judgements and
taking hostages as means of demanding payment of debts, Ren said,
those law-offenders must be given a heavier punishment according
to law.
</P>
<P>
He warned the financial, industrial and commercial, taxation,
custom agencies to offer true facts and figures when they are
demanded by judicial bodies; otherwise, they will be responsible
for the legal consequences.
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed at the meeting that a targeted campaign
against local and department protectionism will be launched in the
first half of 1997 to ensure that the measures and other moves
will be earnestly implemented.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Eliminate Protectionism in Law Enforcement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China is set to take a series
of measures to eliminate widespread local and department
protectionism in law enforcement, a senior party official pledged
today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"This problem has become so grave that it has already reached
the time when we have to make up our minds to overcome it
resolutely," said Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and head
of the Central Political Sciences and Law Committee of the CPC, at
a national conference.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against local and department protectionism will be
under the leadership of party committees and governments at all
levels, and be carried out with planning, and step by step," he
said at the ongoing conference on law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
He claimed "some leading bodies of the party and government and
their officials have ordered, supported and connived their
subordinating departments or working staff to protect their local
and departmental interests by unethical or even illegal means."
</P>
<P>
"Some law enforcement bodies and personnel have taken advantage
of legal loopholes, intentionally misinterpreted the law,
distorted evidence, and broke the law they enforced by brazenly
ignoring the law and facts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some law enforcement personnel from elsewhere may even come
under attack from local law enforcement workers, or be beaten,
arrested, cruelly injured or killed. Abuses of compulsory measures
and taking of hostages have also emerged. Contradictions even
between judiciaries of different places have taken place," said
Ren, who is also president of China's Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Such local and departmental protectionist practices "brought
severe damage to the authority of the central leadership, weakened
macro-level unified leadership of the party and the central
government; affected the high esteem of the law, violated the
unity of the country's legal system, and badly tarred the image of
judicial bodies," Ren warned.

<HEADLINE> China Regrets Jordan's Reception of Taiwan's John Chang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed its deep
regret and strong indignation against Jordan and certain other
countries for their reception of Taiwan "foreign minister" John
Chang.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that Chang paid a secret visit to Jordan
after a one-day stay in the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the affair at a routine press
conference in Beijing today, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen
Guofang said that Taiwan authorities, disregarding the national
interests, have intensified the so-called "elastic pragmatic
diplomacy", actively engaging in splitting activities aimed at
creating "Two Chinas" or "One China, One Taiwan", in a vain
attempt to undermine the friendly relations between the relevant
countries and China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government resolutely opposes any countries which
have diplomatic relations with China from conducting official ties
or contact with Taiwan, the spokesman reiterated.
</P>
<P>
"We feel deep regret and a strong indignation about Jordan and
certain other countries over their reception of Chang," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the sincere hope that countries concerned would
strictly observe their commitment to the one China position, guard
against the political conspiracy of the Taiwan authorities, and
prevent the occurrence of such actions that are harmful to the
bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Spend 2 Billion Dollars in Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will spend one
billion Cyprus pounds (about 2 billion U.S. dollars) in its new
five-year defense plan to purchase weapons and upgrade the
National Guards' military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides at a
meeting of the National Defense Council Wednesday, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The president said the new budget, which includes provisions
for the purchase of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, has
been sent to the House of Representatives for approval.
</P>
<P>
"There are not going to be any further changes," Clerides
said, adding that "it has gone to the House and if any changes
are made they will be made there."
</P>
<P>
The announcement that the defense plan is to go ahead follows
the government's rejection of a call by British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind for both sides on the island to scale
down the current military build-up.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the island Monday at the end of a two-day
visit, Rifkind said the amount of weapons on the island was
already excessive, adding that any further build-up would be
destabilizing and unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has rejected Rifkind's call, saying
that as long as Turkey maintains troops on the island, the
government has a legitimate right to strengthen its defense as
a purely deterrent action against a likely further Turkish
advance.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has purchased armored personnel carriers and tanks
from Russia and is now negotiating a deal on purchase of S-300
anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, one of guarantors of Cyprus' independence under the
1960 Treaty, has still maintained about 35,000 troops in the
northern part of this eastern Mediterranean island.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Condemns Israeli Policies Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti has condemned Israel's current policy against the
Palestinians and its disregard of the agreements it has signed
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti accused Israel of starving the Palestinians by its
continued blockade of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing a joint press conference
Wednesday with his Tunisian counterpart Hamed Karouti after the
conclusion of a two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said that Israel's failure to implement agreements
must be condemned because it could "lead to bloody confrontations
and a human tragedy" involving not only the Palestinian people but
also the whole region.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan would pass such a message to Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy during his planned visit here in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Levy's visit, the schedule of which has not been announced yet,
is his first trip to Jordan since the formation of the hardline
government last June.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's pledge of commitment to the agreements signed with
the Palestinians, Kabariti said "We make our judgement not on the
basis of words and statements but practices and facts on the
ground."
</P>
<P>
Jordan would be the first country to suffer from a further
deterioration and an explosion of the situation, Kabariti stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, he added, remained fully committed to the Middle East
peace process and the principle of land-for-peace launched at the
Madrid conference in 1991.

Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation of China.
</P>
<P>
He told the Chinese official that Kenya would "make sure the
friendship and cooperation between the two countries on the
course".
</P>
<P>
In the past, Kenya and China have signed many cooperative
agreements in political, cultural and social fields and now the
cooperation is moving to the economic area, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin
Mkapa on Wednesday directed the police force to play its role in
fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told commanders of the police force at a meeting in Dar es
Salaam that the operaion should start with cleansing their ranks of
corrupt elements, according to a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
He explained that strict application of the police general orders
and the police force service regulations could adequuately flush out
dishonest law enforcers.
</P>
<P>
The president lamented that the number of corruption cases
prosecuted by the police declined from 491 to 31 and the number of
suspects dropped from 538 to 47 during the 1991-95 period.
</P>
<P>
He said the statistics showed that the law enforcement organs had
been neutralised by corruption.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the police must renew a good working relationaship with
members of the public in fighting corruption and drug trafficking and
use, which he said were on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The police force should act swiftly and honestly to tips on
suspects to restore public confidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president directed the police to extend country-wide the crime
stoppers scheme introduced in Dar es Salaam under which people phone in
information on crime to the police anonymously.
</P>
<P>
He said in fighting the drug trade, attention should focus on the
barons and not petty street peddlers.
</P>
<P>
The police should also throw its full weight behind government
efforts to maximize revenue collection and curb smuggling, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said measures would be taken to
improve equipment used by the force and generally provide better
working conditions. enditem

<HEADLINE> Russia's 'Father of Nuclear' Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Yuly Khariton, father of
Russia's nuclear weapons, died today at the age of 92 in
Arzamas-16, Nizhny Novgorod, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khariton founded the nuclear research center in Arzamas-16, one
of the Russian "closed" cities until recently, and had been its
head for more than 45 years. The center is now known as the
national research center of experimental physics.
</P>
<P>
He was known to the world as a major scientist in the field of
experimental and theoretical physics, the author of a number of
ground-laying works in the field of atomic energy and nuclear
equipment, and the founder and leader of a new school majoring in
the theory of explosives, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Khariton was twice awarded the highest Soviet award of Hero of
Socialist Labor, and won one Lenin and three State prizes of the
former Soviet Union. The Soviet Academy of Sciences also rewarded
his work with a Lomonosov Gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Born in St. Petersburg, Khariton graduated from the Leningrad
Polytechnical Institute in 1925 and was elected a corresponding
member of the Soviet Union's Academy of Sciences in 1946. He
became a full member of the academy in 1953, which was renamed the
Russian Academy of Sciences in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Khariton became a research associate of the Leningrad
Physical-Technical Institute in 1921, and was sent to the
Rutherford Cavendish Laboratory, Britain, where he worked during
1926-1928 period.
</P>
<P>
In 1931, Khariton began his work with the Institute of Chemical
Physics of the Soviet Union's Academy of Sciences and other
research centers. In 1939, he calculated the chain reaction of
uranium fission for the first time together with Yakov Zeldovich.
He then devoted himself to the development of nuclear weapons in
Russia.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Visits Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani arrived here this morning for a four-day state
visit to Turkey for promotion of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted it is the first time that Rafsanjani only
visits a single country in his overseas trip, indicating the great
importance he attaches to the Turkey-Iran ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel met with Rafsanjani and
members of his delegation at the Ankara Esenboga Airport. This is
the third official visit to Turkey by the Iranian head of state
since he came to power in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Demirel and Rafsanjani are expected to hold official talks on
the strengthening of the ties, especially in the field of
economic cooperation, between the two neighboring Muslim countries
and exchange views on the regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to sign a number of economic
agreements during Rafsanjani's visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Turkey, the Iranian president will, besides
Ankara, tour the western city of Izmir and Black Sea city of
Trabzon.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, local newspaper Daily News quoted Rafsanjani as
saying that Iran, Turkey, Syria and Iraq should cooperate to
establish tranquility and peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also said that northern Iraq should not be turned into a
hotbed of instability for all these countries.
</P>
<P>
On Iranian-Turkish relations, Rafsanjani said that both Iran
and Turkey are Muslim neighboring states with deeply-rooted ties
in history, which make it possible for Tehran and Ankara to
strengthen their bilateral cooperation in a broader way.

<HEADLINE> China's Tax Agents Urged To Collect Late Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Recent statistics have shown
that Chinese companies owed a total of 35.7 billion yuan (about
4.3 billion US dollars) in industrial and commercial taxes in the
first 11 months of this year, a 72.9 percent increase from the
same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Chinese tax agencies nationwide have been urged to
make a greater effort to collect the late payments, to ensure that
this year's tax goals will be met.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Taxes says that "Although many
measures have been taken to collect delayed taxes, the total
amount is growing at a rapid pace."
</P>
<P>
Poor efficiency and a lack of funds are blamed for the growth
in late payments by companies, the SAT said.
</P>
<P>
"Weak awareness of tax laws, however, is another important
reason," the agency noted, explaining that some enterprises have
tried in every possible way to delay tax payments by setting up a
number of subsidiaries and setting the company responsible for the
late taxes as a dummy company.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, people who have contracted to run a certain
company can change and both the old operator and the new one can
refuse to pay taxes, the SAT also noted. Other companies may start
projects blindly, resulting in stockpiled or leftover goods,
making it difficult for them to pay taxes on unearned income, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises even reach a private agreement saying that no
one will make the first move in paying taxes, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"To solve these problems, we must develop better measures and
improve law enforcement," one SAT official said.
</P>
<P>
All of this lead Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli on Wednesday
to call for tax departments everywhere to do more to collect late
tax payments.
</P>
<P>
"Let's strive to cut the amount of delayed tax payments to 20
percent lower than at the beginning of the year," he told a
national meeting on fiscal matters.
</P>
<P>
China collected 563.9 billion yuan in industrial and commercial
taxes from January to November this year, up 19.5 percent from a
year ago.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Season's Greetings in Philippines, Different </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- With Christmas Day still a week
away, you may be greeted "Merry Christmas" everywhere in the
Philippines. However, the season's greetings, on most occasions,
mean money.
</P>
<P>
When you open your letter box, you may find a "Christmas card"
lying in it -- just a slip of paper with the season's greetings
from several post office employers.
</P>
<P>
When you wait for the greenlight at crossroads, little boys, or
old ladies, may approach you and say "Merry Christmas" to you.
</P>
<P>
When you begin to read your morning papers, a "Christmas Card"
-- usually a small envelope marked with "Merry Christmas"-- from a
delivery boy may drop down from the papers onto you feet.
</P>
<P>
When you receive a real Christmas card from your apartment
management these days, you may not just be greeted with "Merry
Christmas,"...
</P>
<P>
If you are a newcomer to the Philippines, you would be
surprised by such "hospitality" and "Christmas atmosphere." But if
you have been in the country for a year already, you may find the
greetings really "a headache," because all such greetings should
be returned with money.
</P>
<P>
"What shall I do with these greetings?" a foreigner asked his
Filipino driver when he received two "Christmas cards" signed by
16 post office employees a week ago.
</P>
<P>
"You just give 50 pesos as a Christmas gift for each of them,
or your letters could be taken as 'hostages' later," the driver
warned.
</P>
<P>
What the driver said may be not true, but you would worry about
what will happen to you later if you do not pay for these
greetings.
</P>
<P>
But even so, it is unfair to blame all these "money-seekers,"
for the living standards of the ordinary Filipinos are still
relatively lower, though the country has achieved remarkable
economic progress in recent years, and earned the title of "a
newly-born tiger" in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
For most of house maids, newspaper delivery boys, messengers or
even some factory workers, they earn less than 1,200 pesos (about
45 U.S. dollars) a month, and the Christmas season is the best
period of the year for them to ask for financial assistance from
others so straight.
</P>
<P>
Even if these people are given 50 pesos or 100 pesos only by
one person, when they add them together, it could be a decent
amount for them for Christmas celebrations. Perhaps that is why
some people tried one way or another to seek money from others
during the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
For some companies making little profit in the year, they also
have to prepare Christmas parties for their workers. But some of
them have to ask for donations just for a Christmas party, a must
for a company according to the Philippine tradition.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the company management must also pay double
salaries to its workers in December for Christmas, plus some
Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
"We have prepared a T-shirt and a can of biscuit for each of
our 10 workers," said a owner of a bakery in Manila. "though we
can't make a large profit."
</P>
<P>
A Filipino journalist said that she got her bonus at the
beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
"We had a Christmas party last week, our boss gave each of us a
jacket," she said.
</P>
<P>
But an apartment manager, who declined to be named, in Manila,
said he has to seek donations, either cash or gifts, from the
tenants, to prepare a Christmas party for about 40 workers,
because his company is loosing money.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the Christmas celebrations, to some extent,
mean price hikes. While shop-owners in the world are preparing big
sales for Christmas, Filipino consumers are paying much more
during the Christmas season. Prices of vegetables, fruits and
other essential commodities began to go up two weeks ago.
Economists here predicted further price increases for most of
essential commodities next week.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippine capital of Manila, where there are 1.1
million registered motor vehicles, Christmas celebrations also
mean heavier traffic. Since last week, people buying food,
delivering gifts or going to parties have created traffic jams on
major roads of the city.
</P>
<P>
During rush hours, a car could only travel at 20 kilometers per
hour. At some major crossroads, one sometimes has to wait for half
an hour to go through. However, people in the city still enjoy
going out for celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"That is the Philippine-style celebration," explained a
Filipino driver to his host, who arrived in Manila several months
ago and looked puzzled by the Christmas celebrations here.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad left here this afternoon for India to receive the
Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir will pay a three-day official visit to India during
which officials said the issue of India's possible participation
in the Asia-Europe meeting is likely to figure in talks between
Mahathir and Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral, regional and international issues are also expected
to be discussed by the leaders of the two countries, they said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian-Indian relations have been improving since the first
visit of the Malaysian leader to India in December 1993, followed
by a visit here by the then Indian prime minister Narasimha Rao
last year.
</P>
<P>
India has achieved full dialogue partner status in ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) with the help of Malaysia
and looks forward to a closer relationship with the grouping.
</P>
<P>
Now India is Malaysia's largest trading partner in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between the two countries increased from 629
million U.S. dollars in 1993 to 1,385 million dollars in 1995 with
Malaysia having a trade surplus of 282 million dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> More CAD to Enter Clothing Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China's clothing sector is
expected to expand the use of computer-aided design (CAD) and
computer-aided manufacture (CAM) technologies over the next five
years, in a bid to transfer the industry to a technology-intensive
model.
</P>
<P>
Dong Binggen, president of the China Garment Corporation, the
watchdog of China's clothing business, said that CAD and CAM
equipment is used in 70 percent of European and US clothing
factories, and 30 percent of Taiwan's clothing factories.
</P>
<P>
But in China the rate stands at just one percent.
</P>
<P>
Such a low technical benchmark not only hinders the increase of
the added value of Chinese garments, but also cripples the
competitiveness of domestic enterprises in global markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
At early this month, he added, the corporation announced that
the computer-aided design and manufacture popularization rate in
the country's clothing sector will be raised to five percent by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The corporation, which is anxious to revive the declining
status of China's garment products both at home and abroad, said
that the CAD promotion drive will even resort to "administrative
methods" if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The latest official statistics show that a sharp rise has
emerged in China's demand for clothing CAD and CAM systems, with
the annual growth hitting some 40 percent. The whole industry now
has more than 450 CAD systems, compared with the 250 systems in
1994.
</P>
<P>
So far, a score of famous foreign CAD brands have entered the
country, including Lectre of France and Juki of Japan. Local
analysts said the market share of these foreign companies will
further expand, as the market continues to grow and domestic CAD
developers still suffer a capital shortage and low technological
benchmarks.

<P>
NICOSIA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot woman in
south-western town of Paphos is pregnant with an astonishing 11
fetuses after undergoing fertility treatment at a private clinic
here, Cyprus Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Her gynaecologist Andreas Patsalides was quoted as saying
Wednesday that "it is the first time in my career I have seen such
a case, not only in Cyprus but worldwide."
</P>
<P>
Zoe Efsthatiou, 23, and her 27-year-old husband Demetris were
told the news after an ultrascan of her womb at the Makarios
Hospital in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Zoe, whose name means "life," has an ovarian problem and can
hardly conceive a child without medical help, according to the
doctors.
</P>
<P>
The couple already have one child, born in 1994, following
a course of fertility treatment. They decided to undergo the
same treatment again, and she conceived nine weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
At the Makarios Hospital, to the astonishment of doctors,
the scan revealed a total of 11 heartbeats and embryos.
</P>
<P>
"We have to reduce the number of embryos," Patsalides said
after discussions with the family which requested to save four of
the fetuses. The other embryos will be terminated over the next
two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Patsalides said Zoe risks a 15 to 25 percent chance of
miscarrying even after number of embryos is brought down.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda today called for removing poverty in the South Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"We have to strive together towards raising the quality of life
of people in the largest sense not simply in terms of sectorial
advances," he said while opening the 17th meeting of foreign
ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC) here.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC was formed in 1985 embracing Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the seven-member nations of SAARC is to remove the
curse of the poverty and the hardship and distress associated with
it, the Indian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
The seven SAARC countries should join forces and enhance their
collective strength, range and dynamism at a time when they were
deregulating their economies and opening up markets to the world,
he further said.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian region must rise above differences and join
hands in shared progress and it cannot remain immune from this
logic of collective self interest and advancement, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting of the SAARC foreign ministers is expected
to evolve a strategy to intensify economic and trade cooperation
among the member nations.

<HEADLINE> China's New Oil Exploration System Increases Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China has added more than 500
million tons of proven oil reserves this year with the help of a
new exploration and development system, according to a senior
Chinese oil official.
</P>
<P>
According to the new system, the country's onshore and offshore
oil-gas bearing areas are divided into four types of areas for
different explorers and developers.
</P>
<P>
The exploration and development of areas for foreign oil
companies and major Chinese oil firms are carried out through both
international and domestic biddings.
</P>
<P>
The rest two types of areas are up to the China National
Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and local oil companies to explore
and develop.
</P>
<P>
The new method has paid off because it has increased areas for
exploration and development, and a number of idle blocks both
onshore and offshore are being explored.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2.5 million sq km of onshore area have been made
available to foreign companies for exploration, and the CNPC has
signed nearly 40 contracts with overseas oil companies on 150,000
sq km of areas.
</P>
<P>
The China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) has so far signed
a total of 126 oil contracts with 65 foreign oil companies from 18
countries and regions, with nearly 6 billion US dollars in direct
foreign investment. This year alone, CNOOC has signed 17 offshore
oil contracts with foreign oil giants.
</P>
<P>
Chinese oil experts say that the new method has played an
important role in increasing oil output to more than 150 million
tons this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Current Account Deficit Reaches Alarming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the central
bank, acknowledged that Indonesia's current account deficit has
reached an alarming level, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on "Indonesia's economy and business in
1997" here Wednesday, Bank Indonesia Governor Soedradjad
Djiwandono said the government has shown its concern over the
problem, officials at the seminar said today.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary to boost exports and control imports,
while the monetary authorities should influence liquidity in the
community by posing restrictions on credits.
</P>
<P>
Actually, he noted, the government has adopted a prudent fiscal
and monetary policy of earlier payment of high interest rate
foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added, the debts were still needed to cover
the current account deficit, which, according to senior economist
Sumatra Djojohadikusumo, had reached an alarming level.
</P>
<P>
According the official sources, the current account deficit in
the first half of the 1996/97 fiscal year reached 4.5 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance Saleh Afiff once
estimated that the current account deficit for the current fiscal
year would amount to 8.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soedradjad in his paper said the growth of non-oil
imports in 1995 reached 25.6 percent, while non-oil exports grew
only by 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
This development, he said, put increased pressure on the
balance of payments which, in turn, raised the current account
deficit from two percent of the GDP to 3.7 percent in 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Management of Transient Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to tighten
the control over personal profiles of the so-called transient
personnel, whose numbers has kept growing in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Personnel and the Organization Department of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) today
jointly issued a temporal regulation on the management of personal
profiles of transient personnel.
</P>
<P>
According to the 22-article regulation, transient personnel
mainly include resigned, dismissed, or jobless people, students
studying abroad at their own expense, and employees in non-state
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Before these people can find a place in state enterprises or
institutions, their personal profiles have to be kept and managed
by local employment offices for talented personnel.
</P>
<P>
The employment offices must adequately protect their storage of
personal profiles, and can charge reasonably for the service
without seeking profits.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also notes that only those employment offices
which are attached to Party organization departments or government
personnel administration above the county level have the right to
maintain personal profiles.
</P>
<P>
It rules out the possibility for any other units or individuals
to keep someone's personal profile, in order to protect secrecy
and privacy of the profiles, and prevent any counterfeiting,
change, replacement, and destruction of the profiles.
</P>
<P>
In China, personal profiles consist of a person's work
experiences, education, capability assessment, and records of
awards or penalties. It is regarded as a key reference for
employment, and usually kept by the person's work unit.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, more young people have quit their
jobs in government or state-own enterprises and institutions, and
worked for foreign-funded or private units or headed abroad,
causing much trouble for the management of their profiles.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Gunmen Sentenced to Life Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The two Palestinian gunmen
who killed a Jewish woman settler and her son in the
drive-by shooting on the West Bank last week were sentenced
to life imprisonment in the Jericho Palestinian security court
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The killers, identified as Abdel Nasser Qaysi and Ibrahim Kam,
were convicted of "betraying the security of the Palestinian
people." The two men, who are members of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), were arrested by the Palestinian
security forces shortly after the shooting attack last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Hani, a third PFLP member who served as their
driver in the case, was sentenced to 15 years in jail. He
was arrested Wednesday with weapons used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the three-member cell, several PFLP supporters
who helped the killers were also arrested.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Preventive Security chief Col. Jibril Rajoub met
with head of the Israeli army Central Command Maj.-Gen. Uzi
Dayan in Jerusalem Wednesday afternoon to brief him on the
arrests as the trial got under way in Jericho.
</P>
<P>
Rajoub reiterated rejection of Israeli request for extradition
of the killers. That "is a dream and won't happen. You can
forget it," he declared.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Ilan, communication adviser of Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu, said Wednesday night that he hopes the
Palestinian Authority will not set free the three convicted PFLP
terrorists not long after the sentence, according to Israel
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Eeta Tsur, 42, and her 12-year-son were killed last Wednesday
when gunmen opened fire on their car as they drove home to the
Jewish settlement of Beit El. Three other family members were also
wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The PFLP, a Damascus-based radical Palestinian group, claimed
responsibility for the attack and the Palestinian police began
rounding up members of the group shortly afterward.

Specifically, the officer explained, the military diplomacy has
helped further consolidate and strengthen China's relations with
its neighboring countries, enhance the PLA's friendly ties with
the armed forces of the countries in West Asia, Africa and Latin
America, fully resumed China's military ties with European
countries and improved the relations between the PLA and the
U.S. armed forces despite twists and turns.

<HEADLINE> Senior U.S., Chinese Officials Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States and China
have common interests in many major issues and should increase
dialogue and cooperation to make joint efforts to create a
peaceful and prosperous 21st century, a senior U.S. official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Berger, acting National Security Advisor to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, made the remark during talks with Liu
Huaqiu, director of the foreign affairs office of China's State
Council.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-China relations will occupy an important place in
discussions within the Clinton administration over its second-term
foreign policy, Berger told Liu.
</P>
<P>
The future direction of U.S.-China relations has a significant
impact not only on the current international situation, but also
on the direction the world will take in the next century, Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
Berger and Liu exchanged views on Sino-U.S. relations and
international situations of common concern during their talks.
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes to see China getting stronger and hopes
that China will play a larger role in the world, the U.S. official
said. A strong, prosperous and open China conforms to U.S.
interests.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the world experienced profound and complicated
changes after the Cold War ended. In the new international
situation, he said, the two countries still have wide-ranging and
important common interests.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese side believes Sino-U.S. relations should be
handled and promoted by taking into consideration the global
situation and the 21st century, and in accordance with the
principle of "enhancing confidence, reducing trouble, developing
cooperation and avoiding confrontation."
</P>
<P>
As two major influential powers in the world, China and the
United States share important responsibilities for maintaining
global and regional peace and stability, the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
Berger and Liu both believed the two countries should continue
to increase dialogue and consultation in order to maintain and
develop the positive momentum of bilateral relations and strive
for achievements to be made by the exchange of high-level visits.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that the question of Taiwan is the core issue
in Sino-U.S. relations. China hopes that the United States will
take an overall view of bilateral relations, abide by the three
joint communiques, and handle the Taiwan issue cautiously and
properly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that the United States understands the importance
and sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, and will continue to pursue a
"One China" policy, abide by the three joint communiques and
handle the issue carefully.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on further development of bilateral
economic relations and trade and the prevention of proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that their talks were positive and
constructive and beneficial to the deepening of mutual
understanding and the promotion of cooperation. They said
strategic dialogue will continue.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan to Build China's Largest Drug Dependency Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- China has started work on its
largest drug rehabilitation center in a province plagued by
illegally smuggled drugs.
</P>
<P>
Building of the drug dependency prevention and treatment
institute unit is underway in Southwest China's Yunnan Province
on the outskirts of provincial capital of Kunming.
</P>
<P>
The institute will receive its first drug addicts after
first-phase construction is completed in next July, with the whole
project due to be finished in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Drug Dependency Prevention and Treatment Institute
was established in November this year, and has received 2,000 drug
addicts during its four-year preparation period.
</P>
<P>
Ma Kejian, deputy head of the institute, said the institute
will focus on the research of rehabilitation of drug addicts after
they give up drug taking. The unit will also launch widespread
prevention education.
</P>
<P>
Ma said his institute has sent five experts to a drug
rehabilitation organ in the U.S. to study advanced drug
rehabilitation methods, and sent experts to Germany, Thailand,
Singapore and Hong Kong for training and investigation work.
</P>
<P>
The institute has also chosen two universities, one middle
school in Kunming and a rural middle school as bases for drug
prevention education.
</P>
<P>
It is also conducting research on drug rehabilitation in
several communities in Kunming, Chuxiong and Ruili cities in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Ma said his institute will compile a drug taking prevention
textbook for young people after a period of research.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the drug rehabilitation problem will not be
resolved only by medical means. The research will make
achievements after much study of the social aspects of
drugtaking.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Split Looms Large Inside Congress Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Congress party on
Wednesday came on the verge of a new split over the issue of
Congress parliamentary party (CPP) leadership.
</P>
<P>
While the anti-Rao camp in the party pressed hard for P.V.
Narasimha Rao's ouster from the CPP leadership and mobilized the
Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body
of the party, for this purpose, the Rao camp countered the move by
arguing that this "unprecedented" line of action was not
acceptable. The anti-Rao forces consolidated their position by
endorsing the CPP resolution seeking Rao's resignation with the
backing of the CWC, which had authorized Congress President
Sitaram Kesri to talk to Rao on this contentious issue.
</P>
<P>
The war of nerves between Congress president Sitaram Kesri and
CPP leader Rao took a dramatic turn late on Wednesday night when
Kesri asked the latter to step down from the CPP leadership post.
Shortly after the CWC meeting Wednesday night, Kesri in a letter
to Rao asked him to step down. In his letter, Kesri said that the
CWC shared the views of the CPP on the need for him to resign from
the post to re-establish unity and credibility of the party.
</P>
<P>
A Rao confidant, however, said that the CPP leader was not
likely to step down. When asked what would Kesri do in such a
situation, an aide of the party president said he might issue a
notice to Rao for not paying heed to his advice, and then might
resort to the extreme step of expelling him.
</P>
<P>
Senior Congress leader Jagannath Mishra strongly criticized the
CPP resolution adopted early on Wednesday by CPP Executive
Committee members in the meeting, saying that "only the general
body is competent to take up the CPP leadership issue. If this
resolution is accepted by the Congress high command, this will
encourage dissident activities and will have an adverse affect on
the state legislature parties and the state units." He also
pointed out that the CPP resolution did not give any plausible
reason as to how Rao's removal would strengthen and ensure unity
in the party. Another Rao camp follower S.S. Ahluwalia lambasted
the anti-Rao camp for adopting such a resolution in the CPP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Congress chief whips in both the upper and lower
houses of Parliament Pranab Mukherjee and Sontosh Mohan Deb
respectively offered to resign from their posts on Wednesday in
the wake of the CPP executive committee's demand for Rao's
resignation. Both of the whips were appointed by Rao.
</P>
<P>
Rao, who attended the CPP meeting in the Parliament house on
Wednesday morning, skipped the CWC meeting in the evening on
grounds of ill-health and conveyed it through his aide R.K.
Khandekar, who was reportedly roughed up at the All-India Congress
Committee (AICC) headquarters allegedly by anti-Rao congressmen.
Jitendra Prasada, a Rao loyalists, said that there was no
discussion on the Rao issue and no CWC member sought Rao's
resignation from the CPP leadership post at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the CPP executive meeting, 21 members and three
office-bearers, out of a total 28, signed a brief resolution
asking Rao to step down from the CPP leadership post. The
resolution said that in the present political situation, the
strengthening of the Indian national Congress has acquired utmost
political significance in the interest of the people and the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen later on Wednesday, CPP member Dasmunshi
said that they were left with no other alternative but to tell Rao
to go, since he was refusing "to accept all our requests."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Ramain Engaged in Zaire, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs
Minister Stan Mudenge said on Wednesday Zimbabwe will remain engaged
in the affairs of the Great Lakes region until effective solutions
are found.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge told parliament that because Zaire had as its neighbours
three Southern Affaican Development Community (SADC) members -- Angola,
Zambia and Tanzania -- Zimbabwe would not fold hands and sit back.
</P>
<P>
''What happens in that sister republic has consequences for
SADC and Zimbabwe. The genocide of two million people that took
place in Rwanda is not a tragedy for Rwanda alone,'' said
Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question by a member of parliament Allan
Elliot on Zimbabwe's policy regarding the crisis in Burundi, Rwanda
and Zaire, Mudenge said Zimbabwe had always rendered a hand through
the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity and SADC to
contribute towards a peaceful solution to the great lakes crises.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said SADC leaders looked to Zimbabwe as Chairman of the
community's Organ on Politics, Defence and Security to coordinate a
possible SADC response to the Great Lakes crises. enditem

<HEADLINE> India's State High Court Quashes President's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Allahabad High Court in
Uttar Pradesh today quashed the presidential notification imposing
president's rule in the state.
</P>
<P>
The judgment by a three-member bench of justices was unanimous
on the issue, Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
The three-member bench also ruled that the ratification of the
president's rule in the state by Parliament earlier was
"unconstitutional."
</P>
<P>
To avoid constitutional deadlock, the high court order is made
effective from December 26 to enable the government to take
whatever steps it feels necessary, the bench said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October this year, Uttar Pradesh started assembly
elections but not a single party in that state won a clear
majority in the fight. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged
the largest party in the state, but it could not muster enough
support to form a government. The union government, therefore,
re-imposed the president's rule over the state in a bid to avoid
violence and troubles. Before the assembly elections, the state
was under the president's rule.
</P>
<P>
The BJP today demanded the resignation of the United Front
government in the center in the light of the Allahabad High Court
verdict holding the imposition of president's rule in the state
null and void. Raising the issue in the lower house of parliament
soon after it assembled here today, leader of the opposition Atal
Behari Vajpayee said, "we have won in court and we want justice.
we demand the resignation of the United Front government as it has
murdered democracy."

<HEADLINE> Family Farms Part Of The New South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Taitao, a young farmer of
Nankun Township on China's Hainan Island, decided 11 months ago to
become his own boss, and used every means possible to get
800,000-yuan (nearly 100,000 US dollars) in loans to buy two
bulldozers and hire 15 people.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Nanxian Farm was born, and Zhang became one of
Tunchang County's family farm owners.
</P>
<P>
An official with the county's agricultural bureau says that
there are now nearly 10,000 family farms of more than ten hectares
each, thanks to more advanced management techniques, and more
modern technology and marketing strategies. Most have fairly good
financial returns, and some plan to enlarge the business.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has planted 6,000 mango, litchi and banana trees, and
13,000 betel palms on the gentle slopes of his 31 hectares of
former wasteland.
</P>
<P>
He also dug a pond to raise freshwater fish and ducks, to lower
the risks of his cyclical farm business.
</P>
<P>
These kinds of farms now prevail in this South China Sea
island, China's southernmost province.
</P>
<P>
The possibilities of agriculture were also obvious to Li
Zhuang, Li Jin, and Li Bu, three brothers who had worked
elsewhere, but who decided to return to their hometown, pooling
their money and getting more than 100,000 yuan to start a fruit
ranch.
</P>
<P>
They embarked on a three-year plan to reclaim wasteland with
profits from the previous year, and now plan to plant all 100
hectares of wasteland in tropical fruits, to be followed by
promoting tourism in the village.
</P>
<P>
These family farms, a part of the new economy in Hainan, will
increase economies of scale and get farmers to use resources
economically, said Lin Shuwei, the head of Nankun
Township.

HELSINKI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Finish President Martti
Ahtisaari today proposed a three-party summit between the European
Union (EU), the United States and Russia to ensure European
security.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the three parties is becoming more and more
important to European security, the president said in a speech in
the southern city of Keuruu.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari said security in the Baltic Sea area is essential for
his country and stability there will be impossible without
Russia's participation.
</P>
<P>
The United States leads NATO, which is mainly made up of
European countries. Eleven of the 15 member states of the EU are
NATO members.
</P>
<P>
Finland, which is a EU country, but not a NATO member, must
maintain its defense capacity given the volatile elements in the
European security system, Ahtisaari said.
</P>
<P>
But he hinted that his country won't seek amy military
alliance. The present foreign and security policy of Finland,
featuring military non-alignment and independent defense, will
help maintain stability in northern Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on relations with NATO, Ahtisaari said cooperation
between Finland and NATO is aimed at strengthening Finland's
national security and security in Europe as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Senior U.S., Chinese Officials Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States and China
have common interests in many major issues and should increase
dialogue and cooperation to make joint efforts to create a
peaceful and prosperous 21st century, a senior U.S. official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Berger, National Security Advisor-designate to
U.S. President Bill Clinton, made the remark during talks with Liu
Huaqiu, director of the foreign affairs office of China's State
Council.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-China relations will occupy an important place in
discussions within the Clinton administration over its second-term
foreign policy, Berger, currently deputy National Security
Advisor, told Liu.
</P>
<P>
The future direction of U.S.-China relations has a significant
impact not only on the current international situation, but also
on the direction the world will take in the next century, Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
Berger and Liu exchanged views on Sino-U.S. relations and
international situations of common concern during their talks.
</P>
<P>
The United States hopes to see China getting stronger and hopes
that China will play a larger role in the world, the U.S. official
said. A strong, prosperous and open China conforms to U.S.
interests.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the world experienced profound and complicated
changes after the Cold War ended. In the new international
situation, he said, the two countries still have wide-ranging and
important common interests.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese side believes Sino-U.S. relations should be
handled and promoted by taking into consideration the global
situation and the 21st century, and in accordance with the
principle of "enhancing confidence, reducing trouble, developing
cooperation and avoiding confrontation."
</P>
<P>
As two major influential powers in the world, China and the
United States share important responsibilities for maintaining
global and regional peace and stability, the Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
Berger and Liu both believed the two countries should continue
to increase dialogue and consultation in order to maintain and
develop the positive momentum of bilateral relations and strive
for achievements to be made by the exchange of high-level visits.
</P>
<P>
Liu pointed out that the question of Taiwan is the core issue
in Sino-U.S. relations. China hopes that the United States will
take an overall view of bilateral relations, abide by the three
joint communiques, and handle the Taiwan issue cautiously and
properly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that the United States understands the importance
and sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, and will continue to pursue a
"One China" policy, abide by the three joint communiques and
handle the issue carefully.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that their talks were positive and
constructive and beneficial to the deepening of mutual
understanding and the promotion of cooperation. They said
strategic dialogue will continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The second Malaysian
National Conference on Information Technology (IT) -- Infotech
Malaysia '96 -- was opened here today with a theme "Towards A
Knowledge Society - Creating the Environment for Change".
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference sponsored by the National Information
Technology Council, of which Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is
the chairman, is designed to provide a forum for discussing issues
related to the formulation of a National IT Action Plan to realize
goals of Vision 2020 which calls for building Malaysia into a
developed nation and for the creation of a Malaysian
knowledge-based society.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the conference today, Mahathir said that
with the convergence of computing, telecommunications and
broadcasting in the multimedia industry, it is now imperative for
Malaysia to develop its own socio-technical capacity for a
smoother transition into the information age.
</P>
<P>
He said the information age demands that second wave
technologies be transformed into new industrial structures
associated with what are today called "webs".
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the discussions at the conference would form the
basis for formulating an integrated IT agenda for the country,
which he said "must be to nurture a knowledge society premised on
our own history, tradition, culture and development experiences.
</P>
<P>
This knowledge society must also become a civil society and
this should be the ultimate vision of the IT agenda, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
From the national perspective, he said the use and application
of information technology must lead to a better quality of life
for all Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
And from the international perspective, the IT agenda clearly
places Malaysia's aspirations at the center of the global
technology, trade and investment context, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian leader said the IT agenda would have a
three-pronged strategy with a clear mission of building a
knowledge society.
</P>
<P>
The foundational strategy would be that of building and
developing the appropriate physical infrastructure and
infrastructure; the second strategy would be the creation and
development of enrichment systems of IT-based applications that
are demand-driven and the third one will be the human development
effort, he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference will discuss major issues
including the IT agenda: plan for action, local and global
scenarios, multimedia super corridor; the flagship applications,
funding for IT development, caring society, infrastructure
imperatives for IT development and social transformation through
IT.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the conference, Malaysia's premier IT
exhibition -- ITX '96 -- is being held here from today until
December 22.
</P>
<P>
The first Malaysian Infotech conference was held here last
year.

<HEADLINE> Over 4,000 Brazilian Companies Go Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented number
of 4,100 companies have been declared bankrupt during the first 11
months of this year in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
An annual study by the Centralization of Banking Services shows
the number of bankruptcies increased by 71 percent during the 11
months compared with the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the companies declared bankrupt, retailors made up 58.1
percent, industrial companies 26.6 percent, and 14.6 percent
companies in service fields.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the bankruptcies was the high interest
charges by banks which prevented many small and medium-sized
companies getting the credit they needed.
</P>
<P>
At an annual rate of 40 percent, Brazil's interest rate is
among the highest in the world.

<P>
LANZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- In Gansu, an underdeveloped
province in northwest China, a local bank has succeeded in its
efforts to help local firms in handling foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The International Business Department under the Agricultural
Bank's Gansu Provincial Branch, which was set up in 1991 and has
no more than 30 people, has been praised for its efforts and
success.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the department has made hard efforts to
increase its deposits in both Chinese yuan and foreign exchanges
through constant improvement of its management and facilities.
</P>
<P>
To reduce risks, the bank has been careful when lending loans
to its clients and only those with a promising and international
market for their products could get foreign exchange loans from
the bank.
</P>
<P>
Till now, the department has given such loans to over 200 local
enterprises including six firms which have introduced advanced
equipment and technology from abroad. Due to its efficient work,
the department has no bad debts so far.
</P>
<P>
At present, it has a deposit of 277 million yuan in Chinese
currency and 11.48 million US dollars in foreign exchanges. In the
past five years, the young and small bank reaped 29.61 million

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees No Sharp Oil Price Cut Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine business
community is ruling out a sharp drop in crude oil prices next
year, saying the prices will not fall below 20 US dollars a barrel
despite Iraq's re-entry to the world oil market, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Federation of Philippine Industries President Raul Concepcion
was quoted as saying that oil prices would not go down
significantly without new players and infrastructures that could
support the full deregulation of the local oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion added world crude prices would not go lower than 20
to 21 US dollars a barrel despite the lifting of the oil embargo
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said Arab oil companies would not trade between 16 to 17 US
dollars a barrel, as they did last year, because this would mean
considerable losses.
</P>
<P>
Concepcion said the business community would ask Peton Corp.,
the country's largest oil company, to take the lead in setting
competition through lower prices.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Philippine Industries is also urging the
government to settle first the outstanding claims of oil companies
against the Oil Price Stabilization Funds (OPSF) before pushing
through with the full deregulation of the downstream oil industry.

<P>
HEFEI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A kind of ground plastic
sheeting that can decompose has been invented in east China's
Anhui Province, pointing to a way to stopping "white pollution".
</P>
<P>
The sheeting was invented by a research team headed by Sha
Hongfei, a professor of Anhui University.
</P>
<P>
The ground sheeting contained a composite light-sensitive agent
developed by Sha, which functions as both light decomposer and
biological decomposer. The sheeting will disintegrate after a
period of exposure to the light. Starch and weeding capsules are
also added to the sheeting, which can speed up the disintegration
of the sheeting and kill grass.
</P>
<P>
The sheeting is of significance for the protection of the
agricultural biological environment, according to experts.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian guerrillas today
released five of the 490 hostages they are holding in the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima, including four ambassadors, to set
up a "bridge" with the government.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors were from Germany, Canada, Greece and France,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian ambassador, Anthony Vincent, told reporters they
were released to serve as a contact between the terrorists and the
government and said they would try to help settle the crisis
through negotiation without bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The fifth hostage released could not be immediately identified.
</P>
<P>
The remaining hostages, who are on the second and third floors
of the residence, included two Peruvian ministers, ambassadors
from Asia, Europe and the Americas and Peru's anti-terrorist
police chief Maximo Rivera and state security director Guillermo
Bobbio.
</P>
<P>
About 80 women and old people were set free earlier, reportedly
including President Alberto Fujimori's sister and mother.
Fernando Andrade, Mayor of Miraflores (a district in Lima),
managed to escape through a window early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas, have
demanded the release of up to 500 of their jailed comrades,
including their chief Victor Polay currently serving a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
They have threatened to start killing the hostages if their
demands are not met. They have also demanded and the direct
intervention of President Alberto Fujimori in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Governments throughout the world have urged Peru to do
everything in its power to protect the hostages and not use force
to flush out the guerrillas, who made their way into the Japanese
ambassador's residence Tuesday night when diplomats and officials
were attending a reception in honor of Japanese Emperor Akihito's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
President Alberto Fujimori, who has suspended all public
activities has so far made no comments publicly on the attack.
</P>
<P>
But in a conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, he said Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila is
negotiating with the guerrillas for the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The leftist MRTA movement is the smaller of two major guerrilla
groups in the country. The main group is the Shining Path.

<HEADLINE> Public Service Ads Lift Industry Image, Ethics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Awards for this year's three
best public service ads have been announced yesterday, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that they went to campaigns to help children
with their homework, to recruit blood donors and to assist the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
The three winners were Ogilvy and Mather, a Shanghai-based
Sino-US joint venture which devised Heartfelt Wishes, a TV
announcement to lessen the burden of children's homework, the
Shanghai Oriental Radio Station's blood donation campaign and the
Shenzhen Business news.
</P>
<P>
The judges also gave 38 other TV stations, newspapers and
advertising companies government awards for outstanding public
service announcements, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The winning campaigns were chosen from announcements issued
last September, a month designated by the State to help enhance
social progress and the healthy development of the advertising
industry in China, China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16,860 public service announcements were issued in
September. Of these, 4,582 were TV announcements, 2,749 were radio
broadcasts, 4,123 were published in newspapers and magazines and
50,000 were outdoor announcements.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Hui Lusheng, deputy director of the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce (Saic), as saying that
the contest helped create a good public image for the advertising
sector and has improved supervision over it.
</P>
<P>
But experts attending yesterday's ceremony agree that public
service announcements are still at an early stage in China and
need improvement, both in production values, in the number of
issues, in the number of issues covered and in artistic methods.
</P>
<P>
China's advertising sector has enjoyed sustained growth in the
past five years, and last year's turnover hit 27.33 billion yuan,
10 times the 1990 level.
</P>
<P>
The industry has 48,000 companies and media outlets employing
477,000 people nationwide.

VIENNA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat today demanded that Israel comply with the accords it has
signed with the Palestinians and stop setting up new Jewish
settlements on the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The peace process between Palestinians and Israelis was
irreplaceable, Arafat told the press after talks with Austrian
deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Wolfgang Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue the process," said the Palestinian leader,
who was here on a two-day visit.
</P>

The Palestinians were committed to the peace process although
they were facing many difficulties, Arafat said.

<P>
He asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to revoke
his decision to set up more Jewish settlements in occupied
Palestinian territories and to comply with the accords already
signed between them.
</P>
<P>
He said he understood the historically rooted fear of Israelis,
but Palestinians had fears too. Safety must exist for both sides,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for the support of Europe for his people.
Peace was an international need, he said.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel said his country and its European partners are clear
about their commitments to peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the EU summit in Dublin adopted a strongly
termed statement, criticizing the settlement policy of Tel Aviv.

BANGKOK, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's industrial growth
will slow to 9.3 percent this year, down from 11 percent last
year, due to the falling competitiveness of the export sector.
</P>
<P>
Export growth this year will be just 2.58 percent year-on-year
with exports worth 1,440 billion baht (57.6 billion US dollars),
according to the Federation of Thai Industries' (FTI) 1996
economic forecast on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
FTI Chairman Chokchai Aksaranan noted that the FTI used
slightly different calculations than the Bank of Thailand to reach
its forecast. The Central Bank earlier predicted zero percent
export growth.
</P>
<P>
With the government maintaining its policy of operating on
budget surpluses, state investment would grow by only 16.03
percent in 1996 compared with 18.79 percent in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Rural enterprises, the largest
sector absorbing surplus rural laborers, are approaching
saturation, "Business News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rural industrial firms run by townships and villages recruited
2.5 million rural surplus laborers in the first three quarters of
this year, 3.5 million fewer than that in the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The paper predicted that the number of newly-employed workers
by rural firms will be at 3.5 million by the end of the year, with
a drop of 4.4 percent compared with last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
This is due to slow rural industrial growth, a shift from
labor-intensive to technology-intensive production, readjustment
of industrial structure and product mix and closing down of small
paper mills, leather plants and chemical works which produce heavy
pollution.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia Reach No Agreement Over Sevastopol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian and Russian
legislators reached no agreement so far over the status of
Sevastopol Port, a senior Russian official said here today.
</P>
<P>
However, Vice Chairwoman of the Russian State Duma (lower house
of the parliament) Svetlana Goryacheva, who arrived in Kiev
Tuesday, expressed her optimism over the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Though we haven't reached any agreement, the most significant
is that we have begun our dialogue, which gave us a chance to
understand and listen to each other," Goryacheva said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Goryacheva was leading a Duma delegation here for the first
round of talks on the issue of the Black Sea port.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine had been holding different views over the
division of the Black Sea Fleet since the collapse of the former
Soviet Union in 1992, and they both claimed the territorial
sovereignty over Sevastopol, the main base of the fleet, which had
soured the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation Council (upper house of the parliament)
passed a resolution on December 6, claiming Russia's ownership of
Sevastopol. The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet responded immediately by
adopting a similar resolution on the same day.
</P>
<P>
In Goryacheva's opinion, the Russian upper house's resolution
needed President Boris Yeltsin's ratification.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian legislator Vladimir Yatsenko said that the
parliaments should not interfere in the issues of the governments.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently the two governments are delaying the solution to
the status of Sevastopol and the division of the Black Sea Fleet,
and the parliaments should urge the governments to quicken the
process," said Yatsenko.
</P>
<P>
The second round of talks on Sevastopol is expected to take
place in Moscow on December 24, according to Goryacheva.

<HEADLINE> Notaries Stamp It, Make sure It's Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's notaries have played
an important role since 1993 in promoting cultural and economic
exchanges across the Taiwan Straits, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Beijing municipal notary office was
designated by the municipal justice bureau as the sole organ to
handle notarization cases involving Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
Between June 1993 and June 1996, the office handled nearly
2,700 notarization cases, ranging from marriage, adoption, birth
and inheritance to economic co-operation and cultural exchange,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's notarization work has played the role of a bridge in
strengthening across-Straits links, protecting the rights of
people on both sides and enhancing Beijing-Taiwan economic
cooperation, China Daily quoted Zhang Chen, president of the
Beijing Notaries Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
At present, intellectual property rights of one side can not
win protection automatically on the other side of the Straits. so
owners of patents, trade marks and copyrights must apply to
authorities of the other side for protection, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
By June 1996, the notary office had verified nine cases of
trademark registration and patent transfer, effectively protecting
intellectual property rights of owners on both sides of the
Straits, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Taiwan compatriots have come to Beijing
to work in recent years, raising the problem of double taxation.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing notaries offer legal verification that Taiwanese
working in Beijing have paid their income taxes, Zhang said,
eliminating re-taxation by taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Beijing municipal notary office handled more than
20 such cases, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Approves EVAT Law Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives has ratified the Bicameral Conference Committee
report on additional exemptions to the much-criticized Expanded
Value-Added Tax (EVAT) law, according to local Press reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Jose De Venecia said at the meeting on Wednesday night
the additional exemptions, which will cost the government some 1.2
billion pesos (45.6 million US dollars) in foregone revenues, are
expected to benefit millions of Filipinos without harshly
prejudicing the government's social amelioration program and its
on-going economic improvement efforts.
</P>
<P>
Representative Exequiel Javier, who is also chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, said the new measure will, in
effect, cushion the impact of the "harsh" EVAT law.
</P>
<P>
The amendments were passed by the House early this year after
various sectors protested the implementation of EVAT on January 1,
1995 following a longdrawn court battle before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
It was only this week that the Bicameral Conference Committee
acted on the bill which saw many congressmen crossing partylines
to support it.
</P>
<P>
Under the conference committee report, all cooperatives where
the capital share of each member does not exceed 15,000 pesos (570
US dollars), lease of residential units with a monthly rent of not
more than 8,000 pesos (304 US dollars) and natural gas and coal
used for generating electricity, will be exempted from EVAT.
</P>
<P>
Also exempted from the EVAT are the printing, publication,
importation, sale and distribution of books and newspapers; school
supplies, medicines and processed foods; all agricultural credit
and electrical cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Ramos is expected to sign into law today
the Expanded Value-Added Tax amendment bill.

<HEADLINE> Man Devoted to Photographing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Wang Ying has never missed a
chance to photograph a single rare animal or plant which is found
in the Changbai Mountains, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year old photographer, who has worked in the Changbai
Mountain Nature Reserve for more than 20 years, has photographed
almost all the animals and plants in the area, producing more than
30,000 pieces of precious photos.
</P>
<P>
As the world's best-protected primeval nature reserve, Changbai
Mountains boast the richest natural resources in the northeastern
part of the Euro-Asian continent. There are 1,200 kinds of animals
and 2,400 plants in the region.
</P>
<P>
What makes Wang feel proud is that his more than 100 pieces of
photos on animals and plants in the Changbai Mountain area have
been collected by the related United Nations organization.
</P>
<P>
Another thing that Wang Ying is proud of is that, in July this
year, he recorded the activities of seven monsters in the Tianchi
Lake, located on the top of the Changbai Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who was once a cameraman in a government department,
began to work in the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve in 1974. He
said that he has special love for nature and is willing to make
his own contributions to nature protection.
</P>
<P>
In order to photograph as many animals and plants as possible,
Wang almost spends all the time in the nature reserve to study
their activity and distribution rules.
</P>
<P>
He knows what is the best time and place to photograph an
animal, and he can tell the differences of singing between
different birds.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, Wang has gone to every corner of
the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve, which covers 190,000
hectares. He has photographed almost all animals and plants in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Photographing in the nature reserve is not an easy thing for
him. Sometimes, he had to suffer from insects and mosquitos and be
aware of possible attacks from animals, in waiting for the best
time for taking photos.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Wang waited for seven days and nights to photograph a
wild Syberian Tiger, and another time, he broke his leg when
taking a photo of strange stones of the Changbai Mountains.
</P>
<P>
To let more people know about the Changbai Mountains, Wang Ying
has time and again published his photos on a number of pictorials
both domestic and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Due to his outstanding contribution, Wang Ying's name has been
listed in books of Chinese photographers, forestry experts and
contemporary Chinese artists.
</P>
<P>
Between March and August, 1995, Wang Ying's photos were
exhibited in several cities in the Republic of Korea. His
pictorial "Animals and Plants of The Changbai Mountains" was also
published in the country the same year.
</P>
<P>
Having retired, Wang still shows energy in photographing, and
he wishes to make still greater oontributions to nature
protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
condemned the taking of hundreds of hostages at the Japanese
embassy compound in Peru and offered to help.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the terrorists who are holding these hostages to
release them quickly and safely and unharmed," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said. "There can be no justification for
this shameful act of violence and terrorism. Our concerns are with
the hostages -- who are numerous -- and our concerns are with
their families."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lima said as many as 490 people may be held by the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas who stormed
the embassy's reception, demanding release of jailed comrades.
</P>
<P>
Burns said U.S. Ambassador Dennis Jett and his deputy chief of
mission left about half an hour before the terrorists took over
the compound. But at least seven Americans were said to be among
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Clinton sent letters to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori to express the
United States' anxiety and to advise them of U.S. willingness to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Chairmen Support Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congress chairmen of
foreign affairs committees, in contradiction to the president's
chiding, have written a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, expressing their support for what he repeatedly
stressed was security.
</P>
<P>
"There are voices who insist that it is incumbent upon the
State of Israel to make all the sacrifices for peace. Do not count
us among such people," Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina
Republican, and Representative Benjamin Gilman, a New York
Republican, said in a letter to Netanyahu dated on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The letter followed President Bill Clinton's criticism of
Israel on Monday that the Israeli government's decision to grant
financial benefits to Jewish setters had become an obstacle for
the Middle East peace making.
</P>
<P>
Helms, chairman of the Senate foreign Relations Committee, and
Gilman, head of the House International Relations Committee, are
both known for their strong support of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
They said in the letter that Israel is a political, strategic
and moral ally of the United States and a constant and trusted
friend, adding: "These facts are immutable and cannot be altered
by changes in government, either in Washington or Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
"We... support your efforts to ensure the security of Israel's
people and its borders. Security is the foundation on which the
peace process has been built, and without which neither Israel,
nor the United States, can be confident of a lasting solution to
the conflict in the Middle East," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns urged the
Palestinians to reciprocate some of Israel's gestures in
negotiations for redeployment of Israeli troops from the West Bank
city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"In return for some of the gestures that have been made by the
Israeli government in these negotiations just recently, we think
the Palestinian Authority should now put itself in a position to
reciprocate some of those gestures on the specific issues that are
in play in these Hebron talks," Burns said.

</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 500.4

The Nasdaq composite rose 19.03 to 1,285.35, and the American

</P>
<P>
The Dow industrials were led higher by IBM.
</P>

economists indicated the country's economy should grow 2.3 percent
in the last quarter of 1996 and drop to 2.0 percent in the first
two quarters of 1997.
</P>
<P>
That data confirmed that the economy is growing slowly and
reinforced the Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to hold
short-term interest rates steady.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
condemned the taking of hundreds of hostages at the Japanese
embassy compound in Peru and offered to help.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the terrorists who are holding these hostages to
release them quickly and safely and unharmed," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said. "There can be no justification for
this shameful act of violence and terrorism. Our concerns are with
the hostages -- who are numerous -- and our concerns are with
their families."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lima said as many as 490 people may be held by the
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas who stormed
the embassy's reception, demanding release of jailed comrades.
</P>
<P>
Burns said U.S. Ambassador Dennis Jett and his deputy chief of
mission left about half an hour before the terrorists took over
the compound. But at least seven Americans were said to be among
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Clinton sent letters to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori to express the
United States' anxiety and to advise them of U.S. willingness to
be of help, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.

LONDON, December 18 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the

fully involved in political developments of the European Union
(EU) and should not rule out its membership of the European
Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Royal Institute of International Affairs
earlier today, Clarke said, "our continuing and future economic
successes, exploiting the opportunities of our enterprise economy,
depends to a significant degree on Britain being and staying a key
player in the politics of our continent."
</P>
<P>
"We can not choose to live by the European marketplace
economically and then exclude ourselves from discussion of the
political future of our continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Britain's stance towards the single European currency,
Clarke refused to rule out the coutry's membership of the EMU and
said that the British government's "wait-and-see" policy on the
issue was essential if Britain was to retain its influence on how
the new Euro will operate.
</P>
<P>
"It would be contrary to British interests to rule out now, on
any specific timetable, participating in the next important
development that may occur in Western Europe is our position and
we will stick to it," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Togolese Foreign Ministers Hold talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today called for efforts to
effect a new development in Sino-Togolese relations on the
basis of good cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark in talks with Togolese Foreign Minister
Koffi Panou in Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should make positive efforts to probe new areas and
channels in bilateral cooperation, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian described Togo as an old friend of China. The
solidly-based friendly cooperative ties between the two countries
emit a strong vitality, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drastic changes in the international situation, and
the changes in their respective countries, the friendship between
China and Togo has stood the test of time over the past 20 years
since the two countries were diplomatically linked, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have conducted fruitful and effective
cooperation in political, economic, trade, cultural and public
health fields, and the two countries have always been supportive
and understanding of each other in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Qian spoke highly of bilateral cooperation in economic and
trade fields, saying that China is happy to see that some economic
and technological assistance by the Chinese government and
projects constructed with China's aid have played a role in the
social and economic life of Togo.
</P>
<P>
Panou said the relationship, featured by marked achievements in
economic cooperation between Togo and China, has been good, and
their cooperation could be cited as an example between developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese government and people thanked China for its
assistance, citing the sugar refinery constructed with aid from
China, for which the Togolese people have benefited a great deal.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to see that China is all along with the
developing countries," Panou noted.
</P>
<P>
Panou reiterated Togo's firm stand of supporting the great
cause of China's reunification, saying its government would not
change the policy that there is only one China in the world, that
is, the People's Republic of China, and that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
Panou also extended congratulations to China on its resumption
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao in the no too distant
future.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian and Panou also briefed each other on
the domestic situation of the two countries, and exchanged views
in depth on important African and international issues, and gained
a wide common consensus in this regard. .
</P>
<P>
After the talks the two foreign ministers attended a ceremony
of exchanging notes of governments on retaining the honorable
consulate of Togo in the Hong Kong Special Administration Region
after July 1, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Greater Role Urged in Development of Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Science and technology
associations in western China issued a joint letter today calling
on science bodies at all levels to play a greater role in local
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The western part of China includes Shaanxi, Qinghai and Gansu
provinces, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, Tibet Autonomous Region, Yunnan, Guizhou and
Sichuan provinces and Chongqing City. China's poverty-affected
population are concentrated in the region.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the associations and societies should
fully play their role in the key construction projects in western
China. The consultancy systems of the associations break the
barriers between different sectors and departments and their
consultancies are more fair, objective and detached, according to
the letter.
</P>
<P>
The west development is restricted by the poor quality of
education. The letters called on science associations to fully
play their role in the spread of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The letter also called on the associations to make greater
contribution to the cultivation of talented people and overseas
exchanges in science.
</P>
<P>
The letter proposed that China Association for Science and
Technology organize experts of national societies to work on a
number of research topics about west China development, and
provide the research results to relevant decision-making
departments.

<HEADLINE> Kangaroo Saves Man From Fire in Western Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A man who saved a joey from
the roadside is today thanking the animal for saving his life
after its frantic thumping on the bathroom door alerted him to a
fire in the house.
</P>
<P>
Nigel Etherington was asleep in his house in Perth, a western
Australian city, when he woke to the sound of thumping and found
his home alight at 6 a.m., according to a report by the Australian
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Fire brigade captain Brad Hibble, who attended the blaze, said
Etherington would most probably have died of smoke inhalation if
the kangaroo had not woken him.
</P>
<P>
Etherington found the joey late last night in the pouch of its
dead mother after stopping to remove the kangaroo's body from the
road.
</P>
<P>
He took the joey home and put it in the bathroom, intending to
raise the animal. Etherington suffered minor injuries in the fire.

<HEADLINE> UK Tory Faces Parliamentary Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major has been plunged into further crisis since the Tories were
accused of cheating in Monday night's crucial vote on European
Union fishing policy.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Labor and Liberal Democrats claimed Tory whips
cheated over pairing arrangements used to cover for absent MPs and
threatened they would suspend any further cross-party co-operation
on Commons votes between now and the general election.
</P>
<P>
Pairing is a tried and tested parliamentary tradition, which
allows ministers and MPs to go abroad and MPs to remain in their
sick-beds without having to dash back to the House of Commons for
important votes.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties said during Monday's vote on EU fishing
policy, Tory whips had paired three of their absent MPs twice --
once with Labor, once with the Liberal Democrats -- in a flagrant
breach of Commons conventions.
</P>
<P>
Senior Tory sources Wednesday night admitted that the party had
been pairing one Tory MP with two MPs from different opposition
parties in key votes for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition reacted angrily to the government's refusal to
apologize. Its non-cooperation policy means that the Tory
Government, which lost its overall majority in the House of
Commons, is now in an even more vulnerable position and will make
it even harder for the government to get through its bills before
next election.

GUANGZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The China Minsheng Banking
Corporation has set up a branch in Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The branch, the first domestic branch of Minsheng, opened for
trial operation yesterday. Minsheng is China's first joint-stock
commercial bank invested by non-governmental enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng bank was set up in January with a registered capital
of 380 million yuan, more than 80 percent of which has come from
non-state-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
The newly-opened Guangzhou branch will mainly provide credit
loans of different terms for non-state-run enterprises, and
aid development of sectors such as real estate and science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
The branch is expected to play an important role in local
economic expansion, as Guangdong's non-governmental enterprises
account for about one third of the total.

FUZHOU, December 19 (Xinhua) -- A pavilion has been built to
protect a 900-year-old stone tablet bearing inscriptions of an
imperial tea-making workshop in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say that the tablet, bearing 80 characters, is
very important in the study of the Chinese history of tea-making.
</P>

Song Dynasty (960-1127).
</P>
<P>
It included 32 tea-making houses, government buildings,
pavilions, wells and other tea-making facilities.
</P>
<P>
The stone tablet, and some of the building remains were found

<HEADLINE> Ramos Welcomes Japan's Assurance of Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today welcomed the Japanese government's assurance that it
will build closer partnership with the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The President told Hiroshi Hirabayashi, chief Cabinet Counselor
and special envoy of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, that Japan
and ASEAN can play important roles in ensuring the security and
stability of the Asia Pacific region besides trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Hirabayashi assured Ramos during a courtesy call today that
Japan will make more commitment to pursue and accelerate bilateral
relations with the ASEAN, adding that Japan will look increasingly
to Southeast Asia and renew and re-define policies towards the
ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Hirabayashi lauded the President for bringing domestic
stability to the country, particularly with the Mindanao peace
agreement and the economic progress.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government signed last September the Mindanao
peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF),
the biggest rebel group in the country. The peace deal put an end
to a 24 year civil war in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The country, which enjoys one of the highest economic growth in
the Asia Pacific region this year, has also been hailed as a
"newly-born tiger" for its strong economic performance.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Tokyo government's role in developing and
accelerating the economies of Southeast Asia, Ramos said Japanese
investment, trade and official assistance have been major factors
in improving the Philippine economy.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also expressed satisfaction over Japan's continued
support for the Mindanao peace accord and the development of the
southern Philippines.

</P>
<P>
A police officer said on condition of anonymity that more than
10,000 tons of marijuana were exported through ports of Cambodia
in the past, according to the data available.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some foreigners brought in marijuana seeds,
lured local farmers to grow, then purchased the produce and
smuggled them abroad to obtain excessive profits, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The officer also said that before launching the operation,
police had made a survey over marijuana plantations and found
there are about 100 hectares of marijuana crops in Kandal Province
alone.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, the police have ordered marijuana
growers to destroy the evil crops themselves before a given time.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Yeng Marady said the preparation for this operation
coincided with a debate at the National Assembly on the anti-drug
law, whose passage has offered them a weapon of law in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to destroy marijuana crops in the main marijuana
growing area through the campaign," he added.

China, closed its fifth plenary session of the fifth central
committee today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Participants pledged that their party will go on to unite the
Taiwan compatriots both on and off the island, and promote

The stance of anti-division and anti-"Taiwan independence" held
by the Chinese government has won the recognition and support of
the world communities, they said, adding that as Hong Kong's
return is approaching, the principle of "peaceful reunification,
and one country, two systems" will be understood by more people.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also required its members and departments at each
level to devote more to the socialist ethical and cultural
progress, and better fulfill the party's participation in
political and government affairs next year.

<P>
KHARTOUM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has sent a message to
the U.N. Security Council, clarifying the negative effects of
Resolution 1070 which lays an air embargo on Sudan, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Foreign Ministry prepared a detailed message and
sent it to the president of the U.N. Security Council, explaining
to him that implementing Resolution 1070 would have negative
effects on the unity and security of Sudan, Mustafa Osman,
minister of state at the Foreign Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country would act at all levels in the coming
days to explain its position on the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 1070.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council issued Resolution 1070 on August 16,
which calls for imposing an air embargo on Sudan by the end of
November this year for its failure to hand over the three
suspects allegely involved in the attempt on Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak's life in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, last year.
</P>
<P>
On November 23, however, the U.N. postponed the implementation
of the resolution until the end of December due to a
French-Russian request that offers the U.N. Security Council an
opportunity to assess the consequence of the implementation of
the resolution.

<HEADLINE> India to Introduce New Gold Policy Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- India's Finance Ministry is
likely to announce in early next year an Integrated National Gold
Policy (INGP) which was based on an 11-point recommendation made
by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), RBI sources said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities felt that the time was now ripe for announcing
the INGP in the wake of such factors: erratic pricing of gold in
the domestic market, recent spurt in gold smuggling and the need
to discourage people from excessive craze for gold.
</P>
<P>
A special RBI committee for working out the bank's
recommendations on the need and nature of the proposed INGP was
appointed way back in 1993 when the gold bond scheme was
announced, RBI sources said.
</P>
<P>
The RBI committee in its recommendations said that although
there were official guidelines for certain sub-sectors of the
bullion trade, there was a need to evolve an INGP which would
encompass areas like gold trade, import and export of ornaments,
investments in gold and the gold refining industry. A statutory
regulation of bullion trade was required and the trade should be
uniform.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Trying Hard to Attract Outside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- African countries are creating
conducive environment to attract investments, seeking opportunity
for development.
</P>
<P>
This was manifested by an international conference on
investment in Africa in June which was sponsored by the U.N.
Economic Commission for Africa and the Ghanaian government.
</P>
<P>
About 500 people, which included some heads of government,
ministers of trade, finance, industry, energy, agriculture and
mining, as well as delegates from the economic and commercial
domains, took part.
</P>
<P>
It was aimed at providing a forum for African countries to sum
up and exchange successful experiences in attracting and
utilizing investments while at the same time to demonstrate the
great potential for investment in Africa to outside investors.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the year 1996 saw regional groups such as SADC,
COMESA, ECOWAS and the EAC as well as states in north Africa hold
various international and sub-regional meetings or forums on
economy, trade and investment to speed up their internal economic
integration, improve climate for investment and strengthen
cooperation in economic development.
</P>
<P>
African countries, while trying hard to create conducive
environment for investments, are also paying more attention to
the construction of infrastructure and the building of capital
markets.
</P>
<P>
Ghana has decided to spend 240 million U.S. Dollars to
rehabilitate and expand port facilities. Ethiopia is carrying out
a program to build and maintain roads at the cost of 151 million
U.S. Dollars in the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is schemed to build another 2,000 kilometers of roads
in the coming 10 years. A long-term expansion program for
telecommunication system has been carried out in Zambia on which
720 million U.S. Dollars will be spent within a period of 10
years.
</P>
<P>
African countries are making efforts to build and improve
their capital markets for the convenience of enterprises to
collect capital for their expansion.
</P>
<P>
At present, the stock exchanges in Namibia, South Africa,
Kenya, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Nigeria and other countries are quite
active.
</P>
<P>
Starting business from 1992, the Namibia stock exchange has
become the second largest capital market in Africa with 20
billion U.S. Dollars of capital in July this year.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, the total volume of business recorded 294 million
U.S. Dollars in July as compared to 56 million U.S. Dollars in
the same month of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Africa is a continent with vast potentials for investment. The
efforts made by African countries to attract investment are
gradually being known to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen from Hamburg, Germany, are of the view that Africa
is no longer a land of famine, war and disaster, and businessmen
should develop a positive outlook for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Some of them noted that the continent is on the path to
economic and political stability and it deserves attention of the
investors.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Vows to Renew Attacks Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) issued a statement today vowing to resume
attacks against what it termed as Zionist targets in response to
Israel's hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Distributed in the West Bank city of Ramallah, the statement
said that "the armed struggle to strike Zionist targets and
escalating the Intifada (Arab uprising)" were two responses of
Hamas to what it called "the Nazi policies of the government of
terrorist (Binyamin) Netanyahu."
</P>
<P>
Hamas called for continued strikes against "the herds of
settlers and coward soldiers," in reference to Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The statement was the latest in a series of threats issued by
the extremist Islamic militant group which has been haunting
Israel with violence, including suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
Hamas launched three of the four suicide bombings from last
February to early March which killed 58 people in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Izzadin Kassim, Hamas' military wing was held responsible for
carrying out military attacks, distributed a similar statement
in Gaza last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement declared the renewal of military attacks against
Israel to mark the 9th anniversary of its establishment and the
first anniversary of the death of its bombing expert "Engineer"
Yihya Ayash, who was killed by a booby trapped cellular phone last
January. Hamas blamed Israeli agents for Ayash's murder.
</P>
<P>
Izzadin Kassim's statement attributed the relative quiet of
its activities since March to the crackdown by the Palestinian
Authority and its reorganizing process.
</P>
<P>
It said that the only obstacle to a new start of military
operations was related to "mere technical issues."
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces have been put on high alert since the
drive-by shooting attack last Wednesday near Ramallah by three
Palestinian gunmen.
</P>
<P>
A Jewish mother and her 12-year-old son were killed and her
other four children were wounded in the attack, which was
carried out by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
a radical Palestinian group based in the Syrian capital
Damascus.

<HEADLINE> Violent Video Games Turn More Girls off Computers Than Boys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Violent video games which
teenage girls regard as "silly and immature" turn them off
computers and affect their view of information technology for the
rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
A study which compared students' attitudes and understanding of
computers over the past 10 years shows that young women still lag
behind young men, although both sexes have got more knowledge
since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alan Durndell, a psychology lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian
University, told the winter meeting of the British Psychological
Society in London Wednesday that girls' reaction to violent and
aggressive computer games was that they were "silly and immature."
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that girls are getting negative messages
just at the point in their lives when they are beginning to map
out their future pathways," he said,
</P>
<P>
"By the age of 15 or 16, girls are turned off computers. Their
view (of computers) is one of silly boys, playing aggressive,
silly computer games. Girls consider themselves more mature and
want to spend their time with people."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Durndell also said that when asked about sex differences
and computers, girls expressed a "We can, I can't" attitude -- as
a whole, girls were no less able than boys, but as individual,
most said they did not want to use computers themselves.
</P>
<P>
Girls tended to be more interested in computers when they could
see a useful end point, while boys liked computers for the
machinery itself, Dr. Durndell said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Durndell's research involved four groups of 150 students
interviewed at three-year periods between 1986 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, female students had only half the computer knowledge
of men. By 1995, they had caught up and knew only 25 percent less
than men.

BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The China Zhi Gong Party, a
political public interest organization, will work harder to
contribute to the country's ambitious goals for future development
and reunification of the motherland, the chairman of the party's
central committee said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dong Yinchu made the remark at the closing ceremony of the
Fifth Plenary Session of the 10th Central Committee of the China
Zhi Gong Party, which was held here from December 17-19.
</P>
<P>
Dong stressed that the party will further mobilize and unite
overseas Chinese, especially those in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao
and strive for the smooth hand-over of Hong Kong to the motherland
and its future development.
</P>
<P>
China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong is a
long-awaited event for the Chinese people, and a long-cherished
wish of all overseas Chinese, he said.
</P>
<P>
All overseas Chinese, without exception, feel proud and excited
about the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, Dong continued.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said that China Zhi Gong Party has wide overseas
links, so the party will make even greater contributions to the
country's economic construction by giving full play to these
advantages.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the party has received 12,500 overseas Chinese and
compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. The party members have
actively helped introduce 670 million US dollars and 540 million
yuan for the country's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Du Yijin, vice-governor of east China's Anhui Province, was
newly elected as vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the
China Zhi Gong Party.

<HEADLINE> Mystery of How Insect Can Fly Disclosed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Insects use the same
aerodynamic effects as Concorde to stay aloft, said a report
published by the science journal Nature today.
</P>
<P>
According to the conventional laws of aerodynamics, it is
impossible for insects to fly.
</P>
<P>
But by studying the flapping wings of a model based on the
hawkmoth but 10 times larger, Charles Ellington, a zoologist at
Cambridge, and his colleagues have solved the mystery. The key is
the generation and maintenance of vortices - little whirlpools of
air - along the leading edge of the wing.
</P>
<P>
Concorde depends on this effect to take off and land. British
scientists discovered after the World War II that a slender delta
wing in slow flight generates vortices at the wing tip that create
lift. Since the same wing shape is also suitable for different
conditions of supersonic flight, Concorde became possible.
</P>
<P>
Although insects do not have swept-back wings, they generate
the same kind of vortices through flapping.
</P>
<P>
Tests using smoke in a wind tunnel showed that, at the
beginning of the moth's downstroke, when the wing is angled for
maximum lift, a vortex is created at the wing root. "This creates
a region of low pressure above the wing, which sucks the insect
upwards," Dr. Ellington said.
</P>
<P>
The vortex forms a spiral which moves along the leading edge of
the wing towards the tip. The effect is to create lift on the
downstroke equivalent to 1.5 times the moth's weight, more than
adequate to keep it airborne.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches More Air Raid on South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes bombed
suspected guerrilla targets in an area controlled by the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah in south Lebanon today, the second
successive day of Israeli raids at the same area.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that the Israeli
warplanes fired four air-to-surface missiles at Jebal Al-Safih in
Iglim Al-Toffah, some 60 kilometers southeast of Beirut, in two
bombing runs at 1:40 p.m. (11:40 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Four Israeli fighter jets roared over the area, providing a
cover for other two warplanes which were carrying out the
operation, the Lebanese security sources added.
</P>
<P>
They said that before and after the air raid, Israeli military
helicopters and warplanes hovered over the areas of Iglim
Al-Toffah and Nabatiyeh, drawing upward fire opened by Lebanese
army troops and guerrillas nearby.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes launched two air strikes on Wednesday at
Iglim Al-Toffah, a mountain area often used by Hezbollah, which is
translated as Party of God, as a springboard to attack the Israeli
self-carved "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces in the buffer zone also bombarded a
number of south Lebanese villages opposite the occupied border
strip this morning, leading to the burning-down of a civilian
house in Shakra.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that more than 35 155mm and 120mm
shells landed in a wide area ranging from Baraashit to the
east to Shakra and Wadi Sulouki to the west, and at least
four shells blasted in the village of Baraashit.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that one group of its fighters launched an attack this
morning on an Israeli outpost on a hill overlooking Baraashit with
heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, "causing certain
casualties."
</P>
<P>
Radio of the Israeli client South Lebanon Army militia
confirmed the guerilla attack but denied any casualties were
made.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated in south Lebanon since Israel claimed that
three Katyusha rockets were fired into the western Galilee in
northern Israel Friday, killing some livestocks in the area.
</P>
<P>
The first of the current series of Israeli air strikes occurred
Sunday when Israeli aircraft struck at Hezbollah targets in
Syrian-controlled Western Beqaa after a clash between Israeli
troops and guerrillas from the Shiite Muslim group.
</P>
<P>
A five-nation committee monitoring a limited truce on the
Lebanese-Israeli border confirmed Tuesday that at least one
Katyusha rocket was fired from south Lebanon into Israeli
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
However, the monitoring committee, comprising France, the
United States, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, declined to hold
Lebanon responsible for the Katyusha attack.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers noted that the escalation in south
Lebanon came amid a current trip of Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri in the United States for a fund-raising mission,
which peaked at the so-called "Friends of Lebanon conference"
in Washington Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Muslim guerrillas and bombardments by
Israeli forces constitute a daily scene on the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon, stretching from the Mediterranean coast to the
west eastward to Mount Hermon, in a bid to protect the
Jewish settlements in northern Israel from border-crossing
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR Confident about HK Future (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the issue of the provisional legislature, Tung said that
with the transfer of power in 1997, the existing legislature will
be terminated on June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said it is not realistic to hope for the immediate election
of a new legislature in Hong Kong; in order to avoid the absence
of a legal body in the region, a provisional legislative council
will be set up.
</P>
<P>
When asked how he will strengthen the connection between the
HKSAR government and the central people's government, Tung said
that according to the provisions of the Basic Law, the Chief
Executive of the HKSAR should be responsible for both of them.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, Hong Kong will earnestly implement the principles
of "one country, two systems," "the Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong" and a high-degree of autonomy as well as the Basic Law,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of these principles, he said, Hong Kong has the
responsibility to handle general matters well. Of course, he said,
some issues will involve consultation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that President Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed that
"one country, two systems" is a long-established state policy and
will not change.
</P>
<P>
The central government has the determination and sincerity to
implement the three principles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The state leaders also stressed that if the Chief Executive
meets with difficulties, the central government will fully support
him, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the three principles were created to solve the
Hong Kong issue that was inherited from history, and also to
contribute to Hong Kong's future prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The successful return of Hong Kong to the motherland will
benefit the reunification of the motherland, he said, adding that
the leaders of the central government clearly understand the
matters related to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that a good Hong Kong benefits the country,
while a good country in turn improves Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and
Vice-premier Qian Qichen all encouraged him to go ahead with his
work and implement the three guiding principles.
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence in our ability to work well for the sake of
our common interests," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee-hwa, first Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
said here today that he has gained more confidence in Hong Kong's
future as a result of his meetings and conversations with state
leaders.
</P>
<P>
At a noon press conference, Tung expressed the hope that all of
the Hong Kong people will pool their wisdom and strength to
contribute more to Hong Kong's smooth return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he was greatly honored to come to Beijing and
officially receive the appointment of the first Chief Executive by
the State Council, and also to be given such a warm reception by
the state leaders.
</P>
<P>
This not only illustrates the great importance of his position
and the HKSAR, he said, but also the great importance of the six
million Hong Kong people and the stable return of Hong Kong to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Tung said this appointment is a historical moment, and that it
is his "highest honor" to be appointed as the first Chief
Executive of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, I am aware that there are difficulties in
my work full of challenges. The tasks are heavy while the road is
long," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
During the 45-minute press conference, Tung answered questions
raised by journalists in Cantonese, standard Chinese and English.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the composition of the leading body of the
HKSAR soon to take office, Tung said his usual working style is to
think over a matter, act in an orderly way, and carefully consider
the options.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to Hong Kong, Tung said, he will prepare to
form the leading body of the HKSAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung quoted leaders of the central government as saying that it
is their hope that the Hong Kong civil servants will keep their
minds on their work as they have done in the past, and continue to
contribute to the stable transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the majority of the Hong Kong
civil servants will remain in their jobs.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Enacts Ordinance for Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Regulations for the Shanghai
Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone -- the first ordinance formulated by
the city's legislature for the Pudong New Area -- were passed
today in this east China metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Effective as of January 1, 1997, the regulations will provide a
legal basis for the management and operation of China's first and
largest free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Local lawmakers say the new regulations are meant to improve
Pudong's investment environment and boost the confidence of
international businesses participating in economic and trade
activities in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will clearly define and regulate the zone's
nature, functions, management system, customs supervision
patterns, and operation rules.
</P>
<P>
The regulations have 51 articles, which state:
</P>
<P>
- The Shanghai Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone Managing Committee,
as the municipal government's agency in the zone, will be in
charge of the administration of the zone;
</P>
<P>
- Investors who want to set up businesses in the zone should
apply to the Managing Committee;
</P>
<P>
- Businesses in the zone can trade freely with overseas
counterparts without the limitation of quotas and licenses, except
for items subject to special state rules. Both domestic and overseas
businesses are encouraged to store their goods in the zone, and
there is no time limit for the storage.
</P>
<P>
- Businesses in the zone have access to current-account
convertibility of the RMB with foreign currencies, and certain
foreign currencies designated by state financial regulatory
departments can circulate in the zone.
</P>
<P>
- Businesses and entities in the zone that want to lease land
should sign land use transfer contracts with the Free Trade Zone
Development Co., and follow the land use procedures with help from
the Managing Committee.
</P>
<P>
- Businesses in the zone should pay enterprise income taxes at
the rate of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
China presently has 15 free trade and bonded zones. The
Shanghai Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone, set up in June of 1990, has a
designed area of square 10 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, 2,672 projects had been approved in
the zone, with a total investment of 3.27 billion US dollars, in
which 1.593 billion are agreed overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the volume of import and export and entrepot trade
through the zone reached 940 million US dollars, and the monthly
business volume of its bonded commodities trading market surpassed
100 million.

<HEADLINE> NASA's Evidence on Life on Mars Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found that the
evidence provided by the NASA supporting Martian life theory can
be explained by non-biological processes.
</P>
<P>
NASA announced that it suspected early extra-terrestrial
microbial life on Martian meteorite ALH 84001 in this August
because four compounds found inside the meteorite could be
produced only by living organisms.
</P>
<P>
Geoscientists in America suggested that magnetite crystals
inside the meteorite, assumed to be the product of bacteria, were
not produced by a biogenic process, according to a study published
in the latest issue of the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta.
</P>
<P>
"The biological explanation is becoming less and less
plausible," said the author, John Kerridge, a planetary scientist
at the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
San Diego scientists also found organic molecules called
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Antarctic ice were the same as
those inside the meteorite's globules. They have been also found
in other meteorites that do not come from Mars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Aging Population Increases Faster in Future: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Experts predict that China's
aging population will increase to 132 million by the end of 2000,
based on 1994's figure of 110 million.
</P>
<P>
The figure is expected to climb to 374 million by the year
2040, accounting for 24.48 percent of the total population, they
said. This means that one out of every four Chinese people will be
over 60 years old.
</P>
<P>
"The increasing scale of the aging population in China is
probably the largest in the world," said the experts from the
Chinese Association of the Elderly.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the silver-hair population has climbed at a rate of
3.32 percent per year. Big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and
Tianjin, and the provinces of Jiangsu and Shandong, have reported
higher rates of increase than the national level.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed fast growth of the elderly population to the
prolonged life expectancy of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Because health conditions and living standards have been
greatly improved, the average life expectancy of the Chinese has
risen to 70 years, from 35 in 1949, according to a report from
China's Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, life expectancy has reached 74 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that residential communities will play a
fundamental role in supporting senior citizens who have poor
health and lower incomes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Govt Urged to Solve Sugar Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines, an advocate of
trade liberalization, is now facing a challenge from its sugar
producers, who strongly demand protection of the country's
vulnerable sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
The country's more than half a million sugarcane planters and
sugar producers have in recent weeks appealed to the government to
save the sugar industry, which they said will collapse soon due to
depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, they threatened to halt planting and milling
activities unless the government withdraws refined sugar from the
list of agricultural products traded at discount tariff rates
among the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The proposed work stoppage could affect the jobs of millions of
people, including 560,000 small farmers.
</P>
<P>
The domestic market has witnessed a sharp decrease in the
millsite price of sugar from 800 pesos (30.5 U.S. dollars) a
50-kilo bag in February to less than 500 pesos (19.1 dollars) last
month.
</P>
<P>
Sugar producers blamed the price plunge on a glut of sugar as a
result of the over-importation of cheap sugar and massive
smuggling by sugar traders.
</P>
<P>
There is now an estimated 300,000 tons of excess supply of
sugar in the domestic market, according to the Sugar Regulatory
Administration (SRA), the government agency overseeing the sugar
industry.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of sugar producers' groups said sugar prices will
continue to go down till August next year due to the peak milling
season from December to March.
</P>
<P>
If sugar producers continue to sell at a loss in the next three
to six months, they will not have enough resources to plant next
year and then a sugar shortage will appear, they warned.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of sugar producers, the SRA this week agreed
to push for a unilateral withdrawal of refined sugar from the
ASEAN's Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme. SRA
chief Wilson Gamboa said Wednesday that he was confident that
President Fidel Ramos will agree to the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The CEPT is a tariff-reduction program that serves as the
primary vehicle to create a free trade area among the Association
of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) which groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Under
the CEPT scheme, about 35 percent is shaved off from duties on
refined sugar imported from ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and Indonesia were the only ASEAN members which
included refined sugar as part of their commitment to the CEPT
scheme, but Indonesia last year withdrew refined sugar from its
list.
</P>
<P>
Sugar producers also urged the Philippines government to curb
the import of huge amounts of sugar by duty-free shops in the
country's two major economic zones, Subic Free Port and Clark.
</P>
<P>
They accused sugar traders in the two zones of selling cheap
imported sugar in the domestic market, helping bring down sugar
prices.
</P>
<P>
To stabilize sugar prices, the government has asked the United
States for permission for an advanced shipment of about 106,000
tons of sugar, its remaining sugar quota to the U.S. market.
Another 200,000 tons of sugar will be sold on the world market to
effectively reduce the stocks.
</P>
<P>
Should the U.S. turn down the SRA's proposal, the government
will have to ask a consortium of banks to provide funds to sugar
producers so they can wait for a better price in the future.
</P>
<P>
But economists here said that sugar producers should improve
production efficiency in order to cope with global trade
liberalization rather than relying too much on government
intervention, "a short-term solution".
</P>
<P>
Due to inefficient production and milling facilities, the cost
for producing sugar in the Philippines is higher than that in many
other countries, the economists said. As a result, sugar prices
in the country are higher than those on the world market.

<HEADLINE> EC Grants Financial Aid to Transport Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
has decided to grant 280 million ECUs (some 360 million U.S.
dollars) to assist 107 transport infrastructure projects in Europe
within the 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
EC Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock Thursday welcomed the
decision, saying "the extent of the financial support granted by
the commission will no doubt give a strong momentum to the
development of trans-European transport networks, which remain
essential for the competitiveness and employment in Europe."
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the assisted projects and studies are
projects of common interest identified in the 1996 EU guidelines
for the development of trans-European transport networks.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the greatest part of the support will
still go to rail projects as before in keeping with the EC's
commitment to favor transport modes that are as
environment-friendly as possible.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Deng Xiaoping's Theories Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Deng Xiaoping's theories
should be faithfully followed to arm the Communist Party and
educate cadres, according to a senior Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau, and the
Secretariat, of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), made the remark at the third national symposium on
Deng Xiaoping's theories on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Ding, who is also head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC
Central Committee, noted that Deng Xiaoping is the chief architect
of China's reform and opening up, and the founder of the theories
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved much in its reform and opening up in recent
years, which have been characterized by economic development,
political stability, national unification, and social progress,
Ding said.
</P>
<P>
He observed that this "should be attributed to the efforts by
the CPC Central Committee, with Jiang Zemin at the core, to use
Deng's theories to arm the party, educate cadres and the people,
and make the theories the fundamental guiding principles for the
work of the whole party, and the ideological prop of the whole
nation."
</P>
<P>
He added that in modern China, adherence to Deng Xiaoping's
theories is true adherence to the principles of Marxism and
Leninism, and Mao Zedong's Thought.
</P>
<P>
He urged entire party cadres and government officials to
emancipate their minds and abide by the principle of "seeking
truth from facts in their study of Deng's theories.
</P>
<P>
He called on philosophers to increase their study of Deng's
theories, in order to explore the rules for economic, political
and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges All Buses to Use Gas to Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government ordered
the conversion of all public buses from gasoline to natural gas
by the next year in a bid to reduce air pollution in the country,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the decision was adopted at a cabinet
meeting held Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The government will earmark some 54 million U.S. dollars for
the conversion of 4,000 public buses operating in the capital of
Tehran, which burn a total of 300,000 liters of diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
Some of the budget will be used to build more natural gas
refueling stations around Tehran to encourage and facilitate the
use of natural gas instead of petroleum or diesel fuels.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by mountains which block the winds from three
directions, Tehran is known as one of the most polluted capitals
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts by the municipal government to raise
people's consciousness of the pollution and some laws passed
to curb the rampant pollution, the problem is going from bad to
worse.
</P>
<P>
Late October, thousands of Tehran residents were reportedly
afflicted with laryngitis, a disease affecting throat, as a
result of air pollution, which had also led to a rise in the
number of lung diseases and laryngitis among children.
</P>
<P>
Specialists specified that 65 percent of the pollution in
Tehran is produced by vehicular exhaust, 24 percent is generated
by industries and service centers and 11 percent is caused by
home water heaters.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that Tehran is facing serious air
pollution with two tons of lead entering the air every day. About
80 percent of the air pollution was caused by cars in the city.
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 10 million, there are some three
million cars in the city.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the poisonous gas released by automobiles in
the city will cause various disease related with liver, kidney,
spleen, brain, bones and muscles.

personally negotiate the release of the captives, including the
Peruvian foreign and agriculture ministers and at least 12 other
ambassadors from Asia, Europe and the Americas.
</P>
<P>
The rebels issued an ultimatum at noon that they would kill
Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela unless Fujimori
personally join the negotiations.

solution through negotiation that avoids bloodshed.

AMMAN, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti today lashed out at Israel for its disregard of
the agreements it has signed with the Palestinians, Jordan's
official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel should abide by and implement all the agreements it has
signed with the Palestinians, Kabariti said while meeting with
visiting Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti urged Israel and the Palestinian Authority to proceed
into the final phase of negotiations as soon as possible in
accordance with the Oslo agreements signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Jordan opposes Israel's policy of expanding Jewish settlements
in the West Bank, Kabariti said.
</P>
<P>
The policy runs against the principle of "land for peace"
formula and might constitute a threat to the stagnant Middle East
peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti and Levy also discussed the latest developments
concerning the long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment in Hebron,
the last West Bank town still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Kabariti and Levy took place only a week
after Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher's visit to
Israel, which turned out to be fruitless.

<P>
Levy left Amman after attending the opening ceremony of Israeli
 Embassy's new building here this afternoon.

ISLAMABAD, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Defense Minister
Shahid Hamid made it clear today that there are no intentions to
reduce the country's defense budget.
</P>
<P>
Talking to local reporters in the southern port city of
Karachi, he said, "We spend 26 percent of our national budget on
defense. We have no intentions of reducing the defense budget."
</P>
<P>
If possible, Pakistan will make appropriate increase to cater
to any threat from across the border, Shahid Hamid told local
press.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We will get together with the Ministry of Finance to
see the possibility of getting additional finances to cope with
the impact of the devaluation of Pakistani rupee in the past."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister made these remarks when a reporter drew
his attention to recent increase by India in its defense budget
and the impact of Pakistan's defense budget in the wake of the
devaluation of the Pakistani currency in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
Replying to another question, Shahid Hamid said that the
situation on the border is satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan wants to improve its relations with
India.

However, he made it clear that since the core issue of Kashmir

<P>
NICOSIA, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today expressed then
hope that outgoing U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's
work toward a settlement to the Cyprus problem would be continued
by his successor Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides praised Ghali for his special interest in
Cyprus during his tenure, saying that Boutros-Ghali "did not
hesitate to denounce the lack of political will displayed by the
Turkish Cypriot side."
</P>
<P>
Annan's previous post as head of U.N. peace-keeping operations
gives him a good knowledge of the situation in Cyprus, where a
U.N. peace-keeping force has been stationed for a long period of
time, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
During a press conference at U.N. Headquarters Wednesday, the
new U.N. secretary general described the Cyprus problem as "a
long drawn out situation" and expressed his hope for a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that in the first half of the next year we
might be able to get them (President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash) to have talks on a
settlement," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
seized 37 percent of the island following a short-lived coup
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks aimed at reuniting the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal federal state have been held
on and off for the past 22 years, but so far no tangible
results have been achieved.

Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to overhaul its poverty alleviation
activities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 17th Session of the SAARC Council of Ministers

initiatives taken by the SAARC members in the last four years, the
problem of poverty remains as hard core as ever in the region,
According to Nepal's official news agency RSS.
</P>
<P>
Lohani said it may be appropriate for the council to consider
reconvening the independent South Asian Commission on Poverty
Alleviation (SACPA) to take stock of the implementation of the
SAARC Declaration on Poverty Eradication.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali foreign minister also told the session that Nepal
has prepared an approach paper for the study of a possible
quadrangle to include parts of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal
in the areas of cooperation in water resources, transport,
communications, energy and environment, trade, transit and
investment.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HK's Economy Is Picking Up, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economy is
recovering along the established locus of 5 percent a year and
this performance will sustain through 1997.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang made the statement while
addressing a dinner given in his honor by the Chinese
Manufacturers Association here This evening.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have estimated a GDP growth of 4.7 percent this
year. The recent quarterly growth profile signifies a healthy
reversal from the cycling downturn suffered since the early part
of last year."
</P>
<P>
There has been a steady revival in consumer spending, a
moderate growth in exports and investment, and an improved trade
balance in the third quarter, bringing GDP growth above the trend
level. "We reckon growth in the fourth quarter to be ever better,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said he is confident of the prosperity of Hong Kong's
economy as both the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic
Law guarantee that Hong Kong's economy will reserve the
separateness and distinctness while allowing Hong Kong to continue
to grow and thrive.
</P>
<P>
"It is ironic that not so long ago, many commentators predicted
a collapse in confidence in the final stage of transition. They
suggested that our economic growth would falter badly, the capital
would drain out, and that talents would move off massively
starting by around this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, share prices remain buoyant," he went on. "The
property market shows surging demand, pushing prices to record
levels which we must not let get out of hand."
</P>
<P>
The banking liquidity is high thanks to substantial inflows of
capital. And there is a wave of Hong Kong people returning from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Those who still stand in disbelief and hesitation, I would
quip, risk losing out to all others who grasp the surging trend,"
he said.

killing UNHCR staff. These are people who came from afar to save
others in a spirit of selfless devotion. This kind of incident
simply cannot be allowed to happen again."
</P>
<P>
However, the UNHCR said, it will continue its operations in the
neighboring republics of Daghestan, Ingushetia and North Ossetia
assisting persons displaced by the Chechnya conflict. It has asked
its field staff to upgrade security measures and instructed
personnel to stay clear from areas bordering the territory of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, coffins containing the bodies of the six ICRC
workers arrived here Wednesday night. ICRC President Cornelio
Sommaruga said at the airport that the organization would not give
up its aid work in Chechnya although it has suspended the work
after the attack.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Not Optimistic Over Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today said he was not optimistic over the stalled
Arab-Israeli peace process launched five years ago to end decades
of regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the statement at a press conference after briefing
President Hosni Mubarak on the outcome of his two-day visit to
France where he met with French President Jacques Chirac and
delivered him a message from Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat is due here Friday for consultations on the Mideast peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat embarked on his current European tour Tuesday to drum up
a stronger European role in the peace process. His stops include
Austria, Albania, Italy and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
Deploring that the Israeli settlement expansion policy would
lead the stalled peace process nowhere, he said "all parties are
pessimistic about the peace process and its future. This is an
international impression."
</P>
<P>
Switching to another topic, Moussa praised mounting
U.S. criticisms against Israeli settlement expansion activities in
occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. President Bill Clinton took a "good stand" in
denouncing the settlement policies as an "absolute" obstacle to
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the announcement because it clarifies the U.S. role
as a sponsor of peace, vis-a-vis the current Israeli government's
hindrances and illegal steps," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he conferred with his U.S. counterpart Warren
Christopher over the phone on the Jewish settlements and
unfavorable conditions of peace talks Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to comment on Israel's proposal to deploy
Egyptian and Jordanian forces in south Lebanon following an
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied border strip there.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also labeled as "nonsense" Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu's claim that Arabs were launching a
psychological warfare against Israel.
