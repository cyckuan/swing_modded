<HEADLINE> Nigerian Official Demands Truth Telling On Ogoni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Administrator of Rivers State,
South Nigeria, Lt.-Col. Dauda Komo, has again stressed the need
for foreign delegations visiting Ogoniland to present an accurate
and objective account of their findings to the world.
</P>
<P>
Komo was quoted today by the News Agency of Nigeria as making
the remark in Port Harcourt, capital of Rivers State, when a
14-member delegation from the United States was paying him a
courtesy visit after a visit to Ogoniland in the state.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation monitored last week's Zero-party local
government elections in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been stripped of its Commonwealth membership
following the execution of nine Ogoni activists for murder. The
issue has also triggered off sanctions from a few western
countries.
</P>
<P>
Although many foreign media organizations and other agencies
had visited the state on facts-finding missions about Ogoniland,
it was only when people were open-minded that the facts and truth
of the crisis would be properly appreciated, the Nigerian
administrator said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of distortions experienced so far, he noted, "lies do
not stand the test of time".
</P>
<P>
The administrator advised the American team to correlate their
views with the situation on the spot.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the U.S. delegation, Roy Innis, who is also the
National Chairman of the Congress of Racial Equity, promised to
correct the misinformation about the Ogoni crisis, as well as
present the facts of their findings to the world.
</P>
<P>
On the Zero-party election, Innis expressed satisfaction with
the response of Nigerians to the polls, saying that it was a
good beginning toward democratization.

</P>
<P>
Kalumba was quoted by Zambia's official News Agency as saying

girls infected with the virus was a result of increased sexual
activities with girls by male adults.

The official said the government, which was very worried about
these developments, planned to invite public debate on the issue.
</P>

Official reports said earlier that an estimated 500 people in

LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has expressed its support

federal government's commitment to the enthronement of democracy.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Ambassador to Nigeria, Numan Hazar, was quoted

European Union associate member and a democracy, supports efforts
at democratization by other countries.
</P>

"We believe democracy is a very long process, requiring a long

in a short time "as in our experience of over 50 years in
Turkey".
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a hastily prepared democracy would not be
beneficial, stating that Turkey believed in the sincerity and
commitment of the Sani Abacha administration to return Nigeria to
a civilian democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ambassador, while noting "we understand the

be patient with Nigeria and show understanding.

<HEADLINE> Number of Single Households Grows Fast in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of people living alone
in UK is set to rise from 6.8 million last year to 8 million by
the end of the century, according to a study published here today.
</P>
<P>
This would make single-person households the fastest-growing
group of all household types in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by Mintel, the market intelligence group,
says that single-person households made up 24 percent of all
households in 1985 and 28 percent last year, and by the year of
2000 the figure will have grown to 30 cent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the people who live alone are aged 65 (pension
age) or over, but non-pensioner groups have shown the highest rate
of growth in recent years, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
The rising divorce rate and the tendency towards marrying later
partly account for the trend among younger age groups, while
steadily increasing life expectancy has contributed to the growth
in numbers of older single-person households, according to the
study.

<HEADLINE> New York State Plans to Stop Investing in Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- New York State planned to stop
investing its pension funds in tobacco stocks to avoid risks as
the industry is increasingly under legal and political attacks.
</P>
<P>
The attacks on the industry have raised questions about the
risks of investing in tobacco companies, State Comptroller H. Carl
McCall was quoted by The New York Times as saying today.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the plan, McCall said, "My actions are intended
to prudently limit the fund's exposure to risk for the nearly one
million retirees and members of the fund."
</P>
<P>
The state's pension fund covers 850,000 current and retired
workers. It has invested 636 million U.S. dollars in the cigarette
makers of Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco and American Brands. Between
1985 and 1994, the fund earned 624 million dollars fron its
tobacco investments.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco companies are coming under pressures from
congressional scrutiny of industry practices to government bans on
smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
Anti-tobacco groups have been pressuring the state to divest
itself of tobacco holdings. They say that the state's profits from
tobacco investment pale in comparison to the 2.6 billion dollars
spent each year in New York to treat lung cancer, emphysema and
other smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the nation's fifth-largest cigarette maker, Liggett
Group, agreed, under a settlement of lawsuit, to pay 2.5 percent
of its profits every year for the next 25 years to five states,
Mississippi, Massachusetts, Florida, Louisiana and West Virginia,
to help them pay their Medicaid costs on patients with
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
The company also agreed to create a pool of 5 percent of its
income to pay any other states that seek Medicaid reimbursement.

</P>

European unification, the continent's defense deployment,
disarmament and security issues, as well as Balkan peace and
economic cooperation and the situation in the Caucasus.

to Chernomyrdin to visit Greece, while the Russian premier asked

<HEADLINE> Mandela To Pay "Courtesy Payment" To Ex-wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said today he would ask his lawyers to negotiate a
"courtesy payment" to his estranged wife Winnie.
</P>
<P>
"I have instructed my legal representative to negotiate an ex
gratia payment to her and the waiver of the costs granted to the
court in my favour," said Mandela in a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's request for divorce was granted on Tuesday by Judge
Frikkie Eloff at Johannesburg's Rand Supreme Court, bringing an
end to a 38-year marriage between the couple.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad the case is over and regret that my ex-wife could
not bring herself to negotiate an amicable settlement. It would
have saved us both and children much pain," said Mandela in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"I hope and trust that she will now be prepared to be
reasonable. It can only be to her benefit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wim Trengove, law of the president, declined to elaborate on
details of the payment.
</P>
<P>
Winnie and her lawyers failed to show up for a settlement
hearing at the court today that might have ended in the court
awarding her a portion of Mandela's estate.
</P>
<P>
Judge Eloff then dismissed her claim for half of the
president's estate unless she provided a good reason for her
absence from the court.

HARARE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Multi-Party Consultative
Conference (MPCC), a grouping of Zimbabwean opposition parties
today urged the ruling ZANU-PF government to convene a referendum
to discuss the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Austin Chakaodza, whose Front for Popular Democracy is a
member of the MPCC, told the Zimbabwean National New Agency that
the low turnout during the country's weekend elections was a
victory to the opposition parties which boycotted the elections.
</P>
<P>
The poor voter turnout with a 31 percent of the total
registered voters was a protest against the ''constitutional
state of affairs'' of Zimbabwe and ZANU-PF economic policies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
''When all is said and done, it is now quite clear that Mugabe
is now suffering from a legitimacy crisis. This crisis can only
be resolved by convening a national constitutional conference
which will then draft a new permanent democratic constitution,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Current president Mugabe got 92.7 percent of the total valid
votes in the March 16-17 presidential elections and became the
country's third executive president since its independence in

<P>
LUSAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba today directed all local authorities in the country to
formalize all modalities on the sale of council houses by the end

</P>
<P>
The president made the directive at a press briefing in the
northern city of Ndola at the end of his tour of council houses
in Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba said council houses should be sold to
individual sitting tenants only at affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
The government was determined to ensure success of the sale of
the council houses, he said, warning that any local civic leaders
who failed to cooperate in the exercise would be dealt with
sternly.
</P>
<P>
"I will not tolerate excuses from anyone. Those who are not
ready to cooperate should step aside," Chiluba stressed.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq reached the second
stage of the Asian Zone soccer's Olympic qualifying tournament as
a second place finisher in Group A after a 1-0 win over Oman
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was the second team to move into the final four following
the first Japan, who topped Group A with a goals advantage after
edging the United Arab Emirates 1-0 in the day's early match.
</P>
<P>
In the 62nd minute, Iraq's Oqhtan Drain scored the only goal on
an error from Oman's goalkeeper, who failed to touch a back pass
from its defender Adil Fayel Mukhaini.
</P>
<P>
Oman launched all-out attacks after conceding the goal, but its
efforts turned out fruitless in front of the Iraq's well-knit
defense.
</P>
<P>
The other two participating in the second stage round-robin
competition will be decided from Group B on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Puts Emphasis On Agriculture: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said today that his government is putting special emphasis on
agriculture, aiming at attaining self-sufficiency in crop and
livestock production.
</P>
<P>
President Moi was speaking at the Kenya Agricultural Research
Institute Headquarters (KARI) in Nairobi when he officially
opened the complex.
</P>
<P>
President Moi told the gathering that there is need to
intensify production by use of new and more efficient production
technologies developed through scientific institutions owing to
the fact that one fifth of the countries land mass is arable.//
</P>
<P>
The president said his government will continue to accord high
priority to research as one of the most important inputs required
for rapid development.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in Kenya, agriculture still remains the main
pillar of the economy, employing 80 percent of the labor force,
besides providing food and raw materials for local consumption,
industry and for export.
</P>
<P>
KARI was constructed with the financial support from the World
Bank and the government of Kenya at a cost of 125 million Kenya
Shillings (23 Kenya Shillings equal one US Dollar at the exchange
rate in 1991). Its construction started in May, 1991 and
completed this month. It was contracted by the General Company of
External Construction of Guangxi, China.
</P>
<P>
President Moi thanked the World Bank and other relevant donors
for the loans which financed the KARI complex.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked those who supervised its construction, saying
the 120 million Shillings aimed for the construction was well
utilized.

<HEADLINE> :e:xcl:96/03/20/16/53 eaed032004hke -- Pentagon: Bosnia Will Fragment Without Vast Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua)--The Pentagon has warned that
Bosnia would probably fragment after the withdrawal of U.S.-led
NATO peace implementation forces late this year if there is no
enormous international aid program to rebuild the country's
economy and political institutions.
</P>
<P>
The grim assessment was offered in a report prepared for the
U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee by the Pentagon's senior
intelligence analyst, Lieut. Gen. Patrick Hughes.
</P>
<P>
General Hughes, director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence
Agency, said that the strategic goals of the three warring parties
in the region "have not fundamentally changed" since the days of
the nearly four years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that tensions among Bosnian Muslems, Serbs and
Croats would probably grow in the months leading up to the NATO
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
If that is true, the Clinton administration might come under
intense pressure from U.S. NATO allies not to pull out 17,000
American ground troops by the end of December--a date promised by
U.S. President Bill Clinton when he decided to send the U.S.
troops to Bosnia despite strong objections from the
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has said that at least 5 billion U.S. dollars
are needed to rebuild the war-torn former Yugoslav republic in the
first two years. The Bosnian government even estimated that it
needs at least 12 billion U.S. dollars in its rebuilding efforts.
</P>
<P>
Carl Bildt, representative of the European Union for organizing
Bosnia's economic and political reconstruction, has complained
repeatedly in recent months that foreign governments have been
slow to make available the billions of U.S. dollars needed for
civilian reconstruction in the country.

<HEADLINE> Somalia's Atto Withdraws From Port Town Of Merca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The forces of Somalia's Osman
Hassan Ali (Atto) faction have completely withdrawn from the
coastal town of Merca today.
</P>
<P>
But the reason for the peaceful withdrawal is not yet
disclosed by the United Somali Congress of Somali National
Alliance (USC/SNA) of Osman Atto.
</P>
<P>
However, independent sources from Merca said the withdrawal is
part of a militia tactic after an overwhelming militia power has
been deployed in Merca and Shalambod by General Mohamed Farah
Aideed.
</P>
<P>
Merca and all surrounding battle fields of yesterday were
quiet this morning. It is not known where the forces have gone,
although unconfirmed reports said they came back to Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawing militiamen of Osman Atto left no militia
hardware behind, including three armed wagons they captured
during yesterday's fighting. More 13 people were killed and 21
others were wounded during the fighting which took place in
districts El-Jaalle, El-Ahmed, Shalambod and Merca.
</P>
<P>
The forces of Osman Atto stormed into Merca last Saturday
for unspecified reasons, however his rival General Aideed was
suspicious about the huge militia presence of Osman Atto in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Brigades of General Aideed's uniformed militiamen from Baidoa
were taking new strategic position along the road linking Afgoe
district to Merca.
</P>
<P>
There is no word from the government of General Aideed nor
from Osman Atto over the militia withdrawal from Merca.

<HEADLINE> European Workers Priced out of Jobs: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
accused here today his European Union (EU) partners of having
"priced their workers out of jobs".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a London conference on EU employment policy earlier
today, Major said: "Unemployment in Europe has been getting worse
for about 30 years. Over the past 20 years, for every job created
in Europe, the United States has created four."
</P>
<P>
"We should ask why," Major said, "the uncomfortable answer is
that Europe's politicians have quite simply priced their workers
out of jobs."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Britain, where the official jobless figure is
7.9 percent of the workforce, had more people in work and fewer
unemployed than any other European country.
</P>
<P>
The reason was that it was cheaper to employ people in Britain
than in France, Germany, Italy or Spain because of low non-wage
costs, Major added.
</P>
<P>
The British Prime Minister also attacked the minimum wage and
the EU Social Chapter, which is designed to set common employment
standards in the EU, as "a threat to jobs."
</P>
<P>
"The Social Chapter and minimum wage are economic handcuffs and
they are a guarantee of higher unemployment," Major said.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Table Tennis
Association (HKTTA) Wednesday firmly denied its top female players
Chai Po Wa and Chan Tan Lui are to retire after the Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the rumor, Yue Kwok Leung, chairman of the
HKTTA, said: "No, at least I've not heard from them, nor have I
received any formal application."
</P>
<P>
"As head of the HKTTA, I of course hope they two will continue
to train and compete as they have done in the many past years for
Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
There aren't many players of the caliber of the two in the
world, not to say in Hong Kong, Yue said.
</P>
<P>
In case the two retire in the near future, there could be some
kind of capability vacuum in Hong Kong's female players' ranks,
the HKTTA chief predicted.
</P>
<P>
"So I hope they will continue to contribute to Hong Kong as
they have excellently done in the past. And in so doing, they
could on the one hand help the younger players in the team mature
more rapidly, and, on the other, let others share their
experience," Yue said.
</P>
<P>
Chai, four-time women's singles champion at commonwealth games
and ranked fourth in the world last year, could not be reached
for comment.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Denies Agreement with Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today denied the existence of any
agreement between the PNA and Hamas to allow the Islamic
Resistance Movement to conduct terrorist attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks at a meeting held in the Gaza Strip
today with Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid and Immigrant
Absorption Minister Yael Tsaban.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the dialogues with Hamas held in Cairo
several months ago, he had ruled out allowing attacks against
Israel both from inside and outside the Palestinian autonomous
areas.
</P>
<P>
Sarid told Arafat that the closure on the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip will continue at this time because there are still
warnings of attacks, but Israel is making efforts to ease the
closure further.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed a total closure on the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip following a series of suicide bombing attacks earlier this
month conducted by Hamas, which left more than 60 dead and over
150 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been pressing Arafat and the PNA to crack down the
extremist Islamic groups operating in the Palestinian autonomous
areas and arrest the leaders of Izzadin Kassam, the military wing
of Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had outlawed the Izzadin Kassam and other military
organizations, and the Palestinian police had arrested dozens of
Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists, in an effort to combat terror.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference after today's meeting, Sarid told
reporters that Arafat has asked him to report to Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres on several undisclosed measures taken by
the PNA against terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
Sarid expressed satisfactions from what he had heard from the
PNA president during their meeting, adding "We believe the PNA is
doing now its utmost to combat terror and terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed that he would continue cooperation with Israel
to move forward the peace process, saying "we will continue this
mission (of peace), despite of what we are suffering, because
peace is not only a Palestinian need, but an international need."
</P>
<P>
Israel eased aspects of the three-week-long closure over the
past few days, allowing foodstuffs into Gaza and Palestinians
workers to go back to their jobs in the joint Erez industrial zone
between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army also lifted a curfew imposed on Palestinian
towns and villages, allowing Palestinians to move freely in the
West Bank, and Palestinian goods now can proceed under Israeli
army's escort from Gaza to the Ashdod port for export.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian workers are still barred from entering
Israel due to the closure, from which the PNA estimates losses at
2 to 3 million U.S. dollars a day from salaries alone, and about
the same in loss of trade.

<HEADLINE> Jobs and Wages in Decline among the Young in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Young people in Britain are
financially worse off and finding it much harder to obtain work
than they did 10 years ago, according to a report published
Tuesday by the British Youth Council (BYC).
</P>
<P>
The report challenges the view that young people have an easy
life and claims that they are finding themselves classed as one of
society's lowest priorities.
</P>
<P>
It says young people make up a disproportionate number of the
unemployed. The gap between their wages and average earnings is
growing wider and they have fewer benefits.
</P>
<P>
Among 16 to 24-year-olds, unemployment is almost double the
national average, 15.4 percent compared with 8.5 percent. Today
young people make up 17 percent of the workforce compared with 23
percent in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Income among the lowest-paid young people has gone down in
relative terms. Of those aged between 16 and 24, 458,000 earn 2.50
pounds (3.70 U.S. dollars) an hour or less.
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers are also becoming disenfranchised: almost
one in five younger than 24 is not on the electoral register.
</P>
<P>
The report adds that over the last 10 years the benefits'
safety net for young people has been eroded, with cuts in student
grants and in income support.
</P>
<P>
The BYC is calling for a legal framework for young people's
rights and policies to protect their interests.
</P>
<P>
Diana Moore, the council chairman, said: "The gap between
society's expectation of young people and their own experiences is
getting wider."
</P>
<P>
"Many are forced to return home, to undergo longer periods of
financial dependency on their families, to struggle on lower wages
and to cope with real hardship. You are expected to stand on your
own two feet but that is becoming harder and harder," she added.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Coach Slaps Rugby Rule Change in HK Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The coach of the New Zealand
team for next week's Cathay Pacific/Hong Kong Bank Sevens
international rugby tournament here criticized the rule change
which was introduced into the tournament to speed up the play.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, the team will have scored a try re-starts
play. Gordon Tiejens is concerned that the new rule might make
his team's bid for a successful title defense all the more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
The tournament is slated here for March 29-31.
</P>
<P>
Tiejens said that senior personnel and officials of teams
competing in last weekend's Fiji Sevens were also unhappy with the
 rule change.
</P>
<P>
"It's their tournament, but how would you feel if you hit the
lead against Fiji late in the final and then have to kick the ball
 astraight to them at the re-start?" Tiejens was quoted by a news
agency reporter as saying in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The change was believed to have won strong support from the
Hong Kong coach George Simpkin.
</P>
<P>
Sevens officials also believe the rule change will give the
weaker teams opportunities of winning possession.
</P>
<P>
Tournament director and Hong Kong Rugby Football Union
secretary Peter Else said that he did not receive Tiejens'
argument.
</P>
<P>
Else turned down the suggestions that the new rule could lead
to time wasting from teams who take the lead later in a game.

<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Vanguard and the Nanjing
Army, third and fifth place last season, failed to defend their
Division A spots in the Chinese Basketball League after losing
their last games on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Vanguard lost its playoff match to the Air Force 67-75
after trailing 36-37 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
The relegation put an end of the Vanguard's miserable season,
in which it had picked up only one victory.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing Army followed the Vanguard' suit after dropping to
the Jiangsu squad 93-102 in a thrilling overtime game after
drawing 83-83 during the regular time.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu suffered a first-leg defeat 75-79 last Wednesday to the
Nanjing Army and will play against the Air Force for ninth place.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's national Hu Weidong hit a game-high 44 points
including six 3-pointers. The Nanjing Army's top scorer was Xiao
Weiguo, who sunk 32 points and added a game-high 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the league playoffs Wednesday, the Zhejiang
Zhongxin was edged out by the visiting Jinan Army 77-78 but it
took the aggregate win with points advantage from the first leg
victory 74-66.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongxin will fight for the fifth place against Shandong,
who nipped the Shenyang Army in an aggregate last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Army and Jinan Army will meet each other to vie
for the seventh place.

information increased by over 300 percent between 1993 and 1995,
according to a latest survey of 325 U.S. corporations.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released here on Wednesday, was conducted by the
Arlington-based American Society for Industrial Security. It was
supported by U.S. National Counterintelligence Center, the U.S.
government counterspy group.
</P>
<P>
The report blamed company insiders for almost three-quarters of
all data losses.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the survey, who were not identified by name,
included companies with 4.1 million workers in the United States
and 350,000 employees based overseas. The companies accounted for
some 610 billion U.S. dollars in revenues.
</P>
<P>
"Losses of strategic plans, research and development, and
manufacturing process information accounted for over 60 percent of
the financial losses," said Dan Swartwood, coauthor of a report on
the survey results.
</P>
<P>
Swartwood stressed that protection such data should be a top
priority.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the impact of 193 losses could be valued
at 5.1 billion U.S. dollars. Potential losses for all U.S. industry
could amount to 63 billion U.S. dollars fro the period surveyed
from 1993 through July of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Appointment of Judges Challenged in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Pakistan
in a verdict today bound the government to have effective
consultation with chief justices in appointing judges of the
supreme and high courts.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in its ruling also asked the government to
remove the ad hoc chief justices appointed earlier in three of the
four provinces in the country.
</P>
<P>
A full bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice
Sajjad Ali Shah, announced the judgement through a 12-page short
order after hearing the case filed by a lawyer named Habid Al
Khairi challenging the appointment of acting chief justices and ad
hoc judges by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government was represented by Attorney General Qazi
Mohammed Jameel, Yahya Bukhtiar and Senator Aitezaz Ahsan while
the petitioner was represented by himself.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, judges are appointed by the president under
recommendation of the government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, alleging that the judges were appointed by the
government on political basis, today welcomed the ruling of the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Only one day before the ruling, the Benazir Bhutto government
confirmed the appointment of 17 judges in the provinces of Punjab
and Sindh.

<HEADLINE> US Team Looks to Better Showing at HK Sevens Rugby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The coach of the United States
team, the Eagles, predicted a better showing by his team at the
Cathay Pacific/Hong Kong Bank International Rugby Sevens
tournament slated for later this month here.
</P>
<P>
The Eagles is the first of the 24 participating teams to have
arrived for the three-day event, with a determination this year to
"reach their potential".
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Hong Kong Chinese Bank, the Americans arrived
here Tuesday night, about one week earlier than others.
</P>
<P>
With its players spread wide in the United States, the team had
only gathered together one week before leaving for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Eagles came to get the players used to the venue and host
two rugby clinics for school students and other kids.
</P>
<P>
The US team's last two appearances in the Hong Kong Sevens have
been what the team described as "somewhat frustrating affairs". It
lost to South Korea in the Plate final match and last year
Argentina bounced them from the Plate quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Sensing the narrow margin of past results, second-year coach
Mike Saunders had chosen a veteran outfit to increase its winning
hope.
</P>
<P>
The ten-men squad's aim is to win the Plate Championship, which
it won in 1986 and 1988, or a berth in the Cup playoffs, which it
achieved in 1987.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of next year's 7s World Cup, Hong Kong
organizers have modified the tournament's traditional
format. Instead of eight pools of three teams, there will be six
pools of four. Each pool winner and two wild cards will advance to
the Cup championship, and the next eight teams will go into the
Plate championship.
</P>
<P>
Grouped with South Africa, Papua New Guinea and archrival
Canada, the US are determined first to win two or even all three
of their pool matches.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have an excellent chance of getting out of our
pool," said Saunders.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very experienced side, and I think that's really
going to be a factor this year," he added.

<HEADLINE> Poorest Countries to Receive 22 billion US dollars  from World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of more than 30
donor countries have agreed on new funding for the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank Affiliate which is
the main source of development financing for the world's poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank press release issued here, donors
meeting in Tokyo today endorsed a package which will allow
concessional lending of 22 billion US dollars to poor countries.
</P>
<P>
New contributions from donor countries to this package should
total about 11 billion US dollars, with the rest coming mainly
from past donor contributions, repayments of IDA credits and
contributions from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"IDA is the world's most important channel for providing
concessional financing to the low-income developing countries,"
the donor representatives, known as the IDA Deputies, asserted.
</P>
<P>
"Its beneficiaries are the people of the 78 poorest countries,
which have a total population of more than 3 billion," they added.
</P>
<P>
The donor representatives reaffirmed IDA's special commitment
to Africa within its overarching objective of poverty reduction,
noting that IDA "embodies the commitment of the richer countries
to foster economic growth and better living conditions in the
world's poorest countries."
</P>
<P>
"In the face of tough budgetary constraints in many donor
countries, this agreement is a vital endorsement of shared
responsibility and multilateral action to help the world's poorest
people," said Sven Sandstrom, the World Bank's Managing Director
who has chaired the IDA negotiations over the past 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The three-year package begins with a one-year interim fund of
about 3 billion dollars running from July 1996, with
decision-making and procurement limited to contributing donors and
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States will not contribute to the interim fund. It
is instead undertaking to pay 934 million dollars remaining due to
fulfill its commitment to IDA's Tenth Replenishment, which ends in
June this year.
</P>
<P>
In each of the two subsequent years, starting mid-1997, all IDA
donors will contribute about 4 billion dollars to the Eleventh
Replenishment of IDA.
</P>
<P>
"It represents an exceptional effort by donors to ensure that
IDA financing for poor countries' development can continue without
interruption," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mission Flies to Settle Russian-U.S. "Chicken War" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A Russian mission flew to
Washington today to try to end the month-long "chicken war" with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
A proposal on tougher hygiene standards on poultry imported
from the U.S. will be one of the topics on the agenda at a meeting
with U.S. officials, Vyacheslav Avilov, Russia's chief veterinary
inspector, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Problems connected with the fulfilment by the U.S. side of
veterinary certificate requirements should also be discussed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow stopped issuing licenses to U.S. poultry importers on
February 16, saying U.S. birds failed to meet new stringent
Russian hygiene guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Agriculture Ministry had also threatened to ban
chicken imports from the United States from March 16 unless the
U.S. side could meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has so far not issued new permits to import
U.S. poultry into Russia as these products do not comply with the
requirements of veterinary certificates agreed upon with the
U.S. State Veterinary Service in the summer 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, chicken legs are still being imported under the
earlier permits, but deliveries are thoroughly checked by Russian
experts to prevent the import of substandard products.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a major market for U.S. poultry, worth some 500
million U.S. dollars a year. U.S. chicken exports are estimated to
account for more than half the Russian market.

JAKARTA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A total of 89 Indonesian people
involved in Monday's riot in Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya, have
been arrested so far, according to an Antara report today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources at the Jayapura police office as
saying that 20 of the 89 have masterminded the riot.
</P>
<P>
Irian Jaya military spokesman Lt. Col. Maulud Hidayat said that
if found guilty, they will be prosecuted in line with existing
laws.
</P>
<P>
The riot began Monday when the body of separatist leader Thomas
Wapai Wainggai arrived in Jayapura for burial. He died on March
12 while serving a jail team in Jakarta for subversion.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of student and youth got angry because their request
of paying last respect to Wainggai was not accepted and his dead
body was rushed to his hometown, Abepura.
</P>
<P>
They torched a market, looted shops, destroyed 24 cars, 15
motorcycles and burned houses, shops and buildings in the city.
</P>
<P>
In the riot, four people including a member of the Indonesian
Armed Forces (ABRI) died.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lake Silt Sheds Light on Summer Palace Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Lake silt dormant for about one
and half centuries has yielded evidence about the burning of the
Summer Palace here by British and French troops in 1860.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists revealed this at a press conference today
to publicize the results of a five-year study of the silt at the
bottom of Kunming Lake in the grounds of the palace.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found a layer of silt containing large numbers
of burned objects and ashes when they analyzed different layers of
silt in order to trace climatic and environmental changes in the
past century, said Huang Chengyan, head of a team in charge of the
survey.
</P>
<P>
They concluded that a big fire broke out around the lake
sometime during the period 1850-1910, and the ashes were deposited
as silt at the bottom of the lake.
</P>
<P>
The only record of a fire there dates from October 1860, when the
invading allied British and French forces burned gardens around
the Western Hills, including the Summer Palace and Yuan Ming Yuan, or
the Old Summer Palace, said Huang, a research fellow of the Ministry
of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
Through analyzing the silt layers and unearthing ancient tombs
from the bed of the lake, the geologists confirmed that the lake
was formed about 3,500 years ago, though the Summer Palace, a
former imperial garden of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), was built
in 1750.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Bid to Resolve Duma Conflict Over Soviet Union Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today sent a draft federal law to the State Duma to try and remove
the uncertainty over last week's resolutions by the lower house to
annul the 1991 agreements which broke up the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Communist Duma Speaker Gennady Seloznyov,
Yeltsin asked the lower house to consider the new law "On
ensuring stability of the legal system of the Russian Federation
and confirming Russia's international commitments".
</P>
<P>
The law, if passed, would give the resolutions only political,
not legal, and thus potentially explosive, significance.
</P>
<P>
The president isn't asking the Duma to revoke its resolutions,
but wants to eliminate the uncertainty created by the resolutions
which led to uproar both in Russia and throughout the world, said
a source who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Duma adopted two resolutions denouncing the
1991 Belovezhye agreements which replaced the Soviet Union with
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The agreements were
signed by Russian President Yeltsin and the then leaders of Ukraine
and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Yeltsin declared that those resolutions were
"actually designed to create a situation of political and legal
impasse in Russia" and that they call into doubt the legitimacy
of bodies of state authority including the present Duma.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bitter Lesson from Manila Disco Fire (By Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- What lesson can be drawn from the
worst disco tragedy in the Philippines on early Tuesday morning?
</P>
<P>
At least 150 people were killed in a fire that razed the
"Ozone" disco in Quezon city, metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
The death toll from the disaster was also the third highest in
night club fires over the world in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The worst was the coconut grove fire in Boston of the United
States, on November 28, 1942, in which 491 people were burned to
death.
</P>
<P>
The second worst was in 1977 in Southgate, Kentucky of the
United States, where 164 people died.
</P>
<P>
Arson experts said that the disco fire in Quezon city was
caused by faulty electrical wirings and installation deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
But a major cause could be the narrow entrance and lack of exit
doors in case of fire and other emergencies, they added.
</P>
<P>
It was also found that the exit doors opened inwards instead of
outwards, trapping a lot of the victims.
</P>
<P>
That can only mean gross negligence in the endorsement of fire
prevention regulations and laxity in the issuance of the necessary
permits, said Manila Bulletin, a local leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the building code requires commercial and
industrial establishments, particularly high-rise buildings, to
provide working fire escapes and an adequate number of exits or
public safety facilities.
</P>
<P>
There should be inclines, not stairs, for the disabled or those
who must use wheelchair. Otherwise, the buildings should not be
cleared for occupancy.
</P>
<P>
Any violation of the building code should be sufficient to send
all the owners, the architects and the engineers to jail for the
offense, which can indeed be very costly in terms of life, the
experts said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine journal, another leading local newspaper, said
today in an editorial, "The ozone disco fire is a wake-up call for
all citizens to see to it that all types of buildings, especially
public ones like shopping malls, movie houses and hotels are
equipped with fire escapes and other safety devices."
</P>
<P>
"And we must demand that firefighting facilities/equipment like
extinguishers, water hoses or automatic sprinklers must be found
in strategic places of the building to help insure public safety,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
"It is our collective duty," the Philippine journal stressed.

SHANGHAI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Fujian Industrial Bank today
opened a branch in this, China's largest city under the approval
by the People's Bank of China, China's central bank.
</P>
<P>
It is the first bank from another Chinese area to set up a

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Police Arrest Four for Heroin Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Police in southwest China's
Yunnan Province have confiscated 62.2 kg of heroin and arrested
four people, including two Hong Kong residents, local police
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police at Simao, near the borders with Myanmar and Laos, found
the heroin in the gas tank of a truck being driven across the
border, and arrested the driver.
</P>
<P>
The police seized the two Hong Kong residents and a local
resident who were said to be awaiting the shipment in Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The police have determined the heroin was produced by the Khun
Sa group in the "Golden Triangle", where Laos, Myanmar and
Thailand meet.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese drug dealers are still in contact with the Khun Sa
group, although it collapsed after Khun Sa's troops surrendered to
the Myanmar government in January this year, in attempt to smuggle
drugs through China, the police said.
</P>
<P>
China's border police seized 1,431 kg of opium, 362 kg of "ice"
and 508 kg of heroin last year, and arrested 1,427 drug dealers,
according to a report Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Japan today signed
agreements to expand Russian-Japanese trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed by Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister
Oleg Soskovets and visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko
Ikeda.
</P>
<P>
Soskovets and Ikeda are co-chairmen of the inter-governmental
commission for trade and economic relations, which held its first
meeting in Moscow's President Hotel earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Talks focused on the "Hashimoto plan," Japan's program to help
Russia's reforms, announced in Tokyo in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
The commission also discussed the development of a legislative
framework for attracting Japanese investment and prospects for
bilateral trade and economic cooperation primarily in the far east
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Ikeda held separate talks with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told the Japanese Minister that "Russia welcomes an
active political dialogue with Japan."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Ikeda discussed bilateral relations, the
forthcoming visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and
preparations for the planned G-8 April summit in Moscow on nuclear
security.
</P>
<P>
During his wide-ranging talks with Ikeda, which included
fishing disputes off the South Kuril islands, Primakov said
"Russia is interested in the development of relations with Japan
along all lines, and no obstacles must impede the development,"
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A number of international issues were also discussed,
primarily the situation in the Asia-Pacific region.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia and NATO today signed a
memorandum of cooperation to deal with civil emergencies, on the
second day of NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana's visit to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who began his two-day official visit on Tuesday, told a
news conference that NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)
wants to build a special relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for the two sides to continue dialogue and
expand bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Solana's visit to Moscow, the first by a NATO chief in four
years, coincides with a bitter row between the Russian
administration and parliament over a resolution passed by the
State Duma (the lower house of parliament) last Friday
denouncing the 1991 Belovezhskaya Pushcha agreement which formally
dissolved the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Monday that the Duma's
decision "gives the proponents of NATO (eastward) expansion
additional arguments in their favor." Moscow strongly opposes
NATO's expansion eastward to take in former Soviet-bloc countries,
saying it threatens Russia's security.
</P>
<P>
Solana's trip is seen as a move to defuse the row between
Russia and NATO over the expansion issue.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Solana is expected to meet with Primakov, the
speakers of both houses of parliament, Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev and President Boris Yeltsin.

mee032008hke -- Ten Israeli Soldiers Killed or Wounded in
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah Suicide Attack
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 10 Israeli soldiers were
killed or wounded today in a suicide attack carried out by a
militant of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in an
Israeli-occupied enclave in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that the Hezbollah
guerrilla carried out the suicide attack at an Israeli army convoy
near Adaiseh town in Marjayoun area.
</P>
<P>
They said that the suicide bomber rushed into the Israeli
convoy and blew himself up at 2:20 p.m. (12:25 GMT), killing or
wounding 10 Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that a senior Israeli officer, probably the
northern command chief, was in the convoy.
</P>
<P>
This was the first suicide attack against the Israelis in
Lebanon in the past 11 months.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bombing took place amid an tension in south
Lebanon following repeated Israeli threats and reports of Israeli
reinforcements in the so-called "security zone" carved by Israel
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The attack bore a striking resemblance to a spate of suicide
bombings in Israel which killed 62 people, including the four
bombers, over a nine-day period starting February 25.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio did not give a word on the suicide attack in its
news broadcast at 4:30 p.m. (14:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Another bomb also blasted in Bint Jbail in the central sector
of the buffer zone this morning, wounding at least one person.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Israeli client militia in south Lebanon said
that one local policeman was injured by the blast of the bomb,
which was planted at a police station, targeting an office of the
South Lebanon Army militia.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio today quoted Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi
Beilin as saying that Israeli would not give up a military choice
in south Lebanon if it sees that necessary.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Tells Foreign Banks to Register Branches in Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks in Shanghai must
register their branches in the Pudong New Area in the future, Mao
Yingliang, head of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of
China, said here today.
</P>
<P>
This is an important step to build Shanghai into an
international financial center and will step up the financial
functions of Pudong, he said at a conference on Shanghai-based
foreign-funded financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
As foreign financial organizations are keen to set up more
branches in China, the People's Bank of China, the country's
central bank, has allowed foreign banks to set up branches and
subsidiaries in Shanghai, south China's Guangzhou and north
China's Tianjin and Dalian cities.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China has
stipulated that new branches of foreign banks must be opened in
Pudong New Area, or the banks can move their headquarters formerly
registered in Puxi to Pudong and change their old main branches
into sub-branches.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40 foreign-funded financial organizations in Shanghai
have welcomed the move. Leading officials of some banks said that
the change will not affect their businesses.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year 38 foreign-funded financial
organizations from 14 countries and regions opened business in
Shanghai, accounting for 27.7 percent of the total of such bodies
in China. The financial organizations include banks, securities
firms, insurance firms, intermediary and credit card businesses
and research institutes.
</P>
<P>
The financial organizations in Shanghai reported over nine
billion US dollars-worth of total assets at the end of last year,
accounting for 45 percent of the total of foreign-funded financial
institutions in China. Their profits grew by 55 percent over the
previous year.

Pangalos called the results of his visit as "very positive" and
promised to submit an agreement on Russian-EU partnership and
cooperation to the next EU Council of Ministers for ratification.
</P>
<P>
However, the Greek Minister was cautious about the eastward
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which,
he said, "will be, directly or indirectly, of anti-Russian
character."

Pangalos met with his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov on
arrival in Moscow this Monday.

BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Although the majority of the
Chinese people are already aware of the severe environmental
problems in China, their overall environmental awareness needs
further improving, according to the conclusion of a survey made
public here today.
</P>
<P>
The ten-month survey was carried out by the China Environmental
Protection Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The result showed that although the majority of the Chinese
people are aware of the concept of "environmental protection",
their level of understanding is very low and they do not know much
about ways to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the people are aware of the severeness of the
environmental problems in China. As many as 69.9 percent of the
4,000 people polled considered the problems "severe" or "very
severe", but did not know that the problems are somewhat under
control in some regions but worsening on the whole.
</P>
<P>
The public think that the top three problems which need
attention are water, air and rubbish pollution.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Soong Ching Ling Foundation
and Northwest Airlines of the US, the fourth-largest airline in
the world, are jointly sponsoring a children's coloring
competition, "Bringing China and the United States Closer" here
from March 15 to April 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The event is being held to welcome the opening of the new
nonstop flights between China and the United States by Northwest,
which will be inaugurated on May 3, 1996, said Burt Pinoli,
Northwest's general manager in China, here today.
</P>
<P>
The contest signifies the mutual desire to establish more
flights between China and the US in order to strengthen the
economic and cultural links between both countries. And all
children in Beijing can enter the competition.
</P>
<P>
All winning drawings will be exhibited at the Soong Ching Ling
Foundation's head office here, and will be exhibited on a large
backdrop carrying the Northwest Airlines logo.
</P>
<P>
The backdrop will then tour different American cities to
highlight the cooperation to a wider audience, which is intended
to strengthen the friendship between Chinese and American children
and to promote understanding between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On May 3, 1996 Northwest will launch a thrice-weekly service
between Beijing and Detroit, Michigan. The airline will then will
be the only US airline offering a nonstop flight to and from
China. The start of the service will increase the airline's weekly
flights between China and the US from four to seven.
</P>
<P>
Northwest began its Oriental flights -- from Seattle to
Shanghai -- in 1947, but had to suspend them in 1949. In 1984
Northwest restarted its Shanghai service and it added Beijing to
its Asian route network in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Now it has two offices in China, one in Beijing, and the other
in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Urges Harsh Crack-Down On Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The battle against smuggling must
be viewed from the perspective of national security, and
governments at all levels must attach more importance to and
strengthen the work, Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a national conference on anti-smuggling
work, which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Great efforts have been made to fight smuggling, and marked
achievements have been scored over the past few years, he said,
adding, however, that the situation remains severe in some areas,
although the situation is turning for the better in most areas.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that, owing to rampant trafficking activities,
overseas commodities have rushed into China through illegal
channels, causing great losses in customs duties, damaging the
national interests, damaging the social environment and the fair
and openly competitive market order, adding to the difficulties in
enterprise reform and severely threatening the development of
China's national industry.
</P>
<P>
"Smuggling is eroding people's morale, corrupting the
general mood of society and fostering corruption," he said. "We
must face the problem steadfastly. Smuggling and corruption are
damaging the image of the Communist Party and the government among
the people, undermining the flesh-and-blood relations between the
people and us and affecting the Party's authority in the eyes of
the people."
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the current smuggling activities are connected
with local interests of some localities and departments.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the crackdown on smuggling is not only an
economic struggle but also a serious political one. It is an
important aspect of the fight against corruption and an important
part of the building of the Party and political power in the new
era.

<HEADLINE> State Council Calls for More Anti-Drought Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council today held
a tele-conference here, urging drought-stricken areas in the
northern part of the country to take effective measures to fight
against drought and to ensure successful spring plowing.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, precipitation in the northern part of China
has been 50 to 90 percent less than in previous years. In some
areas not a single drop of water was seen. The drought situation is
getting more and more severe, and has seriously affected spring
ploughing.
</P>
<P>
According to Jiang Chunyun, vice-premier of the State Council,
the government has put great stress on drought relief work. But he
pointed out that there are still some local government officials
and farmers who do not realize the seriousness of the spring
drought. The price of such production materials as chemical
fertilizers and diesel fuel is high, while some areas have seen
shortages of electricity and drought-relief funds, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged farmers to fully utilize all water resources and
water-control facilities to serve the drought relief work.
</P>
<P>
At present, 21,000 water-control facilities are in operation,
and water from 980,000 wells is being pumped in drought-stricken
areas, while 73 million mu of land has been irrigated and 250
million mu of land has been re-fertilized.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also encouraged the spreading of the technology of
water-saving irrigation and dry-crop planting.
</P>
<P>
He called for the stimulation of farmers' initiatives and the
control of farming materials prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
will replace the conventional administrative areas with the
establishment of three economic regions backed with central
cities, ports and transport facilities, a local leader said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xueyuan, the provincial governor, said that although
Zhejiang's economy has increased rapidly over the past 17 years
since China's reform and opening up to the outside world, its
overall economic strength is uneven partly due to its irrational
patterns.
</P>
<P>
The three economic regions are required to form industrial
setups in line with local conditions and the market needs.
</P>
<P>
According to plan, one of the regions in northeastern Zhejiang
will be linked by the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo expressway which is
 under construction.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to take the advantage of close to Pudong,
China's largest economic and technology zone in Shanghai, to
absorb more advanced technology and open wider, and to develop
high-tech industries such as machinery, electronics,
petro-chemicals and new materials.
</P>
<P>
Another one in southeastern Zhejiang headed by Wenzhou and
Taizhou cities will focus on developing power, machinery, medicine
and domestic electric appliances as well as petro-chemical
industry.
</P>
<P>
The third one covering the rest of the province will develop
agriculture and non-metal minerals, light and textile industries,
medicine, building materials and chemicals.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Twelve people died and
another 12 were hospitalized after eating poisonous sea-turtle
meat, in Pemba South region, Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Pemba said today this is the second turtle meat-
eating accident in Pemba within less than 10 days after six
children died and 11 others injured after eating poisonous
sea-turtles in Pemba North region.
</P>
<P>
The regional medical officer, Hassan Ameir, told newsmen by

<HEADLINE> HK Researchers to Study Cause of Porpoise Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong scientists are
preparing to carry out research into finless porpoises after a
spate of deaths among the endangered species, according to today's
Eastern Express.
</P>
<P>
The local English newspaper reported that another porpoise was
washed up dead yesterday in Hong Kong waters, bringing to 10 the
total number of such deaths this year, compared to seven for the
whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
Local researchers are mystified as to the cause of death, which
has been linked to lung parasites found in many carcasses.
</P>
<P>
The Marine Mammal Conservation Working Group, a
government-chaired committee focusing on Chinese white dolphins,
has proposed research into the species, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Like the Chinese white dolphin, the finless porpoise is listed
in appendix one of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna.
</P>
<P>
So far little is known about the jet-black meter-long finless
porpoise which inhabits the waters off Hong Kong. Unlike the
Chinese white dolphin, now the focus of research, the finless
porpoise has never been studied.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Fisheries Department has secured four
million HK dollars for a further two-year study on the Chinese
white dolphins and is looking for funding for the porpoise
research, either from the government or private
organizations.

<HEADLINE> China's Grain Growing Area to Expand By One Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China's grain growing area will
expand by 1.1 million hectares to 110.95 million ha this year, up
by one percent compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
Grain growing areas in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region are expected to grow by the biggest margin, a
rise of 4.5 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
But the country's cotton growing area is to decrease by 0.5
percent, according to a sample survey by the State Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau questioned 48,000 rural households recently and
found that the confidence of farmers about grain growing has
become stronger.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that grain growing areas in Gansu, Inner
Mongolia, Beijing and Liaoning saw slight decreases in grain
growing areas, but the rest of the provinces all saw rises in the
growing area.
</P>
<P>
Last year, provincial governors were charged with direct
responsibility for grain production for their own provinces, and
the measure has helped improve the external environment for grain
production markedly, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that farmers' enthusiasm has waned slightly
for cotton production.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to see its cotton growing area diminish by
25,000 ha, or 0.5 percent to 5.46 million ha. this year.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Hubei and Henan
provinces will expand their cotton growing areas despite the
decreases in Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Statistics Bureau said that the total
cotton output will remain largely the same as last year because
production is relatively higher in those provinces where cotton
growing areas are expanding, compensating for the effect of
decreased growing areas in other provinces.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that growing areas of oil-bearing crops is to
be reduced by 120,000 ha from last year, or a slip of 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total growing area for tobacco is going to
expand by 20 percent over last year, an increase of 300,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
The growing area for medicinal herbs is expected to enlarge by
30,000 ha over 1995, an increase of 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growing area for sugar crops will remain the same as last
year. While sugar cane areas are going to expand by 90,000 ha in
the southern part of the country, sugar beet growing areas are
expected to be reduced by a similar size of area.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the growing area for vegetables is to
increase by 460,000 ha, and that for melons, an extra 40,000
ha.will be added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Multilateral agencies will likely
shift more funding for socially-oriented projects in the future,
visiting US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said today.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the United States has been strongly
advocating that the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and
other institutions move away from vast projects which can be
financed by private financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin cited the need to clarify how money for social
and environmental projects is being used.
</P>
<P>
Multilateral institutions are facing budgetary constraints,
necessitating strict selection of projects to finance.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank, for instance, is faced with the
challenge of replenishing the concessional Asian development fund.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the trend is towards shrinking total concessional
resources for development assistance.
</P>
<P>
The US secretary arrived here Tuesday after attending the APEC
(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) financial ministers'
conference in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Lee Teen-hui Criticized for Self-Contradictory Statements (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui put the blame for "Taiwan independence" on the
Chinese Communist Party, saying in a sympathetic way that
youngsters in Taiwan who advocate "independence of Taiwan" are
pitiful, but that it was the Chinese Communist Party that got them
to do so.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about "Taiwan Independence" forces
raised by a journalist on September 19, 1991, Lee said the issue
was a tough thing to deal with because he could not punish
speeches advocating "Taiwan independence".
</P>
<P>
Lee's appearance to have pledged to punish those favoring
"Taiwan independence" in strict accordance with the law became one
of oozing tenderness toward people supporting "Taiwan
independence", the article said.
</P>
<P>
He even invited those who favor "Taiwan independence" to
participate in the "National Unification Council", saying that it
was important that different opinions not be excluded.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all political parties (referring of
course to the Democratic Progress Party, which favors
"independence of Taiwan") would have a chance to take part in the
council.
</P>
<P>
Inviting divisive people to the council would be tantamount to
inviting a fox to a seminar discussing security for chickens, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
Lee regards those favoring splittism as guests of honor and has
become their intimate friend. No wonder Peng Ming-min, the
so-called godfather of "Taiwan independence", blamed Lee Teng-hui
for copying his ideas.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that since Lee agrees with him completely, Lee should
vote for Peng in the "presidential election". It is easy to see
that Lee Teng-hui follows the same political view as Peng
Ming-min, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The image of Lee's adhering to one China and dealing with
"Taiwan independence " in strict accordance with the law has
vanished, while that of the man supporting "Two Chinas" or "One
China, One Taiwan" in collusion with divisive people is
emerging. The former image is false and the latter is real, coming
out of his words and deeds, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
If Lee wants to change his image in the minds of the people, he
should convince them by giving up "Two Chinas" or "One China, one
Taiwan" instead of trying to defend himself with words, the
article concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
Does he no longer mention only one China because he is afraid
of falling into the Chinese Communist Party's "trap"? The answer
can be found in his attitude on "Taiwan independence," the article
said.
</P>
<P>
"One's attitude on 'Taiwan independence' serves as a touchstone
in judging whether one sticks to the one-China principle," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on February 22, 1988, Lee
declared: "According to law, 'Taiwan independence' as it is
currently advocated is illegal," and "'Taiwan independence'
itself cannot exist internationally or in China, and more
particularly, the people do not support it."
</P>
<P>
In July, he said, "With regard to the 'Taiwan independence'
proposition of a small number of people, the government will never
agree from the standpoint of defending the country and people,"
and "The proposition of 'Taiwan independence' is utterly harmful
to the 20 million compatriots in Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
On December 23, 1989, he said, "I will never agree to the
proposition of 'Taiwan independence.' I believe that the
overwhelming majority of our compatriots will not accept or agree
to it."
</P>
<P>
On October 7, 1990, he said, "Attempting 'Taiwan independence'
is a path that cannot be taken and a path that leads to
self-destruction."
</P>
<P>
However, six months later, Lee began to absolve those who
pursue "Taiwan independence" from guilt.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that "The 'Taiwan independence' attempt
amounts merely to advocating a (political) slogan" and does not
have to be dealt with "in accordance with the law."
</P>
<P>
He seems to have forgotten his earlier statement that "Should
anyone take the problem of 'Taiwan independence' as his
(political) slogan, it must be dealt with in accordance with the
law."
</P>
<P>
He also shifted the blame for the existence of "Taiwan
independence" attempt to the Chinese Communist Party. In
explaining why "many people advocate 'Taiwan independence'," he
said, "because the Chinese Communist Party keeps us from carrying
out all sorts of international activities, we have no way out. So,
a number of young people and those who are dissastified with what
the government has done favor 'Taiwan independence'."
</P>
<P>
On April 30, 1991, he said that "'The Taiwan independence'
attempt resulted from efforts of the Chinese Communist Party to
isolate us from international society."

<HEADLINE> Lee Teng-hui Criticized for Self-Contradictory Statements (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An article that appeared today
has criticized Lee Teng-hui for making self-contradictory remarks
on China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
The article by Guo Taiwen said that Lee talked glibly about the
"one China" principle after coming to power. On December 23, 1988,
he said, "We hold that there is only one China."
</P>
<P>
On May 9, 1989, he said, "I have emphasized repeatedly ... we
must adhere to the one-China policy."
</P>
<P>
Then, on August 29, 1990, he said, "China must be reunified and
will certainly be reunified. I take as my unavoidable duty the
safeguarding of China's territorial and sovereign integrity and
always bear in mind the great cause of China's reunification at an
early date."
</P>
<P>
Again, on October 24, 1990, he said, "There is only one
China. China ought to be reunified and will certainly be
reunified. No Chinese should shirk the responsibility of
reunifying China and should not keep himself apart from
reunification efforts."
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1991, he said, "The reunification of China is not
a remote dream."
</P>
<P>
Records show that, in four years, after coming to power, Lee
spoke about "one China" 15 times, and "seemed to be a strong
defender of the one-China principle," the article said.
</P>
<P>
But, by the end of 1992, Lee seemed to have completely
forgotten his remarks about "one China." On February 7, 1993, he
said that he had "never stated that there is only one China, and
that "Former President Chiang Kai-chek never stated that there is
only one China" and that that was "really great."
</P>
<P>
Why was Chiang so great, simply because he did not state that
"there is only one China"?
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui explained on December 15, 1992, that "in the
international community, China usually refers to the Chinese
Communist Party's 'People's Republic of China'," and "I believe
that if we simply state that there is only one China, we will fall
into the trap set by the Chinese Communist Party."
</P>
<P>
That is why Lee Teng-hui flatly denied that he had stated that
there is only "one China," the article explains, adding that he
has turned out to be an entirely different person when it comes to
the question of China.

BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that further development of
good-neighborly relations between China and the Republic of Korea
(ROK) is in the interests of both countries and is conducive to
regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark here this afternoon in his talks with the
ROK Foreign Minister Gong Ro-Myung, who is on his first visit to

BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Preparatory Committee of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has the right to
make the decision to establish the provisional legislative
council, according to the "Decision of the National People's
Congress on the Method for the Formation of the First Government
and the First Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region".
</P>
<P>
The statement was made at the first session of the the
Preparatory Committee's provisional legislative council panel
which was held here today.
</P>
<P>
Members held that it is necessary to establish the provisional
legislative council of the Hong Kong SAR in order to ensure the
smooth transition and the effectiveness of the SAR's work in
accordance with the decision of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress made on August 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
This is because the transitional arrangements for the formation
of the Hong Kong legislature cannot be realized due to the British
side's unilateral action, they said while discussing the proposal
of the political panel of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC)
of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR on the
establishment of the Hong Kong provisional legislative council.
</P>
<P>
The composition and formation of the council, the congressmen's

<HEADLINE> hke032048--Indian Scientists Move Towards Finding Malaria Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists are upbeat
about the results of their initial experiments aimed at
identifying a candidate malaria vaccine that is the focus of
global malaria research, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said
today.
</P>
<P>
"We have reasonably progressed in our efforts to identify
potential candidates for malaria vaccine development," Professor
V.S. Chauhan of the International Center for Genetic Engineering
and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in New Delhi told PTI today.
</P>
<P>
Malaria vaccine research is focusing on the several antigens
found on the surface of the malarial parasite plasmodium
falciparum.
</P>
<P>
Researchers do not as yet know which single antigen or a
combination of antigens can confer immunity against the disease,
said Professor Chauhan, who chaired a session at the ongoing
global meet on parasitic diseases here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chauhan's team at ICGEB has adopted a two-pronged
strategy to surge forward in the global race for the malaria
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
It is following two routes -- genetically engineered single
antigens, and a chemically synthesized cocktail of functionally
important portions of several antigens present on the parasite's
surface.
</P>
<P>
Of the two strategies, the "cocktail" of antigens has been
tested in mice and encouraged by the results, ICGEB scientists are
planning to initiate limited trials on monkeys.

Policy holders will have to pay additional for their insurance
once the 10 percent E-VAT becomes effective.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao's Banking Business Grows Steadily  by Che Yuming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Macao's banking business is
expected to register a bigger expansion in 1996 following a steady
 growth last year despite an overall economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the 21 banks in Macao had a total
deposit of 81.5 billion patacas (about 10.58 billion US dollars)
by the end of 1995, up 19 percent from that in 1994, or an
increase of 13.4 billion patacas (1.74 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Local financial experts attributed the trend largely to higher
interest rates for the most part of 1995.
</P>
<P>
They added that with the overall sluggish economy in Macao,
fixed bank deposits were preferred as a less profitable but safer
way of investment to risky investment in business like real
estate.
</P>
<P>
Macao's bank deposits grew faster than its economy, indicating
the inflow of foreign capital, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that fixed deposits grew by 20 percent, faster
than current deposits, which went up by four percent. Some three
quarters of the bank deposits in Macao are now fixed ones.
</P>
<P>
Total bank loans reached 47.4 billion patacas (6.16 billion US
dollars) in Macao in 1995, slightly up by three percent from that
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the increase was small because of the economic
 slump, but they expected bank loans to grow more significantly
when the local economy recovers this year.
</P>
<P>
Local banks offered more services in 1995, including the
installation of dozens of automatic tellers, electronics services,
 and the opening of more bank outlets in new residential areas,
which, according to the experts, will pave the way for a better
business.
</P>
<P>
The issuing of note by the Bank of China last year has also
created favorable conditions for the financial stability and
economic development of Macao while increased foreign banks in
Macao would make it more financially internationalized, said
experts.
</P>
<P>
They predicted a further drop of interest rate this year, which
 would stimulate consumption and economic growth in Macao.
</P>
<P>
They added that China's tariff cuts this year would help
increase Macao's exports to the mainland.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A national exercise campaign to
improve the health of the British nation was launched on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Adults are being urged to take up activities like brisk
walking, dancing, cycling and swimming to cut down the risk of
illness and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
One in three British adults take no exercise at all, says the
British Health Education Authority which launched the campaign,
and only 36 percent of men and a quarter of women take the
moderate exercise of 30 minutes five times a week the HEA is
recommending.
</P>
<P>
Paul Lincoln of the HEA said lack of physical activity is now
causing large scale health problems. "You double the risk of
coronary heart disease and increase the risk of stroke three
times," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lack of exercise poses as big a risk for heart disease as
smoking 20 cigarettes a day, the HEA warned.
</P>
<P>
Regular exercise helps control people's weight, improves the
overall quality of life and improves mobility in the elderly,
Lincoln said.

<HEADLINE> HK Anti-Smuggling Police to Have New Speed Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Anti-Smuggling Task
Force (ASTF) will buy purpose-built speed boats which are safer
and faster than smugglers' "dai feis", according to the latest
edition of the local police force newspaper Offbeat.
</P>
<P>
The new boats will be capable of speeding up to 60 knots, which
will be more than a match for the "dai feis" used by smugglers
entering Hong Kong waters.
</P>
<P>
The boats will also be equipped with better safety equipment
and radar so they can perform other marine related patrols and
operations against criminal activities, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
ASTF Senior Superintendent Norrie MacKillop said: "We will have
quite a formidable task force against smugglers and illegal
immigrants once the new boats are in the water."
</P>
<P>
He said that three new speed boats will be commissioned by
early next year.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Claims to Host World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South African cricket chief
Ali Bacher rejected reports on Wednesday that the host for the
2003 World Cup was not decided, insisting that his country be the
final venue.
</P>
<P>
Inderjit Bindra, the head of India's Board of Control for
Cricket, said earlier that no commitment had been given that South
Africa would host the tournament.
</P>
<P>
But Bacher denounced the saying. He said that the members of
the International Cricket Council (ICC) decided in London in
February, 1993, that England would host the 1999 tournament and
that the one in 2003 would be held in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Earlier there were also reports saying the decision on the 2003
tournament was reserved because the West Indies wanted to put up a
proposal.
</P>
<P>
At a recent ICC meeting, the West Indies had indicated that for
the first time they hoped to host a world cup tournament. However,
Bacher said, it had been made clear to them that there next chance
was 2007.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government today
deployed army troops to help the government keep law and order in
the metropolitan cities of Dhaka and Chittagong, which have been
paralyzed by an indefinite "non-cooperation" campaign launched by
the opposition.

<P>
In view of the situation, the government has decided to deploy
the army in aid of civil power to restore normalcy and maintain
law and order in the two major cities, the press release said.

elections to pave the way for fresh polls under a neutral
caretaker government, the mainstream opposition parties launched
an indefinite "non-cooperation movement" on March 9, paralyzing
road and rail communications and normal life in cities and towns
across the country.

<HEADLINE> Thai Defense Paper Shows Concern over Economic Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Economic disputes and their
consequent threats will have a greater impact on national security
in the future, said a "White Paper" issued by the Thai Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the Cold War, the world is splitting into
"economic blocs" instead of "political blocs", said the paper
entitled "The Defense of Thailand 1996" which was available today.
</P>
<P>
The post-Cold War era features a major shift from direct
confrontation due to ideological differences to a competition in
the economic field, and many countries have turned to search for
tangible national benefits, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Although the world's military situation has become more stable
and tensions have been reduced, problems and conflicts concerning
race, religion and unclear borders could easily arise and have a
tendency to escalate.
</P>
<P>
On the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region, the paper
indicated that tensions have lessened, security has increased and
a new area of better understanding and prosperity has emerged in
the region due to efforts made by various countries in the area
through discussions and confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
On Thailand's national security, the paper said, problems on
unclear borders, both on land and sea, might affect the country's
security in the future as some of them have not been demarcated.
</P>
<P>
Internal changes in neighboring countries also might have
influences over Thailand's security, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The internal problems of neighboring countries that directly
affect Thailand's security include illegal entry, cross-border
smuggling, and illegal trade in weapons and drugs, it added.
</P>
<P>
The five-chapter paper also touched on Thailand's national
defense policy and the future development of the Thai armed
forces.

<HEADLINE> Major Border River to be Dredged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China will soon launch dredging
work on the Lancang River (known as Mekong River outside China) on
the border of China, Myanmar, Laos and Thailand, as part of
international efforts to boost shipping on the river.
</P>
<P>
The work, the feasibility research of which has been recently
approved by experts, involves demolishing a nine-km-long sand dam,
40 km downstream the Jinghong City, the last major obstacle on the
300 km river channel.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central government and Yunnan Province will jointly
fund the 26-million-yuan project, which is expected to be
completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The four countries on the banks of the river have been
discussing the possibilities of closer co-operation in developing
the Mekong River area in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The parties agree that such co-operation should start with
common efforts, in boosting shipping on the river.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the Chinese side has opened two border outlets on
the river, one in Simao and the other in Jinghong. The
construction of the Guanlei Port on the river is also under way.
</P>
<P>
Official information shows that the Chinese now operate 60
vessels on the river, which carried 40,000 tons of cargo in
1995. A dozen more vessels are expected to join the fleet this
year.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Kunming said that the four countries concerned
will meet in Myanmar this year, when a shipping agreement is
likely to be signed.

<HEADLINE> Australia, New Zealand Reaffirm Closer Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard re-glazed the country's close relations with New Zealand as
he met with his counterpart Jim Bolger from the fraternal neighbor
in Sydney today.
</P>
<P>
Bolger is the first foreign leader who visits Australia after
Howard's coalition government took office last week.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is fair for me to say on behalf of the Australian
government that we take CER (Closer Economic Relations agreement)
seriously," Howard said at a joint press conference with Bolger
after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question, Bolger declined to say that
relations between New Zealand and Australia were left to rust
under the former Keating government of Australia, which
concentrated on forging ties with Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Relitigating the past is of no consequence," he said.
</P>
<P>
"What we're talking today is tomorrow and on from here, and the
discussion that John Howard and I had was very constructive, very
constructive, and their policy was towards CER," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Howard assured Bolger that the new Australian government would
put the unification of aviation market across the Tasman straits
back on agenda.
</P>
<P>
He said that transport ministers from both countries would
start discussion on the issue soon.
</P>
<P>
Allowing New Zealand airlines to run domestic services in
Australia is one of the unfulfilled targets of the CER agreement,
which was signed between the two governments in the early 1980s.
The Keating government has abandoned the idea in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Bolger said that the two prime ministers discussed the broader
New Zealand-Australian defense relationship but stopped short of
touching the ANZUS defense arrangement.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the close defense relationship between the
two countries "was a positive one and we would expect that to
continue."
</P>
<P>
"But we did not develop out into the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed issues concerning the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) as a vessel of free trade and
reduction of regional tension.
</P>
<P>
Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer and his New Zealand
counterpart Philip Burdon also held talks in Canberra today.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A complete employment system,
with job placement agencies and labor service companies as
mainstays, has been set up in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 job placement agencies opened in the province
have passed appraisal. They helped 640,000 people to find jobs
last year, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
With constant development of a market economy, job placement
agencies have extended to villages and townships. Presently, more
than half of the 1,800 villages and townships in the province have
set up their own establishments for the management of laborers,
half of which were opened last year.
</P>
<P>
In the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), job placement
agencies in the province have offered various services for more
than two million laborers, greatly easing pressure on the province
which has a large population with a small land area.
</P>
<P>
More than 8,000 labor service companies within the province
have employed 170,000 laborers, and played a positive role in
helping maintain good public order.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the province had 33,000 jobless laborers, the carrying
out of "Re-employment Project" has helped 14,000 of them find new
jobs, and a further 8,000 of them find temporary jobs.

<HEADLINE> EAC Encourages PTA Bank To Fund More Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The newly established East
Africa Cooperation (EAC) will encourage the Preferential Trade
Area (PTA) Bank to fund more projects in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Martin Ogang, the PTA Bank President, said at a press
conference in Arusha recently the projects proposed by investors
from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda stood a better chance of
obtaining loan facilities than was the case before.
</P>
<P>
The PTA Bank was established in 1985 as the financial wing of
the defunct preferential trade area, now the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
The Secretariat for EAC is a positive step towards reinforced
economic unity of the three countries, Ogang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya are among the PTA
Bank shareholders, and benefit as recepients of loan facilities
available at the bank.
</P>
<P>
By last December, some 12 projects worth 30 million US Dollars
had been implemented in Tanzania, eight projects worth 20 million
dollars in Uganda and six projects worth 12 million dollars in
Kenya, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The PTA Bank was presently expecting to cater for a wider
clientele in the sub-region, he said, urging potential clients to
furmish well-documented project appraisals.
</P>
<P>
The projects being funded by the bank at present include
ventures in agri-business, holticulture, tourism, railway
maintenance, buildings and port facilities. enditem

<HEADLINE> New International Wetlands Protection Body Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The formation of a new
International conservation body announced today was vital to the
wise use of wetlands around the world, conservationists were told
at the Ramsar meeting today.
</P>
<P>
The Wetlands International was launched at the Ramsar
Convention conference held in Brisbane, a port city in
Northeastern Australia, with the participation of some 1000
delegates from about 120 countries, The Australian Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The new organization links the Asian Wetland Bureau, Wetlands
for the Americas and the International Waterfowl and Wetlands
Research Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill, while addressing
the conference, said that it represented a unique partnership
between government and non-government interests to work for the
goal of wetlands conservation.
</P>
<P>
Hill told the conference that relations between Wetlands
International and Australia have been strengthened to the point
that a formal agreement would be signed tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Asian delegates to the international Ramsar conference called
on the governing bureau to cut costs and move its headquarters out
of Switzerland to the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Swami Singh Boparai, the Asian regional representative, said
that as the infrastructure is available less costly in the
developing world, the bureau secretariat can consider moving to a
developing country so that it can have within the same budget more
manpower and more activity.
</P>
<P>
Boparai also said that wetlands in many developing countries
were vital to the sustenance of human beings, not just flora and
fauna. Malaysia has estimated that its wetlands contributed 10
percent of its GDP although this percentage may have declined
slightly as industrialization increased, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ramsar Convention, signed in 1971 in Ramsar, Iran, has more
than 90 signatory countries which make contributions to the
administrative bureau based in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Previous Ramsar conferences have been held in Italy, France,
the Netherlands, Canada, Switzerland and Japan. The vital
importance of wetlands to Asia has led India to bid to host the
next Ramsar meeting in New Delhi in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Indian President Refuses to Promulgate Ordinances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government suffered
a major blow Tuesday when President Shankar Dayal Sharma refused
to promulgate two poll-eve ordinances proposed by the government,
The Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The president made the decision on the ground that promulgation
of the controversial ordinances on the eve of the general
elections may not pass the test of constitutional propriety.
</P>
<P>
The two ordinances on curtailing campaign time from 21 days to
14 days and providing reservations for 12 million Dalit Christians
are widely believed to be helpful to the government in the coming
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Sharma's decision, coming three days after the draft-ordinances
were submitted by the government, was hailed by all opposition
parties as a step that would strengthen parliamentary democracy.
</P>
<P>
There was no official reaction, but sources in the government
said the two draft-ordinances had been "returned, not rejected"
and theoretically at least, could be revived.

<HEADLINE> Chavalit Stresses Links Between Security and Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAKORN PATHOM, THAILAND, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy prime
Minister and Defense Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh today stressed
that economic prosperity and security awareness are closely linked
and it would be useless to strive for prosperity without security
awareness.
</P>
<P>
Opening a seminar here on the region's security, Chavalit said
the danger of major military confrontation has greatly dwindled
since the end of the Cold War, while disputes over resources,
borderlines and territorial claims, environment, and religion have
increased.
</P>
<P>
"It is our task to find the means to prevent and solve any new
problems and disputes ... to ensure that true progress and
prosperity would be achieved and firmly maintained in the years to
come, " he told the seminar, the theme of which is "the
Asia-Pacific Security Dialogue".
</P>
<P>
The countries of the region are reviewing their national
strategies after the Cold War as they are advancing into an era of
economic prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent that we grasp the opportunity to establish a
permanent peace," as the countries are reconsidering their
national interests and security needs, Chavalit said.
</P>
<P>
Problems of security are complex by nature and means of solving
these problems are equally complex, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must synergize our effort: be pro-active, positive,
systematic, sincere and persistent in our endeavor to build a
lasting peace within the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai defense minister spoke highly of the United Nations'
role in maintaining world peace and building security confidence,
especially in its peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
He said that the seminar will seek concrete steps to bring into
reality an idea for establishing a Peace Keeping Center proposed
at the Second Asia Regional Forum (ARF) meeting in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is being attended by some 130 military officials,
academics and foreign affairs experts from 17 countries.
Participants will focus their discussions on how to implement
those initiatives on security problems proposed at the previous
ARF meetings.
</P>
<P>
The participants will hold further discussions on the roles of
the armed forces in the region in national, regional and global
affairs in their following meetings in the next three days.

<HEADLINE> xinhua interviews sierra leone's first lady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's first lady, Mrs
Patricia Kabbah, said in an interview with Xinhua today it is
''pathetic that illiteracy among (Sierra Leonean) women is
very high'' and she would ''work to reduce this.''
</P>
<P>
Mrs Kabbah, whose husband, Tejan Kabbah, won the presidential
runoff in the West African state five days ago, said, ''I am going
to be very active in the fight to combat illiteracy among women.''
</P>
<P>
''I have been involved in the women's movement in the last few
years but to a limited extent. From all the work women have done,
the nation now knows we have a vast capability,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
She said: ''Education is one area where women can definitely
receive a fairer share.''
</P>
<P>
Asked how she felt over the election victory of her husband,
she said, ''of course I am happy. It was a well earned
victory and I am so elated.''
</P>
<P>
On whether she liked politics, she replied, ''sure. This is
why I also campaigned (in the country's universities and local
markets) actively for people to know me. It was very exciting while
it lasted as it gives one the chance to meet people at the grass
root level and help them discuss and find solutions to their
issues at first hand.''
</P>
<P>
Mrs Kabbah has been married to the president-elect for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
Asked about her age, a very humourous Mrs Kabbah declined to
tell anything, saying ''women and horses should never be dated.''
</P>
<P>
She, like her husband, is a lawyer and practiced in
Lesotho and Zimbabwe for seven years when her husband was United
Nations Development Program representative.
</P>
<P>
They both returned to the United Nations in New York where she
worked in the Department of Political Affairs directly under the
UN Council on Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Kabbah comes from Bonthe in the south of the country and
studied at the University of Ohio in the United States for her
bachelor of arts degree in English and later obtained a masters
degree 8 in French literature. enditem

<HEADLINE> Foreigners to Work on Fishing Vessels for South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will ask foreigners to
work on coastal fishing boats during the first half of this year
in an effort to alleviate manpower shortage, the Fisheries
Administration said today.
</P>
<P>
The administration said that the Justice Ministry has approved
its plan to assign 1,000 foreign workers jobs aboard fishing
vessels on a trial basis. Some 20,000 foreign workers have been
brought in for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
If the fishery circles respond favorably and foreign crewmen do
well, the administration will increase the number of such workers
on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The actual number of offshore fishing workers in South Korea is
expected to fall 10,500 short of the 51,500 needed this year,
according to the administration.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government authorized the Korea Federation of
Small Business in 1993 to import, distribute and manage the
foreign workers under the "industrial trainee" system, which
allows foreigners to legally work in small- and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Some 37,500 foreign workers, including 11,200 Chinese, 6,700
Vietnamese and 6,000 Filipinos, are currently working in South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> .bco::m:k:e:wen xinnian liu:96/03/20/10/45 mee032004hke -- Premier: Jordan Ready to Improve Ties With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti has said that Jordan hopes to maintain good ties
with Syria. But he stressed that the kingdom will enhance
relations with its neighbor only if the latter reciprocates.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Lower House of
Parliament on Jordan's foreign policy on Tuesday, Kabariti
reaffirmed Jordan's keenness to preserve good relations with all
Arab countries, Syria in particular.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan seeks good relations with Syria, but Syria should have
the same desire." he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Syria and Jordan should be based on
mutual respect and not directed by "some countries' ambition to
exercise hegemony over other countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was the first public comment by Jordan's prime minister on
the tense Jordanian-Syrian relations since Jordan signed peace
treaty with Israel in 1994, which Damascus accused Amman of
breaking the unified Arab ranks to make unilateral peace with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The defection of Hussein Kamel, the son-in-law of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to Jordan in August last year and
Jordan's apparent distance from Iraq gave a further blow to the
already sour Jordanian-Syrian relations.

MOSCOW, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda here today to discuss
bilateral relations and preparations for the April G-8 summit on
nuclear security in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin reportedly told the Japanese minister who arrived
here last night that Russia attaches importance to its relations
with Japan and Moscow is ready to continue an active political
dialogue with Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports here, the Russian side intends
to discuss during Ikeda's visit the development of the
Russian-Japanese political dialogue and practical aspects of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese side hopes to discuss the development of the
bilateral cooperation between Russia and Japan in the field of
ensuring security, including broadening of contacts between
representatives of the two countries' armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda is to leave for home this afternoon after his talks with
Russian Foreign Minister Yevegeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
According to Japanese sources here, Ikeda's brief Moscow visit
was caused by the need for his presence at a session of the
Japanese Diet Thursday morning. He had planned to stay in Moscow
for two days.

<HEADLINE> Development in China's Ethnic Minority Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- In Lianshan Zhuang and Yao
Autonomous County, in the northern mountainous region of south
China's Guangdong Province, per capita annual income of peasants
was only 550 yuan (66 U.S. dollars) in 1990, because of traffic
inaccessibility and the single-product economy.
</P>
<P>
By 1994, however, that figure had jumped to some 1,200 yuan,
and continued to rise last year, as a result of the growth of
rural enterprises in recent years and a new export-oriented
economy, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has placed great importance on aiding
the poor and has adopted measures to help them. To date, about 7.1
percent of the Chinese people are still living below the poverty
line. This is down from 30.7 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics from the State Statistics Bureau show
that the number of peasants in the country as a whole with per
capita annual income below 500 yuan has dropped to 65 million,
down five million from the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
The State Council decided to provide an additional one billion
yuan for relief and to allocate one billion yuan more in
aid-the-poor loans each year from 1994 to the end of the century
to help the poor. Most of these funds will be used in minority
regions.
</P>
<P>
These people are mainly found in minority regions of Yunnan,
Guizhou, Guangxi, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet, whose
economies have developed very slowly because of a harsh
environment and inaccessibility.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have come up with preferential policies, mainly for
taxes and credit, in a move to take different circumstances in
different provinces and autonomous regions into account.
</P>
<P>
Such was the case in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region where all enterprises set up in under-developed
areas are allowed to remit their income tax over a three- to
five-year period if they get approval and provided that 60 percent
of their workers come from families living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Aid-the-poor programs have been strengthened. By September
1995, a total of 44 central government departments and
organizations were helping 142 under-developed minority counties.
</P>
<P>
In southwest China's Yunnan Province, which is inhabited by
many ethnic minorities, 73 under-developed counties had found
partners above the provincial level which had chosen them as areas
to support.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have also looked for ways to bring in
more foreign capital to make up for the shortage of domestic funds.
</P>
<P>
In August 1995, the World Bank kicked off an aid-the-poor
project, reportedly to be the largest in China by the World Bank
or any other international organization, to provide 247 million
U.S. dollars in loans to 35 poverty-stricken counties in Yunnan
and Guizhou provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinyou, vice-minister of the State Nationalities Affairs
Commission, emphasized that under-developed regions should get rid
of poverty by relying on local resources, by increasing input in
science and technology, and by developing a diversified economy.
</P>
<P>
Barin Right Banner in the southeastern part of Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region is well known for Barin Stone, which is good for
stone carvings. In 1992, the State Nationalities Affairs
Commission allocated a one-million-yuan aid-the-poor loan to a
local arts and crafts company. By 1994, the company's annual
output value had risen to nine million yuan, up from 2.56 million
two years ago, and the company is now a pillar industry in the
region.

<HEADLINE> 36 Terrorist Attempts Foiled in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 36 terrorist attempts
targeting Jordanian personalities with an aim of destabilizing
the kingdom were thwarted in the past six months, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Times, the kingdom's sole English-language newspaper,
quoted Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti as confirming Tuesday
the reports of arresting a group of militants last week.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with members of the Lower House's Foreign
Affairs committee, Kabariti said all arrests "came within the
framework of applying the rule of law and the kingdom's keenness
to preserve its security and stability."
</P>
<P>
According to Theib Abdullah, a deputy from the Islamic Action
Front, at least 20 people have been arrested in the past few
days. Some of the arrested possessed anti-tank rockets,
anti-personal mines and detonators to be used to launch attacks
against Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti denied that the people arrested had links with the
Palestinian militant group of Hamas, saying that they were
arrested individually for suspected attempts to destabilize the
country.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for Israeli Withdrawal from Occupied Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Ninister Rafik Al
Hariri has said that the problems in the Middle East would never
be settled unless Israel withdraws from the occupied lands in
south Lebanon and the Golan Heights, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Beirut daily "Nida Al-Watan" quoted the prime minister as
warning against Israeli military operation against Lebanon, saying
that any military action would complicate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hariri had a meeting Tuesday night with President Elias Hrawi
in the presidential palace and the two leaders dealt with the
latest developments in both the country and the region.
</P>
<P>
"The settlement is a political one," the prime minister
said. "Any attempt for an escalation would complicate the things
more and more and would not lead to a result."
</P>
<P>
This is the first discussion Hariri has held with local press
since he came back from a three-day official visit to Egypt where
he held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. During the
visit, the two sides three agreements on economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on Lebanon's fear of an Israeli military
action in south Lebanon, the prime minister said that "we believe
that any Israeli military operation against Lebanon will
complicate the things, complicate the peace process and will not
achieve a result.''
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of his talks with the Egyptian president, Hariri
said that "our Egyptian brothers could not allow the conference
which was held to be a cover for a military operation against
Lebanon or against any Arab country," a reference to an
international anti-terrorism summit held in the Egyptian Red Sea
resort town of Sharm el Sheikh Last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We want a just and comprehensive peace," Hariri noted, "but
until now Israel has not shown a desire for peace."
</P>
<P>
He stressed Lebanon's vehement rejection of the remarks made by
some Israeli officials that Lebanon had returned to a situation
before 1982, saying that "all this is incorrect excuses."

<HEADLINE> Earthquake in Xinjiang Kills 24, Injures 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China late Tuesday has left
at least 24 people dead and 40 injured.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement made here today by the State
Seismological Bureau, the quake destroyed 1,000 houses in two
townships in Jiashi county, Kashi prefecture, in the westernmost
part of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, occurred at
23:00 hours on March 19 (Beijing time), with an epicenter at 39.9
degrees north latitude and 76.8 east longitude, northeast of Artux
City.
</P>
<P>
A 600 meter-long crack appeared in an earth dam at a reservior
east of Artux, the local seismological bureau said. Emergency
measures have been taken by Kashi prefecture to reenforce the
damaged reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The bureau says 52 aftershocks had been recorded by 05:00
(Beijing time) on March 20, with the strongest aftershock
measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
The quake jolted areas around Artux, Jiashi, Kashi, and Bachu
and was felt in the Yecheng and Wuqia areas. It had been predicted
by seismologists at a conference on earthquakes earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The State Seismological Bureau says that there is little
possibility that a stronger earthquake will hit the same area
again, but warns that aftershocks measuring 5 to 6 on the Richter
scale are still possible.
</P>
<P>
It has called for a close watch on the situation in other parts
of Xinjiang because the region is in a period of high seismic
activity.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in the quake-stricken areas are coordinating
relief efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole tonight clinched the Republican presidential nomination
by sweeping GOP primaries in four Midwest states, according to
latest local television reports.
</P>
<P>
Dole defeated his remnant rival Pat Buchanan by lopsided
margins in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin. As a result,
the 72-year-old GOP presidential champion gained more than 200
delegates to the Republican National Convention and crossed the
996 mark required for winning the party's nomination for the
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The new victory has set the stage for Dole to face Democratic
Party's re-election-seeking President Bill Clinton in elections on
November 5.
</P>
<P>
"The fall campaign is under way," Dole said triumphantly at a
celebration party in Washington. "It is 230 days to defeating
Bill Clinton."
</P>
<P>
But the Kansas senator, who failed in his first two tries for
the presidential nomination, refused to officially declare his
victory in the GOP nomination chase, eager to maintain some
meaning for next week's primary in the country's biggest state of
California.
</P>
<P>
Dole told a crowd that he would soon begin the process of
picking a running mate and preparing for the GOP National
Convention in San Diego in August.

<HEADLINE> Three Nigerians, Briton Awarded For Fight Against Guinea Worm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Three Nigerians and a Briton
yesterday received the Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter Awards for their
outstanding contributions to the eradication of Guinea worm in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In spite of his physical disability, retired civil servant,
Alhaji Salami has been in the vanguard of guinea worm eradiction.
</P>
<P>
Miss Lola Olopade, a medical student, worked tirelessly
without remuneration to contain guinea worm cases in remote
communities in Niger State.
</P>
<P>
Niran Fatinilu, a former program officer at the Nigeria Guinea
Worm Eradication Program (NIGEP), ensured the proper collation of
data in the southwest zone of Niger.
</P>
<P>
Colins Davis, the Chief of Water and Environmental Sanitation
Section of UNICEF in Nigeria, has been described a major factor
who forged an efficient partnership with NIGEP.
</P>
<P>
All the four recipients got a plaque and undisclosed sums of
money at a ceremony to mark the success of the campaign against
guinea worm.
</P>
<P>
The number of guinea worm cases had been reduced by 97.5
percent, from 653,620 at the inception of the eradication program
in 1988 to 16,374 last December.
</P>
<P>
The number of endemic villages have been reduced by over 50
percent, with most of them having fewer than five cases each in
1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nigerian Federal Health Ministry has regretted
its inability to eradicate guinea worm nationwide at the targeted
December 1995 date.
</P>
<P>
The Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter Awards, introduced by the former
US president and founder of Global 2000, are incentives to hasten
the complete eradication of guinea worm globally. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Won't Give Up Its Principle on Taiwan Issue: NPC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese leader said in
Beijing today that China will not give up the principle of
independence, and will not allow hegemonism, or power politics to
infringe upon its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC)
Standing Committee, reiterated, at a meeting with Yugoslavian
Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic, that the Taiwan issue is one of
internal affairs of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government adheres to the policies of "peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems" on the Taiwan issue,
but will not promise not to resort to the use of arms, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Once the "Taiwan independence" or infringement upon Taiwan by a
foreign force should occur, he said, China will "take every
measures necessary to realize the reunification of the country."
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Qiao said there have been long-term
friendly relations and cooperation between China and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He added that the China visit by Yugoslavia's President Zoran
Lilic has made contributions to the development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
"There are broad prospects for Sino-Yugoslavian cooperation. I
believe that the current visit by Defense Minister Bulatovic will
help enhance the friendly relations, and cooperation between the
two countries, two peoples, and the two armed forces," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao told the defense minister that China has always followed
closely the situation in the former Yugoslavian area.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the UN sanctions against Yugoslavia has now
terminated, adding "this is a good thing."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the Yugoslavian people will
restore the country's national economy, by giving full play to
their creativity.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also briefed the guest on the Fourth Plenum of the Eighth
National People's Congress, saying that the Chinese people will
unite and strive for the goals set forth by the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic told Qiao that both Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian, and he himself, expressed during their talks, the wish to
further develop the friendly relations between the two armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the Chinese government's principled stand on
the issue of former Yugoslavia. He also wished China success in
achieving the goals set by the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia holds that the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of
China, the defense minister said. He expressed the hope that
China will realize national reunification at an early date.

<HEADLINE> Desert-Control Priority Targets Mapped Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region has mapped out a desert-control plan in a bid to contain
the encroachment of deserts on oases and land.
</P>
<P>
A shifting desert belt is posing a serious threat to the
important farming center of Xinjiang, north of Tianshan Mountain,
and a crucial Euroasian Continental railway, linking China and the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Areas listed as priorities are the southern fringe of the
Taklimakan and Gurbantunggut deserts, and the green corridor, or
forest shelterbelt, along the lower reaches of the Tarim River.
</P>
<P>
A survey, conducted by local desert experts, shows that a
two-meter-high sand dune, driven by wind, is shifting southwards
from the Taklimakan desert at 17.8 meters a year, one of the
fastest desert expanding areas in China.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that in the past three decades, a total of
14,000 sq.km. of land has been encroached by desert in the
southern verges of the Taklimakan desert, including 6,000 hectares
of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The rampant desertification has turned the southern fringe of
the Taklimakan desert, the second largest in the world with an
area of 330,000 sq.km.,into the poorest area in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The drying up of the lower reaches of the Tarim river, and
overlogging, has diminished two-thirds of the 400 km-long virgin
diversiform-leaved poplar forest along the river, a green corridor
separating another desert and the Taklimakan desert.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the deforestation, the two deserts are gradually
getting closer to each other, and shifting sand has reached a road
passing across the corridor, and 8,700 ha. of farmland has been
turned into desert.
</P>
<P>
The corridor under threat is also one of the important channels
linking the north and south Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The area under sacsaoul forest in the Gurbantunggut desert has
been reduced by 68.4 percent over the past four decades, turning
many fixed or semi-fixed sand dunes into shifting sand dunes.
</P>
<P>
A new 500 km-long, 10 km- to 30 km-wide wind and sand belt has
been formed in the southern fringes of the Gurbantunggut desert,
and is shifting at a rate of one to three meters each year. It is
this shift that is posing a potential problem to the Euroasian
rail link.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials from Forestry Department of Xinjiang said the
region is preparing for emergency measures such as afforestation,
turning forest-turned farmland into forest, protecting vegetation,
and making rational use of water resources to curb the
encroachment of desert.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Xinjiang is to step up environmental protection in
three basins of Tarim basin, Turpan-Harmi and Junggar plagued by
deserts, where large-scale oil exploitation is underway.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Making Remarkable Progress in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- As economic boom areas of China set
their sights on 21st century computer technology, one region has
been making major strides in reading and writing.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s nine out of ten people in southwest China's
Tibetan Autonomous Region were illiterate.
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to developments in education, the region's
illiteracy rate has dropped to 40 percent
</P>
<P>
The region now has 190,000 primary and secondary school
students, with 70 percent of children of school age going to
schools.
</P>
<P>
One census in 1992 showed that there were 385 people in every
million with college diplomas; and a recent survey reveals that
Tibet has 7.4 polytechnic schools for per one million people.
</P>
<P>
Students of senior vocational schools account for 60 percent of
those at school age in the region, higher than the average
national level.
</P>
<P>
However, during the mid 1950s, serfs, amounting more than 95
percent of Tibet's total population, were robbed of their rights
to go to school by serf owners and nobles.
</P>
<P>
A 1949's survey on the Zhebung Temple, one of the biggest in
Tibet, showed that 80 percent of the temple's lamas were
illiterate. Of the region's total population, the rate stood at 90
percent.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s the Central Government attached great
importance to the development of education in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
From 1957 to now, more than 20 municipalities and provinces,
including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Sichuan have sent more
than 6,640 teachers to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inland universities and colleges have trained a
large number of teachers and educationalists for the region.
</P>
<P>
To help Tibet develop its education, 11 municipalities and
provinces, and concerned departments of the Central Government,
have started programs to support designated polytechnic schools
and colleges in Tibet in many aspects, including training
students, and improving teaching conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government, meanwhile, has invested an accumulated
1.1 billion yuan in Tibetan education development since it was
peacefully liberated in 1951.
</P>
<P>
A program aiming to train Tibetan students in inland schools
and colleges was also started in 1985. At present, the number of
such students is 20,000. Each year, a great number of graduates go
back to work in the modernization construction of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Inside Tibet, the region's education authorities has
implemented policies to grant scholarships to children from
farming and former serf families, due to their family economic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The region has also made extra efforts to perfect its teaching
in the Tibetan language. As a result, more than 95 percent of the
region's school classes now are using Tibetan language. The
number of Tibetan teachers now stands at 21,000.
</P>
<P>
A large group of Tibetan scientists, artists, writers, doctors
and jurists have emerged, and they are playing a very important
role in the construction of a modern Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Cement Factory Removed from Oldest Neolithic Site in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The site of the earliest traces of
human activity on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has been opened up
again, after a cement factory that had been built over it was
removed.
</P>
<P>
The site, at Karub village, some 12 km from Changdu County in
the eastern part of Tibet, was discovered in the mid-1960s when
archaeologists were checking before construction work at a cement
plant began.
</P>
<P>
The site contained man-made items dating back 4,600 years, the
earliest ever found on the plateau, but they were not given much
attention at that time, and construction work on the plant was
allowed to continue over the site.
</P>
<P>
With the growing interest in Tibetology over the past few
years, the importance of the site has become more and more widely
known, and the Changdu government finally decided to remove the
plant.
</P>
<P>
The removal project was started in May of last year and
operations are now located far from the site.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Fighting Drought in Southern Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in the mountainous areas
in southern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China are
fighting a long-lasting drought.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that some peasants, short of food, could hardly
stand the conditions any longer.
</P>
<P>
Little rain has fallen in southern Ningxia, known as Xihaigu in
over five years. To make matters worse a severe drought hit the
area in 1995, reducing its grain production by one-third.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the area's 1.6 million rural residents had to
struggle with a grain ration of just 50 kg per person in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing drought has also ruined about 27,000 hectares of
winter wheat so far this year. Most of the local residents are now
fed by the grain resold by the state.
</P>
<P>
Rui Cunzhang, a leading official in Guyuan Prefecture, said
that about 1.2 million residents in the prefecture do not have
enough food.
</P>
<P>
"The farmers' savings are all drained by the drought." he
said. "They can hardly stand it any longer."
</P>
<P>
Ren Qixing, vice-chairman of the regional government said his
government has taken a series of measures to help the
drought-plagued farmers.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the regional government earmarked 18.7 million yuan for
a relief fund, and 65 million kg of grain to Xihaigu area.
</P>
<P>
Government officials have taken the lead in donating money and
relief materials to the drought victims.
</P>
<P>
Ren said the regional government plans to provide the area with
90 million tons of grain, and 56 million yuan of relief funds in
the first eight months this year. The victims have already
received 26 million tons of grain and 3.2 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments are helping farmers create more
dry farmland, build more wells and water conservancy projects,
boost livestock breeding and speed up export of labor.
</P>
<P>
Ren said the regional government plans to spend 15 million yuan
building 24,000 irrigation wells, 4,000 more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He added that the drought victims will soon receive another 20
million tons of grain, and two million yuan of relief
funding. They will also be provided with six million kg of grain
seeds, and six million yuan in low interest loans to buy potato
seeds.
</P>
<P>
Rui said that the prefectural government of Guyuan will send
3,300 local officials to the villages to join in the fight against
the drought together with the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Xihaigu area, known as the most poverty-stricken area in China,
is located in the drought belt of the Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that just before the turn of the
century one drought in the area lasted for 12 years, finally
ending in 1901.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake in Xinjiang Kills 24, Injures 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China late Tuesday has left
at least 24 people dead and 40 injured.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement made here today by the State
Seismological Bureau, the quake destroyed 1,000 houses in two
townships in Jiashi county, Kashi prefecture, in the westernmost
part of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The quake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, occurred at
23:00 hours on March 19 (Beijing time), with an epicenter at 39.9
degrees north latitude and 76.8 east longitude, northeast of Artux
City.
</P>
<P>
A 600 meter-long crack appeared in an earth dam at a reservior
east of Artux, the local seismological bureau said. Emergency
measures have been taken by Kashi prefecture to reenforce the
damaged reservoir.
</P>
<P>
The bureau says 52 aftershocks had been recorded by 20:05
(Beijing time) on March 20, with the strongest aftershock
measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale.
</P>
<P>
The quake jolted areas around Artux, Jiashi, Kashi, and Bachu
and was felt in the Yecheng and Wuqia areas. It had been predicted
by seismologists at a conference on earthquakes earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The State Seismological Bureau says that there is little
possibility that a stronger earthquake will hit the same area
again, but warns that aftershocks measuring 5 to 6 on the Richter
scale are still possible.
</P>
<P>
It has called for a close watch on the situation in other parts
of Xinjiang because the region is in a period of high seismic
activity.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in the quake-stricken areas are coordinating
relief efforts.

<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China's capital city is set to
have multi-channel TV programs as part of a fiber optic
communications system.
</P>
<P>
It will eventually give people in Beijing a choice of hundreds
of television channels to choose from, when the system is brought
into use during the period of the Ninth Five-Year plan period
(1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The project has been approved by the municipal government and
construction has already started, said Li Tingzhi, head of the
Municipal Radio and Television Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The network will be a modern radio and television cable
network, consisting of fiber optic, microwave, and electric cable.
</P>
<P>
The project will be divided into two stages, the first will
connect two million households in urban and suburban regions. The
second will extend the network to cover 85 percent of the whole
city area.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of the project, the network will be able
to provide 47 TV programs and 18 stereo-sound broadcasting
programs, and the number of TV programs can be increased if the
digital technology is applied.
</P>
<P>
The operation of the network will also lay a foundation for
developing it into a multi-functional system capable of providing
such kinds of social services as auto-alarms, security monitoring,
information indexes, and television conference facilities.

<P>
The troupe is also famous for its big drum, which is two meters
high and 3.2 meters in diameter. Last year a drum solo drew
acclaim at a Denmark Art Festival.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Museum of Miniscule Carvings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The miniature carving museum in
this capital of east China's Jiangxi Province is a must for
visitors -- just as the Great Wall is for visitors to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Entering the gallery, one first sees three small boxes inside
which lie 60 small pieces of thin ivory slices carved with 1.035
million Chinese characters. These slices are only 50 mm long and
35 mm wide. That means each Chinese character only occupies a tiny
area of 0.2 sq mm; in other words a single sesame seed could be
carved with 15 Chinese characters of equal size.
</P>
<P>
The history of miniature carving art in China can be traced
back 3,000 years. There were many experts in this art in the past,
and even nowadays it is still practised. However, hardly any one
has carved an ivory slice with more than 30,000 characters.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shicheng, 49, spent five years carving the 120-chapter
"Dream of Red Mansions", a famous Chinese classical novel, on tiny
ivory slices.
</P>
<P>
Consisting of hundreds of thousands of Chinese characters, the
book was written in the mid-18th century, portraying the rise and
fall of a noble family during Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to show
the impending doom of the decadent feudal system at that time.
</P>
<P>
Wang's work not only includes these Chinese characters, but
also portraits of leading figures in the story. Wang's carving is
described as a full reflection of the beauty and cream of Chinese
calligraphy by experts.
</P>
<P>
Wang was born in Fengcheng City, Jiangxi Province, which is
famous for its writing brushes. He begun to carve characters on
pen-holders when he was young, but Wang was not satisfied with the
simple and stereotyped carving techniques used by his elders.
</P>
<P>
Through practice he got to know that the essence of carving is
a perfect combination of calligraphy, painting and the use of
knives.
</P>
<P>
During the past several decades Wang has used delicate, tiny
knives instead of pens to copy works of famous Chinese
calligraphers and painters.
</P>
<P>
Another of his achievements was the carving of 300 poems of the
Tang Dynasty (618-907), consisting of 21,370 characters, on an
ivory pen-holder 178 mm long and with a diameter of 10 mm. He also
engraved 55,000 characters on a 17 cm-long platinum fan with a 28
cm arc, and 500 Buddhist immortals and 68,000 Chinese characters
on a tiny ivory fan.
</P>
<P>
Wang's latest work, executed in collaboration with his son, is
a story from the Bible on a 300-mm long and 45-mm wide platinum
slice, containing 18,000 Chinese characters and more than 60,000
English letters.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Entering Second Phase of Massive Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong zone in Shanghai has
entered its second development phase with the beginning of the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), according to Vice-Mayor Zhao
Qizheng, who is in charge of the Pudong administrative committee.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan, Pudong will be engaged in
another ten major infrastructure projects, which include
construction of an international airport, an international
information center, a deep-water seaport, and another subway line,
Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Pudong's development has been greatly stressed, he noted,
adding that the central business district should be used as early
as possible and development of the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone should
be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Pudong will primarily build advanced urban infrastructure and
become China's largest business center and advanced export
processing base by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is being regarded as the world's largest project for the
end of the century. During its first phase of development from
1990 to 1995, total investment in infrastructure reached 25
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
At present, Pudong is one of the most intensive areas of
investment by major multinationals in China. By the end of last
year, foreign investment had topped 3.9 billion US dollars, and
GDP was 41 billion yuan, while export volume was 2.4 billion US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Comprehensive Agricultural Development Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province has made great achievements in agriculture thanks to
efforts made on a range of development projects.
</P>
<P>
Local agricultural officials say that in the past ten years, a
total of 10 billion yuan has been invested in the projects.
</P>
<P>
Now the efforts have paid off, with 3.3 million hectares of
land afforested, fruit trees planted across 660,000 ha, 40,000 ha
of waste land reclaimed, and 660 ha of hillside land, water
surface, and beaches brought into use as farmland.
</P>
<P>
To produce more high-yield farm products, the province
introduced 200 varieties of fruit, vegetables and flowers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province invested two billion yuan to set up
processing and stock companies to increase the value of farm
products.
</P>
<P>
Farming conditions in the province have also been greatly
improved as a result of the projects. Irrigated land accounts for
more than 80 percent of the province's total at present.
</P>
<P>
Meizhou in the northeast part of the province has been built
into the largest teak production base in the country, and Zhaoqing
in the northwest, the largest rosin and cassia production base.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal areas, a batch of prawn and high-quality fish
production bases have been set up with an output value reaching
one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive development helped to accelerate the
procession of modernization measures in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the per capita income of farmers in the province
reached 2,200 yuan, with 80 percent of agricultural products were
sent to market.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Dalai Lama's Splittist Act Exposed, Criticized (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On November 8, participants in the third meeting on the
searching of the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, held in
Beijing, also agreed that the soul boy for the Panchen Lama must
be confirmed by holding the lot-drawing ceremony, and the
confirmation must be approved by the central government.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, representatives of the Zhaxi Lhunbo
Lamasery, the home temple of the Panchen Lama, denounced the Dalai
Lama for his interference in, and sabotage of, the work to search
the soul boy for the Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Dalai's choice of the so-called reincarnated
boy for the Panchen Lama is, in essence, a fraud to fool Tibetan
buddhist believers.
</P>
<P>
On learning the guidelines of the meeting, people from all
walks of life in Tibet came to understand Dalai's true nature to
ruin and violate Buddhist rituals, betray national interests,
disrupt stability in Tibet, damage China's sovereignty, and split
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
On November 29, a grand ceremony was held in front of a statue
of Sakyamuni in the Jokhang Monastery in Lhasa, to confirm
Gyaincain Norbu, a six-year-old boy from Lhari County in Nagqu
Prefecture in Tibet, as the 11th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
On December 8, the enthronement ceremony of the 11th Panchen
Lama was held in the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery. State Councillor Li
Tieying presented a golden seal and golden certificate to the 11th
Panchen Lama on behalf of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The occasion marked the fulfilment of the reincarnation of the
Panchen Lama, a great event for Buddhism, to which the Tibetan
buddhism believers were looking forward for a long time.
</P>
<P>
It also marked a decisive victory over the splittist action of
the Dalai clique.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tibetan people have pledged to continue exposing
his splittist acts.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying said, "We will never stop our fight against the
Dalai Lama as long as he does not cease his activities to split
the motherland, and disrupt the stability in Tibet."

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Dalai Lama's Splittist Act Exposed, Criticized (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Dalai Lama's plot to split the
motherland by taking advantage of Panchen Lama's reincarnation has
been exposed and criticized by people from all walks of life in
the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
On May 14 last year, the Dalai Lama illegally announced in
India a boy from Tibet as the "reincarnated child of the Panchen
Lama," arousing strong indignation from among people of various
ethnic groups in the region.
</P>
<P>
They denounced Dalai's act as "illegal and invalid" because it
violates the historical conventions, and the religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
On May 18, Zhao Puchu, president of the Buddhism Association of
China, and one of the general advisors to the Leading Group for
Searching the Reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, said that he was
shocked by, and indignant at, Dalai's announcement.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, vice-chairman of the
Tibetan Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), and one of the general advisors to the Leading
Group for Searching the Reincarnation of the Panchen Lama,
emphasized that only with the central government approval, will
the reincarnated boy for the Panchen Lama become legal and valid.
</P>
<P>
Dalai's separation act also aroused indignation from among
deputies attending the annual session of the Tibetan Regional
People's Congress, and members attending the annual session of the
CPPCC Tibetan Committee held in May last year.
</P>
<P>
They refuted Dalai's illegal act with indisputable historical
facts, and also passed a resolution on resolutely opposing his
illegal deed of announcing the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts on Tibetan studies wrote a number of
articles, noting that China's unification is the inevitable result
of long history. They also explained the origin of drawing lots
from a golden urn to choose the reincarnated Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on May 22, the Tibet Branch of the
Buddhism Association of China stressed that the searching of the
reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama must proceed in accordance
with the historical conventions, and the religious rituals,
namely, to hold a lot-drawing ceremony in front of a statue of
Sakyamuni, and to decide on the new Panchen Lama, whose choice is
subject to central government's approval.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the soul boy for the Panchen Lama announced by the
Dalai Lama is "unlawful and invalid," the statement
declares.

<P>
LHASA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture and
Tibet Autonomous Region's Comprehensive Development Office have
jointly set up five prefecture-level centers for the expansion of
agricultural technology since 1991.
</P>
<P>
A further 43 county level similar centers, and five village
level centers, were also established during the period.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region has improved the breeding of 150,000
cattle and 180,000 sheep, and raised the prevention rate of animal
diseases to 95 percent, which has laid a sound basis for further
developments in the autonomous region's animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan(1996-2000) period, the autonomous
region has ambitious plans to set up 190 county-level centers, for
the expansion of agricultural techniques. It also wants to
increase the number of its agricultural technicians to 2,000, in a
bid to ensure that 40 percent of its peasants have access to one
or two training classes for agricultural techniques each year.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the spreading of agricultural technology, the
autonomous region has set up an awards scheme, and allocated
special funds, in an attempt to encourage more widespread use of
agricultural techniques.

<P>
LANZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Computers and modern technology
have revolutionised banking and financial services in northwest
China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Many residents in the hinterland province now draw money with
computers, and pay bills with credit cards, exposing more people
to the benefits of modern technology.
</P>
<P>
A manager in a local bio-technology company said that the
modern banking system enabled him to settle transactions at any
place, "saving me much time."
</P>
<P>
Credit cards have spurred trade in ethnic minority regions,
where holders of the credit cards have found that they do not have
to carry cash with them when conducting business.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has exerted efforts to upgrade its
underdeveloped banking system.
</P>
<P>
In the Gansu Branch of People's Construction Bank of China, one
of the four state commercial banks in the country, more than 70
percent of deposits, and 80 percent of accounting, have been
processed electronically.
</P>
<P>
The branch has issued 16,600 credit cards, which have been used
in transactions totalling 841 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The local branch of the Bank of China has also successfully
introduced electronic operations, and issued many credit cards.
</P>
<P>
The computerized banking system has made it convenient for
people to save money, said the deputy provincial governor Cui
Zhenhua. Deposits at all financial institutions in Gansu rose
almost fifty percent to 62.8 billion yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The banks in Gansu have widely applied computerised management
systems, and launched automatic telling services in some
department stores.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Refuses New Parliament, Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Leader of Bangladesh's main
opposition party Sheikh Hasina Tuesday asked the people not to
obey the "illegal" government led by Begum Khaleda Zia and
reiterated that the "non-cooperation" campaign would continue till
the government steps down.
</P>
<P>
"We don't accept this illegal government, we don't accept this
illegal parliament," Hasina, president of the largest opposition
Awami (People's) League (AL), told a public meeting prior to a
march toward the parliament house.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition's strong resistance, the ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which won the February 15
general elections, Tuesday formed the sixth parliament and a new
cabinet led by Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who is also chairperson
of the BNP.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to recognize the legality of the new parliament and
government, Hasina warned that the whole country will be "on fire"
till their demands are met -- the scrapping of the February 15
polls and holding of fresh elections under a neutral caretaker
government.
</P>
<P>
The other two major opposition parties -- the Jatiya (National)
Party and the Jamaat-e-islami, joined the AL in refusing to accept
the new parliament and government based on last month's polls,
which were boycotted by all opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the opposition's "non-cooperation"
campaign starting from March 9, the BNP government promised to
pass a constitutional amendment bill for the formation of a
caretaker government in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the offer has been rejected by the opposition. "Any
bill passed by this illegal parliament will be illegal," said
Rahman Chowdhury, acting chairman of the Jatiya Party.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Likely to End Coffee Stock Retention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is likely to stop its
coffee stock retention as of June this year, a local newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Coffee Exporters Association (AEKI) has made the
proposal in consideration of the fact that the country's coffee
harvest season, starting April, is expected to meet Indonesia's
set export target of 275,000 tons, Noor Madjid, secretary of the
AEKI, told the Neraca newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to Madjid, the proposal was also in anticipation of
the current significant drop in coffee prices on the international
market. During the last two years -- just after coffee retention
was put into force -- prices kept declining.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Coffee Producing Countries made a decision
on the retention scheme in October 1993, with the objectives of
controlling supply and supporting prices. At the beginning of the
retention scheme, coffee prices were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
However, several coffee producing countries including Mexico,
Vietnam, India and the Philippines reportedly did not follow the
retention scheme and they instead quietly supplied their products
to the international market, causing a worldwide surplus and a
decline in prices, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The report said Indonesia consistently carried out coffee stock
retention but did not get benefits as expected. Therefore, it
will review the policy.
</P>
<P>
Madjid said the situation would have to change and that if the
ruling continues, some coffee companies will go bankrupt, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Calls for Tariffs Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Foreign
Trade Minister Morris Harf said today that the "automatic
elimination of tariffs" is one of the key mechanisms for
establishing the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the opening of trade ministers meeting and
business forum of the Americas here.
</P>
<P>
"The automatic elimination of tariffs creates greater
competition because it reduces the possibility that the market
will be dominated by monopolies", a very common phenomenon under
excessive protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 businessmen and 34 ministers from the region
are attending the four-day gathering to analyze the progress made
in the establishment of FTAA and seek more cooperations among the
countries.
</P>
<P>
Harf said that the elimination of tariffs should be
complemented with the elimination of non-tariff barriers to trade
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he noted that that it "will also have to
consecrate the concept of preferential treatment that is granted
in order to reduce the current imbalance among the economies of
the integration area."
</P>
<P>
The idea of establishing FTAA in the year 2005 arose from the
summit of the continent held in Miami, the U.S., in 1994 where it
was agreed that the trade ministers would meet once a year to
prepare for the integration.
</P>
<P>
In compliance with this, the ministers met for the first time
in Denver, the U.S., in 1995 and set up seven working groups to
discuss issues that have the greatest priorities for the FTAA. At
that meeting, it was also agreed that businessmen would play an
active role in the regional integration process.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian minister said that it is very important for the
ministers to propose a schema leading the countries to the path of
integration during the current meeting.

<HEADLINE> Tax Consultants Asked to Form Code of Ethics in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Tax Consultant
Association (IKPI) has been urged to immediately form a code of
ethics and adopt professional standards, a local newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move would prevent any wrongdoings in tax consultations,
Karsono Suryowibowo, secretary to the Tax Directorate General,
told the local newspaper Bisnis Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that as a professional association, the IKPI should
have a code of ethics and professional standards.
</P>
<P>
He argued that a code of ethics is an essential instrument in a
professional organization because it directs the behavior of its
members, while professional standards guide their works.
</P>
<P>
It will also help his office judge the behavior of tax
consultants, he said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there are still tax consultants who fabricate
tax notes in an attempt to manipulate the real taxable amount.
Their wrongdoings will bring losses to the government, he said.

KIEV, March 19 (Xinhua) -- At a meeting with visiting
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, a top Ukrainian
legislator today criticized the United States for attaching
conditions to economic aid.
</P>

Alexander Moroz, chairman of the Supreme Council, said that
instead of aid, Ukraine needs mutually beneficial cooperation
without any strings attached.

He made the remarks when Christopher, who arrived here today

privatization so as to qualify for aid from the United States.

Chistopher said the U.S. appreciated the role the Supreme
Council played in Ukraine's economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Christopher, Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma also said that Ukraine seeks cooperation with the
U.S. based on mutual benefit rather than begging, eventhough it

<HEADLINE> Partnership Needed to Settle Environmental Issues in  Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Partnerships between the
government and private institutions are badly needed in Indonesia
to resolve complex environmental problems, a government minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The government and educational institutional and
non-governmental organizations should work in close partnership to
seek solutions to environmental problems, said State Minister for
Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja at a recent panel discussion in
Bandung, West Java.
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted that there were still many complex
environmental problems bearing socio-cultural features.
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to carry out the policies which take into
account socio-cultural factors because of the existing legal and
technical constraints, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the difficulty in limiting resettlement areas. Policy
makers will have to consider the interest of locals who live as
hunters and therefore want their hunting grounds to remain as
large as possible.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that only by paying proper attention to the
interests of the local people could the principle of partnership
in dealing with environmental problems be applied.

<P>
DHAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and at
least 20 injured in Bangladesh's largest port city of Chittagong
today as violent clashes erupted between government supporters and
opposition activists.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said an 18-year-old opposition activist

at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
The deaths have brought the toll in the country's political
violence to 12 in the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
A series of clashes involving home-made bombs occurred when
supporters of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) tried
to stop a demonstration of the All-Party Opposition Alliance in
Chittagong, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
As the opposition-called non-cooperation campaign entered its
11th day on Tuesday, the movement of cargoes remained paralyzed at
the port of Chittagong, where 23 ships were stranded and 31 ships
were awaiting berths at the outer anchorage.

<HEADLINE> German Retailers Rap European Protectionism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The secretary-general of the
Foreign Trade Retailers Association of Germany, Konrad
Neundoerfer, has accused industrialized countries and the European
Council (EC) of upholding protectionism against imports from
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Neundoerfer said that while the industrialized nations and the
EC often paid lip service to free trade, protectionism was more
conspicuous and prevalent than ever.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the volume of goods that enterprises grouped in
his association imported from developing countries dropped 15.7
percent in the first half of 1995 from the same period of the
previous year, with a 23.3 percent fall in clothing imports.
</P>
<P>
The EC did whatever it could to restrict imports of key
consumer goods from China and these restrictions were not at all
economically justified, he said. As a result, Italy would replace
China as the biggest source of imports for retailers in Germany
this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the drop in imports from developing
countries could also be attributed to the retailers' lack of
confidence in the economic prospects of those countries.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Duma Urged to Reconsider Bills on Soviet Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federation Council
(the upper house of parliament) today appealed to the State Duma
(the lower house of parliament) to review its decision to cancel
an accord which formally dismantled the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The Duma voted on March 15 to nullify the Belovezh accord
signed by Ukraine, Russia and Belarus in Belovezh, a suburb of the
Belarus capital, Minsk, in December 1991 to dissolve the Union and
establish the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
The lower house also passed a bill declaring valid the pro-Union
results of the March 1991 referendum.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the two resolutions has drawn harsh criticism
from the Russian leadership and other CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
At the request of President Boris Yeltsin, the Federation
Council convened today and voted by 116 to 10 to adopt the appeal
to the Duma to carefully re-examine the possible impact from its
decisions.
</P>
<P>
The council said the two bills will add to the difficulty in
accelerating the integration process among the CIS.
</P>
<P>
The upper house reserves the right to raise the issue with the
Constitutional Court, the head of the Federation Council's
Constitutional Committee told the Itar-Tass News Agency after the
vote.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Federation Council, said the
council will try to persuade the Duma to "make wise compromise."

<HEADLINE> Germany Urges More European Cooperation in Aerospace  Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The German government has urged the
European aerospace industry to restructure itself to compete more
effectively against its American rivals.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the cabinet, Norbert Lammert, the government
coordinator of the aerospace sector, stressed the importance of
boosting cooperation among European aerospace companies in making
aircraft and exploring markets.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the decline in the European Airbus consortium's
share of the global market, Lammert said: "The era of individual
action is over." He said the survival of a competitive aerospace
industry in Germany could "make sense only in a European context."
</P>
<P>
The report attributed Airbus' lack of competitiveness to its
present structure and urged the consortium to overhaul its
operations.
</P>
<P>
Airbus is owned jointly by Germany's DASA company, France's
Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Spain's CASA. Although the
companies hold different proportions of Airbus shares, they have
equal say in decision-making and shared responsibility for
spending and profit.
</P>
<P>
"The long-term success of Airbus can be guaranteed only if the
partners agree soon on an efficient corporate structure which is
competitive internationally," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the cabinet meeting, Lammert said
corporate restructuring and the production of large new planes
were two preconditions for the long-term success of Airbus.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would provide loans for developing new
products only after Airbus restructured. In its 1996 budget, the
government allocates 7.4 billion marks (five billion US dollars)
to the aerospace industry, a rise of 300 million marks over 1995.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, at a press conference after the
cabinet meeting, criticized Airbus for missing a chance to enter
the world market for large planes.
</P>
<P>
He said Airbus' American rival Boeing had won orders for
hundreds of planes, reaping huge profits which would have been
shared by Airbus if it had acted quickly.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A no-confidence motion against
the Nepali coalition government is to be tabled by the main
opposition party later today in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
A special house session, demanded by the main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (UML) last week for discussing the
no-confidence motion, was summoned for today by King Birendra
after receiving a petition by 86 UML MPs.
</P>
<P>
The UML lawmakers claimed that the parliament had lost
confidence in the three-party government under Sher Bahadur Deuba,
accusing the ruling coalition led by the Nepali Congress (NC)
party of failing to solve the country's pressing problems
including inflation, corruption and social instability.
</P>
<P>
The UML was expected to table the no-confidence motion formally
later today soon after the special house session starts at 1 p.m.
(GMT 06:45).
</P>
<P>
According to the parliament secretariat, discussions over the
motion would be held Friday and Saturday and the 205-seat house is
to hold a vote on the no-confidence motion Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While the main ruling NC and the main opposition UML party
respectively hold 86 and 88 seats in the lower house, the survival
of the government depends on the National Democratic party (RPP),
the second ruling party of the present government, which have 19
MPs in the house.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- More tourists than ever are
flocking to Xuzhou, in east China's Jiangsu Province, to enjoy
China's rich culture from the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
Xuzhou is the hometown of Emperor Liu Bang, the creator of the
Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-23 A.D.), who led an uprising to
overthrow the Qin Dynasty (221 A.D-207 A.D.), the first unified
Chinese dynasty. After Liu Bang became the emperor, his brother
Liu Jiao was made a king, and Xuzhou became the capital of its
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In the following five hundred years, Liu Jiao and his
ascendants lived in the city, and created a splendid culture
characteristic of the Han Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Last year 1.78 million tourists visited Xuzhou, 20 percent more
than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The most characteristic relics in Xuzhou are Han tombs, stone
paintings and terra-cotta horses and warriors, described as
another major discovery in China after those found in Xi'an. The
stone paintings, together with the stone carvings of Southern
Dynasties (420 A.D.-589 A.D.) in Nanjing and ancient gardens in
Suzhou, are called "three creams" of Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
China's Central Television Station (CCTV) is now building a
film location in Xuzhou, known as "the city of Han Dynasty".
</P>
<P>
In order to promote tourism to the region, the local government
has invested a total of around 5 billion yuan to improve
transportation, telecommunications and services and to build new
scenic spots.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Students in Shanghai want to lead
more musical lives, the China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Municipal Educational Bureau is to invest one
million yuan each year in updating music equipment.
</P>
<P>
But even that is not enough to cope with the huge demand from
Shanghai's schools.
</P>
<P>
According to an investigation by senior music students at the
Shanghai Normal University, over 40 percent of high schools in
Shanghai do not have music classes at all. And the existing
classes are of poor quality.
</P>
<P>
The investigation revealed that while over 40 percent of
students own stereos and CD players, only a few schools have video
recorders and some do not even have tape recorders.
</P>
<P>
But the biggest problem is the lack of music teachers,
especially those with higher degrees.
</P>
<P>
According to the investigation, only one quarter of senior
school music teachers have a bachelor degree and none has a
master's degree.
</P>
<P>
More and more students are calling for music education.
</P>
<P>
Of those questioned, over 60 percent demanded music classes
immediately. More than one quarter of them felt that music
appreciation should be included in the curriculum and more than 15
percent hoped to learn music history and basic music theory.

<HEADLINE> New Centre in Shanghai Assists Troubled Wives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Women in Shanghai now have a
haven against domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
The Nanfang Family Violence Protection Centre in Shanghai
opened two months ago, has received more than 900 calls for help
and has offered protection to 18 women who had been bullied by
their husbands, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Gao Shenren, director of the centre, said that she had not
expected that the centre would be such a big help to so many women.
</P>
<P>
Often, women suffering from domestic violence suppress their
misery for a long time. Some have almost lost hope of living. The
centre has restored to them a sense of safety and will to live,
Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Once a woman came to the centre with a swollen face. Her
husband had beaten her badly. The centre immediately sent her to a
hospital, where she was treated for life-threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
While she was recovering at the centre, she studied law with
the help of the centre's lawyers. Now she has initiated a lawsuit
against her husband for maltreatment.
</P>
<P>
"Our society really needs an agency to help ease family
tensions," said Gao.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- New technology in enterprises
generated 70 percent of annual economic growth in Shenyang,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, during the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
It means that 40 percent of technological advances introduced

of local enterprises. This was a significant improvement compared
with the 1986-1990 period.
</P>

The past five years saw the city invest a total of 15.38
billion yuan, almost double the figure during the previous five
years. The spending was in over 2,000 projects to bring in new
technology, with most now in operation, and expected to add 35
billion yuan in output value.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investment, 8.04 billion yuan was injected into
local pillar industries, such as machines tools, general
machinery, automobiles, computers, medicines and chemical items.
</P>
<P>
These key industries generated a total of 54.2 billion yuan in
output value in 1995, and earned six billion in pre-tax profits,
accounting for 63 percent and 52 percent of the city's
corresponding industrial total, respectively.
</P>

followed by Germany's Anke Huber and Argentina's Gabriela
Sabatini. None of those three competed at Indian Wells.

on Monday for the second week in a row, and for the third week of
the year. However, Pete Sampras needs to win the tournament to
regain the top spot, unless Muster loses before the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Agassi will be trying to join Sampras and
Ivan Lendl as the only players to win back-to-back titles in
Lipton tournament.
</P>
<P>
Agassi reached the number one ranking for the first time with
his victory over Sampras in last year's final. Spain's Arantxa

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Reporter Exposing Child Trade Awarded in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Spain has granted a royal press
prize to Brazilian reporter Ana Beatriz Magno, author of a series
of stories exposing baby trafficking and child organ selling,
local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The stories, entitled "Baby Trafficking," said that organs from
27 missing children were sold to European countries and other
nations for transplantation. Two Brazilian children returned each
with one kidney lost one day after they were kidnapped, the
stories said.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia handed the King
of Spain Prize for International Journalism to the Brazilian daily
Correio Braziliense, which carried the series of seven stories in
1994, the U.S. embassy here accused Spain of "helping spread
dangerous lies" by awarding the prize.
</P>
<P>
The embassy issued a strongly-worded statement expressing its
"regret" and accusing the Spanish government of "associating
itself with a dangerous and damaging fiction."
</P>
<P>
But Spain's EFE news service insisted on its original decision
to grant the award to the winner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Spanish Foreign Ministry issued a statement,
saying it "rejects as inappropriate and out of line the (U.S.)
statements."
</P>
<P>
Magno on Monday held a press conference here, stating that her
reports were results of a full investigation on Europeans' illegal
adoptions of Brazilian children.
</P>
<P>
She said she could not understand why Washington was upset.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see why the Americans are in such a state, since my
stories mentioned neither U.S. citizens nor their government."
</P>
<P>
"The Americans have been putting on pressure about this for
three months now," she added.
</P>
<P>
An international jury of seven people from five nations named
the winner of the King of Spain Prize in December.
</P>
<P>
Reports of illegal adoptions of stolen babies and of
trafficking in organs taken from small children have surfaced
regularly in recent years in Central America and other regions.

COLMBO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police Tuesday detected
three bombs near Seylan Bank in Old Moor Street in Colombo, police
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The three bombs, encased in plastic covers and similar to the

suspects in and around Old Moor Street and are carrying out

<HEADLINE> Turin Summit to Change EU's Voting System: EU Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The focus of the European Union's
forthcoming inter-governmental conference will be on trying to
change the way the EU makes decisions rather than revising the
Maastricht Treaty, a senior EU official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Endymion Wilkinson, EU ambassador to China, said: "The EU
wishes to enlarge the number of member states. In order to do so
we have to change the way in which decisions are made."
</P>
<P>
The reorganization of the EU's decision-making institutions
will top the agenda of the two-day conference, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the inter-governmental conference,
scheduled for March 29 in Turin, Italy, is expected to revise the
Maastricht Treaty which lays out the goals and deadlines for the
EU's political and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
But the ambassador said he did not expect an immediate decision
to be made at the conference on postponing the January 1, 1999,
deadline for the launching of European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it was also impossible for the conference to
lower the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty for EMU.
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to say whether the EU can make the decision by
1997 or 1998," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We stick to and maintain the deadline, but other decisions
which the conference has to take will be changing the EU voting
system," Wilkinson said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the EU Commission would propose to the two-day
inter-governmental conference which subjects should be decided by
consensus, which by qualified majority and which by unanimous
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Qualified majority means that bigger states will have bigger
influence, he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU began with six member states, but with members now
increased to 15, the decision-making process has become more
complicated, Wikinson said, adding, "sure we take decisions but
decisions are taking longer and longer."
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, the number of EU countries is
expected to reach 20 by the end of this century. Poland, Hungary
and Malta are most likely to be the next to join the EU, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bill Violates International Law, Cuban FM Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Economic recovery in Cuba will not
be reversed nor halted by the implementation of the
U.S. Helms-Burton Bill, which aims to tighten and internationalize
the economic blockade against Cuba, said Cuban Foreign Ministry
Roberto Robaina here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Robaina said Cuba's economic strategy will
continue to "enrich itself" and develop economic ties with other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Robaina said that the bill goes against the important
international trade regulations and the spirit of organizations
governing relations among nations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. is showing the most absolute disdain of international
public opinion and the demands of an overwhelming majority of
independent sovereign states, he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the U.S. intention of using hunger as a means
to destroy the Cuban people will fail, just as have all the
U.S. hostile actions against Cuba since 1959 when President Fidel
Castro launched the nation's socialist revolution.
</P>
<P>
"Cuba expresses its firmest determination to defend its
sovereignty, independence and self-determination," the foreign
minister said, Cuba "knows that justice and truth are on its
side," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
Robaina pointed out that the objective of the U.S. bill is "to
punish Cuba for its insistence on determining freely,
independently and as a sovereign power."
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. bill as an attack against the international
community as a whole and also "a test of world government," since
it tries to apply "the weight of U.S. law" on third countries and
forces others to adhere to the U.S.-imposed economic blockade
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bill constitutes "a fundamental act of
aggression" against Cuba, another attempt to impose the
U.S. hegemonical and expansionistic will against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
With the enactment of the bill, "cardinal principles such as
the respect for sovereignty, independence and self-determination
are being dangerously attacked," he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by the U.S. Congress and President Bill
Clinton earlier this month after Cuba shot down two light aircraft
piloted by Cuban exiles based in the United States.

<HEADLINE> HK Researchers to Study Cause of Porpoise Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong scientists are
preparing to carry out research into finless porpoises after a
spate of deaths among the endangered species, according to today's
Eastern Express.
</P>
<P>
The local English newspaper reported that another porpoise was
washed up dead yesterday in Hong Kong waters, bringing to 10 the
total number of such deaths this year, compared to seven for the
whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
Local researchers are mystified as to the cause of death, which
has been linked to lung parasites found in many carcasses.
</P>
<P>
The Marine Mammal Conservation Working Group, a
government-chaired committee focusing on Chinese white dolphins,
has proposed research into the species, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Like the Chinese white dolphin, the finless porpoise is listed
in appendix one of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna.
</P>
<P>
So far little is known about the jet-black meter-long finless
porpoise which inhabits the waters off Hong Kong. Unlike the
Chinese white dolphin, now the focus of research, the finless
porpoise has never been studied.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Fisheries Department has secured four
million HK dollars for a further two-year study on the Chinese
white dolphins and is looking for funding for the porpoise
research, either from the government or private organizations.

<HEADLINE> Integration With Mercosur Will Benefit Chile's Agriculture,  Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chile's integration with the
Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) will benefit the country's
agricultural sector, Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The country is going to win more in agriculture than what it
can lose," he said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Insulza noted that Chile's farm exports to the Mercosur, which
comprises Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, are twice what
it imports from the four countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that agricultural imports from the Mercosur countries
did not enjoy preferential tariff treatment in Chile and this
would have to be negotiated with Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
"It is a necessity because more than 50 percent of our products
that go to that market enjoy preferential tariff treatment," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia has also given the assurance
that an agreement with the Mercosur would not harm Chilean
agriculture, which, he said, needed investment, higher
productivity and more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The remarks of the two ministers were aimed at easing fears in
some Chilean quarters that integration with the Mercosur would be
detrimental to Chilean agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Correa, president of the National Agricultural
Association, said Monday that Chile's partnership with the
Mercosur would spell the end of the nation's farm sector.
</P>
<P>
Correa said that he would call on all the farmers in the
country to mobilize themselves to defend Chilean agriculture.

<HEADLINE> France Not to Join NATO's Military Integration Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said here today that France would not join NATO's
military integration institutions.
</P>
<P>
In answering questions in the National Assembly, de Charette
said France decided to move closer to NATO, "but this does not
mean France will naturally join NATO's military integration
institutions."
</P>
<P>
He urged NATO to conduct reforms, saying "now it's real time to
establish the pillars in NATO's European defense."
</P>
<P>
De Charette said France has discussed this issue with key NATO
members and hoped that the organization would "set the directions
for the far-reaching reforms" at the June meeting in Berlin, and
"finalize its European defense blueprint" at the December meeting
in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
France rejoined NATO's military commission last December and
has since taken part in its defense ministers meetings, action
seen as "the first step" moving close to NATO.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, France has been active in advocating NATO's
reforms, supporting U.S. military presence in Europe while asking
for Europe's own independent, unified forces.
</P>
<P>
On March 13, French Prime Minister Alain Juppe proposed the
creation of a European army of 250,000 to 300,000 to be under
European Union's direct control.

<HEADLINE> More Trees for Sichuan, As Tree-Felling is Cut to Size </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Tree-felling in one of China's
major lumber areas has been cut down to size as part of a major
plan to save the area's vast forests.
</P>
<P>
The planting of saplings across a wide area of 59,000 hectares
during the past decade in parts of Sichuan Province has helped
balance the consumption and growth rate of timber.
</P>
<P>
The program has focussed on the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture
of Garze, situated in east Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the prefecture are within one of the country's
major forest zones, where Jinsha river, the upper reaches of
Jinsha River and Yalong River, the major tributaries of Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
However, the prefecture used to suffer an unbalanced
consumption and growth rate of forest resources, due to
over-lumbering during almost half a century.
</P>
<P>
This caused a series of ecological problems, such as an
increase of mud in the upper reaches of Yangtze River, which
threatened the Three-Gorges Project in the middle reaches of the
river.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, to reduce tree-felling, the provincial government
began to move more than 10,000 lumbermen from the prefecture each
year and give them other jobs.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also helped the prefecture to change
its lumbering-oriented economy into an agricultural and industrial
economy, by developing traffic, hydroelectric power, mining,
township enterprises and other industries in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
In addition, nursery gardens have been set up, and the use of
plastic shields has been increased to speed up the growth of
saplings and raise their survival rate.

KIEV, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today repeated Washington's support for Ukraine's
independence, territorial integrity and inviolable borders.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Christopher downplayed a bill passed by
Russia's State Duma (lower house of parliament) last week
declaring invalid an accord that dismantled the Soviet Union and
created the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State, who arrived here today for a one-day
visit, said the bill had no legal force and was only designed to
influence voters in the June presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Washington and Kiev will continue their high-level constructive
dialogue on bilateral relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Ukraine's stance on NATO's planned eastward
expansion, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said Kiev
pursues a non-aligned policy but is ready to widen its cooperation
with NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that NATO will take positive measures to
establish a common security system in Europe, adding that Ukraine
has formally invited NATO's Secretary General Javier Solana
Madariaga to visit the country.
</P>
<P>
Besides Udovenko, Christopher also met Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma, Parliamentary Speaker Alexander Morotz and Prime
Minister Evgeny Marchuk.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body FIFA
denied on Tuesday they had already agreed a television
broadcasting rights deal for the 2002 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Keith Cooper said in FIFA's headquarter Zurich that
they were looking at all offers as contracts with the public
broadcasting consortium CCC expired with the 1998 World Cup in
France, but had not made a final decision.
</P>
<P>
A TV deal will be agreed on May 31, the day before the FIFA
annouced the venue for the 2002 World Cup final, which is
considered whether South Korea or Japan.
</P>
<P>
FIFA was paid 95 million Swiss francs (80 million U.S. dollars)
for the 1990 World Cup, 115 million Swiss francs (96.5 million
dollars) for 1994 and 135 million Swiss francs (113 million
dollars) for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cooper said the 1998 deal was being renegotiated as the number
of finalists had been increased from 24 to 32 countries.

<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 6.9
magnitude on Richter scale hit several prefectures in Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China late on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The State Seismological Bureau says casualties are being
assessed, after damage to homes was reported in areas hit by the
quake. Telephone links in some prefectures have been cut off.
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred at 23:00 hours on March 19 (Beijing time),
with an epicenter of 39.9 degrees north latitude and 76.8 east
longitude, northeast of Artux Prefecture.
</P>
<P>

London, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The London High Court rejected on
Tuesday tennis stars Mats Wilander and Karel Novacek's plea to
temporarily halt the International Tennis Federation's
disciplinary proceedings in the cocaine drug case against them.
</P>
<P>
The doubles partners and long-time friends went to the High
Court to prevent ITF from taking further actions in the case until
after a full trial in June, where they attempt to show that tennis
has unfair drug testing.
</P>
<P>
The players claim there were irregularities at the French
laboratory that conducted the tests last year.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Abady, the American laywer of the two players, said they
would appeal against judge Justice Lightman's decision and again
seek an injunction to stop a hearing in the ITF appeals tribunal
April 10-11.
</P>
<P>
At the appeal tribunal, Wilander and Novacek will have to prove
they did not take cocaine at the French Open last year, as the
dope tests indicated, or they will face a three-month suspension
covering both the French Open and Wimbledon.

<HEADLINE> China to Attract More Foreign Funds for Agriculture (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China is expected to hold a large international seminar in
April as part of the efforts to elaborate China's strategic goals
for developing its agriculture, clarify key steps China is to take
to reform its agricultural system, introduce China's opening-up
policies in agriculture and the major fields in which China is to
strengthen international co-operation in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
To offer more effective information for foreign investors,
China's Ministry of Agriculture has published two lists of
possible projects as well as policies and procedures for foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
More than 10.1 billion US dollars in foreign capital has flowed
into China's agriculture since China initiated the reform drive in
the late 1970s, said officials with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The capital breaks down into 4.51 billion US dollars in direct
foreign investment, 4.2 billion US dollars in loans from the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank, 800 million US dollars
offered by the United Nations' subsidiaries, and 260 million US
dollars in loans from the International Fund for Agricultural
Development.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program under the United Nations has financed 57
projects to produce more grain for more than 20 million farmers in
169 counties across China.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's loans have helped China improve productivity
in areas of saline-alkali and red soil, and cultivate better
seeds. The European Community has donated nearly one billion yuan
to ensure that residents in 20 major cities have fresh milk every
day.

<HEADLINE> China Seeks More Foreign Funds for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to take new measures
to attract more overseas funds for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"To boost foreign investment in agriculture, China will draw up
preferential policies in the fields of domestic taxes and foreign
trade taxes, and create better conditions for foreign enterprises
to use land, hire labor and select products to develop," said Liu
Congmeng, a top Chinese agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
"We will lure foreign businessmen to the rich agricultural
resources in the midwestern China, and encourage foreign
investment in China's hinterland," said Liu, director of the
Department of International Co-operation of the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
While making use of loans provided by international financial
institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank, China is also expected to lure more direct commercial
investment, Liu disclosed.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign entrepreneurs are welcome to set up enterprises to
process agricultural products, upgrade rural enterprises,
construct markets for agricultural products and develop China's
agriculture comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
"Investing in China's agriculture is a profitable choice for
foreign businessmen as China has 900 million farmers and a huge
market for agricultural products, and it is doing its best to
raise people's living standards," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
According to official Chinese documents released last August,
China will need seven billion US dollars in foreign capital to
fuel its agricultural growth from 1996 to 2000.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reaches For The Sky With Its Rocket Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's space industry will
be reaching for the sky with a record high this year.
</P>
<P>
Five carrier rockets made by China's largest city will be sent
into space during 1996, the highest number ever in one year.
</P>
<P>
Four of the rockets will be used to launch satellites,
including China's first static orbit meteorological satellite
"Fengyun No.2", and a retrievable satellite.
</P>
<P>
Space scientists in Shanghai developed the "Fengbao No.1"
carrier rocket in the 1970s, pioneered the sending of three
satellites into the sky with one rocket in the early 1980s, and
succeeded in launching China's first synchronous orbit
experimental telecommunications satellite.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the major space base in Shanghai has sent two
meteorological satellites, and two retrievable satellites into
space with "Long March" rocket series.
</P>
<P>
So far 13 successful launches have been made with "Long March"
rockets, involving 15 satellites of various types made both at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Center Helps Unemployed Women Train For New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A special agency in Beijing's
Dongcheng District has helped some 400 unemployed women workers to
find new jobs over the past year, the "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Dongcheng Employment Service Center for Women, the first
and only of its kind in the capital, was established by the
Dongcheng Labour Bureau in March of last year.
</P>
<P>
Every Monday the centre provides free consultations and advice
to women seeking employment.
</P>
<P>
Ma Shulan, deputy director of the centre, said that the centre
has given free consultations to more than 4,000 women and
distributed 5,000 leaflets publicizing State labour policies.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,700 women have received professional training from
the centre.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that five out of eight of the workers at the centre are
women between 30 and 40 years old who know how difficult it can be
for women to find satisfactory employment.
</P>
<P>
Liang Wenfang, a woman in her thirties who is in charge of
employment "match-making" at this centre, said that some laid-off
women workers feel deserted by society and vent their anger by
insisting that the center find them jobs instantly.
</P>
<P>
Liang said these women usually had lost their jobs because they
were aging, because they were not trained in advanced technology
or because their companies had decided to reduce their staff.
</P>
<P>
Liang and her colleagues work to introduce professional
training to them.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises, such as the Beijing Hengshan Food Co, are
willing to hire women workers who have been laid off because they
find these women often have necessary social experience.

<P>
CARACAS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Defense Minister
Moises Orozco Graterol today downplayed the coup d'etat rumors
that have been circulating in the country, saying that relevant
press reports were "frivolous."
</P>
<P>
The defense minister denied a local radio report that a
possible coup was supposedly hatched in the state of Aragua,
northern Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
"There is no movement of conspiracy and I believe that it is
very irresponsible that some people are launching this information
that unsettles the country," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces are dedicated to the obligation, which
includes the efforts to maintain the integrity and the sovereignty
of the country's territory, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> More Ecological Education Needed: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese people surveyed say
they are aware of environmental protection, but know little about
State laws in the area in China, the national English-language
newspaper China Today reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing-based newspaper, a nationwide survey
on the subject found that 76 percent of the 4,000 respondents said
they knew what environmental protection was, but did not know much
about State regulations.
</P>
<P>
A report on the result of the survey, the first in China, was
scheduled to be released today, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that more than 70 percent of the people showed
little confidence in the environmental awareness of other people.
</P>
<P>
Most people said they oppose over-exploitation of natural
resources and leaving environmental problems to the younger
generation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report will be reviewed at a three-day Sino-British
symposium on how to improve public awareness of the environment,
which opened in the capital city of Beijing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the Chinese Society for
Environmental Sciences and the Culture and Education Section of
the British Embassy.

<HEADLINE> Xi'an Police Hold Relics-Selling Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Police in China have detained two
people accused of concealing and intending to sell three
1,300-year-old Buddha statues.
</P>
<P>
Villager Zha Chengwa and bulldozer driver Sun Baojiang
unearthed the white marble statues in winter of 1992 when they
were digging a fish pond near Xizha Village in suburban Xi'an,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Instead of reporting the finds to the government, they hid the
relics and tried to sell them at price of four million yuan (about
480,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Police in Xi'an seized the statues in Zha's and Sun's
homes last December and last week they captured the fleeing
suspects.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Shaanxi Relics Appraisal Team said the
statues, 68 centimeters, 59.5 cm and 55 cm high, were "very
possibly related with Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty
(618-907)".
</P>
<P>
The excavation site where the statues were unearthed is only
about 1,000 m away from the Ganye Temple, where Wu Zetian had
practised Buddhism. Experts concluded that the exquisite statues
"obviously were objects for royal families".
</P>
<P>
They said the find is very important in research into Buddhist
relics.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an served as the capital city of Tang Dynasty. It is
also famous for the find of terracotta horses and warriors of Qin
Dynasty (221-207 BC).

<HEADLINE> Japanese Students Show Enthusiasm for "Hope Project" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 209 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 Japanese
high-school students who are traveling in China enthusiastically
support the country's "Hope Project", which is aimed at helping
school drop-outs in poor areas resume their educations.
</P>
<P>
They attended a report meeting here today on the poor
educational conditions in China's countryside as well as its
educational development and achievements.
</P>
<P>
The event was sponsored by the China Office of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
After the meeting the students donated textbooks and exercise
books along with stationery to poor Chinese children in north
China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Most of the students come from rich families in Japan, and they
take education for granted. "I didn't expect to see so many poor
children in mountainous areas and on the grasslands who can't go
to school owing to poverty," said one of the Japanese students.
</P>
<P>
"We visited the Great Wall, Palace Museum and Summer Palace in
Beijing, which reflect the ancient civilization of China," she
said, adding that she hoped that Chinese children could look
forward to a better education in order to carry forward the
outstanding cultural heritage of China.
</P>
<P>
Other students agreed to let more Japanese young people know
about the "Hope Project", and help the school drop-outs continue
their schooling.
</P>
<P>
The "Hope Project", which was launched by the China Children's
Educational Development Foundation six years ago, has received
large amounts of funds from UNESCO to build a "Hope Primary
School" in Hebei Province and 13 primary schools in tents for the
children of herdsmen in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
A UNESCO official said that UNESCO will provide more programs
to let Japanese tourists and students get to know about the "Hope
Project".
</P>
<P>
The programs will further promote cultural exchanges and
friendship between Chinese and Japanese students, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the students also held discussions with a group of
local middle-school students during their one-week stay in
Beijing.

<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- British umpire Stewart Hague
resigned from the Badminton Umpires Association Monday after being
passed over for the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Hague, who worked 25 years for the association as a top court
official, quit his job in protest at a selection process he
believes to be haphazard and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
He said good umpires are being overlooked and the selection
seems to show a lot of bias. He hoped his resignation raises a few
eyebrows and helps the lot of umpires.
</P>
<P>
Hague, 51, is still four years short of the International
Badminton Federation retiring age for umpires. He was involved in
controversy at the Barcelona Olympics when he called a service
fault against a Chinese pair in the womens' doubles final.
</P>
<P>
In his career, Hague has officiated at the World Cup, Thomas
Cup, Uber Cup, European and Commonwealth Championships and
Olympics.

MOSCOW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Chess Federation
(FIDE) president backed a controversial plan on Thursday to stage
the world championship in Baghdad, according to reports of the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who was elected head of the FIDE last year,
said that the match between Russia's Anatoly Karpov and Russian
born American Gata Kamsky, with prize money of two million
U.S. dollars, would start as planned on June 1.
</P>
<P>
When asked what would happen if the United States refused to
allow Kamsky, a New York resident, to play in Iraq, Ilyumzhinov
said the U.S. State Department had not given an official reply to
appeals by himself and Kamsky.
</P>
<P>
Ilyumzhinov said FIDE had alternative venues for the match. "It
could be Israel, the United States...," he added. "In order to
save chess, it should be taken away from politics or politics
from chess."
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to address the United Nations and prove the
necessity of holding the match in this Arab country," Interfax

<HEADLINE> UK Government May Overshoot Public Borrowing  Target: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (xinhua) -- The British government seems set
to overshoot its target for public borrowing this year, after it
collected less tax than expected in February while spending more
than it planned.
</P>
<P>
The likely overshooting casts fresh doubts on the ability of
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to provide significant tax cuts
before the general election due next year, said local press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the budget in November, the Treasury forecast a
decline from 35.9 billion pounds (54.6 billion U.S. dollars) to 29
billion pounds (44 billion dollars) in annual borrowing, but
figures for the first 11 months of the year suggest the figure
will be about 32 billion pounds (48.55 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to data published by the Treasury Monday, the
government had to borrow 3 billion pounds (4.55 billion dollars)
in February to bridge the gap between spending and revenue, taking
the total amount borrowed in the first 11 months of the financial
year to 22.6 billion pounds (34.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
There is usually a surge in borrowing in the last month of the
financial year as local authorities and government departments
rush to spend money allocated for the year.
</P>
<P>
The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) reached 11.9
billion pounds (18 billion dollars) in March 1995 and another big
figure is expected for March this year.
</P>
<P>
Monday's figures show that government departments have
increased their spending by 4.3 percent so far this year, against
a budget forecast of 3.8 percent spending growth for the financial
year as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The underlying trend cast doubt on the government's ability to
meet its target of reducing the PSBR to 29 billion pounds (44
billion dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that even if departmental budgets are squeezed,
the government's problem is that it appears to be receiving less
revenues than expected, particularly from the value-added tax.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months, central government revenues rose by
only 9 percent, compared with a forecast for the whole year of 9.6
percent.

<HEADLINE> Perot's Name to Go on Ballots in Some States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Ross Perot has agreed to have
his name placed on the presidential ballot in Texas, Florida and a
dozen more states, though he said he will step aside once his new
Reform Party picks a standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
Using Perot as a "stand-in candidate" on the ballot has been an
option since he first began organizing the new party last year.
</P>
<P>
Petition drives are under way in Florida, Texas and Maryland,
</P>
<P>
"A sense is settling in among the public out there that there
ought to be more choices" than Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, the
Associated Press quoted Russell Verney, Perot's top political
aide, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A month ago Perot said "no" when asked if he would run again.
But recently, he has reopened the door to a second campaign if the
organizers of the new party drafts him.
</P>
<P>
Most political observers expect Perot to be the Reform Party
candidate.
</P>
<P>
The organization plans a Labor Day weekend convention to select
a presidential and vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The party has already qualified in five states, including
California, and has filed petitions in Ohio, Maine and Arkansas.
There are legal disputes in Maine and Ohio about whether the Perot
group filed enough valid signatures, and the effort fell short in
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Reform Party organizers are working to qualify in other states,
and Perot will be listed as the candidate in any state that
requires a name before the Reform Party convention, his spokeswoman
Sharon Holman and Verney said. Florida and Texas are among these
states.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian National Youth
Service Corps (NYSC) is expected to carry out a new project
called "Operation Roll Back To The Desert".
</P>
<P>
Soyemi Sofoluwe, the NYSC Director-General, said today that
the aim of the project is to reduce and possibly stop further
desert encroachment into Nigeria through the planting of trees.
</P>
<P>
The program will be carried out in collaboration with the
African Environmental Action Network, which is Nigeria's newest
non-governmental environment organization.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show the land area devastated by the Sahara
Desert in Nigeria, the oil giant in Africa, was 20 times more
than the same geographical area affected by oil pollution.
</P>
<P>
At least 45,000 trees, representing the current number of
corps members, are expected to be planted this year.
</P>
<P>
The NYSC was created in 1973 to promote the national unity by
mobilization of the nation's youth.

<HEADLINE> Synthetic Chemicals Can Disrupt Fertility, Says  American Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Some American scientists have
warned that humans and wildlife are facing a new and serious
threat from synthetic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes from a new book, "Our Stolen Future," written
by Dr. Theo Colborn, a senior scientist at the World Wildlife
Fund, Dianne Dumanoski, a reporter for the Boston Globe, and Dr.
John Peterson Myers, director of the W. Alton Jones Foundation, an
environmental group. The book has received considerable attention.
</P>
<P>
These chemicals mimic natural hormones like estrogen and even
in minute quantities can disrupt vital processes like fertility
and fetal development, the scientists explained.
</P>
<P>
According to them, the so-called endocrine-disrupting chemicals
are widespread in earth and water and may be wreaking many
insidious forms of damage, like a decline in men's sperm counts,
an epidemic of breast and prostate cancer and fetal effects that
emerge later as reduced intelligence, hyperactivity and violent
behavior.
</P>
<P>
In a forward to the new book, U.S. Vice-President Albert Gore
described the book "critically important" and compared it with
"Silent Spring," Rachel Carson's 1962 book that set off a movement
to ban DDT and other pesticides.

JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The government of South
Africa will hold a major consultation with the business giants in
the country to attract private investment in its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Details of the two-day session, to be presided over by

Officials say the government will release its infrastructural

Reports say the businessmen, keen to invest in projects which

Despite this, the business giants said they are optimistic
that the conference would build mutual understanding and

The two sides are reported to have agreed to form an army of

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Iraq to Allow Inspection of All Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
reiterated today that the Iraqi government must allow the U.N.
Special Commission inspection teams immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted access to all sites designated by the commission for
inspection.
</P>
<P>
Security Council president Legwaila J. Legwaila of Botswana
said in a statement that the council has noted with growing
concern that Iraq blocked five times U.N. arms inspection teams
from access to designated sites between March 8 and 15.
</P>
<P>
"In all of these cases, access was subsequently granted only
after unacceptable delays," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the
Special Commission in the conduct of its inspections and the other
tasks entrusted to it by the council," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The council considered that Iraq's delays in permitting the
inspection team recently in Iraq access to the sites concerned
constituted clear violations by Iraq of the provisions of
resolutions 687, 707 and 715.
</P>
<P>
The council recalled that under Resolution 687 Iraq was required
to permit "immediate on-site inspection of Iraq's biological,
chemical and missile capabilities, based on Iraq's declarations
and designation of any additional locations by the Special
Commission itself."
</P>
<P>
By its Resolution 707, the council demanded that Iraq "allow
the Special Commission, the International Atomic Energy Agency and
their inspection teams immediate, unconditional and unrestricted
access to any and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and
means of transportation which they wish to inspect."

<HEADLINE> US Housing Starts Up 3 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in the U.S.
rose 3 percent in February to the highest level in more than a
year, the Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that construction of new homes
and apartments totaled 1.49 million at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate, the highest since 1.51 million in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The department also reported that housing starts had increased
a revised 1.5 percent in January, to a 1.45 million rate, slower
than the 4.4 percent original estimate. The slower growth was due
to the severe cold and blizzards which hit the eastern area of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Starts fell 2.3 percent in December, when severe weather also
covered much of the nation. Housing starts totaled 1.35 million in
1995, down from 1.46 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The housing market was improving this month. A survey in early
March showed that the Home Builders' Housing Market Index
measuring builders' expectations shot up 10 points to 60. The
level was the highest since May 1994 and the gain was the biggest
since the index was established in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The Home Builders attributed the increase to improved weather
and the anticipation of higher mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.17 percent in
February, up from 7.03 percent in January, though still well below
the 9 percent range at the beginning of 1995.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rejects US Statement on Court Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government today
rejected a U.S. statement slamming the decision by a Lebanese
court to acquit two men tried for kidnapping and murdering two
American diplomats and their Lebanese driver in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Lashing out at the issuing of the statement instead of lodging
a complaint to the Lebanese government, the Lebanese Foreign
Ministry said in a statement today that "the statedment issued by
the American Embassy, in its style and content, goes out of
international practices and pacts, especially the Vienna
Convention on the diplomatic relations issued in 1961."
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese authorities have treated the case mentioned by
the Embassy's statement, and they will also continue to treat all
cases according to the laws and systems." the Foreign Ministry
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut accused the
decision by the Lebanese top appeal court as going against "the
interests of justice and the interests of the Lebanese people."
</P>
<P>
the U.S. statement expressed hope that Lebanon would
demonstrate that "it is no longer a place where terrorists take
refuge without fear of punishment."
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the Court of Cassation acquitted Bassem Farkh
and Namek Kamal. No decision was made on a third man in the case
who is still on the run.
</P>
<P>
The three men were members of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a radical Palestinian group which
was involved in the early stages of the Lebanese 1975-90 civil
war.
</P>
<P>
In the verdict, the court said the case was covered by an
amnesty declared at the end of the 1975-1990 civil war for
political crimes committed during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry statement said the verdict of the appeal
court "is based on a justification that the kidnapping case is
covered by the amnesty law and is independent from the killing
cases which will be tried in a near future."
</P>
<P>
The statedment said, "A possibility remains to re-open the case
on condition that there are necessary elements which are still
unknown for the judicial authority."
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed Lebanon's commitment to the peace process, and
underlined that Lebanon condemns terrorism, but refuses to
describe as terrorism the resistance against the Israeli
occupation on the Lebanese land and the self-defense right at a
time when Israel continues to carry out agressions against this
country.
</P>
<P>
Before issuing the statement, Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
summoned U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Richard Jones at the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, the U.S. Ambassador said that he had
nothing more to say on the statement issued by his embassy on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Lebanese foreign minister said the
U.S. Embassy statement is unacceptable "on the whole and in
detail" after his talks with President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz described the U.S. statement as "an interference in
Lebanon's interior affairs."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today welcomed the recent parliamentary and presidential elections
held in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Security Council congratulated
the people of Sierra Leone on the courage and determination they
have shown in proceeding with the elections despite difficulties
and disruptions.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed the hope that the people of Sierra Leone
would continue their efforts towards democracy and peace,
especially by making a peaceful transition to civilian rule and
maintaining cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"The council stresses the importance it attaches to a peaceful
transition to civilian rule," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It welcomes the commitment by the chairman of the National
Provisional Ruling Council to hand over authority by 31 March 1996
and calls upon all concerned to cooperate fully with the newly
elected president and parliament," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the end of violence, the council called upon the
rebels of the Revolutionary United Front to accept the outcome of
the elections, maintain the cease-fire and enter into a full
dialogue for peace, without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The Council is of the view that the circumstances created by
the successful conclusion of the elections in Sierra Leone require
redoubled efforts to end the fighting in that country," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
After two rounds of elections, Tejan Kabbah of the People's
Party was elected president of this western African country, which
has been in civil war since 1992 and has been under control of
successive military governments.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary United Front has been fighting the military
government. And they are not willing to accept the outcome of the
elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey urged Germany today to
take more concrete measures toward the Kurds who have held riot
demonstrations in Dortmund, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel told reporters
that Turkey "understood and appreciated" the very justified
reaction of the German officials and the public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"But, of course, more concrete measures should be taken, and
this is our expectation," said Akbel.
</P>
<P>
This point is expected to be conveyed to German Foreign
Ministry State Secretary Peter Hartman, who will pay a visit to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people were injured in pitched battles at the
weekend as German police tried to stop thousands of Kurds from
attending a banned protest in Dortmund organized by the Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
German President Roman Herzog Monday condemned the PKK
militants for the political violence and warned that foreigners
involved in rioting will forfeited their right to live in Germany
and should leave that country.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl also said that those who were involved
in the riots would be deported.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting for independence in southeastern
Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther has said, "The PKK
carries terrorism not only to Turkey but to the whole of
Europe".

<HEADLINE> 10 Westerners Arrested in Egypt for Distributing Booklets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Ten Westerners, including six
Americans, were arrested in Egypt's Mediterranean port city of
Alexandria today for illegally distributing booklets, the Middle
East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet is in Arabic and entitled "The Hidden Program
Which Nobody Dares to Discuss and What Is behind the New World
Order and How It Will Affect You," MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The group, which also included two Poles, a Canadian and an

MENA said, citing a statement issued by the Ministry of Interior.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution has been notified to look into the case, MENA
said, without giving further details.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Syria's Ruling Party Official Meets with Chinese Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Vice General Secretary of
Syria's ruling Socialist Arab Baath Party Abdulla al Ahmar met
here today with a visiting Chinese delegation on ways of
developing cooperation and friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was led by Qian
Weichang, vice chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides exchanged views on further
developing the bonds of cooperation and friendship between the
peoples of Syria and China through the activating cooperation
between the Socialist Arab Baath Party and the Progressive
National Front in Syria, on the one hand, and the Chinese
Communist Party and the CPPCC National Committee, on the other.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Chinese delegation on the Middle East peace
process, Ahmar said that Syria adheres to the regional peace
process which was initiated at the Madrid conference in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Syria's genuine desire for establishing a just and
comprehensive peace on the basis of the relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions. He indicated that Israel, not serious in its
approach to peace negotiations, has resorted to the policy of
procrastination and delay, thus failing to respond to the
pre-requisites for a just and comprehensive peace as spelled out
in the Madrid conference.
</P>
<P>
Ahmar added that Syria is opposed to terrorism, but it
distinguishes the right of people to resist occupation of their
territories from terrorism that harms innocent people. He said
that Syria and other countries had suffered from terrorism which
Israel was actually practicing.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Qian Weichang applauded the growing relations
between the Chinese and Syrian people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the tension in the Strait of Taiwan, he pointed out
that Taiwan was an inseparable part of the Chinese territories,
adding that China would never permit a foreign power to interfere
with its internal affairs and that China was capable of unifying
the motherland.
