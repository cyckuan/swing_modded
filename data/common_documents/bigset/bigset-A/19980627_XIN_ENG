<HEADLINE> Construction of Key Railway Roads in Southwest China Commences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Construction of two railway trunk
lines in southwest China started here today.
</P>
<P>
One railway road links Neijiang City in southwest China's
Sichuan Province with Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province in the
same region.
</P>
<P>
The 879-km-long road, one of the state-listed key projects for
the 1996-2000 period, will cost an estimated investment of 11.6
billion yuan (1.4 billion U.S. dollars), which will be shared by
the Ministry of Railways and the governments of Sichuan, Guizhou
and Yunnan provinces.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to open to traffic in 2001 and be
transformed into an electrified line in the following year with a
designed transport capacity of 17 million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
Another project is the transformation of a double-track railway
road between Zhuzhou, in central China's Hunan Province, and
Liupanshui in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
It will become an electrified road upon completion in 2002. The
project will cost an investment of 23 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Operation of the two roads will alleviate traffic jam in
southwest China and cut the distance between Chengdu, capital of
Sichuan Province, and Fangchenggang in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
region by 385 km.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Lowers Statutory Reserve Requirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia announced Friday
that it will lower the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) of
merchant banks, commercial banks and finance companies in the
country by two percentage points to eight percent of their
eligible liabilities from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara (Central Bank) said in a statement that the measure
is aimed at further reducing the cost of funds to banking
institutions and improving the efficiency of the intermediation
process in providing financing to productive economic activities.
</P>
<P>
It said the reduction in the SRR represents part of a series of
measures that would be taken to ensure that the Malaysian economy
does not spiral into a major economic slowdown while maintaining
macroeconomic objectives announced earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Explaining that the lower funding cost would enable
institutions to lower their lending rates, the bank said a two
percentage points reduction in SRR to eight percent would reduce
the base lending rate (BLR) of the commercial banks by 0.21
percent and that of finance companies by 0.27 percent.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in SRR would release about 8.0 billion ringgit
(about 2 billion U.S. dollars) of funds to the banking
institutions, the liquidity in the interbank market would be
closely monitored and the three-month Bank Negara Malaysia
intervention rate would remain unchanged, it added.
</P>
<P>
On February 16, the SRR was cut from 13.5 percent to the
current 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the interest rate policy would have to
take into consideration the significant deceleration in monetary
and credit growth and the slowdown in economic activity in the
first half of 1998 as well as the need to maintain exchange rate
stability.
</P>
<P>
Credit growth of the banking system slowed down from 30.4
percent at the end of June 1997 to 12 percent at the end of May
1998 while Malaysia's real gross domestic product (GDP) declined
by 1.8 percent in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank noted that inflation during April and May this
year, however, has stabilized in the region of 5.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Elected Into New N. Irish Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams became
one of the first members to be elected to the new Northern Ireland
Assembly Friday, election officials said.
</P>
<P>
Adams, whose party is the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), took one of six seats in the strongly Roman
Catholic West Belfast constituency.
</P>
<P>
Adams was elected in the first of several counts due to take
place in Belfast's City Hall for the four constituencies in the
city out of 18 across the British-ruled province.
</P>
<P>
The election paves the way for Adams to become a minister in a
12-member ruling executive at the head of a 108-seat assembly that
will give the province its first taste of self-rule in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that Sinn Fein has taken up seats in
a provincial administration under British sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Martin Mcguinness, one of Sinn Fein's top leaders, also won a
seat in the assembly in the Mid Ulster constituency.
</P>
<P>
Estimates are that the total voter turn-out was around 70
percent -- lower than last month's referendum on the peace
agreement, but higher than last year's general elections.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
would stay in Moscow next week to follow Duma debates on a
government-proposed program, the Kremlin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prompting Yeltsin to delay his pre-scheduled overseas tour is
the agenda of Duma, or the lower house of parliament, to
deliberate on ways to handle the country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The president did not think it would be proper for his absence
for four days when his country was faced with a crisis, his Press
Secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin initially planned to start on July 1 a visit to
Kazakhstan. And on July 3, he would join a summit meeting with his
counterparts from China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday, the Kremlin announced postponing the trip to
September.

<P>
XI'AN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Following are some titbits in the
first full day U.S. President Bill Clinton spent in China:
</P>
<P>
-- Shopping at Handicraft Stands
</P>
<P>
People of Xiahe village near the site of the terra-cotta
warriors are known for their business mind, and today they
impressed visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Sure they wouldn't miss the big chance today when the U.S.
president came to visit their village in the outskirts of Xi'an.
They lined up hand-made clothing and cute little toys on the
stands along the road to the village.
</P>
<P>
Clinton walked up to one of the stands for a closer look at the
goods and apparently was very interested in the handicrafts made
of bright red home-woven cloth with Chinese traditional designs
such as dragons and spiders.
</P>
<P>
"How much is this?" the president asked, pointing at a wall
decoration composed of miniatures of the 12 animals representing
the Chinese lunar year.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty yuan (around 2.5 U.S. dollars)," answered the owner of
the stand, a young women named He Yanhong.
</P>
<P>
The president bought one.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty yuan is already a real bargain" said He, when someone
suggested she sell it at a lower price to the distinguished guest.
</P>
<P>
Many of the reporters, who came simply because the president
did, left the village wearing red baseball caps with the dragon,
pheonix, tiger on the front.
</P>
<P>
Some bought bright red vest made of homespun cloth, which is
known to local people as "Shaanxi vests."

-- The "Hungry, Thirsty" Await President
</P>
<P>
The professional instinct drived reporters who were able to
cover Clinton's arrival at the Beijing International Airport
within a near reach to secure a satisfying spot, but not
necessarily reminded them of their need for water and food.
</P>
<P>
Awaiting three to four hours in summer heat at the parking
field for the presidential airplane, the reporters were hungry
and thirsty. Many could not help being envious of those thoughtful
enough to bring mineral water and snacks with them.
</P>
<P>
Out of security consideration, however, the reporters who had
gone through strict security procedures were not allowed to go
out.
</P>
<P>
But the reality was that they had to be there for another two
or three hours before President Clinton could appear.
</P>
<P>
At the requests of the reporters and after consultation with the
authorities, the Chinese and U.S. security guards finally agreed
that the reporters could get on a special shuttle bus to get some
food and beverages at a nearby hostel outside the airport.
</P>
<P>
When the shuttle bus that came every half an hour reached the
parking field, the hungry and thirsty crammed into the bus.
</P>
<P>
But, again, here comes the long, strict security procedures.
</P>
<P>
-- Excavating News Clues
</P>
<P>
Though "stuck" in the place where they were allowed to stay,
reporters are still reporters.
</P>
<P>
Some used cell phones. Others exchanged information with old
buddies. And almost all were hunting for official information from
Chinese and U.S. official sources.
</P>
<P>
When an official-looking guy was surrounded by a flock of
reporters, seemingly talking about something, some more went "up
close and personal."
</P>
<P>
Then the "official" told the new comers that he and his
crowd were with a Hong Kong television, and were discussing
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"I thought you were with the Information Department of the
Foreign Ministry (of China)," a new comer said with
disappointment.

Surin also said that Thailand, as other countries in the world,
is very interested in Clinton's visit to China.

XI'AN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton was
very pleased today when he succeeded in joining the head
of a Chinese "warrior" to its body.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the "warrior" could not come to life, for it was a
terra-cotta one buried more than 2,000 years ago along with the
first emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC) who unified China
for the first time in the Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is now on a nine-day state visit to China,
said he was very delighted to pitch in restoring a terra-cotta
warrior, enjoying a big laugh after the operation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his wife visited at noon today the No. 1 and No. 2
army vaults of the museum of terra-cotta warriors and the bronze
chariot and horse exhibition hall in the company of Shaanxi
Provincial Governor Cheng Andong and his wife and museum Curator
Wu Yongqi.
</P>
<P>
Clinton completed the last phase of the repair process at the
terra-cotta restoration center of the museum.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yongqi explained that many terra-cotta warriors had been
crushed or fractured after being buried for so many years. It
requires a large amount of meticulous work to restore them.
</P>
<P>
The body and head of the terra-cotta warrior joined by
Clinton today had been pieced together separately. Curator Wu
Yongqi handed the head to Clinton who in turn lifted it carefully
and placed it on the slit of the warrior's neck.
</P>
<P>
Fondling the warrior of his same stature, Clinton said it was
"perfect" and "fantastic."
</P>
<P>
The terra-cotta warriors, located 37 kilometers to the east of
Shaanxi Province's capital Xi'an, were first discovered by local
farmers digging a well in 1974. And a large-scale excavation was
carried out in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
They are among the world's most important archeological
findings in the century and regarded as the Eighth Wonder.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the warrior he had just fixed, Clinton said that
"I've been waiting for 25 years" to come and see the warriors. He
said he had come eventually and had greater enjoyment than
expected.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned twice to the governor and curator in less than an
hour the aspiration he cherished when he was young.
</P>
<P>
In the No. 1 Army Vault there are formations of more than 6,000
terra-cotta chariot warriors and infantry troopers. The Clintons
stepped down to the basement of the vault and were reluctant to
ascend after viewing the warriors for more than a quarter of an
hour.
</P>
<P>
Before concluding his tour of the museum, Clinton signed his
name on the visitors' book, with the inscription: "Thank you for a
wonderful tour."

qualify into the second round as Group H winners.
</P>
<P>
Argentina will take on the runners-up of Group G while Croatia
will have to face the winners of that group.
</P>

The match between Argentina and Croatia was slow and lack-luster

The Argentine team, which need only a draw to win the group,
adopted a counter-attack tactics while the Croatian team also lacked

The Argentine team took one of several chances at the 36th
minutes when Hector Pineda beat a off-side trap and scored the sole

<P>
In the second half, the Argentine team could have scored more
goals but Marcelo Gallardo's shot was just wide at the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
Star striker Gabriel Batistuta, who shares the top position in
the scorers' list with Italian Vieri with four goals each, also put
on a sluggish performance.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income, Spending Climb Up Strongly in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. personal incomes
picked up 0.5 percent in May but spending increased at a slightly
higher pace, the Commerce Department reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in income, to a seasonally adjusted 7.22 trillion
U.S. dollars, reflected gains in all broad categories, including
wages and salaries, which account for more than half of income,
according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, personal consumption expenditures rose 0.6 percent,
to a seasonally adjusted 5.75 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the fact that spending growth was outpacing
income growth, the U.S. savings rate dropped from 4 percent of
disposable, or after-tax, income in December last year to a
10-month low of 3.5 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
While other sectors' personal income was rising, manufacture's
was flat in May after declining 0.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
However, payrolls of service and distributive industries'
surged. Also rising were business owners' income, farmers' income,
transfer payments such as Social Security, rental income,
dividends and interest.
</P>
<P>
The country's spending in May rose most strongly for durable
goods, expensive items expected to last three years or longer. It
increased 2.9 percent, the most in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Spending rose 0.4 percent for nondurable goods and 0.3 percent
for services.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland to Launch Road Safety Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's national road
safety council said Friday that it would launch a national road
safety campaign to curb the high incidence of road accidents in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The campaign would include road safety awareness booklets
aimed at adults, workshops for teachers to enable them to educate
pupils, radio and television programs and road safety clubs at
schools, council secretary Sibusiso Dlamini said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The country has one of the worst road accident rates in
Africa, and more than 55.6 million U.S. Dollars worth of property
was lost every year in accidents, South African Press Association
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians should be educated as well as drivers, as half of
those involved in crashes were pedestrians, Dlamini said.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's high road accident rate has been linked to the
country's rate of alcohol consumption, which is among the highest
in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland to Build 20 Dams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland has begun building
20 dams in drought-prone parts of the country at a cost of about
3 million U.S. Dollars, the Agriculture Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
About half of the cost, or 1.5 million Dollars, has been
allocated by the European Union and the Swazi government will
provide the rest, South African Press Association quoted the
ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The dams would provide irrigation for cultivating undeveloped
rural areas in the tiny mountain kingdom, and supply water for
human consumption and livestock. The dams would also be stocked
with fish.
</P>
<P>
The two-year dam project would provide badly needed job
opportunities for Swazis and meanwhile benefit Swazi-owned
construction companies, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Wants Resettlement Accelerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday urged his ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic
Front (ZANU-PF) government to move fast on land redistribution
program to avoid anarchy.
</P>
<P>
He said the move by farmers in Mashonaland East and
Matebeleland North (two provinces) onto commercial farms was a
signal of what could happen countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Last week, about a thousand villagers in the two provinces
occupied several commercial farms. They are now demanding a
written undertaking from the government promising them that they
will be resettled on the farms they have invaded.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was addressing the ZANU-PF's 34th ordinary session of
the central committee meeting, whose main topic was the land
issue, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of land has remained one of great concerns to the
majority of the people, especially as they see no real practical
or physical process on the ground," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
"What are we afraid of? Do we fear the British, International
Monetary Fund or the World Bank and not our own people?" Mugabe
asked.
</P>
<P>
"We must strive to fulfill their right they suffered for, the
right they willingly gave up their sons and daughters in the
struggle, the right our comrades perished for during the
liberation war," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us not continue to lag behind the people's expectations
lest we invite anarchy into a process which so far has been going
smoothly and systematically," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some progress had been made so far with some
five million hectares of commercial land having been acquired
last year.

HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Defense Minister Erkki
Nghimtina said Friday the mission of armed forces should not be
confined to defense against external aggression only.
</P>
<P>
They should include rendering support to the civil authorities
in the maintenance of law and order as well as humanitarian
assistance to civilians, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here at the graduation ceremony for 55 officers from
11 member countries of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), the minister said it was a good thing that African
countries were now participating in peacekeeping missions, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"As family members of the United Nations, we are obliged to
contribute to the solution of world crisis especially in the
fields of peace support and peacekeeping operations," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, working together of different
countries in peacekeeping initiatives was conducive to sound
relations and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The officers graduated Friday after completing an intensive
three-week military observer's course in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The course, which was attended by officers from the navy, army
and air-force, was sponsored by the Danish and Zimbabwean
governments.

<HEADLINE> Setup of India National Security Council Recommended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A high-level task force set up
by the Indian government last April Friday recommended the
establishment of a national security council on a priority basis.
</P>
<P>
The three-member team led by former defense minister K. C. Pant
presented its report to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Friday, which said management of national security had become more
pressing after India's nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
The council should comprise a cabinet committee headed by the
prime minister as the apex decision-making body, according to a
statement issued by the office of the task force chairman.
</P>
<P>
The council should include a cabinet-rank national security
adviser to the prime minister and three divisions for concurrent
functions, the report recommended.
</P>
<P>
The three concurrent functions to be performed are long-term
strategic planning, formulation of strategy of national security
coordination of current decision-making and follow-up of policy
implementation, and coordinated intelligence assessment for
national security planning and management.
</P>
<P>
The National Agenda for Governance announced by Vajpayee last
March had promised to establish a national security council which
could undertake India's first-ever strategic defense review. The
government set up the task force on April 14.
</P>
<P>
The report said the task force recognized that national
security management required integrated thinking and coordinated
application of political, military, diplomatic, scientific and
technological resources of the country to protect and promote
national security goals and objectives.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the team adopted a broad and comprehensive approach
to the concept of security, it said the proposed national security
in India's context needed to be viewed not only in military terms,
but should also include fields of domestic peace, economic
well-being and financial viability, trade policy, technological
strength and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The planning and management of national security, therefore,
should include the relevant aspects of functioning of the six
ministries of the central government dealing with these issues,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
The organization should function within the government and be
answerable to the cabinet and parliament, said the report.
</P>
<P>
All decision-making would continue to remain within the
existing ministries and departments with the national security
council acting as the facilitator and assisting in coordination of
integrated approach to planning and management of national
security, in a holistic manner, the report recommended.

<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- American coach Steve Sampson said
three of players who publicly crticised him during the World Cup
would be fined.
</P>
<P>
Sampson has promised the fines would be "significant" and that
he would not pick any of the players concerned if he retains his job.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Lalas, Tab Ramos and Jeff Agoos have all said they would
refuse to play under Sampson.
</P>
<P>
The American team lost all their three group matches and
Sampson's future as coach will be determined within the next month
by the United States Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any level of unprofessionalism is acceptable,"
said Sampson,"It's unfortunate they feel so free to voice their
opinions about me when I have given them so much respect and credit."
</P>
<P>
Sampson rejected the suggestion he might resign:"I've worked too
hard and I'm not going to let one or two individuals dictate my career."
</P>
<P>
Sampson would not reveal the exact size of fines to the
players:"Those concerned will be notified by letter over the next
few days." Sampson said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ugandan Rebels Isolated Following </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The rebels active in northern and
western Uganda have been intensifying their abduction activities
and it is these horrific abductions that put them under the quick
fire from the general public and make their lonely bases in
remote areas more isolated.
</P>
<P>
Abductions by young rebels have hit headlines in recent local
media and it gives the impression that the rebels are more
desperate than ever.
</P>
<P>
There are three groups of rebels in Uganda. The Lord
Resistance Army (LRA) rebels spearheaded by Joseph Kony, which
numbers some 1,000 in total, are active in northern districts
while the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) and the Uganda National
Rescue Front (UNRF) II rebels take the northwestern and western
districts as their bases.
</P>
<P>
In April, LRA rebels infiltrated into northern Uganda from
their bases in southern Sudan to make abductions and loot
foodstuffs, sending the Museveni administration on alert.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, mostly young trained abductees, attacked villages
and used landmines to loot goods vehicles on roads in Gulu and
Kitgum districts.
</P>
<P>
On June 8, some 200 ADF rebels staged a surprise pre-dawn
attack on the Kichwamba Technical College in western Kabarole
district, burning over 80 students to death and abducting more
than 100 others.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, 40 girl students from a secondary school in
northern Acholi district were abducted by the LRA rebels soon
after midnight.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, the UNRF rebels abducted 15 bus passengers on
the Koboko-Yumbe-Moyo road in the north of the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
These inhuman acts of terror soon became the target of
criticism from international bodies, the Ugandan government and
civilians at large.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament and civilians accused the government of
being responsible for the June 8 massacre because the government
army protecting the college fled in front of rebel advances.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government took the blame and at the same time
determined to flush out the rebels.
</P>
<P>
In order to wipe out the rebels, heavy military presence was
deployed in the war-torn districts and more efficient commanders
were appointed to replace the less capable. Moreover, tanks and
other efficient weapons were applied against the thugs.
</P>
<P>
However, the soldiers registered little success because of the
mountainous topography of the areas and laxities within the army.
</P>
<P>
All the setbacks in the front and threats issued by the rebels
have not in the least changed the government's mind of
eliminating the wrongdoers by force.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni has made clear on several occasions
that the government will not talk to the rebels although there
was a strong outcry for the peace talks from some members of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
This determination can also be reflected in the sharp increase
of defense spending in the new budget presented to the parliament
by Minister of Finance Gerald Ssendaula on June 11.
</P>
<P>
In the budget, the military spending will be increased 26
percent from the current level of 120 million U.S. Dollars to 150
million Dollars, the biggest increase second only to that for
education.
</P>
<P>
In the urban areas, the authorities have beefed up security
measures against possible relentless acts of horror. More arrests
have been made in the capital Kampala recently and security is
clearly tightened in important public places.
</P>
<P>
These preventive measures may not wipe out all the rebels in
the country in a short period of time, but one thing is sure: the
rebels would face harder times under the mounting pressure from
all sides and they would be left less room for survival.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Calls Alarm to Drug Addiction on Campuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Vietnamese official has
called alarm to a surge of drug addiction and trafficking among
the country's school kids and college students in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Of the 61 provinces and municipalities across Vietnam, said Le
Vu Hung, Deputy Minister of Education and Training, 56 have found
their school campuses already penetrated somehow by narcotics.
</P>
<P>
As results, 2,837 kids and students, 63 percent of them at
secondary schools, have been identified as drug addicts, Hung was
quoted as saying by a Vietnam News Agency (VNA) report Friday.
</P>
<P>
Friday is the International Day Against Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
To help wipe out drugs on campuses, said Huang, who chairs his
ministry's Committee for Drug-HIV/AIDS Prevention, anti-drug
programs have been in place since the 1997-98 school year.
</P>
<P>
And as a part of these programs, including educational ones,
teenagers are urged to sign a pledge to stay away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the ministry would also mobilize schools,
administrators and local police to work together in identifying
violators and applying appropriate disciplinary measures.
</P>
<P>
The official said the ministry would also launch a health
program to offer medical checkups to college freshmen on a more
regular basis, and possible treatments if needed.
</P>
<P>
Anti-drug efforts so far have already paid off, with 855 of the
1,387 addicted students, or 62 percent, in 17 provinces and
municipalities have kicked their habits, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urges Lebanon to Negotiate Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai Friday urged the Lebanese government to
negotiate an agreement for Israel to pull back troops from south
Lebanon, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to four Israeli soldiers wounded in south
Lebanon, Mordechai voiced hope that Lebanon will move forward
with an Israeli offer in a bid to change the situation in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided in April to endorse the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 425, which calls for unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Israel demanded that security arrangements be reached with
the Lebanese government before it withdraws troops from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai urged Syria to help the negotiations between Israel
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, which stations 40,000 troops as peacekeepers
in Lebanon, have rejected the Israeli offer, insisting that the
Israeli withdrawal be unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai's call came one day after a successful swap deal
between Israel, the Lebanese Muslim group Hezbollah and the
Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
The remains of an Israeli soldier killed last September in a
botched commando raid in south Lebanon was brought back to Israel
on Thursday night. In return, Israel sent back the bodies of 40
Hezbollah fighters to Beirut and released 60 Hezbollah detainees.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone, with an area of 1,200
square kilometers, in south Lebanon in 1985 to allegedly protect
its northern border from cross-border attacks by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Paedophile Trial Postponed by 2 Years in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian Justice Ministry said
Friday that the trial of the country's alleged child kidnapper and
rapist had been postponed by two years until September 2000.
</P>
<P>
The trial was being delayed because the investigation into the
crimes of Marc Dutroux had not been completed, ministry spokesman
Eugeen van Kerchkoven said.
</P>
<P>
"At the earliest it (the trial) will be in September 2000 and
it could also be in January 2001," he said.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux was accused of raping and murdering four girls and
kidnapping two others when the country's most notorious child sex
ring was exposed in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
The brief escape from jail in April this year caused a
sensation in Belgium and two cabinet ministers had to resign to
take the responsibility and the government set in motion a
far-reaching reform of the police and justice systems.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs of the justice and interior ministries resigned
following the escape that allowed the paedophile to remain at
large for three and a half hours before being caught again near
the borders between Belgium and Luxembourg.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved here
Thursday a loan of 300 million U.S. dollar to help finance
Kazakhstan's pension reform.
</P>
<P>
The loan is earmarked for the Kazakhstan Pension Reform
Adjustment Project designed to switch the country's existing
pension system over to a fully-funded one.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to help with macroeconomic stability and
restructuring, social protection and public information,
government management and operation in the reform process.
</P>
<P>
In addition, legal and regulatory framework, as well as related
institutions are also areas targeted for receiving the funding.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank loan would make up part of the fiscal deficit
brought about by the reform, which is equivalent to some 1.7
percent of Kazakhstan's gross domestic product (GDP).

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Denies Any Agreement with UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government Friday
denied that it had reached any agreement with the opposition
UNITA on completing the remaining tasks prescribed in the Lusaka
Peace Accord after the U.N. Security Council deadline.
</P>
<P>
Higino Carneiro, deputy chief of the government delegation in
the Joint Committee of the Angolan Peace Process, revealed the
government stand in response to the statement made by Lukamba
Gato, general secretary of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) at a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government has always held that Andulo, Bailundo, Nharea
and Mungo, the four regions under UNITA's control, should be
handed over to the government on the deadline set by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Under the Council's resolution, the task should be completed
by June 23. The Security Council Wednesday postponed the
deadline to June 30 and ruled that new sanctions including
freezing the foreign accounts of UNITA leadership, and
restricting the UNITA's diamond export, will take into effect on
July 1 if the four regions are not handed over on time.
</P>
<P>
Gato said Thursday that UNITA and the government agreed at the
June 19 meeting in Andulo that the two sides will meet again in
15 days to decide on the exact date when UNITA hands over the
four regions.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that UNITA could not hand over the four places
until after July 10.
</P>
<P>
Carneiro denied these statements, saying that the government
only stated that U.N resolutions must be adhered to, and didn't
reach any agreement on any date other than the Security Council's
deadline.
</P>
<P>
He finally noted that the only way to prevent the U.N
resolution from taking effect is for UNITA to accomplish all its
due tasks by the deadline.

<HEADLINE> Russia Calls Belarus' Eviction of Ambassadors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia Friday called Belarus'
recent eviction of foreign ambassadors from their residence "an
undiplomatic act" and called for a solution that "takes account of
the interests of all sides."
</P>
<P>
Moscow "accepts with deep regret the conflict which has arisen
over the Drozdy compound, which has led to the departure of some
ambassadors from Belarus," the Interfax news agency quoted Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has done everything possible to contain this conflict
and divert its settlement onto the course of negotiations,"
Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors of Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and
the United States left Minsk on June 22 for consultations with
their respective foreign ministries.
</P>
<P>
The departure came after demands from Belarussian authorities
that they vacate their residence in the Drozdy compound and water
and gas supply were cut.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian authorities notified the 20 missions in early May
that work would soon be started to overhaul the compound's water
and sewage systems, which were last repaired about 40 years ago,
and asked them to either move to new buildings in central Minsk
and the Krylovo governmental compound, or begin construction of
their own buildings near Minsk.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, who is in
Switzerland to attend an international economic forum, told
reporters that the real cause of the incident was Minsk's course
toward rapprochement with Russia and its staunch opposition to
NATO eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept a policy of lecturing and provocation,"
Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the West to give up its double standard in foreign
policy and look at the world with reason and self-restraint,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, before his departure to Switzerland, Lukashenko
said the ambassadors could only return "with the permission of
Belarussian authorities."
</P>
<P>
"Let them consult, but they should know they can come back only
with our permission," Interfax quoted the president as saying.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Key to Solving Afghan Tragedy Lies in Ending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The key to solving te
Afghan tragedy lies in curtailing the continuous foreign
interference in the form of arms and other supplies to the warring
factions, said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan said that for
such interference to end, the regional powers need to talk to each
other and build mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the supply of arms and money to
Afghanistan's warring factions, including both Taliban and the
Northern Alliance, has continued unabated during the past three
months, frustrating international mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The report said internal political tensions among the Afghan
factions have further complicated prospects for the resumption of
peace talks, following the failure of a U.N.-sponsored dialogue
between the two sides in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief expressed alarm at the suspension of dialogue
and the apparent start of the annual spring offensive. He called
on the Afghan factions to return to the negotiating table without
delay and on the regional powers to intensify contacts on
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Conference,
he said, are both ready to offer the regional powers opportunities
to enhance their mutual trust so that they can help the Afghan
people and save the entire region from the real danger of any
spillover effects from the conflict.

LYON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese coach Takeshi Okada on Friday
thanked the country's fans for their support in their first World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
"I'm grateful to have fans supporting us in Japan and in France. We
got huge support," said Okada after their 2-1 loss to Jamaica in Group
H here.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Japanese arrived in France to support the team
but many found them ticketless when their travel agencies could not
provide tickets.
</P>
<P>
"It's a great pity that we could not win any games here. My players
worked very hard and I am very grateful to them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would continue as coach after the World Cup, he
said: "My contract runs only until the end of July."
</P>
<P>
Okada said, "I didn't get my players to win a game that was
winnable. I couldn't even make them draw when it was possible to draw.
It is my responsibility for these results."

Japan and Jamaica had no hope to reach the second round even before

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- From Friday, 26 June Daily
contracts for Natural Gas Futures are available from the
International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), reflecting demand from the
industry for a shorter term hedging tool.
</P>
<P>
The IPE announced that these Dailies include a contract for the
next day, as well as the following six days. This means that
companies will be able to hedge using individual days for the week
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Companies are already able to trade in monthly strips for daily
deliveries up to a maximum of 15 months, and for daily deliveries
for the balance of the current month.
</P>
<P>
As for the existing contracts, the minimum trading size for
Dailies will be 5 lots at 1,000 therms a lot. The contract is
denominated in sterling with the minimum tick size unchanged at
0.01p/therm.
</P>
<P>
Natural Gas futures were launched by the IPE on 31 January
1997. The contract has already developed into a key indicator of
price trends in the UK market.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of April the contract was extended to 15
forward months from 12 previously as a result of demand from the
users.

BORDEAUX, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The 1-0 victory over Croatia in the

</P>
<P>
Argentine defender Matias Almeyda said:"Today against our

when we are united together and everybody follows orders, nothing
can go wrong."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rising Tanker Hijackings Warned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- International maritime crime
investigators Friday raised the alarm about the growing incidence
of tanker hijackings in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
They appealed to governments to extradite pirates who put to
shore on their territory so that they can stand trial in the flag
state of the hijacked vessel.
</P>
<P>
The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) of the International
Chamber of Commerce listed three recent hijackings of small to
medium-sized tankers in Southeast Asian waters and a fourth in
the Gulf last week.
</P>
<P>
All the vessels were carrying marine fuel oil. While there is
no information yet on the fate of the vessel seized in the Gulf,
all the other cases involved the transfer of cargo at sea to
another tanker.
</P>
<P>
IMB Director Pottengal Mukundan said in a statement, "Violence
and intimidation are hallmarks of these attacks. Crews have been
beaten with iron bars, tied together, gagged and blindfolded."
</P>
<P>
Captain Mukundan said there were indications that the Asian
economic crisis had caused pirates to switch their prey from
general cargo vessels to tankers carrying marine fuel oil.
</P>
<P>
The captain said, "We are encouraged by the action of the
Chinese authorities in arresting the pirates and we hope that
eventually they can be extradited."
</P>
<P>
He urged the governments of all flag states to apply for
extradition and the governments of countries where the pirates put
into port to grant these requests so that these dangerous
criminals could be brought to justice.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's foreign policy is to
"attain and maintain regional stability in eastern Africa with a
view to Promoting her economic interests in the region," Foreign
Minister Bonaya Godana said Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking while launching the first issue of the monthly
Foreign Affairs Bulletin here, Godana said Kenya's foreign policy
is about advancing interests of Kenya and Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
"Our core national interests comprise safeguarding our
territorial integrity and sovereignty and promotion of economic
and commercial interests," said the honorable minister, who
assumed the post since Kanu won the general election last
December.
</P>
<P>
Godana stressed, "We have emphasized peaceful co-existence,
respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity of
other states and adherence to the charters of the Organization of
African Unity and the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Addressing about a hundred foreign diplomats, reporters and
officials at a cocktail here, the minister admitted that Kenya
seeks a pro-active role in regional international ties, saying
that conflict prevention, management and resolution "remain a
central plank of our foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
Kenya has been mediating on the Sudanese conflict and
appealing for a cease-fire in southern Sudan as it is the
president of the seven-member Intergovernmental Authority on
Development (IGAD).
</P>
<P>
"Kenya supports peaceful resolution of conflicts and disputes
through negotiations and mediation as opposed to the use of force
and remains active in initiating peaceful negotiations in the
Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa," Godana said,
referring to the Burundi peace talks and the recent conflict
between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Kenya would like to "see North-South economic equities and
believes in the South-South cooperation," he noted, adding that
"we are determined to support the efforts of the Group of 77
toward economic development."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Friday
appealed for 20.2 million U.S. dollars to meet the urgent
humanitarian needs of populations affected by the crisis in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
The people affected include those displaced within the country
as well as those who have sought refuge in the neighboring states
of Liberia and Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Although the return of the democratically elected government in
February has brought a level of peace and stability, the
consolidation of peace remains a difficult task in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. sources, in the last three months, more than
237,000 Sierra Leoneans have fled into Liberia and Guinea,
bringing the total to over 500,000, and over 50,000 internally
displaced people have sought shelter in camps and towns in the
north.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration condition of the refugees is particularly
alarming. New arrivals are suffering from exhaustion, disease and
malnutrition, and their situation is likely to worsen in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
The overall humanitarian response to the crisis has been
undermined by security and access constraints. In spite of these
difficulties, the humanitarian community has attempted to respond
to the situation. Last month, United Nations agencies and the
International Committee of the Red Cross conducted humanitarian
assessments in previously inaccessible areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition to securing life-sustaining support to the affected
populations, the United Nations consolidated inter-agency appeal
for humanitarian assistance to Sierra Leone also seeks to support
the emergency assistance priorities and objectives of the
government of Sierra Leone, as well as efforts to facilitate peace
and reconciliation.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, JUNE 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
adopted a resolution Friday, appealing to Eritrea and Ethiopia for
the immediate cessation of hostilities and restrait from further
use of force against each other.
</P>
<P>
The resolution drafted by Costa Rica, Japan, Russia, Slovenia,
Britain and the United States also called on the parties to
"exhaust all means to achieve a peaceful settlement" of their
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The 15 council member states strongly supported the mediation
efforts by the heads of state of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) and urges the OAU to follow up as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requested U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
make his good offices in support of a peaceful resolution of the
conflict and consider further recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Annan was requested to provide technical support for the
eventual delimitation and demarcation of the common border between
the two Horn of Africa countries.
</P>
<P>
The border issue centering on a piece of 400 square km land
erupted on May 6 and escalated into a ground and air war on June 5
before both sides agreed to a moratorium.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the OAU summit on June 10, an OAU mediation
group has been established.
</P>
<P>
"There has been for some time in the discussions of the shape
of the eventual peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea, a
border demarcation exercise, and there has been talk of United
Nations involvement in that, but of course we are still far from a
peace agreement in that dispute," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said
Friday.

polio eradication campaign in the second half of the year, a
mobilization committee secretary, Magreth Fimbo, said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first round of immunization will take place on August 1
and 2 and its second round will be on September 12 and 13, Fimbo
said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of polio vaccines have arrived in the country
and are being distributed in various regions. The vaccines are
11.26 million doses from Japan, she said.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 40 percent will arrive next month, the official
added.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the vaccines, equipment for immunization are
forthcoming and every region has its plans to make the
immunization of children under five years successful, she said.
</P>
<P>
"To make the immunization campaign successful, senior health
officials have been gone to different regions to make sure that
there are proper arrangement for it," Fimbo said.
</P>
<P>
She added that vaccinators and health attendants in regions
with poor records in past years' immunization campaigns are under
training so that the regions can perform well in this year's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The official named the regions as Mbeya, Rukwa, Mara, Arusha,
Coast, Tabora and Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Fimbo said that the educators will also give services in the
regions of Mtwara, Dodoma, Morogoro, Tanga, Ruvuma, Shinyanga and
Singida after receiving funds from UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
The national immunization against polio for children under
five started in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Free Democrats Remain Loyal to Kohl's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Free Democratic Party (FDP)
voted Friday to stay loyal to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
three-party ruling coalition after the general elections this
September.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the 662 delegates present at a FDP
party convention in the eastern German city of Leipzig Friday
voted in favor of a continuation of their center-right coalition
with Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party and its sister
party Christian Social Union (CSU).
</P>
<P>
However, many delegates speaking at the convention criticized
the CDU for blocking faster and more fundamental structural
reforms sought by the FDP in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
They also vowed to be more independent and to sharpen their
profile as a staunch advocate of economic and social reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We want more jobs through tax reform, privatization and the
reduction of state subsidies and bureaucracy," said FDP leader
Wolfgang Gerhardt in an opening speech to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also set out a five-point program to be pursued by his party
in the coming years, including continued tax and social reforms,
continued efforts to rebuild eastern Germany, a comprehensive
education reform, more liberal immigration regulations, and a
reliable foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The tiny FDP has been crucial to keeping Kohl in power in the
past 16 years. Without the votes won by the liberal party, Kohl
would not have won the four general elections since 1982.
</P>
<P>
However, at a time when Germany's unemployment is hovering at
record highs, Kohl's coalition have been losing popular support to
the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD).
</P>
<P>
The SPD is striving for a leftist coalition with the ecologist
Greens party to force Kohl from power on September 27 when the
national vote is due to be held.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges International Efforts on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos has urged the U.N. Security Council and the
international community to help reach a solution to the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special session of the House of Representatives
here Friday evening, Stephanopoulos said "a peaceful solution to
the Cyprus problem and the enforcement of legality is of primary
importance to Greece."
</P>
<P>
He noted that if Ankara abandons its intransigent stance and
contributes toward a Cyprus settlement, then "this will be an
important step for confidence building between Greece and Turkey."
</P>
<P>
No Greek would ever accept a settlement of Greece-Turkey
relations with the Cyprus problem unresolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was in this context that the political decision for a joint
defense pact between Cyprus and Greece was taken, Stephanopoulos
added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in 1974
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed a joint defense pact in November
1993, under which Greece will provide military assistance if
Cyprus is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Cyprus' course for accession to the European
Union (EU), which was opposed by Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots,
Stephanopoulos said this will create the conditions for
continuing development and help overcome mistrust between the two
communities.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus' accession to the EU serves the common interests of
both Greek and Turkish Cypriots and will secure the viability of a
future Cyprus federation," the Greek president noted.
</P>
<P>
Described as "unacceptable" Turkey's effort to block Cyprus'
accession to the EU, Stephanopoulos said "Ankara should realize
that Europe will not be humiliated and succumb to blackmail and
that a Cyprus solution is a condition... also for the future of
its European prospects."
</P>
<P>
The Greek president arrived here Thursday for a four-day
official visit to Cyprus, the first of its kind since the
establishment of the Republic of Cyprus in 1960.

ATHENS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The five-day meeting of military
experts from seven Balkan countries ended here Friday with a joint
communique calling for cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique released after the meeting, the military

Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and observers from the U.S.
and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>

establishment of a multinational force with the aim of preventing
conflict and maintaining peace and stability in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The military experts are expected to meet again in Rome in
September to pave the way for a defense ministers' conference
which will take place in the same month in the FYROM.
</P>

concerning the location of the force's headquarters and which
country has the command of the force.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government Friday
suggested to extend the mission to monitor northern Iraq, called
Northern Watch, for another six months.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was presented to the parliament by Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz, according to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the mission to monitor the situation in northern
Iraq is still of significance to Turkey's "territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish parliament is expected to approve the proposal
within the next few days, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government lost its effective control of northern
Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War and some warring factions have
been fighting for dominance over the region since then.
</P>
<P>
Northern Watch was established on December 1996 as a
replacement of the mission of the Operation Provide Comfort, and

<HEADLINE> Germany Reports Strong Growth in Foreign Direct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment flowing
into Germany in the first quarter of this year soared to over 9
billion marks (5 billion U.S. dollars) compared with only 4.2
billion marks (2.3 billion dollars) for the whole of last year,
official data showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt cited the new figure
as an evidence of the government's success in reversing the trend

He also indicated that it now seemed likely for Germany to
attract even more foreign investment in 1998 than the latest
record of 18 billion marks (10 billion dollars) registered in
1995.
</P>
<P>
According to data released by the Economics Ministry, Germany's

<HEADLINE> WTO Urges Nigeria to Effect Credible Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
has urged Nigeria to carry out "credible reforms" and move
quickly toward a rules-based market economy.
</P>
<P>
The WTO, in a report on Nigeria's trade policy released
Wednesday, urged the Nigerian government to pursue "credible
structural reforms" of its economy to help liberalize its trade
and improve living standards in Africa's biggest oil producing
country, the Guardian newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The WTO report said foreign investors outside the oil and gas
sector have largely steered clear of Nigeria due to corruption
and political stability.
</P>
<P>
The government of late General Sani Abacha has left behind a
mismanaged and neglected state sector well on the way to total
collapse, leaving Nigerians short of fuel, power, transport and
communications, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO pointed out that the oil industry responsible for more
than 95 percent of Nigeria's export earnings remains in a parlous
state, with the development of new reserves held up by
underfunding and a failure to agree on crucial terms to protect
investors.
</P>
<P>
The world trade watchdog called on Nigeria to remove import
prohibitions, reform inefficient public sectors such as
telecommunications, oil refining and chemicals and introduce
legislation on competition policy.
</P>
<P>
"Recent steps to increase transparency and accountability in
government, and thus combat allegations of fraud and corruption,
must be pursued if international confidence in Nigeria's economy
is to be regained," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Increased transparency and accountability would signal
Nigeria's commitment to a rules-based market economy," the WTO
said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO recognized the efforts by the Nigerian government to
reform its customs, pre-shipment inspection and port policies,
but said such efforts have been so far uneven.
</P>
<P>
"Illegal levies at ports substantially increase the cost of
importing and consequently, a large share of Nigeria's external
trade is conducted informally through ports in neighboring
countries," it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said illegal discharging levies at Nigerian ports
increased the cost of imports by as much as 45 percent, thus
diverting large flow of trade to neighboring ports.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy to Angola Tours W. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Blondin Beye, the United Nations
Special Envoy to Angola, left here for Sao Tome &AMP; Principe, his
first leg of a tour of five western African nations, to enlist
support for the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
During his western African tour which also covers Gabon, Togo,
Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, Beye will brief leaders of these
countries on the current situation in Angola and seek support for
the U.N. move to overcome the difficulties in the country.
</P>
<P>
Blaise Compaore, President of Burkina Faso and the current
Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), would be the
key figure for Beye to enlist his support, since Beye wants to
make use of Compaore's influence as the OAU chairman to tackle
the Angolan crisis.
</P>
<P>
This is the second of Beye's African tour within a month for
the Angolan crisis. He had visited Zambia, Namibia and Zimbabwe
before his western African tour earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process hit snags again as the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) put off, as
formerly agreed, to hand over administrations of four sensitive
regions under its control to the government.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. Security Council resolution passed
Wednesday, UNITA should hand over the four areas now under its
control, to the government before the June 30 deadline, or face
the punishment of having its bank accounts abroad frozen and its
diamond exports banned.
</P>
<P>
During his two tours of African countries Beye is expected to
ask for these countries' support for the U.N. resolution once the
UNITA fails to fulfill its hand-over of the areas to the
government.

<P>
OTTAWA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada's two long-distance phone
companies, Call-Net Enterprises and Fonorola Inc., announced
Friday that they have agreed to merge in a 1.8 billion dollar
(1.2 billion U.S. dollar) deal.
</P>
<P>
The merger will push Call-Net Enterprises up to be Canada's
largest alternative long-distance phone company in the
increasingly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Call-Net will pay 67 dollars or 2.68 of its
non-voting B-class shares for each share of the Montreal-based
Fonorola company.
</P>
<P>
"This transaction creates synergies that could not have been
realized by any other combination," Call-Net President Juri Koor
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The deal "will accelerate Call-Net's growth as the leading
alternative long distance telecommunications company in
Canada.... It also advances our efforts to expand in the U.S. and
international market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The combined company would have had over 1.3 billion dollars in
revenues in 1997, and a 16 percent share of Canada's 8.6 billion
dollar market for long distance services.
</P>
<P>
Call-Net, which is based in Toronto, will have a combined
network of more than 23,000 kilometers of fiber route, serving
more than 1.35 million customers in Canada, with connections into
the U.S. and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Over the next two years, Call-Net said it expects to become a
full service telecommunications firm in Canada offering a wide
range of products, including long distance, local, data, Internet
and mobile service.

</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian Equal Opportunity for All Trust Fund (EOTF) has

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Extend Freed Prisoners Hero's Welcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon Friday extended a hero's
welcome to 55 prisoners released by Israel in a swap between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Lebanese surged as two buses and an ambulance of
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) carrying the
prisoners moved slowly through the crowds at the Kfar Falous
crossing.
</P>
<P>
The crowds had been waiting for hours at the usually quiet
crossing, which links the Israeli-occupied south Lebanon and the
rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the prisoners were excited to see the return of
their husbands and sons, most of whom have spent at least 10 years
in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Most of the prisoners are members of the anti-Israeli
resistance groups like Hezbollah, Amal movement and the Communist
Party,
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone covering an area of
1,200 square kilometers in south Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed
aim to protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese resistance forces have been fighting to drive the
Israeli troops out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The crowds chanted anti-Israeli slogans and sang Hezbollah
songs. Some waved flags and banners reading "Freedom returned with
our liberated detainees" and "Our martyrs and prisoners are the
symbols of our struggle and victory."
</P>
<P>
The freed prisoners then received a grand banquet hosted by
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri at his palace in the capital.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the banquet, Hariri praised the prisoners for
their struggle for the "nation's right to live in freedom and
dignity."
</P>
<P>
He also glorified the guerrillas who have died in fightings
against the Israeli occupation of Lebanon's soil.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that the government is determined to
liberate all the Lebanese detainees in the Jewish state through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
About 150 more Lebanese people are still held by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Friday's release of the prisoners came in an ICRC-mediated swap
deal, which is the biggest in two years between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel set free 60 prisoners. Four of them chose to stay in
homes in the occupied zone and one decided to remain in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel also returned 40 bodies of Lebanese guerrillas,
including that of Hadi Nasrallah, the eldest son of Hezbollah's
leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
In return, Lebanon Thursday handed over the remains of an
Israeli soldier killed in a botched raid in south Lebanon last
September.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Urged to Flush Out S. Leone Junta Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar has directed that the tempo of ECOMOG attack
on remnants of the rebels in Sierra Leone be redoubled to wipe
them out completely.
</P>
<P>
The west African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG ousted
Sierra Leone's military junta and allied rebels earlier this year
and it has been carrying out a mopping up drive in the northern
and eastern parts of that country.
</P>
<P>
Noting it as key to the stability in the sub-region, Abubakar
has directed the operation of the Nigerian-led ECOMOG be
maintained and stepped up, the News Agency of Nigeria reported,
quoting ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Timothy Shelpidi,
who has just concluded a four-day visit to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, assuming office early this month after the sudden
death of former Head of State General Sani Abacha, also acts as
chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), which sent ECOMOG to Sierra Leone following the coup in
May last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Shelpidi assured Sierra Leone
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah that ECOMOG would assist in
retraining soldiers who had surrendered after proper screening
and urged Kabbah to absorb them into the new national army.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah, who was reinstated last March after the ousting of the
junta, has promised that the new army would be ethnically and
regionally balanced to stand the test of time.

As before, the discussions will be limited to migration issues,

report.
</P>
<P>
Cuban National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, a close aide

The U.S. side will be led by John Hamilton, a deputy assistant
secretary of state.

Four years ago the Kwacha was at 2.5 to the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The unsteady Kwacha has not been backed by an inflation rate
of 20.20 percent, which has made the cost of borrowing from the
banks extremely expensive, the Pan-African News Agency (PANA)
quoted an economist as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said to borrow money from a commercial bank, a client
should be prepared to pay a prime lending rate of 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
PANA did not mention the name of the economist or say when he
made the remarks.
</P>
<P>
Compared to past years, bank managers demanded a prime lending
rate of only 23 percent, said the economist.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Denies Welfare Problem of Troops in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force known as ECOMOG said Friday that its withdrawal from
check-points in Liberia had nothing to do with the welfare of the
troops.
</P>
<P>
It was a reaction to a shift in policy from Liberian President
Charles Taylor's regime, the force said in a statement issued at
its headquarters in Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a program on local television which gave the
impression that the withdrawal was to enable the troops to visit
their families, the force said it could be attributed to two
recent incidents involving the country's security forces and
ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
The two incidents, which took place on June 21 and 22
respectively, included the refusal of Adolphus Taylor, a relation
of the president, to be subjected to a search at the Parker Point
check-point, as well as the attempt by Liberian soldiers to
search an ECOMOG vehicle on a supply mission to troops in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
"Although these two incidents have no direct bearing, they
both represent a shift in policy by the Liberian government in
its relationship with ECOMOG," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that during the Parker Point incident, an ECOMOG
soldier was dragged to the presidential villa and maltreated in
the presence of the director of the State Security Service (SSS)
in violation of the spirit of the status of forces agreement
signed with ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS, namely the Economic Community of West African States,
sent ECOMOG to Liberia in 1990 to help bring to an end the bloody
civil war in that country. The force did it and created
conditions for Taylor to win last year's election to become the
post-war president.
</P>
<P>
"The (ECOMOG) high command views these acts as diametrically
opposed and incompatible with the spirit and letter of the
agreement and the previously existing cordial working
relationship between ECOMOG and the government," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The attempt to attribute the withdrawal to welfare matters was
misleading as the force was in the habit of granting leave to
troops to attend to their families without compromising its
responsibility, it noted.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported repeatedly that Taylor does not like
ECOMOG and has asked the force to leave his country.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that ECOMOG is considering to move its
headquarters from Monrovia to Freetown, capital of neighboring
Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Super Eagles Eager to Win for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Super Eagles from Nigeria are
thirsty for a second round victory over Denmark not only for
themselves but also for the African soccer.
</P>
<P>
The point was emphasized through the words of striker Victor Ikpeba
after they qualified for the last 16 by beating Bulgaria in their
second game.
</P>
<P>
Ikpeba said: "It was a victory for the team. It is also a victory
for the African soccer."
</P>
<P>
Of the five African nations here, Nigeria are the only one that has
survived the grilling of the first round,
</P>
<P>
But the Super Eagles want to avoid the disaster in 1994 when they
were shot down by the eventual runners-up Italians.
</P>
<P>
The best record for an African team was registered by Cameroon who
reached the quarterfinals in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The only setback for the Nigerian camp is the injury of striker
Daniel Amokachi, the 1994 star who will miss the match.
</P>
<P>
But coach Bora Milutinovic has rested their key players in the last
group match against Paraguay, paying the price of a 3-1 loss which did
not affect their qualification.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, an overaged Denmark would still depend on the
skills of Laudrup brothers.
</P>
<P>
The younger Brian said: "This is perhaps our chance -- a chance we
may not have had against teams like for example Germany, the
Netherlands or Yugoslavia. That is why we think that something big is
in the making."
</P>
<P>
Denmark will also trying to surmount the barrier of second round as
they have never gone beyond.
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, who plays for Manchester United, is
the final defence against the Nigerian strikers and he would
definitely not want to let his first and probably last World Cup ends
so early.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Urged to Open Markets to Somali Livestock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the Arab League
(AL) Saturday called on Arab countries to reopen their markets to
Somali livestock, the only source of income to the majority of the
war-ravaged Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Abdallah Adam, the advisor to the AL secretary general, said
the his organization has received reports from various United
Nations organizations saying that Somali livestock is free from
diseases that prevent the export.
</P>
<P>
It is known that the U.N. Development Program, the World Health
Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization have sent
such reports to the 22-member Arab group.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has a huge livestock - about 80 million heads of cattle
in addition to some 70 million others - that are untamed and could
be widely used by Arab countries, Adam said.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. delegation visited Somalia to verify the fact that
Somali livestock did not catch any diseases from Kenya and wrote a
report after four months of research, proving that there are no
diseases among animals in Somalia, Adam added.
</P>
<P>
The Arab official called on the private sector and importers in
Arab countries to make use of such "enormous and cheap animal
livestock" in the Horn of African state.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been hit hard by factional wars since the ouster of
late President Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. More than 300,000 people
have died in the war and concurrent famine.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Carvers Stops Using Ebony for Wood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Carvers'
Association (TCA) has stopped using the ebony tree to make
carvings for the sake of protecting the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
The association is encouraging its 1,400 members to use other
trees for wood carvings, which are tourist souvenirs attractive
to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The move has been in response to the government call, said the
TCA secretary general, Raymond Likajuma, who expressed concern
that the trees may soon perish if they are not properly
protected.
</P>
<P>
"Ebony trees, available in Morogoro and Coast regions, have
been felled indiscriminately," the Saturday's Guardian quoted
Likajum as saying recently.
</P>
<P>
Likajuma said that the association is doing its best to
persuade its members to try other tree varieties which are able
to produce quality carvings as well. He urged the carvers to
change with the tide of time instead of sticking to traditional
ways.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, some carvers doubted whether other
types of trees are suitable for the production of quality
carvings.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the experience at an art institute in
Bagamoyo in north Dar es Salaam has proved that other types of
trees serve as good materials as ebony.

<HEADLINE> EU Dumps June 12, Supports New Election in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has made it
clear that it wants a new election to be held in Nigeria, instead
of installing Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the June 12,
1993 election, as the president.
</P>
<P>
Tony Lloyd, the British Deputy Foreign Minister made this
known while addressing newsmen in Lagos Friday night before
winding up his one-day visit to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd arrived in Nigeria Thursday night as a special envoy of
the British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the EU. His mission is
to express the EU's concern with Nigeria's transition to civil
rule program, now at a cross with the sudden death of late
military leader, General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd held a closed-door talk with Nigeria's new leader,
General Abdulsalam Abubakar, in the federal capital Abuja Friday.
He described the talk as "constructive."
</P>
<P>
He said he welcomed the release of 17 political detainees by
Abubakar just before his arrival and called for the early
resolution of the case of Moshood Abiola, who has been in
detention for five years.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the call of pro-democracy groups in Nigeria that
Abiola should be given his mandate as winner of the June 12, 1993
election, Lloyd said that the feeling of the international
community, especially of the EU, is that a new election should be
held.
</P>
<P>
"What we insisted on is a proper election. What we want for
the people of Nigeria is a transparent election progress," he
told the press.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, who is a member of the parliament, said that in
Britain, the parliament does not sit for more than five years,
meaning that Abiola's mandate is no longer relevant.
</P>
<P>
As close and traditional friends of the Nigerian people,
Britain and the EU are ready to support Nigeria's transition to
democracy process, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Lloyd made it clear that before Nigeria could effect
a genuine transition, EU will not lift its sanctions against the
west African country.

<HEADLINE> Many Mozambican Women Not to Vote: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Many Mozambican women might not
vote in the coming local elections, the pro-government newspaper,
Noticias, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the polls made by the newspaper, a large number
of women in the capital city of Maputo still don't know there
will be local elections just three days before the event.
</P>
<P>
Some women who do know there will be elections, however, do
not know when the local elections take place and who are the
candidates, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it expected that many Mozambican women might not
vote in the elections scheduled on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The paper also reported that the campaign starting on June 15
for the posts of the mayors and members of the hall in 33 cities
and towns ended peacefully at zero hour.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party (Frelimo), the
Labor Party and 11 mass organizations took part in the election
campaign, the report said. But the biggest opposition party, the
Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo) and other 16 oppositon
parties did not participate in the running.
</P>
<P>
In some provinces, the supporters of the rivaling parties
threw words and stones at each other, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some supporters for the elections have been beaten by Renamo
members in the provinces of Tete, Manica and Sofala, but with no
serious results.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Urges Britain to Help Zimbabwe With Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Saturday urged Britain to help Zimbabwe with its land reform.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the British government is now
accepting its moral obligation on the need to assist Zimbabwe
implement its controversial land acquisition program.
</P>
<P>
But Mugabe said despite the new signs of acceptance, the
British were still however, insisting that the land
redistribution program be done in a way that would alleviate
poverty in this southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who also is the First Secretary of the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union (Patriotic Front) (ZANU-PF), said this
when he addressed the ruling party's annual national consultative
assembly at ZANU-PF headquarters in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Although there were differences within the government on how
land for redistribution would be acquired, there was need for a
speedy program to resettle millions of peasants squashed in
barren and sandy communal areas, the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted
the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent move by thousands of Svosve and
Nyamandlovu villagers who invaded white-owned commercial farms,
Mugabe said people were getting more impatient and tired of
promises as they only enjoy political and not economic
independence.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe assured thousands of villagers in the Svosve
and Nyamandlovu and all other land-hungry peasants, that land
would soon be made available for their resettlement with the
government already having made available 104 farms for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
He pleaded with the villagers to go back to their homesteads
and wait for an organized resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
The president also spoke strongly on the "ugly phenomenon of
factionalism" which he said still haunted the party, splitting
its people into "antagonistic" groups that worked against
collective goals enunciated in its policies and decisions.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the problem of weakening cohesion, the party's
organizational structures have become enervated, especially in
urban areas where most of these anti-party forces are active," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Thai FM in Phnom Penh, Meeting Hun Sen on Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan met Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen here Saturday
to discuss forthcoming elections in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Arriving here in the afternoon and entering into talks with Hun
Sen at the Premier Office, Surin's party included Indonesian and
Philippine Ambassadors to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The three came to brief on the views expressed by the Friends
of Cambodia grouping and the "Troika" of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The "Troika," of Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines,
discussed the Cambodian Elections in Bangkok on June 20.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his meeting with Hun Sen and before flying home,
Surin told reporters that their talks were "successful" and he was
"very satisfied" with the election process.
</P>
<P>
"We think all the preparations have been going well and last
few days of the campaign have been very smoothly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his party has no intention to interfere Cambodia's
internal affairs he said: "we only want to help with the Cambodian
government and so far we think we have cooperated very well."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Hun Sen reportedly expressed his willingness to
welcome observers from international non-government organizations
(NGO) and said the more NGO observers, the better.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hun Sen's remarks, Surin said NGO observers would
help the world to know that everything here was in good order, and
then help bring in support for Cambodia's reconstruction efforts.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Thai foreign minister raised concerns
about continued extra-judicial killings in Cambodia. However, Hun
Sen denied there were political murders relating to the elections.
</P>
<P>
About voter registration for Cambodian refugees in Thailand,
Hun Sen said it should be decided by the National Election
Committee, as it is beyond the government's authority.
</P>
<P>
About 55,000 Cambodian refugees are still on the Thai soil.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hun Sen made it clear to his quests that Cambodia
would prepare to join the ASEAN at any time.
</P>
<P>
Before Surin and his party's arrival here, they flew to Siem
Reap and met King Norodom Sihanouk. He described the meeting with
the King also as "very successful."

<HEADLINE> S'pore Toughens Enforcement Against Illegal Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Ministry of
Manpower said on Saturday that tough punishment will be enforced
in Singapore against employers caught employing illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a press release that it had conducted a
total of 190 inspections on restaurants and food stalls from
January to May this year and detected illegal employment at all
these stalls and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
In the ministry's actions during the same period, a total of
325 foreigners were detained for working without valid work
permits.
</P>
<P>
On Friday at the Le Grand Palace Banquet Restaurant, 29 out of
73 foreign workers were found to be working as restaurant
supervisors, waiters and waitresses without valid work permits.
</P>
<P>
The ministry warned that tough punishment will be rendered
against stall and restaurant operators caught and convicted of
employing foreign workers who have no valid work permits.
</P>
<P>
Under the enforcement regulations announced by the ministry
Saturday, the first-time offender upon conviction will face a
minimum fine equivalent to two years of the foreign worker's levy
(7,920 Singapore dollars, about 4,800 U.S. dollars) and a maximum
fine of up to four years' levy (15,840 Singapore dollars, about
9,600 U.S.dollars) for each foreign worker, or imprisonment of up
to one year or both.
</P>
<P>
For the second and subsequent conviction, the penalty will be a
mandatory jail sentence of one to 12 months, in addition to the
above fines.

six months and not more than two years, and shall be liable to a
fine of up to 6,000 Singapore dollars (about 3,636 U.S. dollars).

He said that as two great nations, the United States and China
are expected to set an example for the world.
</P>
<P>
"In the last few months, we have seen how much we can do
together -- in our strong response to the crisis in India and
Pakistan...our efforts for lasting peace on the Korean
peninsula...our cooperation to stem the flow of dangerous weapons
around the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He used the teachings of Mencius to describe U.S.-China
cooperation on international issues: "A good citizen in one
community will befriend the other citizens of the community...a
good citizen of the world will befriend the other citizens of the
world."
</P>
<P>
He said that the American people admire the great strides China
has taken.
</P>
<P>
"Your people are leading lives inconceivable just a generation
ago," he said.
</P>

"Your phenomenal growth over twenty years has opened new worlds
of possibility -- more jobs, more schools, greater mobility, and
instant access to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"We Americans appreciate the mutual respect of our relationship
-- a relationship based on cooperation, candor and recognition of
each nation's values and traditions," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted an ancient Chinese proverb as saying: "Be not afraid
of growing slowly; be only afraid of standing still."
</P>
<P>
In Conclusion, he said, "Let us commit to keep moving forward
together, turning small steps into giant strides for our people,
our nations and the world."

<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin gave
a grand state banquet here tonight in the Great Hall of the People
for visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yeping, wife of the Chinese President, attended the
banquet.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the banquet were Chinese Party and state leaders
Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li
Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
Among the guests present were U.S.Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, U.S. Ambassador to China James Sasser and his wife,
Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin, Secretary of Agriculture Dan
Glickman, Secretary of Commerce William Daley, U.S. Assistant to
the President for National Security Affairs Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
The national flags of China and the U.S. were hung in the hall,
and the banquet began with the military band playing national
anthems of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the banquet, Jiang Zemin said he was very glad to
host this state banquet.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Chinese government and in the name of his wife
and himself, Jiang Zemin extended warm welcome to the U.S.
presidential couple and other members of Clinton's official
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he had reached consensus with the U.S. president on
the goal of developing Sino-U.S. ties oriented toward the 21st
century and decided to make concerted efforts to build
constructive strategic partnership between the two countries
during his state visit to the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange of visits between the heads of state of China and
the U.S. will be of vital significance to deepening understanding,
enhancing friendship, increasing consensus, expanding cooperation
and advancing bilateral relations to a new phase of development,"
Jiang Zemin said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that since China and the U.S. reopened the door to
their contacts 26 years ago, generally speaking relations between
the two countries have been growing, though there have been ups
and downs.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that any twists and turns cannot stop the major trend
of the growing bilateral relations," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the improvement and development of
bilateral relations embodies the devotion and endeavor of people
with insight in the two countries, and enjoys active support from
the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It also shows that there are solid foundation and strong
motivation for friendly cooperation among the statesmen and people
of the two countries," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. have different social systems, ideology,
cultural traditions, historical backgrounds and economic growth
levels, he said. "Therefore, it is no wonder that the two sides
differ in their views on some matters."
</P>
<P>
"What's important is that the common interests of the two sides
are far greater than their differences, and hence, existing
questions should not become obstacles to the growth of bilateral
relations," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we view and handle the questions with a strategic
and long-term perspective, relations between China and the U.S.
will surely grow better," he added.

<P>
Speaking of strengthening the bilateral ties, Jiang said that
as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and the
U.S. shoulder heavy responsibilities in safeguarding world peace,
and close consultation and cooperation between the two countries
constitute an important factor for maintaining regional and world
stability.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two countries have the ultimate common
goal in preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, and there is an urgent need for increasing
cooperation in environmental protection, cracking down on
international crimes, drug trafficking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest developing and developed nations, Jiang
noted, China and the United States enjoy huge potentials for
economic and trade cooperation and technological exchanges on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"We can also play an important role in maintaining
international financial stability and promoting the sound
development of world economy," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and American cultures are both of unique features,
which merits exchanges and learning from each other, said Jiang,
adding that the people of the two countries enjoy a traditional
friendship, and their leaders have attached great importance to
development of bilateral ties and have made much effort to this
end.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have shown that under the new historical circumstances,
the common interests between China and the U.S. are expanding
rather than reducing, the foundation for cooperation being
consolidated rather than weakened, and favorable factors for
developing bilateral ties increasing rather than decreasing," the
Chinese president said. "Friendly cooperation between China and
the U.S. is in line with the aspiration of the two peoples and
will be beneficial to promoting world peace and development,"
Jiang said.

<P>
Mankind is marching into a new century, and peace and
development have become the theme of the era. But these two issues
still remain unresolved, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "without peace, no development can be
spoken of, and, if there is no common development, no lasting
peace can be achieved."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, maintaining world peace and promoting
common development represent the biggest common interest for China
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the pursuit of peace and development, it is essential to
maintain the comprehensive security of various nations around the
world and to handle international affairs in accordance with the
principles of democracy, equality, justice and fairness, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the general tide of the times and the common
aspiration of the people, which conforms to the trends of
historical development," he noted. "China and the U.S. should
enhance cooperation and make due contribution to the attainment of
these magnificent goals pursued by the people of the entire
world."
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that President Clinton and he had an
in-depth exchange of views on Sino-US relations and the global
situation this morning, reaching new and extensive consensus.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides agreed to strengthen cooperation in various fields
and make continuous efforts to build a constructive strategic
partnership between each other," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his firm belief that based on the principles
enshrined in the three Sino-US joint communiques and the Sino-US
joint declaration, the relationship between China and the U.S.
would surely keep advancing on a correct track.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that President Clinton would also go to visit
Shanghai, Guilin and Hong Kong following his trip to Xi'an and
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that through this current China trip, you avail
yourself of the opportunity to learn about China's longstanding
history and splendid culture, witness the country's achievements
in reform, opening-up and modernization drive, and experience the
friendly affections of the Chinese people for the American
people," Jiang told Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president finally wished President Clinton's visit
a complete success.

<P>
In response, President Clinton said he was honored to be in the
Great Hall of the People, which reflects the impressive progress
of the Chinese people in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Great Hall of the People reminded American
people of what they saw on televisions 26 years ago, when
President Nixon became the first American leader to visit China.
</P>
<P>
"Those were the first live pictures of China ever seen in my
country. Across the United States, Americans were filled with
great hope as relations resumed between our two great nations," he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nixon's visit changed history.
</P>
<P>
"It reminded us of the warmth each nation felt for the other,
long before the Cold War. It recalled our alliance in World War
II, and our long history of commercial relations, dating back to
the infancy of the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the two countries were trading together before
the United States' Constitution was written.
</P>
<P>
"Even the tea that our founding fathers threw into Boston
harbor in 1773 to protest British taxes came from China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For most of our history, we have looked upon China as a
distant friend across the sea.
</P>
<P>
"As the Bamboo Curtain opened, Americans and Chinese learned
about each other all over again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that starting with pandas and pingpong players,
the two countries have built a broad and friendly relationship.
</P>
<P>
"Today China and the United States cooperate across a wide
range of enterprises -- in business, in the arts, in the academic
world and in the personal friendship that unites Chinese and
Americans," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that more than a million Americans trace their roots
to China.

<HEADLINE> Police Investigating Nazi Behavior of German Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- German police said Saturday they are
investigating alleged Nazi behavior by three German soldiers while
watching a television broadcast of a World Cup football match.
</P>
<P>
As reported by eyewitnesses, a group of German soldiers made
Nazi salute when the German national anthem was played ahead of
last Thursday's World Cup match between Germany and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Nazi salute is constitutionally forbidden in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers have also been seen, at a cafe in the southern
German city of Regensburg, wearing T-shirts printed with the
slogan: "We march into France in 1998."
</P>
<P>
Three soldiers based near the city have been detained in
connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
German army officials said Saturday they were shocked by the
new incident and would take harsh disciplinary measures against
the soldiers if their behavior was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The German military was hit by a series of neo-Nazi scandals
last years with incidents ranging from soldiers making Nazi
salute, chanting Nazi slogans to conducting mock execution of Jews.
</P>
<P>
The scandals also prompted the German parliament to launch a
special investigation into the general morale of the German army
earlier this year.

<P>
GUILIN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Flood waters have receded and daily
life returned to normal today under clear skies and sunshine in
Guilin, a scenic city in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Some 24 pleasure boats carrying 494 foreign tourists and nearly
2,000 local residents sailed to Yangshuo County along the Lijiang
River, one of the region's most popular tourist attractions, at
10:00 this morning.
</P>
<P>
While Guilin has reeled under the heaviest flooding in 80 years
in recent days, reports from the regional water resources bureau

<HEADLINE> Conference Promotes Scientific Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Guangzhao, vice-chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC),
today urged sponsors of the Xiangshan Science Conference which is
celebrating its fifth anniversary to provide greater latitude for
exchanges and discussions of new scientific ideas.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the conference's 100th symposium, Zhou said
that "China should avoid simply following scientific innovations
introduced in other countries, but instead should score
achievements which glorify the scientific history of human beings."
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists should explore interesting topics from the
frontiers of science and carry out creative studies, said Zhou,
adding that redundant studies of short-term projects should be
reduced, while rewarding long-term studies in the basic sciences
should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
"Individuals lacking creative ideas can never become true
scientists", and "releasing the creativity of scientists will be
the key to promoting the research and development of the basic
sciences in China," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
He expressed an expectation that the conference will alter the
traditional conceptual style of China's scientific community by
encouraging young scientists to challenge the authoritarianism of
their older peers and enhance the openness of discussions and
debate.
</P>
<P>
The conference carrying the theme "promoting innovation" was
initiated in 1993 by the former State Science and Technology
Commission and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The 99-odd symposia held to date have promoted comprehensive
studies of various subjects and helped scientists in differing
gain a greater understanding of other areas.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing two-day symposium, which opened in Beijing today,
has attracted the participation of more than 90 Chinese
scientists.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday Bosnia-Herzegovina leaders are not
seeking any aid from Malaysia at present as they are aware of the
economic turmoil facing Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said he had explained to Bosnia-Herzegovina's joint
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic the reasons for Malaysia to recall
its soldiers serving in that country.
</P>
<P>
"He did not ask for any help as he is aware of the problems
facing Malaysia," Mahathir told reporters after talks with
Silajdzic at his residence here.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said they discussed various issues including the
situation in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.

He said Silajdzic informed him that rehabilitation efforts were
at a slow pace in Bosnia-Herzegovina because not many were
investing there and job opportunities were limited.

<P>
"Safe to invest there at present but recovery is at a slow
pace," Mahathir said when asked if it was safe to invest in that
country.
</P>
<P>
"Many refugees have returned to Bosnia and hence there is a
need for jobs for them," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
the Sino-U.S. Joint Statement on South Asia issued here today:
</P>
<P>
 Sino-U.S. Presidential Joint Statement on South Asia
</P>
<P>
Beijing, 27 June 1998

Introduction
</P>
<P>
Recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, and the resulting
increase in tension between them, are a source of deep and lasting
concern to both of us. Our shared interests in a peaceful and
stable South Asia and in a strong global nonproliferation regime
have been put at risk by these tests, which we have joined in
condemning. We have agreed to continue to work closely together,
within the P-5, the Security Council and with others, to prevent
an accelerating nuclear and missile arms race in South Asia,
strengthen international nonproliferation efforts, and promote
reconciliation and the peaceful resolution of differences between
India and Pakistan.

Preventing a Nuclear and Missile Race in South Asia
</P>
<P>
The P-5 Joint Communique of June 4, which was endorsed by UN
Security Council Resolution 1172, sets out clear and comprehensive
objectives and a plan for action to address the threat of a South
Asian nuclear and missile arms race. We pledge our full support
for the steps outlined in the Joint Communique, and again call on
India and Pakistan to stop all further nuclear tests and adhere
immediately and unconditionally to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT), to refrain from weaponization or deployment of
nuclear weapons, and from the testing or deployment of missiles
capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and to enter into firm
commitment not to weaponize or deploy nuclear weapons or the
missiles capable of delivering them.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Joint Statement on South Asia (2) Strengthening Global Non-Proliferation Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We call for the prompt initiation and conclusion of
negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament, on the basis of
the 1995 agreed mandate, for a multilateral treaty banning the
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other
nuclear explosive devices. We urge India and Pakistan to
participate, in a positive spirit, in such negotiations with
other states in the Conference on Disarmament with a view to
reaching early agreement.
</P>
<P>
We both actively support the Strengthened Safeguards System
now being implemented by the IAEA, and will promptly take steps
to implement it in our countries.

Reducing Tensions and Encouraging the Peaceful Resolution of
Differences between India and Pakistan
</P>
<P>
We are committed to assist where possible India and Pakistan
to resolve peacefully the difficult and long-standing
differences between them, including the issue of Kashmir. We
welcome the resumption of dialogue between the two countries and
encourage them to continue such dialogue, and we stand ready to
assist in the implementation of confidence-building measures
between them, and encourage the consideration of additional
measures of this type.

Responsibilities of China and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States have long sought friendly
relations with both India and Pakistan. We reaffirm this goal
and our hope that we can jointly and individually contribute to
the achievement of a peaceful, prosperous, and secure South
Asia. As P-5 members, and as states with important relationships
with the countries of the region, we recognize our
responsibility to contribute actively to the maintenance of
peace, stability and security in the region, and to do all we
can to address the root causes of tension.
</P>
<P>
We reaffirm that our respective policies are to prevent the
export of equipment, materials or technology that could in any
way assist programs in India or Pakistan for nuclear weapons or
for ballistic missiles capable of delivering such weapons, and
that to this end, we will strengthen our national export
control systems.

Next Steps
</P>
<P>
Close coordination between China and the United States is
essential to building strong international support behind the
goals to which we are committed in response to nuclear testing
by India and Pakistan. We will stay closely in touch on this
issue, and will work with other members of the P-5 and the
Security Council, with other Asian and Pacific countries, and
with the broader international community to forestall further
instability in South Asia, achieve a peaceful and mutually
acceptable resolution of differences between India and Pakistan,
and strengthen the global non-proliferation regime.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Clinton Have Frank Exchange of Views at Press Conference (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zeming and
U.S. President Bill Clinton had a frank exchange of views over
human rights and Tibetan issues at a joint press conference here
today following their official talks.
</P>
<P>
In response to a Xinhua reporter's question on China's stance
on human rights, Jiang said "China and the United States have
different views and also have common ground" on this issue, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation always respects and maintains the dignity of
the human beings, he said, and today, the Chinese government
solemnly announces its commitment to the promotion and the
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
</P>
<P>
"I listened very carefully to what President Clinton said just
now, and I noticed that he mentioned the political disturbances
that occurred in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and in addressing the
issue, he also gave an account of the history of Tiananmen," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
For the people of China, he said that "we have long drawn a
historical conclusion." He also said he had stated during his
visits to the United States and at various international occasions
that during the turmoil of 1989, had not China taken the resolute
measures, it would be impossible to have a stable situation as it
is today."
</P>
<P>
"No country's human rights situation is perfect," he said,
adding that "fundamental changes and the tremendous achievements
that have been scored in human rights in China are for all to see"
since the founding of the New China.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton in his opening remark mentioned that the two
countries have different views on the human right issue, while
acknowledging the progress China has made in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said "this debate and discussion today have been a
healthy and a good thing."
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to have a dialogue here that will enable both of us
to move forward so that the Chinese people will get the best
possible result," President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he acknowledged that the two countries "are working
together in many areas of cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"We have developed a relationship of openness and candor," he
said, noting that "when we differ, as we do from time to time,
we speak openly and honestly in an effort to understand our
differences and, if possible, to work toward a common approach
to resolve them."

<P>
On the question of Tibet, Jiang went into details to enumerate
great changes that have happened to Tibet after 1 million serfs
were emancipated after the Dalai Lama left China in 1959. He also
pledged guarantee to the religious freedom even though he is an
atheist, communist and state president.
</P>
<P>
"Just now President Clinton also mentioned the Tibetan issue
and urged dialogue with the Dalai Lama," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the Dalai Lama can make public the statement and
commitment that Tibet is an inalienable part of China and
recognize Taiwan as a province of China, then the door to our
negotiation is open," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, we are having several channels of communication with
the Dalai Lama. And I hope the Dalai Lama will make a positive
response in this regard," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I agree that Tibet is part of China," Clinton said. "And I can
understand why the acknowledgement of that would be a precondition
of dialogue with the Dalai Lama," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang said he felt that President Clinton is a strong
defender of the American interests and that he himself is a strong
defender of the Chinese interests. But despite that, he added,
they can still converse and consult each other in a very
friendly manner and "this is democracy!" he said in English.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "I want to explain that, actually, there are a lot
of areas in which we can learn from each other," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, President Bill Clinton answered
questions on the Asian Financial Crisis and the Sino-U.S.
agreement not to target nuclear weapons at each other's
territories.
</P>
<P>
In reply to the former question, President Clinton said China
has "shown great statesmanship and strength" in making a strong
contribution to the stability of the entire region by maintaining
the value of its currency.
</P>
<P>
The joint press conference held earlier today lasted for over
70 minutes, with more than 300 journalists both at home and from
overseas attending.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Hong Kong - One of Safest Cities in World (1) By Feng Xiuju </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Cho has been keeping order by
the door at several banks in Hong Kong for a total of 20 years,
but has never felt so secure as it is now.
</P>
<P>
"Some banks have been equipped with bulletproof glass so that
people's safety can be guaranteed," said the 63-year-old Cho, who
is now working in a branch of the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, however, his friend witnessed right here a
bank robbery involving pistols.
</P>
<P>
"It was too terrible to say," recalled Cho who previously
served as a guard in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank and the
Standard Chartered Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays I seldom hear such kind of robbery cases, especially
after Hong Kong returned to China last July," Cho said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
His words are backed up by facts. A 73 percent drop was
scored in the number of bank robberies in 1997 from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's safety is not merely reflected in the banking
sector. Last year saw a marked decrease in burglaries for four
years in a row, down by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that Hong Kong's overall crime rate in
1996, one year before its return to China, was the lowest in 15
years and the downward trend continued in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1996, the overall crime rate and violent crime
rate dropped by 17.3 percent and 12.4 percent respectively, the
lowest in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, these two kinds of crime
rates recorded further decreases of 2.4 percent and 12 percent
respectively compared with the corresponding period of last year,
Ng Ching-kwok, senior assistant commissioner of police said.
</P>
<P>
"Our detection rate of 51.4 percent compares favorably with
other densely populated cities worldwide," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year of 1997, the police force continued its
determined enforcement action against drug trafficking and drug
abuse.

HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The gold price in Hong Kong went

according to Po Sang Bank, one of the major gold dealers in Hong

The gold price is equivalent to 292.69 U.S. dollars a troy

Operations mounted locally and internationally have been
successful in preventing the large scale importation of illicit
drugs, particularly heroin, methyl amphetamine and ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
"Our long standing relationships with key overseas law
enforcement agencies have been crucial in ensuring that we play an
important role in the international fight against drugs," Ng said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the 17 percent reduction in triad related crime
in 1997, saying that the successful confiscation of criminal
assets at the end of 1997 stood at 261 million Hong Kong dollars
(33.46 million U.S. dollars), with a further 244 million Hong Kong
dollars (31.28 million U.S. dollars) either frozen or pending
confiscation.
</P>
<P>
Coordination with the mainland's Public Security Bureau and
international law enforcement agencies has successfully reduced
organized vehicle thefts and smuggling by 18.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the commissioner of police received a total of 2,939
complaints against the Police Force from the public last year,
showing a decrease of 370 cases compared with 1996.
</P>
<P>
Corruption complaints against police officers decreased by 12.5
percent from 576 in 1996 to 512 in 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ng stressed that after Hong Kong returned to China on July 1
last year, "we continue to enforce the law in exactly the same way
as before."
</P>
<P>
The concern that police officers in senior ranks would leave
the service prior to the transfer of the power has proven to be
unfounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of expatriate officers remained committed to
Hong Kong and the Police Force, with 402 remaining in the Force at
the end of 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
A recent public opinion survey shows that the overall majority
of respondents, about 80 percent, felt a strong sense of safety
living in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
So, Hong Kong remains one of the safest and most stable
societies in the world.
</P>
<P>
Ng attributed the present good order in Hong Kong's society
mainly to the joint efforts of the Hong Kong Police and other
government departments, as well as their close cooperation with the
relevant mainland security departments.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure Hong Kong's safety, more security staff
members are sent out on patrol duty everyday in streets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the security equipment has been improved further.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important factors in this regard is, of course,
related to Hong Kong's return to China, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zidane-less France to Find Way Past Paraguayans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LENS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- France, without playmaker Zinedine
Zidane, will have to find a way past in-form Paraguay here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A flare-up of temper in a group game led to Juventus midfielder
Zidane being sent off in their group game against Saudi Arabia and
subsequent two-game ban.
</P>
<P>
Coach Aime Jacquet had to make eight changes in starting line-up
against Denmark, including Youri Djorkaeff shouldering the
responsibility of feeding strikers like David Trezeguet and instant
hero Christophe Dugarry who scored in their opening game.
</P>
<P>
Dugarry is doubtful for Sunday's game after being injured against
Saudi Arabia but captain Didier Deschamp and Emmanuel Petit, yellow
carded in the first round, now can play without worrying about
suspension as the second round starts afresh.
</P>
<P>
The game against the Danes reflected France's remarkable depth in
bench talents and constantly deafening vocal support from local fans
is also a plus that could not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
Although the performances in the three games proved that doubters
of lack of attacking power were wrong, coach Aimer Jacquet cautioned
that Paraguay are not minnows.
</P>

"We can't take the game lightly. We have to prepare well. During
their games the Paraguayans have gronw in stature and really
progressed," Jacquet said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "They are a passionate team, very compact and they work
hard to retieve possession of the ball."
</P>
<P>
But the Frenchmen should be wary of the attacking power unleashed
by midfielder Jose Cardozo and Miguel Benitez of Spanish club
Espanyol.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of French attacks, Paraguyan goalkeeper Jose
Luis Chilavert will not have an easy day.
</P>
<P>
But if necessary, "The Bulldog" is likely to call upon his scoring
skill, which has brought five goals for the Paraguayan eleven.

<HEADLINE> Interview: New Airport, Pride of Hong Kong, Says Wong (1) by Wang Qun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- "Hong Kong's new international
airport at Chek Lap Kok ranks among the world's most majestic
projects and its opening on July 6 will be a landmark in the
development of Hong Kong," said Wong Po-yan, chairman of the Hong
Kong Airport Authority (AA).
</P>
<P>
Within less than nine years, a world-class new airport took
shape at the reclaimed land off the northern coast of Lantau
Island, and was supported by nine related projects, including
roads and bridges, an airport railway, a tunnel and a new town,
Wong told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The whole set of projects, known as the Airport Core Program,
cost a total of 155.3 billion HK dollars (19.9 billion
U.S. dollars), which will be the largest infrastructure
development project in Hong Kong's history.
</P>
<P>
With just ten days left before the historic opening of the new
airport, the AA is busy conducting the last-minute operational
trials and coordinating the challenging relocation of airport from
the downtown Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok, 25 kilometers west of Hong
Kong's central business district.
</P>
<P>
With some 30 years of experience behind him in public service,
the 75-year-old Wong is very proud of having the grand project
finished within budget and on schedule.
</P>
<P>
"This clearly demonstrated that Hong Kong kept its promises,
and also had the financial capability to do what it wanted to do,"
he stressed, comparing the new airport with quite a few
infrastructure projects in other parts of Asia which had to be
suspended due to the regional financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Hong Kong will feel a great source of pride in
the wonderful facility which creates a lot of superlatives over
the world," Wong said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: New Airport, Pride of Hong Kong, Says Wong (2) by Wang Qun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wong has been involved in the project from the very beginning.
Before taking the chair of the Airport Authority, a full
government-owned body in charge of building and running the new
airport, Wong was chairman of the Airport Consultative Committee
which advised the government on the new airport.
</P>
<P>
The new airport's Y-shaped terminal, with a floor area nine
times as large as that at Kai Tak, is the world's largest airport
terminal and indoor public place, Wong pointed out, adding that
everyone should find its panoramic views and spaciousness
impressive.
</P>
<P>
Departing passengers should take less than three minutes to
check in at nearly 300 desks. From each of these desks, luggage
will move smoothly on its way through a sophisticated baggage
handling and screening system. For arrivals, with 12 reclaim
carousels handling almost 20,000 pieces of luggage an hour,
passengers will be able to retrieve their baggage quickly.
</P>
<P>
The new airport also boasts of the most state-of-the-art air
traffic control system, a north runway with the highest safety
grade, the largest air cargo handling facility and even a kitchen
capable of providing 80,000 meals daily for passengers, Wong
continued.
</P>
<P>
The list could still go on. Actually thousands of Hong Kong
residents have seen for themselves what a great achievement the
new airport has been. Anxious to taste the new airport, they
participated in "the New Airport Experience", an AA program of
public open days to familiarize Hong Kong people with their new
airport.
</P>
<P>
He said, operating around the clock, the new airport is able to
handle up to 35 million passengers or 1.2 times of that in Kai
Tak, and 3 million tons of cargo or 2 times of that in Kai Tak, in
its first 12 months of operation while the ultimate capacity will
reach 87 million passengers and 9 million tons of cargo per year.
</P>
<P>
Built to meet the aviation demands of Hong Kong, southern China
and the broader Asia-Pacific region for at least 50 years, the new
airport will bring overall economic benefits to Hong Kong,
strengthening the city's status as an Asian aviation, tourism,
trade and financial center in the long term, Wong noted.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, following the closure of Kai Tak, some
380,000 Kowloon City residents living under its flight path will
obviously escape the noise of aircraft, while additional land will
be made available for residential and commercial developments in
the area.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges Judicial Officials to be Impartial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Saturday called on the country's judicial officials to be
impartial and free from any political influence.
</P>
<P>
"Judges should be impartial in all ways and must not side with
any specific trend, group and tendency," Khatami said at a
nationwide gathering of judiciary officials, according to the
Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a judge is not subordinate to the command of any
individual and no superior official can tell him what to do and
not to do.
</P>
<P>
The criterion in Islamic judicial system is restoration of
rights and nothing should prevent such a grave task, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president made the remarks after the moderate
faction in Iran accused the pro-conservative judiciary of putting
Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi on an open trial for
political purpose aimed at weakening Khatami's government.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's case aroused a serious factional struggle between
the moderates and conservatives. The judiciary is expected to
announce a final rule on Karbaschi next month.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that Islam does not favor scrutinizing in order to
find faults, rather, the most important principle in Islam is the
principle of acquittal. He warned that any violation of this
principle will be dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that no power is authorized to force a judge to
issue a certain verdict and judges should function in total
freedom, stressing the need to avoid forced extraction of
confession and the unpleasant methods.
</P>
<P>
Any citizen in the country is entitled to certain rights and
the Islamic system is responsible to guarantee those rights,
Khatami said, adding that the president is responsible for the
execution of the constitution and all should coordinate their
actions within this framework.
</P>
<P>
A two-day nationwide gathering of the judiciary officials
opened here Saturday morning to debate issues related to
supervisory commissions of the judiciary, practical boundaries of
judiciary, Islamic human rights, prison affairs, security and
correctional measures and women's issues.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Meets With U.N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The special envoy of the United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan on Saturday delivered a
personal letter of the world body chief to Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina on the tension in South Asia following the nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan last month.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief was concerned about the nuclear tests carried
out by India and Pakistan, Alvaro De Soto, U.N. assistant
secretary general for political affairs, told Hasina at a meeting
Saturday morning, a spokesman of the prime minister told a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Annan had conveyed the same concern to the respective
countries, and suggested initiation of dialog between India and
Pakistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina welcomed the envoy and thanked the secretary general for
the message.
</P>
<P>
On her recent visits to India and Pakistan, Hasina said they
were aimed at better appreciation of the two countries'
constraints and concern, avoiding arms race in the region, urging
the two countries to resolve all outstanding issues through dialog
and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister said that she had not offered
mediation between her country's two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a tension- and (nuclear) weapon-free world, she
said peace was essential for development and welfare of the people
of the region.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad soon after
his arrival Friday afternoon, the U.N. envoy said that he would
discuss (with the prime minister) the possibility of Annan's
planned visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of my mission is not to mediate, but to hand over
the messages (of Annan) to the leaders of Bangladesh and
Pakistan," said Soto, who is scheduled to fly to Karachi,
Pakistan, Saturday evening after his one-day Bangladesh visit.
</P>
<P>
India is against outside involvement in resolving its disputes
with Pakistan, while the latter favors the U.N. or any third party
to help in this regard.
</P>
<P>
India would refuse to receive the U.N. envoy, Indian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sunil Lal said Thursday, reports reaching here
said. "They are talking about Indo-Pakistan matters and Kashimir.
You know our stand," he was quoted as saying.

<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton told a gathering of Chinese women that American and
Chinese women have a lot in common to work in education, health
care and getting rid of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a panel discussion focusing on the progress and
challenges in the transforming of Chinese society here this
morning, Mrs. Clinton said that she found herself has never been
in a discussion "more lively, energetic, informed and exciting" as
the one she heard today.
</P>
<P>
"I was struck by the fact that many of the solutions concerning
women issues discussed today by the Chinese panelists are ones
that were also worked on in the United States, such as expanding
legal rights for women, changing the judicial system to be more
sensitive and aware of women's needs, expanding education for
girls and women, persuading families, particularly families of
minority culture to educate their daughters," she said.
</P>
<P>
After the panel discussion, she went to Beijing Medical
University (BMU) to co-preside over the signing of a declaration
of intent to collaborate between BMU and U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC).
</P>
<P>
The BMU and CDC has conducted a successful cooperation in
fighting neural tube birth defects. Neural tube birth defects,
including spina bifida, an opening of the spine, and anencephaly,
an absence of brain tissues, are serious but largely preventable
disorders.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 pregnancies are affected by neural tube birth
defects a year in China, compared to 4,000 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Health Minister Zhang Wenkang said the results of
China-U.S. cooperation in research on the causes and prevention of
neural tube birth defects will also benefit mother and children
the world over.
</P>
<P>
The declaration of intent to collaborate signed today by
Richard Berry of the CDC and Wang Debin, din of BMU, will expand
the scope of future collaboration to the prevention of all kinds
of birth defects, disabilities and environmental health.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urges Japan to Stop Yen Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Rodolfo Severino, secretary general
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Friday
called on Japan to work with the group of seven industrialized
countries to arrest the slide of the yen.
</P>
<P>
Severino, who made the call at the annual ASEAN-Japan forum
held in Hanoi, also asked for an early implementation of the 16
trillion yen (about 120 billion U.S. dollars) package that the
Japanese government had put together to stimulate Japan's economy,
the English "Vietnam News" reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which was attended by the deputy foreign
ministers of Japan and the ASEAN members, Severino said that the
weakness of the Japanese currency was creating a "dangerous"
situation for Southeast Asia and the whole world as well.
</P>
<P>
The weak yen contributes to the shrinking of Japan's demand for
ASEAN exports and lowers the value of Japanese investments and
assistance to the region in terms of dollar, he added.
</P>
<P>
Severino also stressed that it was necessary to pull ASEAN out
of the economic difficulties arising from the regional financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese senior official who attended the forum reiterated
his country's commitment to extend various forms of assistance to
Asian countries amounting to 42 billion dollars and a "solidarity
fund" of 20 million dollars specifically for manpower development,
poverty alleviation and regional projects in ASEAN, said the
report.

<HEADLINE> Pak Devalues Rupee by 4.2 Pct to Shore Up Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Saturday devalued
its currency of rupee by 4.2 percent as part of an emergency
package to shore up the country's foreign reserves following its
nuclear tests in late May.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in a statement that the
new rate of 46.0000/46.4600 rupees against one U.S. dollar would
replace the official 44.0500/44.4905 official rate in force since
March 24 with immediate effect, said reports from Karachi,
Pakistan's southern port city.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen as another part of efforts to shore up the
country's foreign exchange deposits in the wake of sanctions
imposed by major western powers for Pakistan's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has already frozen foreign accounts in the
country to prevent any run on foreign exchange deposits in light
of its dwindling reserves.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves fell to about 1.5 billion
dollars on June 20 from about 1.6 billion dollars a week earlier,
the central bank said on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Ready to Improve Ties With EU: Senior Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran has announced its readiness to
improve relations and enhance cooperation with European countries,
calling for dialog on the basis of equality and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Mohammad Khatami is steadfast in
improving and expanding relations and cooperation with the member
states of the European Union (EU), Morteza Sarmadi, Iranian deputy
foreign minister for Euro-American affairs, said in an interview
with Iran Daily published on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi said that the future dialog between the EU and Iran
"should be based on equality, mutual benefits in order to promote
the level of cooperation" between the two sides, adding that the
reason for the failure of the EU "critical dialog" with Iran is
the "incorrect views" of the EU and its intention to dictate Iran
to change its policies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the future dialog should focus on removing
hurdles for economic cooperation, paving the way for dialog among
civilizations and exchanging views on important international and
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister noted that about 20 different
delegations from the EU countries, such as France, Italy, Spain,
Belgium, Germany and Austria, have visited Iran and held talks
with Iranian officials to improve bilateral relations during the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi will arrive here next
Tuesday for a three-day official visit aimed at enhancing
cooperation with Iran in political, economical and cultural
fields, according to Sarmadi.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's visit is the first by a western head of government to
Iran since the Islamic revolution which toppled former Iranian
Shah regime in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The visit is believed to be a new step in pushing forward the
EU-Iran relations after the end of the EU-Iran diplomatic row
last November over a Berlin court rule which accused Iran of
supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In March, the EU announced to resume high-level contacts and
talks with Iran. Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini visited
Tehran days after the EU announcement.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Albertini Says Norway Strong in Header </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MARSEILLE, France, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Demetrio Albertini
said the biggest threat from Norway in their second-round clash was
their headers.
</P>
<P>
"Norway is a better team when it comes to headers," the AC Milan
midfielder said on Friday. "We're going to have to try to win the
battle in the midfield, and recover a maximum number of balls."
</P>
<P>
Italy will face Norway in the Stade Velodrome here later on
Saturday. The winners will enter the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Albertini said his team would rely on the experience of players who
had honned their skills in the professional leagues.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Professional players should systematically be confident.
This concentration is in fact the most important thing to have in a
World Cup, and you have to maintain it."
</P>
<P>
Italian captain Paolo Maldini said they would take advantage of
tactics to make up for the weakness in height.
</P>
<P>
"The Norwegian players are very athletic very strong, and overall
taller than us," he said. "We also have some big players, but we play
differently to them. It will be hard to find any openings against
Norway."
</P>
<P>
He said both teams had improved since last edition in the United
States in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The difference between Norway in 1998 and in 1994 is that Norway
have a different style of play, but the same goes for Italy," said
Maldini, who turned 30 on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges COMESA to Fully Liberalize Trade, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has urged
the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to
liberalize trade and agriculture completely.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the COMESA's fifth Council of Ministers meeting
starting Friday in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry Enock
Kavindele said that the COMESA members should adhere to the
regional body's timetable for the reduction of tariffs and
complete elimination of non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, originating from Preferential Trade Area for Eastern
and Southern Africa in 1994, aims to achieve a free trade area by
the year 2000 and a customs union as well as free movement of
finance, capital and people in the region, the Times of Zambia
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele, also Chairman of the Council of Ministers, said
that it is possible to attain free trade in agricultural products
and inputs on January 1, 1999, adding that there will be minimal
losses in revenue when agricultural trade is fully liberalized.
</P>
<P>
Given the related agricultural seasons in the region, said the
Zambian minister, member states should strive to eliminate
cross-border informal trade in agricultural products and expand
market as well as enhance food security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kavindele stressed that COMESA has reached a critical point in
its history when it is needed to move the region to higher level
of economic cooperation and integration.
</P>
<P>
Industrial cooperation is key to regional integration, he
said, calling on the members to agree to have COMESA become a
free trade area by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We must, therefore, continue to press on even with greater
determination and commitment if we want to harvest the full
benefits of integration," said Kavindele.
</P>
<P>
The fifth Council of Ministers meeting attracted about 300
delegates from 19 member countries and it will consider, among
other things, reports of various COMESA committees.

PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- England's David Beckham said their 2-0

"I've never played better," the Manchester United midfielder said
Friday night in Lens. "I had to prove I could do it."

"I was given the central midfield that I want and I kept hold of
the ball and didn't give it away," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the free-kick was given I knew it was my sort of
distance and felt it was right for me. I told myself that if I hit it
right and got it over the wall it would be in," said Beckham, who
converted a free kick.
</P>

He said, "I was that confident and as soon as I hit it I knew it
was going in."

<HEADLINE> S. African Rand in Free Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's currency, the
Rand has gone into a free fall, despite unprecedented support
from the Bank of England and the United States Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
The Rand went into free fall Thursday night, hitting 5.95
against the U.S. Dollar in late trade.
</P>
<P>
Reports from New York dealers that the two big central banks
had bought Rand for Dollars surprised analysts, who said it was
the first time that South Africa had enlisted major powers'
support for the currency, The Citizen daily said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mauling of the Rand by speculators has underlined the lack
of confidence in the economy and raised the chances that interest
rates will be hiked again, practically killing any chance of
reasonable growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate, at which the Reserve Bank lends to commercial
banks, had soared to a 13-year high of 24 percent on Monday, but
had been allowed to relax over the week as the semblance of
stability returned.
</P>
<P>
The South African currency has fallen 43 cents or nine percent
since Thursday morning, and in just over a month it has slipped
from 5.080.
</P>
<P>
The Rand traded at 9.8117 against the British Pound, losing
more than 15 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
Friday's slide came after a firm increase in the repo rate to
18.31 percent from 17.34 percent, which initially seemed to
support the Rand.
</P>
<P>
But fresh waves of selling saw the currency fall steadily
until, dealers said, big central banks came in to support. The
beleaguered currency took some strength from the intervention but
then it fell again.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank intervened heavily to support the Rand in
May, employing 26 billion Rand (4.58 billion U.S. Dollars) to
support the currency in the early stages of an emerging market
assault.
</P>
<P>
But analysts believe that the authorities don't have enough
foreign reserves to intervene again.
</P>
<P>
Economists reckon the central bank should allow the Rand to
slip rather than chance a prolonged period of high interest
rates, which would stifle the fragile economy into full blown
recession.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has witnessed 15
plane accidents between 1995 and 1997, according to Tanzanian
Deputy Minister for Communications and Transport Maua Daftari.
</P>
<P>
These accidents occurred because of bad weather, recklessness
of the pilots and mechanical failures, the Guardian Saturday
newspaper quoted Daftari as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister revealed the figure Thursday at the
National Assembly session in Dodoma when answering questions
raised by members of parliament on the record of the country's
plane accidents and causes during 1995-1997.
</P>
<P>
Daftari denied claims that passenger planes were not properly
checked before take-off, saying that there were thorough
examinations before any planes registered in the country started
to operate.
</P>
<P>
She said that during the period, ten companies were involved
in accidents, three planes crashed because of poor weather, four
companies were given warnings and three pilots had their licenses
suspended.

<P>
President Jiang noted that peace and development are the
main themes of the current times, an era full of both hopes and
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization has accelerated the expansion of the
international economic cooperation and trade, while scientific and
technological advances, particularly the revolution of information
technology, have given a new impetus to human progress and social
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, destabilizing factors and uncertainties continue to
exist in the international situation with the unjust and
unreasonable old international political and economic order not
fundamentally changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Regional conflicts caused by racial, religious and territorial
disputes and such problems as international crimes, drug
trafficking, terrorism and environmental degradation remain
unabated, and the financial crisis has caused economic and
political turmoil in some countries, Jiang said, mentioning that
the nuclear arms race in South Asia has created sudden tension in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"These problems, if not promptly and properly settled, will
cast a shadow over the future of the mankind in the next century,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
In the new historical conditions, Jiang added, China and the
United States shared extensive common interests and shouldered
unshirkable common responsibilities on major issues concerning
peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world at
large.
</P>
<P>
"As two big countries of great influence in the world and
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, we wish to see
peace and security prevail in the world and have made our efforts
in resolving hot spot issues," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Sharing a common objective in preventing the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction committed to maintaining regional
stability, he noted, China and the U.S. have conducted effective
cooperation in checking nuclear arms race in South Asia,
maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in
other areas.
</P>
<P>
As the largest developing country and the largest developed one
in the world, China and the U.S. have actively conducted bilateral
economic cooperation and trade and worked together to promote
financial stability and economic growth of the world, and have
also enhanced cooperation in protecting environment and combating
international crimes, drug trafficking and international
terrorism, said President Jiang.

<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State President Jiang
Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton held talks here this morning
in the Great Hall of the People and had an in-depth exchange of
views on China-U.S. relations and major international and regional
issues.
</P>
<P>
They reached broad and important consensus, and the talks were
positive, constructive and fruitful, according to the presidents.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang first extended a warm welcome to President
Clinton on his state visit to China at the important moment at the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said an exchange of visits by the two heads of state of
China and the U.S. represents the common aspiration of the people
of both countries, and signified the beginning of a new era in
the growth of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"Facts show that the improvement in and development of
Sino-U.S. relations is an historical inevitability and no force
can stop it," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Clinton said this is his first visit to China,
also the first visit by an American president in nine years, and a
visit only eight months after Jiang Zemin's visit to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
It shows that the progress the two countries have made in
building their constructive strategic partnership, and that the
vast majority of the people in the United States welcome the
improvement and development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed the hope that his frank and open talks with
President Jiang and his trip to China will help extend the areas
of cooperation between the two sides, reduce differences and
increase the American people's understanding of China and Chinese
people's understanding of the United States, so as to further
expand the friendly partnership between the two countries.

<P>
Jiang said the two sides should view and handle China-U.S.
relations from a strategic and long-term perspective, remove all
interference and firmly promote a sound and stable development of
China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
He said in handling bilateral relations, the two countries
should unswervingly abide by the principles embodied in the three
Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques and the Sino-U.S. Joint Statement.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. should make particular efforts to properly
address the Taiwan question, Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We should properly address our differences on the principle of
mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, non-interfence in
each other's internal affairs and seeking common ground while
reserving differences," the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
China and the U.S. should try to find the converging point of
their common interests and work to expand the areas of
cooperation, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He also called for vigorous promotion of friendly relations and
cooperation between China and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In a few months' time, Jiang said, China the U.S. will
celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of their
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
"China-U.S. relations are at an important historical juncture
of building on the past and preparing for the future," Jiang said,
and "I am convinced that, with the joint efforts of both sides, we
will surely be able to overcome all kinds of obstacles to advance
our relations toward a constructive strategic partnership."
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan question, Jiang said, is the most important and most
sensitive issue at the core of China-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The key to a healthy and stable growth of China-U.S. relations
lies in the proper approach to the Taiwan question in strict
accordance with the principles set forth in the three China-U.S.
Joint Communiques and related commitments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Clinton reiterated during the talks the
commitments the United States has made on the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed to enhance dialogue and cooperation
between the two countries on major international issues and work
together to bring into the 21st century a world that is peaceful,
secure, stable and conducive to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to continue with concerted efforts to make greater
strides toward the goal of a constructive strategic China-U.S.
partnership. In this spirit, the two sides decided not to target
at each other the strategic nuclear weapons under their respective
control.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state believe it is necessary and useful for
leaders of the two countries to maintain close contacts with each
other and have direct, in-depth exchange of views on bilateral
relations and major international issues.

<HEADLINE> Germany Not to Release Pledged Aid to Zambia: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany will not release its aid
to Zambia as it pledged until Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) is privatized, German Ambassador to Zambia has said.
</P>
<P>
It will be economically imprudent if the assistance is
released before the privatization process of ZCCM is completed,
the Zambia Daily Mail Saturday quoted Helmuth Schroeder as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that the money ZCCM is losing equals the
amount of the aid the donor community pledged to give Zambia and
that if it is released, it will have no impact on its economy and
serve no purpose because all of it will go to bailing out the
ailing ZCCM.
</P>
<P>
While it's the Zambian government's decision to sell the
mines, the donor community largely remains concerned at the slow
pace in privatizing the mines, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of the mining sector to Zambian
economy, saying if there is an adverse effect on it, the rest of
its economy will suffer.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that the German government does not agree
to the reasons given by the Zambian government on the failure of
the talks with the Kafue Consortium.
</P>
<P>
Zambia discontinued the negotiations last April with Kafue
Consortium on the sale of Nchanga and Nkana mines, which make up
65 percent of the ZCCM assets, over disagreement on the prices of
the two mines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two other foreign mining companies pulled out, citing
falling international copper prices as the main reason for their
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the donors pledged Zambia an aid of 530 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Because of the falling copper prices and outdated equipment,
lack of investment and mismanagement, annual copper output of the
southern African country has decreased gradually to about 300,000
tons in recent years from peak 750,000 tons in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investment, advanced technology and
management to revive the stagnating copper production, Zambia has
invited foreign tenders for the ZCCM mines and assets.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano said the
whole team were confident for their clash against Brazil in the second
round on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We're confident for our match Saturday. We have won the chance to
play here against Brazil, and we have to make the most of it," he said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said he had a good relationship with Brazil's star striker
Ronaldo, who will be one of the major threats to the Chilean goal
later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Of course I know Ronaldo since he plays for my club (Inter Milan).
When he's having a good day, he creates a lot of problems for us,"
said Zamorano.
</P>
<P>
He said it was apparent that Ronaldo played better than him.
</P>
<P>
"Is Ronaldo better than me? I don't doubt it for a minute," he
said. "I'm 31 and have accomplished much in my career, but he still
has his entire life ahead of him."
</P>
<P>
"I get on very well with Ronaldo in Milan, but I think I get on
better with (Marcelo) Salas on the Chilean team," he added.
</P>
<P>
"For now, I can thank God for giving me a chance to play with the
two best strikers in the world: Ronaldo in Milan and Salas on the
Chilean side"
</P>
<P>
He said he would stay with Inter Milan next year but was proud that
Paris Saint-German had an interest in him.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'll play in Paris one day," he said.

<P>
President Clinton and I decided that China and the U.S. will
not target each other with the strategic nuclear arms under our
control. This shows the whole world that China and the U.S. are
cooperative partners instead of adversaries.
</P>
<P>
I reiterate here again that since the day when China began to
possess nuclear weapons, it made the commitment not to be the
first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton and I have reached extensive consensus on
further enhancing the Sino-U.S. exchanges and cooperation in the
bilateral ties and many other areas.
</P>
<P>
We have agreed to take positive steps to promote the constant
development of the mutually beneficial trade and economic

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
U.S. President Bill Clinton met the press after their formal talks
at the Great Hall of the People here this morning. Following is
the full text of Jiang's opening remarks at the press conference:
</P>
<P>
Just now we held formal talks. The two sides made extensive and
profound exchange of views on Sino-U.S. relations and major
international and regional issues. The talks were positive,
constructive and fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The successful mutual visits between the two heads of state of
the two countries marked that Sino-U.S. relations have entered a
new stage of development. This not only accords with the common
interests of China and the United States but also is of important
and positive significance to promoting the peace, stability and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the two main themes of the times, an
era full of hopes and challenges. Under the new historical
conditions, the common interests between China and the United
States are increased instead of being decreased. The foundation of
cooperation between the two countries is strengthened instead of
being weakened.
</P>
<P>
The two sides beleive that the two countries, both as permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council, should make
concerted efforts to promote peace and security in the
Asia-Pacific region, ease and remove various tense situations,
prevent the proliferation of mass destructive weapons, enhance
environmental protection, crack down on international crimes, drug
trafficking and international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to further increase the dialogue and
cooperation between the two countries in major international
issues. The Sino-U.S. relations are improving and developing and
both sides have achieved important progress in many areas of
cooperation.

<P>
The Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive issue
in Sino-U.S. relations, and we hope that the U.S. side will abide
by the principles and the commitments laid down in the three
Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the joint statement to ensure the
smooth development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The improvement and development of Sino-U.S. relations have
been hard-earned thanks to the joint efforts by the governments
and people of the two countries, and we should all the more
treasure it.
</P>
<P>
Although China and the U.S. have different social systems,
ideologies, concepts of values, cultural background and traditions
and differing views on some issues, they should not hinder the
development of Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
The world is a colorful one, and the road of development for
each country should be decided by its own people.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States should examine and handle bilateral
relations from the strategic height and a long-term perspective.
We should promote the bilateral ties in a spirit of mutual
respect, equality and mutual benefit, and of seeking common ground
while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
I believe we will make continued progress toward building a
21st century-oriented constructive strategic partnership with
joint efforts of both sides.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President to Visit N. Cyprus in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Amid the new wave of tension
between Greece and Turkey, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel is
due to visit northern Cyprus next month to show Ankara's support
for Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Demirel's visit scheduled for July 20 is to mark the anniversary
of Turkey's military intervention in Cyprus 24 years ago, the
English-language newspaper Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On July 20, 1974, Turkish troops landed and took over the
northern third of Cyprus in the wake of an abortive coup by Greek
Cypriot army officers who attempted to seek union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Cyprus, Demirel is expected to meet with
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas on the latest developments on
the long-divided island, the paper quoted unnamed diplomats as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president's trip to northern Cyprus is believed to
be a response to his Greek counterpart Costis Stephanopoulos'
four-day official visit to the island country starting from
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Greece's four F-16 fighters and two C-130 transport
planes landed at the air base near the town of Paphos in western
Cyprus, triggering strong protests from Turkey and Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkey retaliated by sending six F-16 fighters to northern
Cyprus to show its determination to protect Turkish Cypriots
living in the northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over a number of issues
concerning the Mediterranean and Aegean, the settlement of the
knotty Cyprus problem in particular.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which keeps close relations with Greece and
Turkey, has been trying to mediate between the two foes, but no
substantial improvement in bilateral ties has been made so far.

<HEADLINE> Measures Introduced to Curb Price Fall of Meat and Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is taking
fresh measures to curb the downturn of the prices of meat and
sugar in a bid to protect the enthusiasm of the producers.
</P>
<P>
Due to a continuous rise in output, the purchasing price of
live pigs fell from 7.91 yuan (0.95 US dollars) to 5.8 yuan per
kilogram from January to May, and this was the lowest ever
recorded since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the record-high output of sugar also brought down
the price of sugar to the lowest since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, many of the pig-raisers in pig-producing areas
have begun killing mother pigs. If the trend is going on uncurbed,
the farmers' enthusiasm will be seriously hurt," a market analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
In order to address the problem, the State Bureau of Internal
Trade which supervises commodity marketing and storing, has worked
out five major measures:
</P>
<P>
Since April, the Bureau has coordinated the selling of
slaughtered pigs from producing to consuming regions and in
storing more pork in state-run warehouses.
</P>
<P>
An amount of imported sugar has been shifted as state reserves
instead of putting it onto the market.
</P>
<P>
An urgent circular was issued calling for local governments to
ensure more purchasing funds and subsidies and increase the
storage of meat and sugar.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made to step up the purchase of meat and
sugar by state-owned purchasing companies and to organize more
exports.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Use Cuttlefish Ink to Treat Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- While Chinese scientists in Shanghai
are trying to use the toxic white arsenic to treat cancer, some
other scientists in east China's Shandong Province claimed that
they are managing to turn cancer cells into normal ones with
non-toxic cuttlefish ink.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Sun Keren, professor at the toxicology research
institute of Shandong Medical Science University, scientists
probed a new way to treat cancer patients by using a kind of
non-toxic biological pharmaceutical with a special material
extracted from cuttlefish ink and rare traditional Chinese
medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the cancer cells are developed from variant normal
cells. Chemical and radiation therapies are usually applied after
the patients undergo operations.
</P>
<P>
However, those methods kill a large amount of healthy cells
while killing cancer cells. So scientists worldwide are seeking a
non-toxic method to treat the deadly cancers.
</P>
<P>
After eight years research, Sun and his colleagues have used
their self-developed pharmaceutical to cause abnormal development
of thew cancer information transmission system which impels cancer
cells to turn to become normal ones.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the pharmaceutical can also curb the deceasing of
white blood cells and enhance patients' immunological function.
</P>
<P>
Clinic use of the pharmaceutical indicated that the rate for
curbing the development of cancers reaches 70.8 percent and 98
percent of patients under radiation or chemical treatment
therapies have their white blood cells increased after taking the
pharmaceutical.
</P>
<P>
Sun's research will focus on the industrialization of the
cuttlefish-ink pharmaceutical.

Chinese archaeologists regard it as a proof that the site was
where Ruyao Kiln, one of the most famous kiln complex in the
dynasty, was located. The kiln was noted for its celadon ware made
for imperial family.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the archaeologists unearthed there remains of a
workshop and tens of porcelain pieces and gather that Baofeng was
probably the site of Ruyao Kiln. Yet no remains of kilns have been
discovered previously.
</P>
<P>
The newly-found kilns are in the shape of a horse's hoof. One
of them is so well preserved that it can be restored easily and
will contribute to the study of celadon-making in the Northern
Song Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Porcelain pieces found at the site suggest that the site was
operational during the period from the Northern Song to the Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368).

<HEADLINE> Residence of Ceylon Prince's Offspring Found in Quanzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The residence of an offspring of a
Ceylon prince who came to China some 500 years ago has been found
in Quanzhou city in east China's Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese historians value the residence as it provides an
evidence for the relationship between China and ancient Ceylon, or
today's Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the residence, as well as the
mausoleum of the prince's offsprings, are evidence of Sino-Ceylon
relationship ever found in China.
</P>
<P>
Historical records have shown that a crown prince of Ceylon was
sent to China in 1459, when the country was under the rule of the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, his father, then the king of Ceylon, died
and his cousin took over the crown. The prince could no longer go
back to his motherland and settled in Quanzhou, then a famouse
seaport of China.
</P>
<P>
The newly-found residence was first built some 300 years ago in
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) by Shi Quanguan, an offspring of the
Ceylon prince who changed his family name into "Shi".
</P>
<P>
According to the title deed owned presently by Lin Jinzheng,
the house was sold to a family with the surname of Yuan in 1783
and in 1885 it was sold again to a family with the surname of Lin.
</P>
<P>
The brick house in the Quanzhou local style, covering an area
of some 800 sq m, was kept intact with original flower pots and
fish bowls.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's VP to Hold Talks With Squatters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zibabwean African
National Union (Patriotic Front) (ZANU-PF) has tasked Zimbabwean
Vice-President Simon Muzenda to persuade the Svosve villagers to
vacate the farms they have forcibly occupied.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for administration of the party Didymus Mutasa told
the Zimbabwe News Agency in an interview Friday that the central
committee of the party's 34th ordinary session held in Harare
Friday had tasked Muzenda to persuade villagers from Svosve
communal area to recognize the need to be orderly resettled.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of the Svosve people was mentioned in passing
during the meeting and Vice-President Muzenda was assigned to go
there tomorrow to try and talk to them so that they realize what
is happening and the fact that there are farms earmarked for
orderly resettlement in Mashonaland East Province," he said.
</P>
<P>
The land-hungry villagers in Svosve communal lands, about 80
kilometers east of Harare, last week marched onto commercial
farms in the area and vowed to stay put, accusing the government
of not acting speedily on its planned resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
They have already begun putting up shelters.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe has ruled out the use of force to evict them,
saying they had genuine reasons to demand resettlement but should
wait to be orderly resettled.
</P>
<P>
The analysts in Harare said the Svosve issue had far-reaching
ramifications, including dampening investor confidence. They
also expressed fear that if the government was not tough enough
on the villagers, other villagers elsewhere would also illegally
resettle themselves.
</P>
<P>
President Mugabe Friday urged his ruling ZANU-PF government to
move fast on land redistribution program to avoid anarchy.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Facilitates Operation of Foreign Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River, the longest in
China, will introduce an internationally-recognized "sectional
ship piloting system" to facilitate the operation of foreign ships.
</P>
<P>
Also as part of the effort, the ban on night sailing of foreign
ships will be gradually relaxed, according to the river
administrative authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant Chinese legislation, foreign ships
sailing on the Yangtze should be led by Chinese pilots. The river
opened to foreign ships in April, 1983.
</P>
<P>
"Sectional piloting", already in practice on the Mississippi,
the Rhine, the Suez and Panama canals, is designed to enable the
relay of pilots and the non-stopping sailing of the ships on long
journeys.
</P>
<P>
It is highly necessary to implement "sectional piloting" on the
Yangtze, since as long as 1,331 kilometers of the river have
opened to foreign ships, the river authorities said.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the implementation of the practice, several
piloting relay bases are being built on the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Since May, 1983 when the first foreign ship entered the
Yangtze, 77,000 ships from 60 countries and regions of the world
have been using the river course.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate piloting, piloting stations have been
built at major ports in Nanjing, Nantong, Zhangjiagang, Zhenjiang,
Shanghai, Wuhan, Jiujiang and Wuhu.
</P>
<P>
There are now 160 pilots working on the river for foreign
ships, who account for one fifth of China's river piloting
force.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Yang Min's dream to have a
personal psychiatrist has come true since he has joined a private
psychological consultation agency in the Chinese capital of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Established two months ago as the first privately-owned
psychological body, the Bonian Yangguang (sunshine) Family Health
Advisory Club means the appearance of private psychological
services in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Yang, in his forties, said that social reforms sped up social
development, meanwhile they also put a bigger mental pressure on
people. "Psychological adjustment is the best thing to do,
whatever difficulties one might meet," Yang added.
</P>
<P>
Yan Jun from the club disclosed that more than 2,000 people
have joined his club, in line with a development momentum to have
personal psychiatrists as people are paying much attention to
psychological health.
</P>
<P>
Many of the members of the club are middle-aged and young
people who usually get help from psychiatrists through
telephones. If necessary, people can also have face-to-face
dialogues with doctors at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
The club provides consultation on personal love affairs,
marriage, education of children, career development and relations
with other people.
</P>
<P>
A survey disclosed that at present some 70 percent of the local
residents are interested in psychological services.

<HEADLINE> Door to Negotiation with Dalai Lama Is Open: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin told
a press conference here today that the door to negotiation with
the Dalai Lama is open so long as the Dalai Lama recognizes that
Tibet is an inalienable part of China and that Taiwan is a
province of China.
</P>
<P>
"Actually we have several channels of communication with him. I
hope (to see) positive changes in the Dalai Lama," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in response to an earlier statement by
U.S. President Clinton that he had urged Jiang to resume a
dialogue with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton is also interested in the question of the
Dalai Lama. Actually since the Dalai Lama left (Tibet) in 1959,
earth-shaking changes have taken place in Tibet and theocracy has
gone forever, although the disappearance of this system in Tibet
is much later than that in Europe after Renaissance," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"More than one million serfs under the rule of the Dalai Lama
were liberated and I visited a liberated serf's family in 1990,"
Jiang noted, adding that the system of national autonomy is in
practice in Tibet and people there have their Tibet Autonomous
Region government.
</P>
<P>
"Since I came to work in the central government, I have urged
the rest 29 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions to
assist Tibet in its development, even including those provinces
that are not developed such as Qinghai," Jiang said, stressing the
fact that 8 billion Yuan (RMB) has been spent on Tibet and 62
projects have been accomplished there," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Send Five or Six Sports to Asiad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Only athletes from five or six
sports deserve to go to the 13th Asian Games in Bangkok in
December, a minister was quoted by local press Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deserving athletes were from badminton, karate,
weightlifting, tennis and boxing, Minister of sports and Youth
Affairs Agung Laksono said, adding that other sports only held
slim chances of bagging medals in the quadrennial sporting event.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, The National Sports Council announced that the
country's athletes would compete in 21 sports in the hope of
winning six or seven gold medals.
</P>
<P>
On a visit to the national badminton training center in East
Jakarta on Friday, Agung said that the lack of international
achievements coupled with lack of funds should prod several sports
organizations to reconsider their efforts to send their athletes.
</P>
<P>
"The contingent is not necessarily big in quantity, but the
important things are quality and chances to win medals," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia only excelled in badminton at the previous Asian
Games in Hiroshima, Japan, four years ago, winning all of its
three gold medals in the event. In the upcoming Asian Games,
Indonesia will likely rely on badminton players in its medal hunt.
</P>
<P>
The badminton association's deputy in charge of athlete
development Mangombar Ferdinand Siregar told Agung that the
association had drawn up a master training plan for the Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The association would shortlist between 42 and 48 shuttlers
from the 63 players currently at the training center, Siregar
said.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes as expected, we will give the
Olympics-bound players the privilege to take part in international
tournaments," he added.
</P>
<P>
The race for Olympic qualifying will start in April next year
and finish 12 months later.

<HEADLINE> Jamuna Bridge to Bring High Rate of Economic Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The 4.8-kilometer-long Bangabandhu
Jamuma Bridge, the longest bridge in Bangladesh as well as in
south Asia which opened to traffic Tuesday, may have an annual
economic rate of return at 22 percent, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility studies of the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) showed a healthy rate of return, A.H.M.
Abdullah, deputy project manager of the bridge, was quoted by
press reports Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"A healthy rate of return is expected to come from the bridge
and it may go up from the previous estimate of 14.9 percent,"
considering the traffic volume in the last few days after the
opening of the bridge, an ADB expert said.
</P>
<P>
The bridge would not only pay off all its foreign debts of 600
million U.S. dollars by the year 2033, but also earn an impressive
net income, in view of the anticipated daily traffic demand and
its earnings as a facility provider for railway, power, and
telecommunications, according to Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
The power transmission lines with the bridge, for example,
would reduce the cost of supplying power to the west of the
country which would otherwise request a power interconnector
across the Jamuan River at a much higher cost, he said. This
helped to increase the economic rate of return substantially, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Toll collection from vehicles across the bridge was estimated
at 50-60 million taka (about 1.09-1.3 million dollars) per month.
"Collection of the first two days indicates the monthly toll
collection will be 50-60 million taka (about 1.09-1.30 million
dollars)," resulting in an annual collection from the bridge
ranging between 600-720 million taka (about 13.04-15.65 million
dollars), an official of the bridge authority said.
</P>
<P>
Initially authorities have fixed the target of annual toll from
the country's largest development project at 530 million taka
(about 11.52 million dollars) that may rise up to 7 billion taka
(about 152.17 million dollars) by the year 2033, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 35,000 to 40,000 jobs might be generated
each year in the country's northern region after the opening of
the bridge, according to an ADB survey conducted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the 950 million-dollar multipurpose bridge,
which was funded by the Bangladeshi government, the World Bank,
the ADB and Japan, started in October 1994.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- NBA Washington Wizards player
Juwan Howard denied that he made a sexual assault to a woman, and
is seeking 20 million U.S. dollars from the accuser for his
reputation and image damage.
</P>
<P>
Howard's lawyer filed the civil suit Friday in Montgomery
County Circuit Court in Maryland. The suit seeks compensation for
emotional distress caused by the charges made by a Connecticut
woman.
</P>
<P>
The woman dialed 911 and told police that she was sexually
assaulted during a party on April 6 at Howard's home. She also
mentioned Howard's teammate Chris Webber's name.
</P>
<P>
"This woman's allegations have done irreparable harm to my
reputation and image," Howard said in a statement by his lawyer
Mitchell Rubinstein on TV. "It was important to me to take legal
action in order to restore my good reputation and deter anyone
from making such false claims against me in the future."
</P>
<P>
The woman's lawyer Ned Collier said his client would respond to
Howard's suit with one of her own, this time in civil court.
</P>
<P>
"My client told the truth in front of the grand jury, she told
the truth to me and she will tell the truth in court again," the
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
Webber and Howard denied any wrongdoing in the sexual assault
case.

<HEADLINE> China Is Right on Resolving Tiananmen Disturbances: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Had the Chinese Government not
taken resolute measures to deal with the political disturbances in
1989, China would not enjoy the stability that it is enjoying
today, President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a joint press conference with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in the Great Hall of the People at noon
today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question from Xinhua about China's position
concerning the human rights issue and apparently showing
disagreement to an earlier allusion by President Clinton to the
Tiananmen Square incident in June 1989, Jiang said that the
Chinese people "have long drawn a historical conclusion" on this
incident.
</P>
<P>
He noted that today the Chinese Government solemnly commits
itself to the promotion and protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
</P>
<P>
"China stresses that top priority should be given to the rights
to subsistence and the rights to development," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, he noted, "efforts should be made to
strengthen democracy and legal system building and to protect the
economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights of the
people."
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that the Chinese nation always respects
and maintains the dignity and the rights of people.
</P>
<P>
He quoted an ancient Chinese thinker more than 2,000 years ago
as saying that "among all the living things nurtured between
heaven and earth, the most valuable is human beings."
</P>
<P>
"China and the United States have differences and also have
common grounds on the human rights issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries differ in social system, ideology,
historical, cultural and traditional backgrounds, he said, they
have different ways and means to realize human rights and
fundamental freedoms.
</P>
<P>
"So it's nothing strange that we may have some difference of
views over some issues," President Jiang said.

WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- NBA Houston Rochets' star
Charles Barkley was fined Friday and had to make community service
visits to two children's programs to settle charges for throwing a
bar patron through a window last October.
</P>
<P>
"I had allowed myself to be provoked by a malicious bar patron,
and I realize in hindsight that I compounded the problem by not
being initially more cooperative with the officers present,"
Barkley wrote to the judge.

Barkley was ordered to pay 320 U.S. dollars in fines and court
costs, and the 34-year-old has to visit a hospital for children

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today refuted some overseas media's allegations that China was
involved in political donations to the United States, calling the
allegations "sheer fabrications."
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with the visiting U.S. President
Bill Clinton, which was held here shortly after formal talks
between the two heads of state, Jiang said that before Clinton's
visit, he learned about some media reports alleging China have
been involved in some so-called political contributions in the US.
</P>
<P>
"I really think it's very absurd and ridiculous, and I think
they are sheer fabrications. China can never do such a thing, and
China never interferes in other country's internal affairs," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that President Clinton also brought up these
allegations in their talks this morning.
</P>
<P>
"I told him that after hearing these allegations, we conducted
very earnest investigation into the matter, and the results of the
investigation show that there is never such a thing," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the people can have different understandings
of one fact, this is actually a manifestation of democracy.
However, what's important is that the fact itself should not be
distorted," he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Denies Concession Made in Detargeting Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
denied that the U.S. side has made any concession in the course
of reaching an agreement with China on not to target their
respective nuclear missiles at each other's countries.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question from a U.S. journalist whether concessions
have been made on the joint press conference hosted by the two
presidents, Clinton said "the short answer...and the accurate one
is No."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. position on the issue has been products
of decades of experience that has not been changed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton elaborated that the agreement is a mutual decision to
eliminate the chance of any accidental launch of each's nuclear
missiles and to take one more step in showing mutual confidence
and trust in one anther.
</P>
<P>
The decision is also a "helpful signal as a counterweight to
the recent nuclear tests in India and Pakistan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese President Jiang Zemin pointed out the
agreement shows to the whole world that China and the U.S. are
partners rather than adversaries, and reiterated that China will
not be the first to use nuclear weapons under any circumstances, a
promise China has kept since the very day it came into possession
of nuclear weapons.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's House of
Representatives approved the 825 billion baht (20.1 billion U.S.
dollar) budget for fiscal 1999 late Friday night after the
opposition staged a walkout.
</P>
<P>
As The Nation reported Saturday, the opposition said the budget
was unacceptable because it was not in line with the economic
situation and had only been prepared to improve the government's
stability.
</P>
<P>
However, House members voted 205 to nil in favor of the Budget
Bill at the first reading after a three-day debate and set up a
special committee to scrutinize it.
</P>
<P>
Before the debate ended after mid-night, the opposition New
Aspiration Party legislators walked out in protest.
</P>
<P>
The budget will carry a 25 billion baht (609.8 million dollars)
deficit, and revenue collections would not come as "overly
estimated" under the economic crunch, the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
With such a budget, the government would not succeed in curing
the economic woes, they said.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Declines in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The percentage of the unemployed
in Sri Lanka's labor force declined from 13.1 percent in 1994 to
10.3 percent last year, according to the Department of Census and
Statistics (DCS) here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The number of Sri Lanka's unemployed people declined from
797,591 in 1994 to 644,870 in 1997. However, in the previous three
years from 1991 to 1994 the decline in the number of the
unemployed was only 64,089, the DCS sources said.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed comprised 319,383 (49,5 percent) males and
325,487 (50.5 percent) females in 1997. More than 80 percent of
the unemployed are youths in the age groups of 18 to 29.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is highest among persons who have the
General Certificate of Education (Ordinary Level), the sources
stated.
</P>
<P>
A large number of employed persons, about 38 percent, are
engaged in the agricultural sector while 15.6 percent are engaged
in the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the decline in unemployment is due to the
setting up of many new industries during the past three years,
said the sources, adding that in the next three years Sri Lanka
proposes to push projects to develop the rural areas and provide
more employment.

Although China and the U.S. have different social systems,

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Develop Corn Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- World Health Organization (WHO)
has granted 50 million U.S. dollars in a bid to popularize and
develop the cultivation of corn in Sri Lanka, according to
Agriculture Ministry sources here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the corn could be cultivated as Sri Lanka's
climate was suitable, but the country has been cultivating a
little of corn in the past.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the WHO's grant, the ministry had taken several steps
to popularize corn cultivation and a four-year plan has been
drawn up.
</P>
<P>
The plan is being implemented from June this year, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the ministry aims to harvest 32,000 tons of
corn before the end of this year and 151,000 tons in the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15,000 hectares of land have been utilized for corn
cultivation in Anuradhapura district in the Central Northern
Province for the 97-98 season, said the sources, adding that a
special program has already been launched by the state and private
sector traders to buy the corn harvest of 20,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Four Suspects Arrested in Thailand Over WTC Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A police source Saturday confirmed
a newspaper report that U.S. FBI agents stormed a Bangkok
apartment Friday and arrested four foreign nationals suspected of
involvement in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York.
</P>
<P>
The suspects belong to a Moslem extremist group that
masterminded the blast, the source said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Nation Newspaper quoted U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation officers as saying the four men were suspected of
planning to assassinate the U.S. ambassador to Thailand and launch
a terrorist attack on the U.S. Embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the suspects -- Mohamad Rahim, 30, Hadja Pahu
Sasa, 25, Hara Haj Husem, 26, and Hareef Hussen, 25 -- had made
contact with several Thai suppliers to obtain weapons for their
operations. The paper said the suspects are Pakistani nationals.
</P>
<P>
Thai immigration police, acting on an FBI tip-off, traced the
suspects to their hideaway and made the arrests, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said U.S. Ambassador to Thailand William Itoh and a group of
U.S. officials later visited the Suan Pllu headquarters of the
Immigration Police where the four suspects were being held.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy spokesman acknowledged that an investigation of
the suspects' activities in Thailand was under way. But he said
that at present he could not link the suspects with the World
Trade Center bombing, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The bombing killed six people and wounded more than 1,000
others. Damage was estimated at more than 500 million U.S.
dollars. Six men were convicted in the United States between 1994
and 1997 in connection with the attack.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Moves to Ease Interest Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand, the
country's central bank, took a new step Friday to ease its grip on
monetary policy by lowering interest rates on the bond repurchase
market below 17 percent, the Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The move was positively received by the market as a step toward
easing the pressing interest burden on the corporate sector, the
newspaper quoted central bank governor Chatumongol Sonakul as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange rates were also trading in a satisfactory
range without any intervention by the central bank, the governor
said when commenting on the new move.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the baht traded late at 41.45/55 to the U.S. dollar,
compared with 41.16/26 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The overnight interest rate through the bond repurchase market
was 16.875 percent, down from 17.25 percent on Thursday. Interbank
rates on Friday ranged from 17-18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Apart from complaints from the country's corporate sector, many
foreign analysts had also called for the central bank to lower
interest rates to ease the credit crunch.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said he believed the economic contraction of
Thailand would not reach 7-8 percent this year, since the country
has a strong agricultural base and relative social stability.
</P>
<P>
Pressure on the capital account has also eased as the rollover
rate of foreign loans remains high, he added.

BELGRADE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy
to the Balkans, said here Friday the United States will do
everything possible to help secure a peaceful settlement regarding
the Kosovo crisis, the Tanjug News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke warned at a press conference after meeting Kosovo
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova that the situation in Kosovo is
"very dangerous."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all efforts should be made to prevent the
fighting in Kosovo from escalating into a war.
</P>
<P>
NATO is very concerned over the Kosovo issue, the envoy
said. NATO is now working on actions to take if the Kosovo
conflicts turns into war and spreads beyond the Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
Decisions will be made only by President Bill Clinton when
mobilization of NATO forces involves the United States, Holbrooke
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the next few days will be dedicated to strengthening
diplomatic mediations between Belgrade and Pristina, the
provincial capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said on Thursday the international community was
opposed to the independence of Kosovo and conceded that Kosovo is
part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has sunk into chaos since pro-independence ethnic
Albanians clashed with local Serb police in February. More than
300 people have been killed since then.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts in the troubled province are now threatening to
escalate and spill over into neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Mergers Promote China's Industrial Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- South-north enterprise mergers
are going strong in China, aimed at reshaping the country's
state-owned industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry of northeast China's Liaoning
province, the country's major heavy industrial base, for example,
has witnessed a surge of mergers and purchasing, involving
enterprises in south China.
</P>
<P>
The province has some high-tech enterprises that have been
doing well in manufacturing color TVs, refrigerators and washing
machines since the early 1980s. But most of them are facing a
declining market due to poor management and operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, producers of electrical appliances in south China
have made excellent achievements, and they are seeking for
opportunities to expand their market shares and gain more benefits.
</P>
<P>
Kelon Group, China's largest refrigerator producer in Shunde
city of Guangdong province, for example, took the lead in entering
north China, financing the formation of the Yingkou-Kelon
Corporation with the Yingkou Refrigerator Plant, Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
"Kelon will set up a huge production and marketing system by
the end of the century, based in Shunde while developing two wings
in Yingkou of northeast China and Chengdu of Sichuan province,
southwest China, in an effort to manufacture three million
refrigerators annually", said Jin Changwei, deputy general manager
of the Yingkou-Kelon Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Other high-tech giants from Guangdong, Shandong, Shanxi and
Shanghai are also doing the same. "It's of strategic significance
to group small businesses into large enterprises to face
competition in the domestic and world market", said Wang Jiaqi,
deputy manager of a joint venture between Fushun city of Liaoning
and the Hi-Sense Electrical Appliances Group of Qingdao,
Shandong.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Reduce Oil Production Starting July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to reduce oil production by 30,000 barrels per day (bpd)
to 1.28 million bpd starting next month, local press Saturday
quoted a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will produce only 1.28 million bpd for one year
starting July 1, down from 1.38 million bpd as targeted for that
period, Minister for Mines and Energy Kuntoro Mangkusobroto said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in support of the agreement reached by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that each
member, except Iraq, is to reduce production to anticipate an
oversupply in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial conference in Vienna last week decided to
reduce the organization's total oil production by 600,000 to
800,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
The total OPEC production (excluding Iraq) on July 1, 1998 to
June 30, 1999 was put at 24.397 million bpd, down from 26.987
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
"The decisions made by OPEC and non-OPEC countries slightly
boosted the oil price. The price however has decreased to 10.11
U.S. dollars per barrel since June 15 as world demand for oil in
the second quarter of 1998 dwindled," the ministry's spokesman
Budi Sulistyo was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Production to Drop by 6.25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's unhusked rice output
is expected to drop by 6.25 percent to 46.29 million tons this
year due to the planting season being delayed by the drought,
according to the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said Friday the severe drought which hit the country
last year and delayed the rice planting season, affected the
supply of water to many rice-producing regions and led to reduced
yields and crop failure.
</P>
<P>
The drought reduced rice planting areas by 4.13 percent to
10.68 million hectares this year from 11.14 million hectares last
year, the bureau said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Reduction of fertilizers and pesticides used in rice farming
has also resulted in a downward trend in the volume of rice
production, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
However, the bureau announced increased production of several
other crops. For instance, the country's corn production this year
is expected to reach 9.17 million tons, up 4.56 percent from 8.77
million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is expected to import 3.1 million tons of rice from
Thailand, India, China, Vietnam and Pakistan to make up for the
shortage in domestic production this year, official sources said
earlier.

<HEADLINE> Retired U.S. Commander Denies Use of Nerve Gas to Kill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A retired Army commander of a
U.S. military operation on Friday denied the alleged use of nerve
gas to kill defectors during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
"Tailwind was a diversionary mission. It was not to kill
defectors or POWs or anything like that," Army Col. Eugene
McCarley who was a captain at the time he led the mission, told
500 members of the Special Forces Association at its annual
meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the CNN and Time magazine reported that
their research over eight months indicated that sarin nerve gas
was used by U.S. forces in about 20 operations in northern Vietnam
and in the so-called secret war in Laos.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Tailwind mission was aimed at killing U.S.
defectors and up to 20 American military defectors may have been
killed.
</P>
<P>
"The CNN report was absolutely wrong," McCarley said, "I think
we fought a good fight."
</P>
<P>
A key source of the CNN-Time report was retired Admiral Thomas
Moorer, a Vietnam-era chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He
has since backed away from his account.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen has ordered an official
investigation into the report.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Advance Women's Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to step up its
scheme to advance the women's cause phase by phase for the
progress of the nation based on patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Myanmar National Committee for
Women's Affairs (MNCWA) here Friday, Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt
urged the committee to render effective assistance down to the
grassroots level for health, education and social progress of
Myanmar women to safeguard the country's tradition, culture, race
and religion, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Khin Nyunt, who is first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace
and Development Council, also urged the committee to strive for
the emergence of a peaceful, developed and modern nation in
cooperation with government organizations and non-governmental
ones including the Myanmar Maternal and Child Welfare
Association.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the committee to strive to implement programs
worked out in line with the tasks laid down by the Beijing
Declaration adopted at the United Nations Fourth World Conference
on Women held in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The MNCWA was formed after Myanmar had agreed to the Beijing
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a workshop of the MNCWA on women's development took
place here last month to draw up the programs and plans for
implementing the country's women development projects including
education, health and socio-economic development as well as
protection of Myanmar women against violence.

<HEADLINE> Modern Life Built for Ethnic Folks of Rocky Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Cutting through the desolate rocky
mountain, one arrives at the Disu Township where the scene changes
quite dramatically. In sight are two- and three-story villas
inlaid with colorful ceramic tiles. Mitsubishi and Toyota
cross-country jeeps are running against the hot breeze of June.
</P>
<P>
In the homes of local folks, one can see an abundance of modern
home appliances such as color televisions, telephones and
electrical water heaters, as well as stockpiles of rattan-woven
handicraft articles.
</P>
<P>
It is these rattan articles plus a thriving market economy that
have turned a dream for modern life into reality for the folks of
one of the poorest mountain areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Disu Township is located on a rocky mountain in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China. Nothing grows on the
mountain except rattans and grass. The severe shortage of arable
land made the township's 48,100 people live under poverty even in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
By chance, Wei Changying, a young fellow of the yao ethnic
group, learned in 1994 that rattan-woven wares, which local folks
made for exchanging salt and matches, could be sold to foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Wearing clothes of home-woven cotton cloth and carrying rattan
ware samples, the shy-looking Wei turned up during the annual
export commodity fair held in Guangzhou in the spring of that year.
</P>
<P>
The exquisite flower baskets and Christmas gifts caught the
immediate attention of businessmen, and deals worth 15,000 yuan
(1,807 US dollars) were clinched.
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the dozen varieties of rattan growing out of the
rocky mountain have become a huge source of wealth. Orders from
the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Holland have flaked
in.
</P>
<P>
Now over 90 percent of the township's labor force are involved
in the business. In 1997, the township turned out 23 million yuan
(2.71 million US dollars) worth of rattan articles which were sold
to over 20 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The successful business has brought incredible wealth to the
once poor township. Take Danyang Village for example. Now 95
percent of the households have built multi-story houses. The
families have bought 30 imported jeeps each worth over 300,000
yuan plus a dozen less-expensive cars.

<HEADLINE> Tumor Necrosin Believed Effective in AIDS Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Danish professor claimed
that the necrosin of tumor inside the human body may be effective
in the treatment and prevention of the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
Tan Jinquan, visiting professor at the Anhui Medical Science
University, said he will engage in the research in the next three
years to find if his inference is true.
</P>
<P>
The government of east China's Anhui Province and the
university have decided to spend 1 million yuan (120,000
U.S. dollars) on the research program.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old professor said scientists found in 1975 that
lab mice would have cell tissue that has immunity and could cause
necrosis of tumor after injection of BCG vaccine. Scientists
called the tissue "necrosin of tumor."
</P>
<P>
After 10 years research, Tan found that the necrosin of tumor
could keep the AIDS virus under control.
</P>
<P>
He said when the AIDS virus infects the human body, its needs a
"tunnel" inside the human body, while the necrosin of tumor could
block the moving of AIDS virus cells.
</P>
<P>
His inference has been proved by lab experiments on mice.
</P>
<P>
The professor has already published his latest discovery on
British magazine "Immunology" and the article was later cited by
U.S. "Science" magazine.

<HEADLINE> Girl with Rare Heart Undergoes Correction Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A hospital in northwest China's
Shaanxi province has successfully made a correction operation for
a "three-atrium-heart" girl. The surgery ended her 11 years heart
disorder.
</P>
<P>
An ordinary people's heart has only a left atrium and a right
atrium. However, the 11-year-old girl has three. Her left atrium
was divided into two parts with a six millimeter hole on the
central part of the diaphragm.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi People's hospital made the three-hour operation for
 widening the hole on the left cucurbit-shaped atriums and
removing the atrial septum between the left and right atriums.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the Hospital said the girl, coming from north
China's Hebei Province, often had tachycardia and in some cases,
her heart would beat 180 times per minute. She often felt
suppressed in the chest and faint because of blood blocking in her
left atrium.
</P>
<P>
With the operation, she now can live a normal life.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Comments on Historic Visit to Iran Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
is scheduled to arrive in Tehran on June 30 for a two-day visit to
Iran, the first by a Western head of government since 1978.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's visit comes as a result of the European Union's
decision in February to restore top-level contacts with Iran, and
of Italy's own strategic interest in the Mediterranean area,
according to a statement from the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
Italy wants to learn whether Iran's increasing openness to the
West and the reformist stance of President Mohammed Khatami has
actually born fruit inside the country, a spokesman for the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It's an exclusively political visit to understand (the
situation in Iran)," said Ricardo Franco Levi.
</P>
<P>
Italy has consistently backed a line of dialogue with Iran,
seeing it as essential not to alienate a key player in the Middle
East balance of power.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Levi stressed that Italy has never broken ranks
with its Western allies in policy towards Iran and is not doing so
now.
</P>
<P>
"All our allies know about this visit," he said. "They know
that they will be informed of whatever emerges from it and the
Iranians know this too."
</P>
<P>
The groundwork for the visit, during which Prodi will meet
President Khatami and other top Iranian politicians, was laid by
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who went to Tehran in early March.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Thursday that Italy wanted the West to support
President Khatami and encourage the openness he proposes.
</P>
<P>
Khatami won a landslide election victory last year.

<HEADLINE> Island Province Free From Red Tides (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Old Zeng, a fish breeder in
Qionghai of south China's Hainan province, expects a good harvest
and handsome returns this year as he is sure of the good quality
of the environment that guarantees his business success.
</P>
<P>
He didn't, however, feel so good only one or two months ago,
when he learned that red tides were frequently occurring in the
waters off Hong Kong and Guangdong that are not far away.
</P>
<P>
"I felt worried every day then, afraid that misfortune might
fall, but now it seems unnecessary for me to worry about it
anymore as specialists have assured me red tides will not come,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Specialists say that the red tide is mainly caused by
pollutants from land and excessive marine cultivation. But Hainan
province has never been invaded by large-scale destructive red
tides since 1988, and the province's sea areas will be free from
red tides for a long time to come thanks to the sound
environmental quality and the steps taken by the local government
to protect the marine environment.
</P>
<P>
"Although red tides occurred in part of the province's sea
waters some time ago, pollution was brought under control soon and
the general situation of the province's marine environment has
been kept as good as it is," said Chen Cheng, director of the
provincial oceanic department.
</P>
<P>
The water quality of more than 80 percent of Hainan's sea area
has been among the best in the country, according to a recent survey
conducted by the National People's Congress's oceanic environment
law enforcement inspection team.

<P>
The provincial government has put environmental protection on
its top agenda from the very beginning. A 1,500-km coastal forest
belt has fixed shifting sand and prevented land erosion on the
island.
</P>
<P>
"To prevent the possible deterioration of the oceanic
environment, we must bring land pollution under strict control,"
said Li Fude, director of the law and regulation office of the
provincial oceanic department.
</P>
<P>
The province has closed down 75 polluting enterprises in past
two years, setting deadlines for another 400 enterprises to meet
pullutant discharge standards, and refused to grant approval for
any polluting project to be launched.
</P>
<P>
Most of the province's industrial projects are located in the
western part and a license system for discharging pollutants has
been established to control the total volume of urban pollutant
discharge.
</P>
<P>
An urban waste water treatment plant and 12 industrial waste
water treatment plants have been set up in the provincial capital
of Haikou, which has a population of over 600,000. With loans from
the German government, the city is also building another waste
water treatment plant with a daily capacity of 300,000 tons, which
will be put into operation by the end of the year to handle more
than 95 percent of the city's waste water.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the construction of a garbage treatment plant with
loans from Norway is also in full swing. After completion of these
treatment facilities, all the city's wastes can be handled
properly, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The ecological resources of mangrove and coral reef have been
effectively protected, with 13 natural protection zones
established along the island's 1,500-km sea shores, which have
become a shelter belt against oceanic pollution.

<P>
Tourism resources have been developed in Sanya in the island's
southern tip whose coral protection zone is famous for its
beautiful landscape, and a waste water treatment plant with daily
capacity of 80,000 tons is also being constructed in the city.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection awareness has been enhanced among the
island's residents, who have spontaneously worked out many local
rules on protecting their environment.
</P>
<P>
The mangrove in Dongzhai port in Qiongshan city has spread to
cover an area of 2,000 hectares, which has been listed by the
International Wetland Organization.
</P>
<P>
In sea water fish breeding zones in Sanya, Qionghai and
Lingshui, fish breeders cultivate fish under the guidance of
technicians to avoid causing pollution to the sea waters.
</P>
<P>
The island province strengthens oceanic pollution treatment and
control while stepping up marine transportation and oil
exploration. All ships of more than 100 tonnages have been
equipped with facilities to retrieve waste oil, and have their
pollution discharge recorded to meet inspection.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 law-enforcement organs have been established in 13
coastal cities and counties to conduct supervision and
administration over sea areas, and inspection teams are frequently
sent to oil-exploration platforms to oversee pollutant discharge.
</P>
<P>
The province has handled 130 cases involving marine
environmental pollution in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
The sound marine ecological environment has provided a larger
space for the province's development in the next century. The
provincial government has listed the marine industry as its
economic pillar. The province's total output of marine economy is
expected to reach 15 billion yuan (about 1.9 billion US dollars)

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Starts Cattle Exports to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua is ready to export some
1,800 heads of cattle to Mexico under a new free trade arrangement
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This is Nicaragua's first export of cattle on the hoof since
1977, Agriculture Minister Mario de Franco said after signing an
amendment on Friday to two support projects in the cattle raising
sector.
</P>
<P>
Mexican importers are offering a price of 9.6 cordobas (less
than one U.S. dollar) per kilogram for the cattle, higher than
what is paid by local slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
De Franco predicted that the international prices of beef would
go up next year to level the historical record in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The free trade agreement between Nicaragua and Mexico provides
for a comfortable quota of access with zero tariff for Nicaragua's
exports to the Mexican market, in respect to beef, powered milk
and non-processed cheese.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Worries Its Footballers' Fate in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has expressed its worry over
its footballers' fate in Spain, after its team's Wednesday 1-3
loss to Paraguay edged Spain out of the ongoing World Cup in
France.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Bello, the Press Secretary to the Minister of Youth
and Sports, made his fear known Friday in Abuja to the official
News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"It is all over for the boys. You do not know these whites. You
will see what will happen to our boys in Spain next season," the
sports official said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Spainish football association is already
complaining about the number of black players in their clubs. He
feared that Nigerian players may not be hired by Spanish clubs.
</P>
<P>
As it beat Bulgaria by 6-1, Spain needed Nigeria to draw with
Paraguay in Wednesday's match so that it can enter the second
round matches. Nigeria's loss made Paraguay qualify for the last
16 with 5 points as the runner-up in Group D, one point more than
Spain.
</P>
<P>
Bello noted that although there was no agreement between
Nigeria and Spain, the Spaniards had expected that the game
against Paraguay would be drawn.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how many of Nigerian footballers play in Spain,
but it is known that Mutiu Adepoju and Finidi George, both major
players in Nigeria's World Cup squad, play for Spainish clubs in
the last season.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Appeals for Eliminating Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu Friday called on the young, the education staff and
the civic organizations to join the efforts to eliminate the drug
phenomenon from the life of the future Romania.
</P>
<P>
In a message addressed on the international Day against drug
abuses and drug smuggling, Constantinescu stated that Romania "has
become a place for the transiting and stocking of drugs". Even if
the drug consuming is relatively low, more and more young people
take to the narcotics, he added.
</P>
<P>
The President stressed that the Romanian state has committed
itself to a triple self-defense action, namely to improve the
legislation, restructure the institutions and sustain education
activities in the field. "These directions would be blended into a
national strategy to fight against drug trafficking and
consuming," he said.
</P>
<P>
Romania is part of the United Nations' Convention and signatory
of programs and resolutions made by the U.N, which are meant to
develop international cooperation in combating drug smuggling and
consuming, Constantinescu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1998 Bucharest would host the regional
Conference for the fight against drug smuggling and consuming.

<HEADLINE> Congress Passes Bill to Penalize States for Missing Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A dozen states that missed
child support enforcement deadlines will be penalized under a bill
being sent to President Bill Clinton, although the fines are a
fraction of what a 1988 law required.
</P>
<P>
The bill marks an agreement between the House of
Representatives and Senate, which objected to penalties.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed it Friday by voice vote. The House did the
same Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
A 1988 law required states to set up computer systems to track
the movements of parents who owe child support. More than 2.6
billion dollars have been spent on the project since then and the
deadline was extended once to give states until October to finish
their work.
</P>
<P>
States without working computer systems faced losing all
federal child support funding, which they use to manage the
collections.
</P>
<P>
But Friday's legislation substantially softens the penalties.
</P>
<P>
"Welfare recipients are now being held to strict time limits
and work rules," said Representative Clay Shaw Jr. a Republican
and chairman of the House Ways and Means human resources
subcommittee. "This bill says that states should be held to the
same level of accountability."

<HEADLINE> Tunisian Coach Says Romania Deserve the Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-DENIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian coach Ali Selmi said
Romania deserved their point after the two teams fought to a 1-1
draw here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The first half was the best we have played in the competition.
In the second they were stronger and much better organised and
they deserved the draw."
</P>
<P>
Selmi, who replaced sacked Henryk Kasperczak, said:"After the
first game when we didn't play well and the second when we had
chances and didn't score it was very hard to motivate the players for
another game where there no real incentives."
</P>
<P>
Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu was apparently relieved after
his team salvaged the draw and qualified as the group winners:"We
were very poor in the first half and our whole game was
disorganised," said Iordanescu, "In the second half we played much
more like our normal game."
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the lack of organisation was my fault as I had
changed five players." Iordanescu said.
</P>
<P>
Viorel Moldovan, who scored the equaliser for Romania, said:"I'm
very proud of what I did but I wasn't the only one. The whole team
won, we were better in the second half."

<HEADLINE> IMF to Aid Rwandan Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) governing board has confirmed its support to the three-year
Rwandan macro-economic reform program, sources in the Finance
Ministry in Kigali said.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF's response to our program is an inspiring one, that
the ESAF (enhanced structural adjustment facility) is moving
toward success," said Prosper Musafiri, the director of
Macro-Economic Analysis in the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning, the Rwanda News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is an important stage for the program to be
approved by the IMF since it is going to encourage even other
donors to support it," the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at an IMF meeting convened in Washington
on June 24 1998.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the government of Rwanda sent a letter of
intent to the IMF board of governors seeking its support for the
program.
</P>
<P>
Through the letter, the government of Rwanda requested an IMF
funding amounting to 99.4 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the June 24 meeting, the IMF board approved a three year
credit for Rwanda equivalent to 95 million Dollars while 16.4
million Dollars will be disbursed, with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
According to Musafiri, the money will be specifically used for
balance of payment support channeled through the Central Bank to
stabilize foreign exchange reserve.
</P>
<P>
It will be mainly for private sector support by increasing
import capacity of private investors. The money is not designated
for government functions, he emphasized.

<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Belgian veteran midfielder Enco Scifo
announced on Friday his retirement from international soccer.
</P>
<P>
Scifo, 32, has just played his fourth World Cup finals. He said
his 84th cap for Belgium against South Korea on Thursday would be
his last international appearence.
</P>
<P>
Belgium were forced to a 1-1 draw by the South Koreans and that
cast them a place in the second round.
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked to continue my international career. But in
these conditions it is no longer possible," Scifo said, "I don't
feel I am important to the squad. So for me it is over."
</P>
<P>
It was Scifo's second retirement announcement this year. In
February he said he had quit international soccer when he was left out
of the squad for a World Cup warm-up against the United States.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Turkey Urged to Resolve Disputes Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. presidential envoy for Cyprus
Richard Holbrooke urged Greece and Turkey Friday night to resolve
their disputes by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a graduation ceremony at the American college in
Athens, Holbrooke warned that any use of violence would be
catastrophic for both Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that there should be permanent peace on both sides of
the Aegean Sea because the two countries had no problem in the
form of a clash of cultures.
</P>
<P>
While calling for the reduction in military spending by Greece
and Turkey, Holbrooke recommended international adjudication for
the resolution of the Imia islets issue which almost brought the
two countries to a war in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy said that his country would continue urging
Cypriot leaders to continue negotiations because the island
republic must not remain the last divided country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
As for Cyprus' accession to the European Union (EU), Holbrooke
said that Washington supported the island's EU application, but
also equally supported Turkey's hope for closer ties with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limit, the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and the protracted
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Greece and Turkey rose recently following the
visits by Greek and Turkish warplanes to Cyprus in a show of
force.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Coach Quit after Losing to Jamaica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LYON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese coach Takeshi Okada resigned
on Friday after his team suffered their third one-goal defeat at the
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Japan lost to Jamaica 2-1 on Friday. They were defeated 1-0
by Argentina and Croatia respectively.
</P>
<P>
"I will quit as a professional coach. When a coach fails to
achieve what he set outs to do, he should quit." said Okada.
</P>
<P>
Okada said:"It is my responsibility. I was not able to draw the
best out of the players in this match."
</P>
<P>
"Today the team was much too slow in attacking the Jamaican goal
and made too many needless passes, even though they put 100 percent
effort into it." said Okada.
</P>
<P>
Jamaicai coach Rene Simoes said Okada had nothing to be ashamed
of:"I think japan should feel very proud as well. They played three
wonderful games."

<HEADLINE> Liberia Wants ECOMOG to Intervene in Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Liberia has appealed to West
African leaders to intervene militarily through the sub-regional
peace-keeping force ECOMOG to restore peace in Guinea Bissau,
where rebellious troops claimed to have set up a junta.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Friday quoted Liberian President
Charles Taylor as saying in a statement that "Liberia will
support the dispatch of an ECOMOG intervention force to Guinea
Bissau to restore peace and tranquillity to the people of that
sister republic."
</P>
<P>
"A collective regional initiative is necessary to buttress the
current efforts of Guinea and Senegal in Bissau," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
According to it, Taylor made the appeal in a telephone
conversation with General Abdulsalam Abubakar, Nigerian Head of
State and current Chairman of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
The statement did not say if Liberia would contribute troops
to such an intervention force.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was first formed in 1990 to intervene in the Liberian
civil war. Though it initially received strong resistance from
Taylor who started in the war in 1989, ECOMOG eventually
succeeded in ending Liberia's civil war in 1997, with Taylor
emerging winner of the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG also succeeded in helping restore the elected civilian
government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in Sierra Leone, where
it expelled the military junta of Paul Johnny Koroma that seized
power in a coup in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Guinea and Senegal have sent troops to quell a rebellion
against the government of President Bernardo Vieira led by the
country's sacked Army Chief of Staff.

signed three treaties Friday to enhance cooperation in merchant
shipping, police work and sports.

visiting French President Jacques Chirac, South African Transport
Minister Mac Maharaj and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
signed an agreement on merchant shipping and related maritime
matters in Pretoria.

Friday morning for a three-day state visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing of the accords, Chirac and Mandela held
talks for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
Chirac met South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in the
afternoon to present him with the Grand Officer of the Legion of
Honor, the highest award in France for person ranked just after a
head of state.
</P>
<P>
Mandela hosted a state banquet in Chirac's honor in the
evening, at which he commended France for its contribution to
South Africa's economic development.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's efforts to attain economic growth and
entrench democracy were strengthened by the knowledge that it
could be assured of French support, as a country and also as a
member of the European Union and of the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, Chirac will visit the Hector Peterson
Memorial in Soweto, a black township near Johannesburg, to
commemorate the historical 1976 students uprising before leaving
for Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Chirac travels to Maputo, capital of Mozambique, on Sunday for
the next leg of his southern African tour before going to Angola.
