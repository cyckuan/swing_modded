Residents Return After Dutch Blast
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- Residents began returning to their damaged
homes after an explosion at a fireworks storage site devastated an entire
neighborhood, killing an estimated 20 people and wounding another 628. The
search for bodies by a 144-member forensics team continued two days after the
blast, but officials said it was unlikely any more survivors would be found.
Firefighters sprayed the blisteringly hot rubble left by the enormous blast of
100 tons of fireworks in a low-income neighborhood of this Dutch town, 85 miles
east of Amsterdam. Members of the Disaster Victim Identification Team sifted
through the ruins in search of clothing fragments, jewelry and any signs of
life.

Contractor Charged In Egypt Collapse
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Prosecutors charged a contractor with wrongful death and
violation of building regulations in the collapse of an apartment building that
killed 16 people, police officials said Monday. Prosecutors also summoned for
questioning the consulting engineer in charge of the five-story building in
downtown Cairo that collapsed before dawn Sunday, the officials said. Police
arrested contractor Mohammed Mahmoud Khodeiry. A resident who fled the building
minutes before its collapse, Um Ahmed, told reporters that the contractor had
dug a long ditch next to the building on Saturday, saying it was to erect
support rods. ''Then he left without putting up the rods,'' he said.

Columbine Report Is Released
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A sheriff's department report released Monday indicates
the 12 Columbine High School students killed by teen-age shooters were dead
within 16 minutes. It appears to counter claims by the victims' families that
law officers could have saved lives if they had acted more quickly. However, the
report also confirms that teacher Dave Sanders, who died, and some of the 23
wounded waited for hours until the school was evacuated.

25 Are Charged in Vieques Protests

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Twenty-five protesters were charged with
trespassing at the Navy bombing range on Puerto Rico's Vieques island and
released without bail Monday to cheers from dozens of supporters. The 25 were
among 55 protesters who cut through a fence to slip into the training ground
Saturday night. The rest were released on Sunday and face similar charges. U.S.
Marshals on May 4 cleared 216 protesters from camps on the range. Activists have
been trying to force the Navy to leave Vieques, and have vowed to continue
entering Navy land.

AP Responds to No Gun Ri Questions
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press Monday responded to questions raised
about its Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the killings of civilians by
American soldiers at No Gun Ri in the chaotic opening days of the Korean War.
The 1999 story -- more than a year in the works -- quoted a dozen U.S. veterans
who said a large number of civilian refugees, many of them women and children,
were shot to death under a railroad bridge at the hamlet of No Gun Ri on July
26, 1950. The veterans' accounts confirmed those of two dozen South Korean
survivors. But in this week's issue, U.S. News &AMP; World Report raised questions
about some aspects of the story. Jonathan Wolman, the AP's executive editor,
said all of those interviewed were quoted meticulously, many of them recorded or
videotaped.

Murders of Lawmen at Record Low
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI said Monday that the lowest total on record of law
enforcement officers -- just 42 -- were murdered on duty in the United States
during 1999. It's a decline of more than 31 percent from the year before. The
drop is consistent with an eight-year-long, nationwide decline in major crimes.
The FBI says its national figures on lawmen murdered go back 36 years to 1963.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With Ethiopia and Eritrea engaged in heavy fighting,
the United States introduced a Security Council resolution Monday calling for an
arms embargo against the warring Horn of Africa neighbors. But Russia strongly
objected. The council met Monday afternoon to follow up on the resolution it
adopted Friday calling for ''immediate steps'' to be taken if the two countries
didn't immediately cease hostilities and resume stalled peace talks. But there
was no agreement on what steps to take.

<HEADLINE> Bill would prohibit shackling of inmate moms on way to delivery room </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Women inmates in New York should not be
shackled as they are being transported from prison to hospital
delivery room, a new bill advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which appears to have the sponsorship to
guarantee its passage, should be looked upon as an affirmation of
basic rights to women who are at their most vulnerable point in the
criminal justice system, said the measure's prime sponsor,
Assemblyman Nick Perry, D-Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International is among the groups advocating for changes
in state or local laws to prohibit shackling of women prisoners
both during labor and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1999 report to the U.N. Human Rights Commission, U.N.
investigator Radhika Coomaraswamy found the use of leg irons and
shackles common in prisons throughout the United States. She cited
one case -- Perry said it was not in New York -- where a woman was
shackled during delivery and Coomaraswamy expressly criticized the
practice of shackling women in labor who were being taken to
hospitals and after their babies were born.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a human dignity issue,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, female state inmates who are expecting babies are
housed in two prisons, the maximum-security Bedford Hills and the
medium-security Taconic, situated alongside each other in
Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Taconic inmates are prohibited from being shackled or having to
wear leg irons past the third trimester of their pregnancies. Hand
and leg restraints can be used on inmates being taken to local
hospitals from Bedford Hills for delivery, with the approval of
both prison and medical personnel. Waist shackles are prohibited on
those women in any case.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is under court order not to shackle inmates during
delivery, but there is no court directive against pre-delivery
shackling.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good thing,'' Mishi Faruqee of the state
Correctional Association's Women in Prison Project said of the
proposed state law. ''We have actually been advocating for a long
time for a policy like this.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that women who are going into labor are not an
escape risk, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The policy is there are supposed to be security and medical
considerations (about shackling), but usually the security
considerations override the medical considerations,'' Faruqee said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said state and local corrections officials have adequate
personnel to make sure a woman about to give birth are properly
guarded without the use of shackles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue of security I think is very muted in this case and I
don't believe this is a political issue,'' he said. ''I think it's
a human issue and I believe we put humanity before politics most of
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann, R-Onondaga, is sponsoring
the bill in her Republican-controlled chamber. She said she
expected it would move through committee this week and to get onto
the floor for a vote within two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very narrowly drawn provision that applies to women in
labor,'' she said. ''Obviously, a woman in labor does not pose much
of a security risk for flight on her way to the hospital to deliver
a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Correctional Services officials do not
comment on pending legislation. Officials could not say how many
inmates give birth each year in New York, but about 10 percent of
the women entering the prison system are found to be pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The maternity ward at Bedford Hills has a capacity of 32 babies
while Taconic's can accommodate 23. Babies can stay for up to a
year with their mothers in the prison maternity wards.

<HEADLINE> New York Democrats prepare to nominate Hillary Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope says
today's New York Democratic Party convention to nominate Hillary
Rodham Clinton for the U.S. Senate will be the largest such
gathering in state history.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of excitement we haven't seen since Bobby
Kennedy,'' Hope said at a news conference Monday just outside the
large sports arena in downtown Albany where the convention is being
held.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said they expected up to 5,000 people to attend
this evening's convention, including 352 delegates who will do the
actual nominating.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the convention, Clinton wasn't certain who she would
be facing on the Republican side. New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has said he is uncertain if he can stay in the race
because of his prostate cancer. The state GOP convention is May 30
in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said Monday she was also still uncertain whether
President Clinton would be joining her at the state convention, but
later in the day her staff announced that he would not.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking the Senate seat from New York once held by
Kennedy and later by the man she hopes to replace in the Senate,
fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan is retiring at
the end of the year and will be the subject of a special tribute at
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the convention will largely be a coronation of sorts for the
first lady, a carefully scripted event designed to help boost her
candidacy in an adopted state.
</P>
<P>
   Until January, when she moved into a $1.4 million home in
Westchester County just north of New York City, Clinton had never
lived or worked in the state. Like Kennedy, Clinton has faced
charges of being a carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   Noting earlier reports that Democrats speaking at the convention
have been told to shy away from mentioning the New York City mayor,
Hope was asked Monday if speakers had been told not to use the
words ''Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What words are those?'' Hope responded with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The state party leader said Clinton's nomination by Sen. Charles
Schumer would be seconded at the convention by U.S. Reps. Charles
Rangel and Nita Lowey.
</P>
<P>
   While past Democratic conventions have often produced enough
delegates votes for various candidates to set up September
primaries, Hope and other Democratic leaders said they expect no
such developments on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several other little-known Democrats have expressed an interest
in the race and they could force a Sept. 12 primary by going
through the arduous process of collecting the signatures of 15,000
party members statewide.

<HEADLINE> Pataki says third term run a ''likely scenario''  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In his strongest statement to date, Gov.
George Pataki said running for a third four-year term in 2002 is
''the most likely scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after a public appearance Monday, Pataki
reiterated that he would not enter the Senate race if Rudolph
Giuliani drops out, even though polls show him to be the top choice
among Republicans to replace the mayor and take on Democrat Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said there is still ''a lot to be done here in New York''
and added that being governor is ''one of the greatest jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some potential donors to Pataki are likely to think
he has decided to run against Clinton when they open their mail.
The governor has just sent out a direct-mail appeal for funds to
create a ''Pataki Truth Task Force'' aimed at combatting how
''Hillary and her friends will try to distort our record.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to let Hillary move into this state and bring us
back to the days of the failed policies of fellow left-Democrat
Mario Cuomo,'' Pataki writes in the four-page letter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anti-Hillary Clinton rhetoric, Pataki adviser Zenia
Mucha said the letter was designed to raise money for the
governor's state campaign committee, not a Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Using Hillary Clinton's name in fund-raising letters has proved
a successful tactic for Republicans and many conservative political
groups and candidates even if they are not directly involved in
running against her.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who said in his 1994 campaign for governor that he would
serve only two terms if elected, has said before that he is
considering running for a third term. But he said it more strongly
than ever before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most likely scenario, come 2002, is that I will run
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long he wants to remain governor, Pataki said, ''It
could be 2006, it could be 2010, it could be 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a question if I have a date in mind. It's whether or
not the voters have a date in their minds when I should leave
office,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   If he does decide to run for a third term, Pataki will most
likely face a Democratic challenge from either state comptroller H.
Carl McCall or federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the only black elected to a statewide office in New
York, has privately told supporters he intends to run for governor.
Cuomo, the eldest son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, said he is
''seriously considering'' a run for governor and added that he
would not rule out a primary against McCall.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have said they will not make any decision on entering
the gubernatorial race until after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide poll conducted by the Marist College's Institute for
Public Opinion in April showed Pataki ahead of his potential
Democratic opponents. It had Pataki at 50 percent and the younger
Cuomo at 40 percent in one possible matchup and it had Pataki
leading McCall, 52 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been rumored that Giuliani -- diagnosed with prostate
cancer and discussing formal separation with wife Donna Hanover --
would be interested in running for governor if his Senate campaign
is scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki refused to comment on what impact the Republican mayor
could have if he decides to seek gubernatorial office.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a million things that could happen, and I'm just not
going to speculate on what may or may not occur over the course of
the next week, the next month,'' Pataki said.

<HEADLINE> Top state Republicans eye Lazio as Giuliani alternative  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki and state GOP Chairman
William Powers are increasingly focusing on Rep. Rick Lazio as the
fallback candidate if Rudolph Giuliani drops out of the U.S. Senate
race, key Republicans say.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio scenario heated up Monday when millionaire Theodore
Forstmann took himself out of contention as a possible GOP
alternative should Giuliani quit the contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street financier, who has been pumping some of his own
money into a program he helped create to provide scholarships to
send poor children to private schools, said he could be more
effective outside government at reforming the nation's educational
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can be of far greater help to those parents who want control
of their children's education by leading a movement for change from
outside the political system than becoming another interchangeable
part of that system,'' Forstmann said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   There had also been concern in the Forstmann camp that GOP
leaders wanted too much control over any campaign he would mount.
He has never run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said again Monday that he would not reconsider his
earlier decision not to jump into the Senate race against Hillary
Rodham Clinton if the New York City mayor quit the contest because
of his health and marital problems. Polls have shown Pataki to be
the strongest Republican alternative to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The governor refused to speculate on who the GOP might turn to
if Giuliani quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are lots of good, qualified New Yorkers who can
represent and who know the state and who would do an excellent
job,'' Pataki said, adding that he was optimistic ''we'll have a
strong candidate, mount a strong campaign and win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Pataki said: ''We have a presumptive candidate ...
I'm not going to speculate on whether he may or may not be in the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   But other key Republicans, speaking only on condition they not
be identified, said GOP leaders, including Pataki and Powers, were
working on where to turn if Giuliani withdrew. They said the main
focus was on Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless Lazio screws this thing up for himself, he's pretty
much got it,'' said one of those Republicans, who spoke to The
Associated Press only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment from Lazio, who has said he won't make any
decisions until Giuliani decides what he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Giuliani said he was scrapping a two-day trip this
week to California in which he was to have raised money for his
Senate campaign committee. The mayor said he wanted the time to
consider how best to treat his prostate cancer. Giuliani said the
medical regimen will be the major factor in whether he continues
with his Senate campaign. He said again that he has not decided on
his medical treatment or whether he will stay in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to health problems, the mayor is also facing marital
strife. Two weeks ago, he announced he was spending time with
''very good friend'' Judith Nathan and last week he announced that
he and his wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover, were discussing a
formal separation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lazio, U.S. Rep. Peter King, who like Lazio comes
from Long Island, has said he would be willing to step in as the
GOP Senate candidate if Giuliani bows out of the race. But King's
relations with Pataki, Powers and some other top New York
Republicans are cool given his criticism of their attempts to keep
Sen. John McCain off the New York presidential primary ballot this
year in favor of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans plan to hold their Senate nominating convention on
May 30 in Buffalo. While the mayor said Monday he was aware of that
deadline, ''I don't feel under pressure from the state Republican
Party'' to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, 42, was elected to Congress in 1992 and was trying to
drum up support for a possible Senate run until Pataki endorsed
Giuliani last August and asked the congressman to put his campaign
plans on hold. Lazio has about $3.5 million in his campaign
committee account.

<HEADLINE> Court says county not liable in fire deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Barbara Burger collapsed before she could
say the words that might have saved her family.
</P>
<P>
   Because Burger was unable to communicate to a 911 dispatcher the
exact nature of her emergency the morning a fire killed her
daughter and three granddaughters, Onondaga County cannot be held
liable for those deaths, a state appeals court has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Burger sued the county emergency center claiming it was
responsible for a six-minute delay in dispatching firefighters to
her home Feb. 27, 1998 that led to the four deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court Appellate Division in Rochester
dismissed Burger's lawsuit because there was no proof a ''special
relationship'' had been created that would make the county
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is strictly a legal standard,'' Senior Deputy County
Attorney John Sharon said Monday. ''It's harsh. Cold might be a
better word for it. Unfortunately for the Burger and Turbe
families, this was a terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the blaze were Mary Turbe, 38, and her three children:
Alicia, 3; Jessica, 2; and Jason, 9 months. Burger, 71, survived
the fire but died in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators determined Burger accidentally started the fire
with an unattended cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Burger, who lived with the family, dialed 911 but collapsed
before speaking. The line stayed open for nearly two minutes before
going dead. During that time, what sounds like a fire crackling can
be heard, as well as a blaring smoke detector and the cries of a
child screaming for ''Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, a county grand jury blamed dispatcher James
Harrison for the delay, concluding he was ''asleep at the switch''
when the fire call came in shortly before 6 a.m. A medical examiner
told the grand jury the victims might have survived if there had
not been a delay in sending help. Harrison resigned rather than
face disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   In legal arguments, Burger's lawyer, Dom Cambareri, said the
fact that Harrison can be heard talking about the sounds of fire
and children screaming for help was sufficient evidence to support
a claim the county had a duty to promptly send firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon argued that Burger would have had to relate the nature of
the emergency and someone from the 911 center would have had to
communicate back that help was on the way to establish the
''special relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, state Supreme Court Justice John Elliott rejected
Cambareri's request to declare the county had a special duty to
Burger. Elliott also rejected the county's motion to dismiss the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Cambareri said he would discuss with the family whether to
appeal the ruling to the Court of Appeals in Albany, the state's
top court.
</P>
<P>
   The decision last week by the appellate court also could have an
impact on a $56 million lawsuit brought by the children's' father,
Frank Turbe. Sharon said the county will likely seek the dismissal
of that suit on the same grounds.

<HEADLINE> Grub-scouting party harkens shift in Buffalo's green policy  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The city plans to make a party out of
hunting for grubs by hand as its phase-out of pesticide use begins
in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of volunteers will be enlisted for an August
get-together, at which they will comb a municipal golf course for
signs of the grass-destroying pests that have wreaked havoc in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   The goals are early detection and organic solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo last year joined Albany, San Francisco and a handful of
other municipalities that have committed to stopping virtually all
pesticide use on city property. Buffalo's Pesticide Sunset
Ordinance took effect in September.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is brand new for us,'' said Gary Carrel of the Buffalo
Olmsted Parks Conservancy, which is making plans for the first
grub-scouting party at the Delaware Park golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spray the entire course with dangerous chemicals,
volunteers will target problem areas in an organized effort. The
hunters will line up five-to-10 feet apart and walk forward in
tandem along the fairways, stopping at intervals to pull up small
sections of ground and examine them for grubs before replacing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''These efforts are more environmentally friendly,'' but, he
said, ''they also take a large volunteer force.''
</P>
<P>
   So came the idea for the grub-scouting party.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is there will be no sign of the pests, which staged a
major infestation in 1995. If they are detected, however, there are
several non-chemical solutions being considered, including the use
of parasitic nematodes which feed on the larvae but don't harm the
ground. Chemical spraying would be a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just moving to a whole environmentally friendly way,''
Carrel said. ''Golf courses are traditionally very chemical
dependent.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the city's Pesticide Sunset Ordinance, the most dangerous
chemicals will be eliminated first, followed by the less hazardous
pesticides. Exemptions will be allowed for nontoxic and low-level
pesticides and city departments can get waivers in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware Park has become a sort of testing ground for
environmentally friendly groundskeeping. The park's rose garden is
being tended with organic compound and soon will be watered with a
drip-irrigation system, rather than sprinklers, which soak the
whole plant and encourage fungus growth, and in turn, pesticide
use.
</P>
<P>
   City officials hope residents will follow suit and stop using
harmful chemicals on their own lawns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of our mission is to increase public awareness,'' said
Nancy Smith, co-chairwoman of the Pest Management Board, which was
formed to help guide the city away from its chemical dependency.
''The exciting thing is, we're getting phone calls from around the
country. We're considered a leader in this.''

<HEADLINE> United Hiring More Pilots  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines says it's hiring more pilots and
''fine-tuning'' its flight schedule to compensate for a continuing
shortage of crews that has forced a series of cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest airline said it canceled 57 more flights
Monday, 40 because of bad weather on the West Coast and the rest
due to a pilot shortage that the pilots' union blames on United's
staffing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Some pilots have declined to work overtime, upset at what they
say is the airline's failure to hire more pilots, according to the
Air Line Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   Union spokesman Herb Hunter, a United pilot, denied any job
action was being encouraged by the union and said pilots are not
refusing regular assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's calling in sick. Nobody's not doing their job,''
Hunter said Monday. ''We've advised the company over the last six
to nine months that we're going to be short of pilots ... and now
it is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot criticized as ''not a wise strategy'' United's
practice of counting on pilots to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   United's Hopkins said the policy has worked -- until pilots began
refusing overtime after their contract status changed on April 12,
when an employee stock-option plan expired. He said the airline is
beefing up its force of 10,000 pilots and cutting its schedule back
accordingly by canceling some flights; customers are notified in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, pilot shortages and bad weather resulted in the
cancellation of 108 of United's 2,400 flights.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is hiring 1,200 new pilots in all this year,
although some are replacements for those retiring or otherwise
leaving. Hopkins said he didn't immediately know by what amount the
pilots' force will be increased.
</P>
<P>
   United, which is 55 percent employee-owned, and the pilots
submitted their contract standoff to federal mediation last month
when the airline's employee stock-option plan ran out. Pilots'
wages were linked closely to that plan because they agreed to lower
salaries in 1994 when it was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots are now seeking sharply higher pay in addition to other
benefit improvements.
</P>
<P>
   United has declined to discuss specifics of ongoing contract
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, airline contracts do not expire and most
airline workers are prohibited from striking unless they receive
permission from the National Mediation Board.
</P>
<P>
   While the law allows airline employees to picket, union
spokesman Hunter said there are no plans for United pilots to do so
at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said it is not unusual for airline contracts to take a
year or two to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said United wants to reach agreement as quickly as
possible.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors on Buying Spree  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Taking advantage of economic hard times here,
foreign investors are doing what even five years ago would have
been shocking -- buying up a record amount of shares in companies
that once formed the bulwark of Japan's financial and industrial
base.
</P>
<P>
   But while their newfound foothold reflects a significant opening
of the world's second-largest economy, many experts wonder whether
the shopping spree may be ill-advised.
</P>
<P>
   Led by French automaker Renault SA's purchase of a 36.8 percent
stake in Nissan Motor Co., foreign companies spent a record $13.2
billion in Japan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than triple the $3.94 billion in the previous year,
the Bank of Japan said in its annual report, released in March.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners once complained that high costs and closed markets
prevented them from investing in Japan. The tradition of companies
in Japan's tight-knit corporate groups to own the bulk of each
other's shares also kept them out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, companies suffering from the nation's decade-long
economic slump are dumping shares in their affiliates at low prices
to repay debt, making it easier for foreign companies to gain a
foothold.
</P>
<P>
   And now that the momentum is going, analysts say they expect the
buying trend to continue for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't seen any letup,'' said Peter McKillop, spokesman
for U.S. investment bank J.P. Morgan Securities (Asia) Ltd. ''There
will be a lot more deals coming down the pike.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival investment consultancy PricewaterhouseCoopers has more
than doubled its investment advisory staff to more than 100 in
Japan over the past year. It plans to add 50 more by the end of the
year on expectations of more deals, said spokesman Koichi Yamamura.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago that a foreign takeover of a major Japanese
company caused an outcry not unlike that in the United States when
Sony Corp. in 1989 acquired Columbia Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Japanese newspapers warned of a foreign invasion and
western-style job cuts when Ford Motor Co. boosted its stake in
Mazda Motor Corp. to 33.4 percent and installed Henry Wallace as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was hardly a blip three years later when Renault
announced in May 1999 that it would buy its stake in Nissan and
appoint Carlos Ghosn as the automaker's second-in-command.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there much fretting in December when the Japanese
government approved New York-based Ripplewood Holdings' $1.76
billion takeover of the failed Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
LTCB was one of three banks that had financed Japan's rise into an
industrial power after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   And already this year, German automaker DaimlerChrysler AG has
said it would pay $2.1 billion for a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi
Motors Corp., Japan's fourth-largest automaker. By owning more than
a third of Mitsubishi's shares, DaimlerChrysler gains the power to
veto management decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing surprises me anymore,'' said Katsuyuki Yamakawa, 25, a
salesman for a publishing company in Tokyo. ''Sometimes change is
good if it makes things better.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment is good for Japan because it brings new
management ideas, helps Japanese companies repay debt and, as in
the case of LTCB, pulls them out of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefit for the overseas investor is not so clear.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their focus has been on struggling automakers, as well
as on unhealthy banks and other financial companies suffering from
investments that went bad when asset prices collapsed in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are without exception really pretty weak Japanese
companies and it isn't obvious that the foreign investor can fix
them,'' said James Abegglen, chairman of Asia Advisory Service
K.K., a consultancy for foreign companies in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies would be better off spending their money in
service industries where they have an advantage over Japanese
firms, said Haruo Shimada, a professor of economics at Keio
University.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, should be to lure some of the estimated $12.3
trillion out of Japanese savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Shimada said life insurance, family care and other lifestyle
industries are not well-designed in Japan and are an area in which
foreign companies have a competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a brilliant future for foreign investors'' in those
areas, he said. ''And this time the Japanese people are going to
welcome it.''

<HEADLINE> AP Responds to No Gun Ri Questions  </HEADLINE>
By JERRY SCHWARTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Associated Press on Monday responded to questions raised
about its Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the killings of
civilians by American soldiers at No Gun Ri in the chaotic opening
days of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 story -- more than a year in the works -- quoted a dozen
U.S. veterans who said a large number of civilian refugees, many of
them women and children, were shot to death under a railroad bridge
at the hamlet of No Gun Ri on July 26, 1950. The veterans' accounts
confirmed those of two dozen South Korean survivors.
</P>
<P>
   But in this week's issue, U.S. News &AMP; World Report raised
questions about some aspects of the story. The magazine questioned
the reliability of accounts by three former soldiers who said they
were at No Gun Ri; it also quoted others who said their comments
had been distorted by the AP or taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Wolman, the AP's executive editor, said all of those
interviewed were quoted meticulously, many of them recorded or
videotaped. And he said none of the material cited in these reports
undermines any of the AP's major findings:
</P>
<P>
   --The American unit was in the area of No Gun Ri on that date,
despite denials by U.S. military officials.
</P>
<P>
   --A large number of refugees were shot and strafed by American
forces at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   --Fearing enemy infiltration, military commanders had issued
orders to units on the battlefield, authorizing soldiers to shoot
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Duffy, executive editor of U.S. News, acknowledged in an
interview Monday that the magazine had not used a key document
provided by the AP that undercut one of its challenges to the AP
report.
</P>
<P>
   Wolman said: ''Even as we review discrepancies between several
records and eyewitness accounts, we are confident of the accuracy
and fairness'' of the story's central findings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our story, published almost eight months ago, was careful to
reflect the contradictions, ambiguities and scarred memories that
marked our attempts to reconstruct an event from 50 years ago,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The AP story prompted an investigation by the Army. The New York
Times quoted Defense Department officials over the weekend as
saying that Army investigators had ''confirmed the central element
of the (AP) report.'' The Army report is not expected until at
least this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In its account, AP emphasized the difficulties of reporting a
50-year-old story. Memories conflict, accounts contradict each
other, and gaps persist.
</P>
<P>
   ''AP's account was prepared with exhaustive care over more than
a year, reported and re-reported, recorded and indeed in some cases
videotaped so that the kind of questions now being raised could be
fully addressed within AP's standards of accuracy and fairness and
dedication to objectivity,'' Wolman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the new questions are based on records that themselves
leave gaps or are subject to multiple interpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the issues raised by U.S. News, and the AP's response:
WERE THEY THERE?
</P>
<P>
   The AP cited 12 veterans and quoted nine as saying that they had
either participated in the shootings or had witnessed them. U.S.
News offered evidence that three of those veterans -- Edward Daily,
Delos Flint and Eugene Hesselman -- were not there.
</P>
<P>
   Hesselman, according to the magazine, was transferred out of the
No Gun Ri area on July 26, the day of the shootings, based on the
morning report of the unit, H Company of the 2nd Battalion, 7th
Cavalry. The magazine quoted ''army officials'' as saying that he
almost certainly had been moved before noon.
</P>
<P>
   But Hesselman told AP in 1999 that he was lightly wounded that
day and refused to be evacuated; the morning report does not say
''evacuated.'' And another document, the regimental war diary,
lists Hesselman as wounded in action on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News notes that AP quoted Hesselman as saying orders were
issued to fire. Several veterans interviewed by the AP said such
orders were issued at the scene, and the magazine fails to mention
AP's disclosure that the U.S. commanders had issued general orders
authorizing soldiers in the area to fire on refugees in some
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ''No refugees to cross the front line. Fire everyone trying to
cross lines. Use discretion in case of women and children,'' the
1st Cavalry Division's operations staff ordered division units on
July 24, 1950.
</P>
<P>
   A communications log for the 25th Infantry Division on July 26,
1950, notes that Maj. Gen. William Kean, commanding general of the
division, ''directed us to notify Chief of Police that all
civilians moving around in combat zone will be considered as
unfriendly and shot.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, Kean ordered: ''All civilians seen in this area are
to be considered as enemy and action taken accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy said the reason U.S. News did not say AP ''uncovered
orders to fire on civilians was because we did not know whether
those orders pertained to No Gun Ri, whether that was a front-line
situation, and we found no one saying they received those orders.''
</P>
<P>
   In the AP story, Flint remembers being caught with other
soldiers in the strafing and piling into a culvert with refugees.
''Then, 'somebody, maybe our guys, was shooting in at us,' he said.
He and his comrades eventually slipped out.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News contends a regimental war diary entry indicates Flint
was transferred out of No Gun Ri on July 25 -- a day before the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   But a reading of that war diary says that he was wounded, but it
does not say that he was evacuated. In addition, the more reliable
company morning report for July 27, reporting on his wounds, shows
he was still with the unit on July 26.
</P>
<P>
   The war diaries were generally compiled from scattered sources,
days or weeks later, at the rear; the morning report was written
each day at the front.
</P>
<P>
   The morning report ''was not cited, but it should have been,''
Duffy conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the U.S. News story dwells on the account of Edward
Daily. It was Daily who told the AP, ''On summer nights when the
breeze is blowing, I can still hear their cries, the little kids
screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily said he fired a machine gun at refugees huddled under the
railroad trestle near No Gun Ri. But U.S. News quoted Army records
as saying that Daily was not assigned to H Company, 2nd Battalion,
until eight months after the shootings. In July 1950, he was
assigned to the 27th Ordnance Maintenance Group, which had just
arrived in Korea and was 80 miles from No Gun Ri, the records
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Daily's files -- and those of many other
veterans -- were destroyed in a fire at a government records center
in St. Louis in 1973, and were later partly reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   When interviewed by the AP, Daily insisted that he was at No Gun
Ri. As evidence, he offered a stamped and signed Army driver's
license that puts him in H Co. in March 1950; a Christmas 1949 H
Company menu that lists him with the company; a postmarked, faded
letter to his mother in which he refers to his company commander as
Capt. Chandler of H Company; an immunization record whose details
strongly suggest he was in H Company in mid-1950.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several veterans referred to Daily's presence in
the 2nd Battalion in the early days in Korea. U.S. News quoted
others as saying they don't remember him among the 660 members of
the battalion.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News says retired Col. John Lippincott never saw Daily;
unsurprising, because while Daily was with H Company, Lippincott
was with F Company.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News questioned Daily's credibility in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   It noted the reconstructed record shows him discharged as a
sergeant, ''not as a captain as he had claimed.'' Daily says he was
given an irregular battlefield commission, from sergeant to
lieutenant, and was discharged as a first lieutenant, not a
captain. Daily showed the AP what he said was his discharge,
identifying him as a lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstructed file contains no actual discharge document.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News notes that Daily claimed major decorations for valor,
but they are not reflected in his file.
</P>
<P>
   The AP report did not mention Daily's medals, although an AP
reporter saw a Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, Bronze
Star and Purple Heart displayed in his home.
</P>
<P>
   Military archivists say major awards are not written routinely
into a reconstructed file because of the laborious research
required. In addition, the reconstructed file does not list a
Combat Infantryman's Badge for Daily, even though that file itself
indicates he served two months with an infantry unit, H Company.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News also raised the subject of Daily's mental health. With
his permission, the AP interviewed Daily's therapist, who said
Daily's problems appeared to stem from the killing of civilians in
Korea, at least in part.
</P>
<P>
   ''Serious questions involve veteran Ed Daily,'' said Wolman, the
AP executive editor. ''We spoke to soldiers who put him at the
scene and have reviewed the documentation he offered for his role --
a dated driver's license listing his unit, a frayed letter to his
mother, a Christmas menu with his name. If it turns out that he and
those records deceived us, we will be extremely regretful, and
saddened for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the tale of No Gun Ri does not fall on the words of Mr.
Daily. He was first mentioned in the 56th paragraph of our story
and only later became such a visible figure through followup
reports, as the U.S. News story says.''
WHAT DID THEY SAY?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News re-interviewed five veterans who were quoted in the AP
story -- Robert Carroll, Herman Patterson, Jim Kerns, George Preece
and Norman Tinkler -- who told the magazine that they felt they were
ill-used by the AP.
</P>
<P>
   ''We reported what these veterans said to us,'' said U.S. News'
Duffy. ''Evidently they said something different to you. We
certainly didn't put words in anyone's mouth. I don't know how we
reconcile the different statements to you and to us.''
</P>
<P>
   --Patterson said he ''told AP that when we were knocked back to
the Naktong River a few days later it was damn near a massacre -- of
us. Their story when it came out quoted me as saying that No Gun Ri
was a massacre, and that was not what I said at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual quote from the AP's story was: ''It was just
wholesale slaughter.'' And the context makes it clear that he was
not talking about a slaughter of U.S. troops at the Naktong:
</P>
<P>
   ''In the area of our first withdrawal, what we had to do, we had
to kill 'em. It was just wholesale slaughter. Because we couldn't
get them to get out of there. We couldn't see the enemy for the
refugees. They gave them a certain amount of hours to get out. They
didn't get out and we fired on them.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said: ''We were instructed we were going to see
guerrilla warfare, not armed, uniformed soldiers. How can we assume
that all these people are civilians? I could see a lot of dead
people. I thought at the time it was a wholesale slaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ''To protect your own you're going to annihilate that
possibility. I don't mean they weren't armed. I don't think it was
a slaughter without justification.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent interview videotaped by Associated Press
Television News, Patterson confirmed he saw civilians killed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ''How many people do you think were killed down there?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ''I think the total tally at the end of it was 300.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ''These were, you're assuming there was enemy in there? Do
you know?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ''I don't know for sure. There could have been, there could
not have been. Me seeing them? I didn't see them. We received no
fire from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ''Could you say that again? I didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   A: ''We received no fire from that group of people, no enemy
fire.''
</P>
<P>
   --According to U.S. News, Kerns expressed anger that the AP
''used his words to support the notion that an ordered massacre
occurred. 'Don't talk to me about no AP. Those people twisted my
words,' he said. 'When they phoned me after their story came out, I
told them don't you call me no more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   AP correspondent Charles Hanley spoke, and dined, with Kerns
after the story moved. He was friendly and specifically asked
Hanley to thank co-writer Martha Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Kerns told U.S. News: ''I waved the refugees back. About then
the airplanes began strafing and they ran into the tunnels. I fired
about 40 feet over their heads. I didn't shoot anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This gibes with what he told the AP. A machine gunner, he said
he fired over the refugees' heads: ''I would not fire into a bunch
of women.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News quotes Kerns on the likely number of refugees in the
tunnel. ''There weren't over 125 people in there,'' he said. ''You
couldn't get more to fit in there with all their A-frames and
baggage and carts.''
</P>
<P>
   The AP did not quote Kerns on the body count; other veterans
spoke of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead, while Koreans say 300
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   --Carroll, too, told U.S. News that hundreds couldn't fit in the
culvert: ''You couldn't get that many in the culvert if you stack
them five deep.''
</P>
<P>
   At no point in its story, however, does AP estimate on its own
how many were present or were killed. In a recent test, several
hundred South Korean soldiers were able to lie down in the twin
underpasses.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News quotes Carroll as saying he told AP there was no order
telling machine gunners to open fire on the refugees and none did.
</P>
<P>
   In AP's story, Carroll is quoted on 2nd Battalion riflemen
firing on refugees, and he remembers there were blanket orders to
stop refugees. He told the AP that he left the scene after the
riflemen fired and he could not describe what happened after that.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped interview, Carroll gave APTN a dramatic account
of the first fusillade of fire at the civilians while they were
still up on the railroad tracks. He recalls rescuing a child.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went down there and there were Korean females with that
medical team which wasn't ours ... I turned that little kid over to
them and I shagged my fanny back'' to the company command post.
</P>
<P>
   --U.S. News quotes Tinkler as denying there were orders to fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Refugees came through our positions the day before and pulled
pins and threw three hand grenades at our guys,'' he told U.S.
News. ''I wasn't going to let them get near me. I was on a
.30-caliber Browning water-cooled machine gun that fires 700 rounds
a minute. I was located on the right side of the railroad tracks
facing the bridge, between a quarter and a half-mile away. And yes,
I fired at them. Nobody gave me orders. Nobody was there to give me
any orders. There was just me and one other guy on this gun. Nobody
else around. I saw maybe 150 refugees go in that bridge tunnel. I
fired one belt, 250 rounds. I could see maybe a couple of feet of
one edge of the tunnel and I aimed at that and moved the elevation
knob up and down, ricocheting bullets into the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   AP never reported that Tinkler said he was following orders.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the AP quoted Tinkler: ''We just annihilated them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later, videotaped interview he explained: ''War is not
just. There's things that goes on that we can't comprehend, but it
has to be done. And it's the individual that has to make the
decision. It's not run from Washington D.C. and a bunch of lawyers.
Either shoot, stay alive, or die. That's all there was to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ''And you?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ''I shot. I didn't ask questions.''
</P>
<P>
   His claim to U.S. News of a grenade attack by refugees has not
been supported by any other veteran or military document.
</P>
<P>
   --U.S. News quotes Preece as saying that the story about a
massacre is a ''bunch of bull.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is what he said in a videotaped interview with the AP:
</P>
<P>
   ''They were chased down into that tunnel, all day and all night
going into that tunnel ... we wanted to keep them off the road....
there was women, children, old men, old women.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ''And then an order came to fire on these people?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ''Yes, sir. I know the order was given for them to fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: ''You saw bodies piled up. How many?''
</P>
<P>
   A: ''One hundred, 150, 200 ... I just don't think it was right
to kill women and babies. We felt bad about it, but when you've got
orders you've got to do what the uppers say. They'll get you for
treason and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran -- not a witness -- also gave markedly different
interviews to the AP and to U.S. News.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Haskell, a retired major in the military police, told the
magazine, ''When this (AP) story broke, the whole thing surprised
me. I couldn't believe it, and I guess I was right not to believe
it. We had MPs everywhere ... They would have heard about something
like this and gotten back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But when AP interviewed Haskell, he said the MPs were not
everywhere. His commanding officer, retired Col. Lou Mehl, and
Haskell both said the 545th MP Company was pressed into service for
reconnaissance duty at this time and was not patrolling the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell told AP: ''The division ordered the MPs to break down
into recon patrols. We were reconnoitering the left flank of the
division.''

<HEADLINE> Stars 3, Avalanche 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MARSHALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars, needing a win to keep from
facing the near-impossible turned to -- who else? -- Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   Modano scored two goals as the Stars won their eighth
consecutive Game 2 with a 3-2 victory over the Colorado Avalanche
in the Western Conference finals Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas was desperate after a 2-0 loss in Game 1 and the series
shifting to Colorado on Friday. A two-game deficit would have been
hard to overcome, even for the defending Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 1-8 after losing the first two games of a series --
their only comeback was 1968 against the Los Angeles Kings -- and
Colorado has not lost in six home playoff games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Modano made sure they didn't have to overcome the odds.
</P>
<P>
   After Sandis Ozolinsh gave Colorado the lead 25 seconds into the
second period, Modano tied it at 5:24 when he slipped a shot under
Patrick Roy's pads as both were falling to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sakic took Modano out from behind as he charged the net to
rebound a Brett Hull miss, but also knocked down Roy in the
process. Modano swiped it in just before hitting the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Modano scored his eighth goal of the playoffs on a power play
with 1:45 left in the second, lifting a shot from a tough angle on
the right wing over Roy's glove shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Roy, the NHL's leader in career playoff wins with 119, allowed
eight goals in his previous seven playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, already playing without injured defenseman Ray
Bourque, lost Adam Foote 2:42 into the first period when he took a
stick to the side of the head.
</P>
<P>
   Foote got hit next to his right eye when Jere Lehtinen took a
shot from the left wing and caught him on the follow through. He
was taken to an area hospital to be evaluated and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque skated in the morning, but opted to wait for Friday's
Game 3 in Colorado to test his injured knee. It was his fourth
straight missed game.
</P>
<P>
   Ozolinsh's goal -- his fifth of the playoffs -- found its way
through Adam Deadmarsh's legs and Ed Belfour's pads from about 50
feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Hull put Dallas up 3-1 with a blast from the point over Roy's
right shoulder 5:48 into the third period. Avalanche rookie
defenseman Martin Skoula turned the puck over on the play when he
tripped over his own skate next to the net.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Forsberg pulled Colorado within one when he redirected a
Deadmarsh shot through Belfour's pads with 5:37 left. It was his
sixth of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' rally from a poor Game 1 was the continuation of a
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas came back from a loss in Game 1 of last year's conference
finals with one of its best games of the season, then did it again
after a Game 5 loss with an energized road victory to even the
series.
</P>
<P>
   This year's playoffs have been no different.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took a beating from Edmonton in Game 3 of their
first-round series, but rallied to win the final two games. They
also followed a bad Game 3 at San Jose with a pair of victories --
eliminating the Sharks in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas played without first-line forward Brenden Morrow, who
broke his ankle in Game 1 and will miss the rest of the playoffs.
He was replaced by Lehtinen, who made his first start Saturday
after missing all but 17 games with a broken ankle.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Raiders' Turner Is Ill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Eric Turner of the Oakland Raiders said
Monday he is not gravely ill, contrary to newspapers' reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realize people are concerned, but I have chosen to keep this
issue within my family,'' Turner said in a written statement
released through his agents. ''Contrary to published reports I have
not lost 70 pounds and am not gravely ill ... I will make another
statement when my family and I deem it appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have refused comment on the 31-year-old free safety,
who did not attend the team's minicamp in late April for personal
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Daily News first reported the story, saying last
week the former Pro Bowl player has a serious stomach illness.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified Raiders official as saying,
''It's a terrible, terrible situation ... people should really be
concerned for this kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It started out as an ulcer and it's developed into something
worse,'' the Raiders official told the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Several other San Francisco Bay area newspapers reported late
last week that Turner was ill. On Sunday, the San Jose Mercury News
reported Turner is gravely ill with intestinal cancer. One source
quoted by the newspaper said Turner was resting at his home near
Los Angeles and had lost 70 pounds from his playing weight of 215.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family and I appreciate the thoughts and prayers of my
friends, teammates, and fans .... '' Turner said. ''We ask all
those involved to please respect the privacy of my family during
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a nine-year pro who attended UCLA, was the second
overall pick in the 1991 NFL draft by the Cleveland Browns. He was
selected to the Pro Bowl in 1994 after tying for the NFL lead with
nine interceptions, including one he returned 93 yards for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Turner signed with the Raiders as a free agent before the 1997
season. He led the team in tackles his first year with 111, but was
limited to just six games in 1998 because of a foot injury and
missed the final six games of last season with a calf injury.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 6, Royals 3  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Randy Velarde, Miguel Tejada and Eric
Chavez homered in a five-run sixth inning to back the strong
pitching of Mark Mulder as the Oakland Athletics beat the Kansas
City Royals 6-3 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Grieve also homered for the A's, who won for the sixth time
in seven games to maintain their hold on first place in the AL
West.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder (2-0) went six-plus innings and allowed three runs -- one
earned -- on six hits to snap a string of four no decisions since
beating Cleveland in his major league debut April 18. He struck out
two and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tam worked out of a bases loaded in the seventh during two
scoreless innings and Jason Isringhausen pitched the ninth for his
eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Fussell (3-2), who allowed one run in two previous starts
since being recalled from Triple-A Omaha, gave up four runs and
three hits in five-plus innings. He walked four and struck out
four.
</P>
<P>
   Fussell had held Oakland without a hit until Grieve connected
for his fifth homer, a solo shot with two outs in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland still went into the sixth trailing 3-1 but Velarde, who
missed the first 31 games of the year with a left knee strain,
started the inning with his first homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi singled and Matt Stairs walked to chase Fussell.
Jose Santiago relieved and retired Grieve and Jeremy Giambi, who
had a run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Tejada worked the count full before hitting a go-ahead two-run
homer and Chavez followed with a drive clearing the right-field
wall. It was the fifth homer of the season for each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City took a 2-0 lead in the first on Mark Quinn's RBI
single and Joe Randa's sacrifice fly. Quinn added an RBI groundout
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The attendance of 6,836 was a season-low in attendance for
the A's at Oakland Coliseum. ... The 2-hour, 24-minute game was the
shortest of the season for Oakland. ... The successive homers by
Tejada and Chavez marked the third time this year Oakland batters
have gone deep back-to-back. The last two do it were Jason Giambi
and Tejada on May 2 at Kansas City. ... The Royals, a league-best
14-4 at home, fell to an AL worst 5-15 on the road. ... Kansas
City's Carlos Beltran snapped an 0-for-24 skid when he led off the
seventh with a single.

<HEADLINE> Centenarians honored at capitol  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Marjorie Burnham Ayer-Robbins says
staying active is the key to longevity.
</P>
<P>
   She should know, she's 102 years old. She was one of nearly 50
centenarians -- nearly all women -- from around the state honored
Monday at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Ayer-Robbins, a Hampton resident, goes to church and attends
activities at the historical society, the grange and the senior
center. She quit driving three years ago -- when her car gave out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain her long life, Ayer Robbins said, ''I think a
strong constitution and a wonderful family and keeping an interest
in everything going on. I still go out a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Goldstein, a meteorologist who served as master of
ceremonies, saw a common theme.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of you stayed very active,'' Goldstein said. ''That seems
to be the key to longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Agnes Bardeck, a 100-year-old New Britain resident, relied on an
upbeat attitude and good German food.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that came along, she figured it was God's will and
she was not going to be upset about it,'' said Jane Conway, a
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Asked her secret for long life, Elsie Roskos of Newtown said,
''I'm not really that old.'' She's 103.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin B. Sullivan, who
sponsored the event with Senate Minority Leader M. Adela Eads,
noted some of the key events around the time most of the
centenarians were born, including the election of William McKinley
as president and the start of construction of the New York City
subway system.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the centenarians would find themselves caught up in some
of the momentous changes of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   One-hundred-year-old Marie Africano's husband, Frank, was
veteran of World War I and a victim of gas poisoning. Helen Max,
100, came to Hartford from Austria after the Nazis took over her
home and the bank where she worked.
</P>
<P>
   Lorion Campbell Bassett, 101, knew Mark Twain, who used to shop
and socialize in her grandfather's bookstore in Elmira, N.Y. Marion
P. Lane, 103, recalled her family had one of the first radios in
Meriden around 1919.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Fitzpatrick, 101, of New Britain recalled taking an
automobile trip in the 1930s with her sisters and brothers to see
the Dionne quintuplets in Canada. Fannie Rose Grossman, 101,
emigrated from Russia to Meriden at age 11. She used to watch her
brother, Louis ''Kid'' Kaplan, practice boxing. He won the World
Boxing Championship in New York in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Ayer-Robbins said Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon was the most
exciting event of the 20th century -- but not the most important.
Ayer-Robbins, who recalls growing up on a farm where doctors were
too far away, rated medical advances the most significant
development.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was a child, there was so little available to treat
almost any disease,'' Ayer-Robbins said.

UN Polio Campaign Suffers Setbacks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Wars, a vaccine shortage, and logistical problems have set
back a campaign to eradicate polio, but the dreaded disease should be wiped out
by 2005, the World Health Organization announced Monday. In a campaign begun in
1998, WHO set a goal of certifying the last transmission of polio by the end of
2000, with the whole world declared polio-free five years later. However, WHO
Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland said Monday at the annual meeting of the
agency's governing body that the organization would fail to stop polio infection
by the end of this year. WHO includes 191 member nations.

Drug May Ease Tamoxifen Hot Flashes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Postmenopausal women whose hot flashes are caused by the
breast cancer medication tamoxifen may find relief in a drug normally used to
treat high blood pressure, a study suggests. In a study of 194 women taking
tamoxifen, researchers at the University of Rochester Cancer Center found that
the drug clonidine had a ''small beneficial effect'' in reducing the frequency,
duration and severity of hot flashes. Hot flashes -- sudden spikes in
temperature that cause sweating and dizziness -- are the most common side effect
of tamoxifen, the treatment of choice for women whose breast cancer tumors are
fueled by estrogen.

who said a large number of civilian refugees, many of them women and children,
were shot to death under a railroad bridge at the hamlet of No Gun Ri on July
26, 1950. The veterans' accounts confirmed those of two dozen South Korean
survivors. But in this week's issue, U.S. News &AMP; World Report raised questions

<HEADLINE> 1976 murder case tests memory of boyhood pals  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After a gunman shot and killed a Brooklyn woman
on her own stoop, he came face to face with a kid playing in the
street named Jerry Crespo. Then, authorities say, the gunman
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two decades later, prosecutors have turned to
Crespo and a boyhood pal, Jose Perez, to help try to convict a
suspect captured in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, after being located in an undisclosed Southern state, was
called to the witness stand Monday in the murder trial of David
Galletti; Crespo is to testify later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege Galletti shot Luetisher Johnson, 52, in the
head May 10, 1976, believing -- mistakenly -- that she had been
involved in a dispute with his sister. Afterward, he allegedly fled
New York, changed his name and became a model citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities ''have the wrong man, and you will hear why and how
that can happen and did happen,'' defense attorney Lee Ginsberg
said in opening statements at the trial in state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Galletti, 47, who is free on bail, admits reinventing himself to
dodge the law. But he claims he feared that as a one-time junkie
with a criminal record, no one would believe he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the shooting, three potential witnesses who
were injured by the gunfire have died. So has the woman who
actually had the fight with Galletti's sister.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez, now a 36-year-old car salesman, emerged to testify
that he and Crespo were playing stickball on a spring evening in
Bushwick when they spotted three masked men, at least one of them
armed, emerging from a sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Hey, that guy's got a gun,''' said Perez, who was 12
at the time. ''Then we heard some shots go off. At first, we
thought they were firecrackers.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez recalled that after the men ran past them with their masks
off and hopped into a car, Crespo yelled out the license plate
number. Perez wrote it down with chalk he had been using to keep
score of their game.
</P>
<P>
   The information pointed investigators to Galletti. They tried to
arrest him two days later. But he was long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Galletti went to Puerto Rico, leaving behind
a girlfriend and their children. He returned to the mainland in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Using the alias Luis Gonzalez, he married and started a second
family. He also landed a job with a large food service company,
eventually becoming a manager in a Miami office, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995, Galletti made a crucial mistake. His company
wanted to give him access to a company bank account in Miami, for
which the bank required fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Galletti complied, and the prints were sent to FBI headquarters.
A routine check matched the prints to those New York police had on
file from a 1975 Galletti assault arrest.
</P>
<P>
   After reviving the murder case, authorities descended on
Hemingway, S.C., where Galletti had been transferred. New York
detectives, FBI agents and a local sheriff arrested him in front of
his stunned boss.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect first insisted his name was Gonzalez. But after he
was put in an interrogation room and read his rights, the story
changed, a former detective, Robert Alongi, testified Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''At that point he said, 'I'm David Galletti,''' the detective
recalled.

<HEADLINE> Tobbacco Curing-Barn Modifications  </HEADLINE>
By ELLIOTT MINOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIFTON, Ga. (AP) -- For decades, tobacco growers cured their
tobacco in wooden barns with flues that distributed heat from coal
or wood fires. The smoke never came in direct contact with the
large, green leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Technology changed in the 1960s, and barns today resemble
windowless mobile homes, as farmers load leaves into the structures
and cook them with burners that fill the barns with heat. Problem
is, scientists say, those burners release a gas that reacts with
the tobacco to create carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials, in search of safer cigarettes, want the
growers to invest millions of dollars in curing-barn modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco researchers say combustion gases, particularly nitrous
oxide from direct-fired burners, react with the naturally occurring
tobacco alkaloids during the curing process to produce
nitrosamines, which can cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Converting 45,000 barns in the six flue-cured tobacco states --
Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North and South Carolina and Virginia --
could cost up to $270 million, from $3,000 to $6,000 per barn.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton Matthews, chairman of the Georgia Tobacco Commission,
said farmers are upset that they are being asked to pay some of the
conversion costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's on the minds of a lot of growers is that nitrosamine is
just one of 40 or 50 carcinogens in tobacco,'' said Matthews, who
grows 37 acres near Moultrie. ''What's a concern ... is that this
is the first of many changes we'll have to spend for -- that we'll
just keep adding more expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tobacco Industry Leadership Group, representing all segments
of the industry, recommended in December that growers replace
direct-fired heating systems with systems that vent the gases
outside.
</P>
<P>
   The organization plans to establish an $85 million fund to
assist farmers -- $60 million in direct subsidies and $25 million in
loans. Farmers who convert this year would receive $3,000 per barn;
those who wait until next year would get $2,600 per barn.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership group, which is made up of growers, domestic
cigarette companies, leaf buyers, exporters, scientists, state
agriculture officials and the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative
Stabilization Corp., plans to ask the Department of Agriculture to
make the conversions mandatory for next year's crop, said Arnold
Hamm, assistant general manager of the Stabilization Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Stabilization Corp. is a farmer-owned cooperative that
administers the government price-support program for flue-cured
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deadline for the conversions is July 1, 2001.
Growers who fail to comply would be excluded from the price-support
program.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can reduce a potential carcinogen by 95 percent, we feel
it's not only the morally right thing to do, but it makes good
sense business-wise,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the nation's second-largest cigarette
maker, says it will help pay the barn-conversion costs for growers
who provide low-nitrosamine leaf this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette consumption, which had been falling about 2.5 percent
per year for the past decade, tumbled 9 percent last year. The USDA
responded by slashing flue-cured tobacco production by 44 percent
over the past three years.

28 presidential runoff, election monitors fear that President
Alberto Fujimori is rushing to a repeat of irregularities and
allegations of fraud that marred the first-round vote.
</P>
<P>
   Peru came to the brink of political turmoil a month ago when
supporters of candidate Alejandro Toledo took to the streets by the
tens of thousands, accusing Fujimori of trying to rig a third-term
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis was averted three days after the April 9 vote when,
amid intense international pressure, election officials announced
that Fujimori had fallen shy of the absolute majority needed to
avoid a second round.
</P>
<P>
   ''The political health of this election process, and
consequently civil stability, demand that the second vote has
sufficient validity and is fully accepted by the population as an
indisputable result,'' said Eduardo Stein, head of the observers
mission from the Organization of American States. ''What happened
in the first round didn't provide these guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   Guarantees are what Toledo, a U.S.-trained economist who grew up
in poverty, is demanding. He says he would rather pull out of the
race than lend credibility to an illegitimate election.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS mission says the government is dragging its feet on
investigating fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Results of an investigation into charges that Fujimori's
campaign forged 1 million signatures, aided by election officials,
to help register his candidacy are being postponed until after the
runoff vote.
</P>
<P>
   And Stein said the second-round ballot was set so early that it
is doubtful there will be enough time to test new software that is
supposed to fix the election authority's chronically faulty
computer system.
</P>
<P>
   In the first election, official results showed that there were 1
million more ballots cast than there were voters, and ballot totals
mysteriously decreased as the tally progressed. Stein said there is
insufficient evidence to prove fraud caused the irregularities, but
that his mission could not rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who denies the fraud allegations, maintains the second
round schedule was determined by the constitution, which requires
that the vote take place within 30 days after the official posting
of final results from the first round election.
</P>
<P>
   But political scientist Julio Carrion said Fujimori, whose
third-term bid has been questioned by constitutional experts, has
always been selective about what constitutional requirements he
follows and which ones he sidesteps.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it were to the government's advantage to postpone this
election, it would be postponed,'' Carrion said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, 61, said last week that he would not accept a third
term if victory came under a cloud of irregularities and more fraud
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   According to several national polls, he is tied with Toledo in
the second round race. However, pollsters agree that Fujimori would
not necessarily need to resort to foul play to win.
</P>
<P>
   But polls have also shown that a majority of Peruvians believe
fraud played a part in the first-round vote and that Fujimori's
victory was prevented by massive street protests, international
pressure and threats of sanctions from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The joint observers mission from the U.S.-based National
Democratic Institute and Carter Center recently urged Fujimori to
take whatever steps necessary to guarantee more equal campaign
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, monitors have noted modest improvements in campaign
coverage of Toledo by television stations closely aligned with
Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's state-run station now runs Toledo's campaign commercials.
Private networks, which depend on lucrative government public
service ads for their economic survival, have toned down attacks on
the 54-year-old candidate and for the first time are covering his
rallies on their morning and evening newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines depicting Toledo as a drunk, a terrorist sympathizer
and a free-spender who would usher back the economic chaos of the
1980s, have been pushed to the back pages in tabloid newspapers
widely believed to be financed by Fujimori's National Intelligence
Service.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are front-page stories praising Fujimori for
providing free school lunches to 1 million children, and
proclaiming his re-election promise to deliver jobs, something he
has been unable to provide during his 10 years as president. Only
one in two in Peru's work force has steady employment.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Releases Second Dissident  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba freed the second of four well-known opponents
in a surprise move likely to ease some international pressure on
the communist island, which is still stinging from last month's
United Nations censure for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But while admitting that her time in prison was hard, Marta
Beatriz Roque insisted shortly after her release Monday that her
time behind bars did not change her political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a member of the opposition and will be until we have a
democratic country,'' she said, recalling what she told the
president of the tribunal when she was sentenced last year to 3{
years.
</P>
<P>
   She was surprised when they released her after she'd served all
but eight months. ''I didn't believe it when they told me,'' said
Roque, who turns 55 today. ''Imagine the birthday present!''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba continues to receive heavy criticism a year after
sentencing Roque and her colleagues to prison sentences ranging
from 3{ years to 5 years for written and spoken statements that
were judged to be ''incitement to sedition.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva censured
Cuba for the second consecutive year, voting 21 to 18 to criticize
it for ''the continued violation of human rights and fundamental
freedoms.'' Fourteen members abstained.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, the European Union confirmed that Cuba had
canceled a planned visit by a senior EU delegation after European
nations voted in favor of the censure.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation was scheduled to visit Cuba in late April, headed
by senior diplomats from Portugal, which currently holds the EU
presidency. Talks had been expected to focus on plans to develop
trade ties between Cuba and the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban human rights advocate Elizardo Sanchez said he believed
that the Cuban leadership decided to free at least two of the
prisoners because relations with other countries were being
overshadowed by the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government of Cuba wanted to take the theme of the four
off the agenda,'' said Sanchez, of the Cuban Commission of Human
Rights and National Reconciliation. ''It was coming up in all of
Cuba's international contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been difficult to explain to the international
community that with more than half of their sentences completed and
with good conduct that they had not been freed.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of the four, engineer Felix Bonne Carcasses, was
released Friday. He had been sentenced to four years, walking free
after serving a little less than three years. The government and
the state-controlled media has not commented on either release.
</P>
<P>
   The other two opponents still jailed are lawyer Rene Gomez
Manzano, sentenced to four years, and Vladimiro Roca, a former
military fighter pilot and son of a revered Communist Party leader.
Roca was sentenced to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Although jailed in July 1997, the four were not sentenced until
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   They were charged with criticizing a Communist Party document
that they said did not present solutions to Cuba's severe economic
problems, and for holding several rare news conferences with the
foreign media to publicize their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The government accused the four dissidents of promoting
aggressive U.S. policies toward the communist nation and trying to
harm the economy by discouraging foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   The charges also included encouraging Cubans not to vote, urging
foreign businessmen not to invest in Cuba and asking Cuban exiles
to encourage relatives on the island to undertake acts of civil
disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, the European Community, Canada, the United States
and others protested the sentences as excessive and called for the
opponents' release.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials have repeatedly referred to the opponents as
''counterrevolutionaries,'' rejecting the characterization of the
four as prisoners of conscience.

<HEADLINE> Drug May Ease Tamoxifen Hot Flashes  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Postmenopausal women whose hot flashes are
caused by the breast cancer medication tamoxifen may find some
relief in a drug normally used to treat high blood pressure,
researchers suggested today.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 194 women taking tamoxifen, researchers at the
University of Rochester Cancer Center found that the drug clonidine
had a ''small beneficial effect'' in reducing the frequency,
duration and severity of hot flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Hot flashes -- sudden spikes in temperature that cause sweating
and dizziness -- are the most common side effect of tamoxifen, the
treatment of choice for women whose breast cancer tumors are fueled
by estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of women take estrogen and other hormones to ease hot
flashes brought on by menopause. But doctors are reluctant to
prescribe estrogen in conjunction with tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of concern among oncologists that combining two
hormones can cause inadvertent side effects. Blood clotting is the
most dreaded one,'' said Dr. Kishan Pandya, who led the study,
published in today's Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Women taking clonidine suffered a median of 2.2 fewer hot
flashes per day, according to the study. Women who received a
placebo reported a median of 1.2 fewer hot flashes per day over the
course of the eight-week study.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aikin, director of the clinical coordinating center at
the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Valve Project in
Pittsburgh, said patients have had some success with clonidine. But
the drug's side effects include dry mouth and low blood pressure.

<HEADLINE> Drug Shows Promise for Alcoholics  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A drug designed to help alcoholics abstain from
drinking showed promise in its first American test, according to
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Acamprosate worked best in people who aimed to avoid alcohol
entirely, rather than just cutting down, said researcher Barbara
Mason of the University of Miami School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not magic,'' she said. ''It's not something a spouse can
put in the coffee of the alcoholic in the morning and the problem
will go away. It has to go hand-in-hand with having abstinence as
your treatment goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Acamprosate is now sold in Europe, South America, Asia and
elsewhere, and more than a million people have taken it, Mason
said. It is manufactured by Lipha s.a. of Lyon, France, which paid
for the new study.
</P>
<P>
   Mason presented the study's results Monday at the annual meeting
of the American Psychiatric Association.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anita Goodman, executive vice president of Lipha's clinical
development group in the United States, said the company plans to
get the drug on the American market ''as soon as we can.'' That
step, which would require federal approval, will take at least a
year, she said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors already have some drugs available to maintain
abstinence. One, disulfiram, makes a user feel nauseous and
otherwise sick if he or she also uses alcohol. Another medication,
naltrexone, acts on brain circuitry to reduce the desire to drink.
Acamprosate acts on different brain circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   Mason's six-month study involved 601 alcoholics who were treated
at 21 medical centers. They were randomly assigned to take either
acamprosate tablets or a placebo twice a day, starting two to 10
days after their last bout of excessive drinking.
</P>
<P>
   They also received psychological treatment, education about
effects of alcohol, strategies to help them cut down and quit
drinking and exercises to identify what led them to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Only 41 percent of the participants, or 241 people, began the
study with a goal of complete abstinence, Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those people, those on the placebo stayed away from alcohol
on 58 percent of the days they were studied. Those taking 2 grams a
day of acamprosate didn't drink on 70 percent of the days they were
studied; for people on 3 grams, the figure was 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the members of the placebo group cut their weekly intake
of drinks by 36 percent; the two other groups each reduced it by 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Raye Litten, a program officer for medications development at
the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, said
acamprosate has a modest effect on drinking that's about the same
as naltrexone.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's another way to treat alcoholism,'' he said. ''The more
weapons you have to treat, the better off you'll be, because what
works for one person may not work for another.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Expanding the 'Today' Show  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two hours of the immensely profitable ''Today''
show is no longer enough for NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The network announced Monday it will expand its dominant morning
show to three hours, airing from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., starting Sept.
15. ''Later Today,'' which airs primarily from 9 to 10 a.m., will
be pushed back an hour on the 13 NBC owned-and-operated stations.
</P>
<P>
   NBC executives have talked about expanding ''Today'' for about
20 years. But a number of factors, including the show's ratings
strength and its immense profitability, made the time right for NBC
President Andrew Lack to announce the move to affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something we've wanted to do for years,'' said ''Today''
executive producer Jeff Zucker. ''The 'Today' show has never been
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosts Katie Couric and Matt Lauer will be part of the extra
hour, but the additional time will also give NBC the chance to
increase the roles of newscaster Ann Curry and weatherman Al Roker.
Both have been eager to do something more.
</P>
<P>
   The network and its stations clear an estimated $200 million in
profits a year through the ''Today'' show, which dominates ABC's
''Good Morning America'' and ''The Early Show'' on CBS. The chance
for another hour was too hard for NBC executives to resist.
</P>
<P>
   NBC didn't want to try it last fall, when ''Later Today''
debuted, because it was concerned about tougher competition for
''Today.'' But ''The Early Show'' has been a ratings disaster for
CBS. ''Good Morning America'' has picked up steam, but has not
seriously challenged NBC's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The network also perceives a potential weakness at 9 a.m. on
many ABC stations when Kathie Lee Gifford leaves ''Live with Regis
and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger for NBC lies in overexposure or stretching its
''Today'' team too thin. The cable network MSNBC recently tried
airing reruns of ''Today'' in the early afternoon, but it did
poorly in the ratings and was quickly replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Although ''Later Today'' is continuing, Monday's news doesn't
bode well for the talk show. It began last fall to tepid reviews
and mediocre ratings. It will be on at 10 a.m. for roughly
one-third of the nation's television viewers but must be sold in
syndication to the other markets.

<HEADLINE> NBC Trying New Approach Against ABC  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- NBC is trying a new approach against ''Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire,'' the game show that's dominating television.
</P>
<P>
   Although ''Millionaire'' still attracts a huge audience when it
airs three times a week -- and often more -- the average age of its
viewers has increased from 42 to nearly 51 since it debuted last
August, said Garth Ancier, NBC entertainment president.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best way to succeed against 'Millionaire' is by going for
younger-skewing audiences,'' Ancier said.
</P>
<P>
   That was behind one of NBC's boldest moves in announcing its
fall schedule Monday. It shifted ''Frasier'' back to Tuesday nights
and gave the third-year comedy, ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' the coveted 9
p.m. shift in the network's powerful Thursday lineup. The time slot
was more coveted before ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' began.
</P>
<P>
   ABC was expected to reveal today how many times it plans to air
''Millionaire'' next season. Also releasing its fall schedule was
the WB network, which saw ratings for its teen-oriented schedule
sag this year.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also said it will add four new comedies and three dramas to
its schedule. It is eliminating its Saturday night lineup of dramas
-- ''Profiler,'' ''Pretender'' and ''The Others'' -- and axing the
comedies ''Suddenly Susan,'' ''Veronica's Closet,'' ''Jesse'' and
''Stark Raving Mad.''
</P>
<P>
   The network avoided a major problem when the six actors on
''Friends'' agreed this weekend to two more seasons at $20 million
a year each. Some other popular NBC shows, including ''ER,'' ''Law
and Order'' and ''Will &AMP; Grace,'' have multi-year commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The network also cut ''Dateline NBC'' from five nights to three.
The show has been a workhorse over the past few years, but with
evidence that a glut of newsmagazines is causing audience fatigue,
the Monday and Wednesday editions were eliminated. Producer Neal
Shapiro said he expects more editions of ''Dateline'' will be added
if other shows fail.
</P>
<P>
   NBC hopes a new Aaron Spelling series, ''Titans,'' can revive
the genre of nighttime serials. It centers on a 26-year-old fighter
pilot who returns home to find his dad engaged to a former lover
who's about to bear the son's child.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the kind of total guilty pleasure fans of this genre
love,'' Ancier said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Michael Richards Show,'' with the actor who played
Seinfeld's sidekick, will feature Richards as an unconventional
private investigator. But the network passed on a pilot featuring
Wayne Knight, who played Seinfeld nemesis Newman. The public so
identifies him with that character that it isn't ready to accept
him as a dad, said Scott Sassa, president of NBC West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Movies will be shown on Saturday nights until February, when NBC
broadcasts games from the new football league it is starting with
the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The usually jaded audience of advertisers watching NBC's
schedule announcement gave a standing ovation to the cast of the
freshman drama, ''The West Wing.'' The five other new shows NBC
will premiere in the fall:
</P>
<P>
   --''Dag,'' a comedy starring David Alan Grier as a demoted Secret
Service agent guarding the first lady, played by Delta Burke.
</P>
<P>
   --''Tucker,'' a comedy modeled after Fox's successful ''Malcolm
in the Middle,'' about a 14-year-old boy and his newly divorced
mother who move in with her older sister.
</P>
<P>
   --''The Steven Weber Show,'' which stars the former ''Wings''
actor as an executive whose life unravels after a blind date puts a
hex on him.
</P>
<P>
   --''Deadline,'' which gives producer Dick Wolf (''Law and
Order,'' ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'') his third hour on
NBC's schedule. It's a drama about a columnist working on a New
York City tabloid newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   --''Ed,'' a drama about a New York attorney who moves back to his
Midwestern hometown. It comes from David Letterman's production
company and was created by two ''Late Show'' writers.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Inaugurating New President  </HEADLINE>
By AYLA JEAN YACKLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey is inaugurating a reform-minded
judge as its 10th president, raising expectations that the country
will press forward in its efforts to broaden democracy and increase
personal liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmet Necdet Sezer, the chief justice of Turkey's highest court,
is to be sworn in as president today before parliament, replacing
President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer, 58, was elected earlier this month to a seven-year term.
His new office will be largely ceremonial, but many political
observers think he will use the considerable clout of the
presidency to affect public -- and parliamentary -- opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''His election symbolizes the will of the public for more
democratic rights,'' said Fehmi Koru, a columnist at the
pro-Islamic Yeni Safak newspaper. ''More importantly, it's also a
symbol of the will of parliament. They chose a true democrat at
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   While presidents in Turkey function mainly as figureheads, they
play a crucial role as power brokers in times of political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer can also wield influence by proposing legislation in his
meetings with ministers and in his public speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Signs that Sezer supports extending civil liberties include his
criticism of the Constitution, drawn up in 1982 during military
rule, and his calls for reforming laws that check free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Those laws have imprisoned hundreds of people for speeches,
books or newspaper articles deemed threats to national security.
</P>
<P>
   ''An understanding of democracy has not developed in social and
political life, and a tradition of democracy has not been
created,'' Sezer said after his election. ''Democracy and
democratic values have to be inserted into our legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   Sezer has also questioned the army's annual purges of officers
considered sympathetic to Islamic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercely secular military, which has seized power three
times since 1960, considers political Islam the greatest threat to
Turkey's secular regime.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his predecessor, Sezer is a political novice.
</P>
<P>
   Demirel, 76, was a fixture in Turkish politics for nearly 40
years. As president, Demirel helped balance the power of the
military and that of politicians and forged close ties with the
Central Asian states of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts fear that Sezer lacks the clout to keep the
military's strong influence in check.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer, the fourth civilian to serve as president, takes office
as Turkey undergoes what some consider an economic and political
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit won a $4 billion IMF-backed loan
last year, and the government has begun to privatize state
enterprises and rein in chronic inflation, which hovers around 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sezer has called for increased economic reforms ''to remedy the
disparities in income and thus to bring about a social state of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also criticized restrictions on the use of the Kurdish
language, which is still banned in schools and broadcasts, despite
a visible decline in the Kurdish rebel threat.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, which accepted Turkey as a candidate in
December, has been pressuring the country to enact democratic
reforms to become a full member.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a strong desire for democracy right now,'' Koru said.
''If Sezer offers Turkey the chance to realize more democracy, it
will also be an opportunity for Sezer to engrave his name upon
Turkish history.''

<HEADLINE> AP Statement on No Gun Ri Story  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A statement by Jonathan Wolman, Associated Press
executive
editor, regarding questions raised by U.S. News &AMP; World Report
about the news service's investigation into the shootings of
civilians at No Gun Ri during the Korean War:
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Associated Press stands behind its carefully researched
report of events in the early days of the Korean War near the
village of No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Even as we review discrepancies between several records and
eyewitness accounts, we are confident of the accuracy and fairness
of the central finding that Korean civilians were killed by U.S.
forces during chaotic days at the end of July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Our story, published almost eight months ago, was careful to
reflect the contradictions, ambiguities and scarred memories that
marked our attempts to reconstruct an event from 50 years ago.
Investigations are under way in the United States and South Korea,
and last Friday senior Defense Department officials were cited in
The New York Times as confirming the central finding of the story.
Two prominent Korean War historians told The Washington Post they
have reached a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Previous to our story the Pentagon had denied any knowledge of
the incident and said the unit involved was not in the area.
</P>
<P>
   AP's account was prepared with exhaustive care over more than a
year, reported and re-reported, recorded and indeed in some cases
videotaped so that the kind of questions now being raised could be
fully addressed within AP's standards of accuracy and fairness and
dedication to objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new questions are based on records that themselves
leave gaps or are subject to multiple interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Serious questions involve veteran Ed Daily. We spoke to soldiers
who put him at the scene and have reviewed the documentation he
offered for his role -- a dated driver's license listing his unit,
a frayed letter to his mother, a Christmas menu with his name. If
it turns out that he and those records deceived us, we will be
extremely regretful, and saddened for him.
</P>
<P>
   But the tale of No Gun Ri does not fall on the words of Mr.
Daily. He was first mentioned in the 56th paragraph of our story
and only later became such a visible figure through followup
reports, as the U.S. News story says.
</P>
<P>
   Events at No Gun Ri were important and complicated ones that
deserve the scrutiny of journalists, historians and investigators.
We were proud of the No Gun Ri story when we distributed it, as we
are today.

<HEADLINE> Census-Takers Tackle Rural Areas  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHEIM, Pa. (AP) -- The travel can be tough, especially when you
have to walk down dirt driveways in 90-degree heat. The job pays
$11.25 an hour, but dealing with people can sometimes be a
challenge, especially when they just don't want to talk.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens census-taker Lois Weaver just grins and moves
on to the next home or farm. It's what the 440,000 Census Bureau
workers must do to track down the 42 million households around the
country which did not return a questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Weaver, who work in more rural areas, the job
can be tougher. Rural areas got a higher percentage of long forms
than cities -- the same 53-question long form that has sparked
debate over whether the Census Bureau asks questions that are too
intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people are nice, friendly and helpful,'' said Weaver, a
gift shop owner who took the Census Bureau job to help buy a new
computer. ''But if someone's not going to fill it out, I can't make
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you show them a long form, some of them laugh,'' she
said. ''Then they direct their hostility toward the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight million of the 120 million forms mailed out have
been returned, leaving census-takers to track down the missing 42
million. The operation ends on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports of census-takers being chased off
porches by gun-toting homeowners. One enumerator near Tahlequah,
Okla., was invited into a home, but wasn't allowed to leave until
two hours later, said Titus Frenchman, manager of the Tulsa, Okla.,
Census Bureau office.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to classify as a major problem, but Census
Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt says he is still unsure exactly
what type of response his workers will get in the long run because
of the long form debate.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, criticism from citizens and congressional
Republicans heightened about whether the Census Bureau was being
too nosy. Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said he suggested to
constituents worried about giving information they considered
private to decline to answer those questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now move from one phase of the census to another -- the very
demanding task of convincing people who did not return their forms
to cooperate when census-takers come to their door,'' Prewitt said.
''If we stopped now, the results could be disastrous for many
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   More long forms are missing this year than in the last census 10
years ago: the response rate gap doubled from 6 percent to 12
percent during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Those long-form questions range from ''What is your race?'' to
''How much money do you make?'' to ''Do you have indoor plumbing?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I got my census form in the mail one day and shipped it out
the next. I can't believe some people didn't send it in,'' Harry
Bachart, of nearby Ephrata, said as he returned home from his
factory job. He got a short form.
</P>
<P>
   ''But is the long form an invasion of privacy? Well, maybe it
is,'' Bachart said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 1 of 6 households across the country were randomly
selected to get the long form. But the ratio fell to 1 out of 4, or
1 out of 2 in more rural areas in order to get detailed information
that was statistically comparable to data from cities.
</P>
<P>
   Some census-takers go to unusual lengths to get the job done. In
Maine, workers used lobster boats to sail to remote island homes,
while in Santa Fe County, N.M., employees needed four-wheel drive
vehicles to travel over rough roads to get to isolated homes.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer Nathan Reiff, of Ephrata, returned his short form and
says he would fully cooperate if someone knocked on his door asking
census questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a head count, right?'' Reiff said as he headed home
after a day in the field. ''I don't see anything wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't as agreeable.
</P>
<P>
   John Trochmann, co-founder of the Militia of Montana, says he
tells people they should only answer questions that deal with age,
skin color, address and sex.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been very cooperative, and we urge everyone to cooperate
up to that point,'' said Trochmann, of Noxon, Mont. ''These
so-called census-workers here are neighbors of us, we are not
hostile to anyone. Unless they draw first blood, in which case we
better be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hendrick, a Census Bureau area manager for Montana, Utah
and Wyoming, said enumerators are trained to handle the stickiest
of situations. Except in areas where safety is a concern,
census-takers usually do the job on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Zdan, of Bear Creek, Pa., is a census-taker whose
territory includes isolated mountain homes and out-of-the way
lakeside resorts in the Pocono Mountains. He takes a gentle
approach if someone declines to answer his questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell them, 'If you don't answer now, then another enumerator
will knock on your door, so you might as well as just get it over
with now,''' Zdan said.

<HEADLINE> Fed Expected To Hike Interest Rates  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, worried that the economy
is zooming ahead too fast, is likely to take a more aggressive
stance in fighting inflation and boost a key interest rate by a
half-point, a growing number of private economists believe.
</P>
<P>
   The record-breaking economy, now in its longest-ever streak of
uninterrupted growth, continues to speed ahead despite five
quarter-point interest rate increases by the Fed since last June to
try to slow things down a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and members of the Fed, including Chairman Alan
Greenspan, have expressed concerns that too-rapid economic growth
could spark inflation down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things are sure not slowing down,'' said David Wyss, economist
with Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. ''We are seeing continued strength in
this economy and the Fed feels the strength is becoming a little
too much. We are doing too well for our own good.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that, many economists predict the central bank is poised
to double its normal dose of anti-inflation medicine and raise its
federal funds rate by one-half percentage point, instead of the
usual quarter-point. That key rate governs the interest that banks
charge each other on overnight loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee was to meet
today to review interest rate policy. An announcement of its
decision was expected by midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A half-point boost would push the federal funds rate to 6.5
percent. Since June 30, the Fed has increased the funds rate from
4.75 percent to the current 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks would respond to such a half-point increase in
the funds rate with a similar boost to their prime rate, the
benchmark for millions of consumer and business loans. The prime
rate now stands at 9 percent and at 9.5 percent would be at its
highest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The booming economy, which grew at a sizzling rate of 5.4
percent in the first three months of 2000, has pushed the nation's
unemployment rate below 4 percent for the first time in 30 years.
Economists view such developments as signs that demand is having
trouble keeping up with supply, sowing the seeds of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those were all flashing red signals'' leading many economists
and investors to forecast a half-point interest rate boost, said
David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. The normal
quarter-point rate increase, Jones said, would create ''the
perception that the Fed is falling behind the curve'' in terms of
fighting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The economy's expansion has managed to last so long because
inflation has been dormant, allowing the central bank to let the
good times roll without having to worry too much about cooling
things off with higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But there are indications that inflation pressures are beginning
to mount.
</P>
<P>
   A measure of wages and benefits increased in the year's first
three months at the fastest pace in eight years, seemingly a
confirmation of Greenspan's repeated worries that tight labor
markets will eventually translate into inflationary wage demands.
</P>
<P>
   A minority of economists believe the Fed will stick with its
incremental quarter-point increases on Tuesday, arguing that
anything larger could jolt investors not only in the United States
but in countries still trying to emerge from the global financial
crisis of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   But those in the half-point camp said they believe some recent
dips in U.S. stock prices reflected investors pricing in a
half-point Fed rate increase and anything smaller could trigger a
market rally.
</P>
<P>
   That is something the Fed would not want to see, these analysts
said, given that rising stock prices have fueled the consumer
spending boom the central bank is trying to dampen.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be surprising to the markets and to many economists
if the Fed did less aggressive tightening,'' said Michael P.
Niemira, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

<HEADLINE> Cookbook Designed for Poor Families  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned that low-income families aren't
getting the nutrition they need, the government today released a
cookbook with recipes designed to be easy to follow and provide an
adequate diet on about $100 a week.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-page book also provides sample menus for a two-week
period, a suggested grocery shopping list, and advice on reducing
food costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the recipes don't taste good, they won't be used regardless
of whether they are nutritionally sound,'' said Shirley Watkins,
the Agriculture Department's undersecretary for food, nutrition and
consumer services. ''These recipes passed all the tests with flying
colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dishes include stir-fried pork and vegetables with rice (with a
total preparation and cooking time of 45 to 50 minutes), saucy beef
pasta (preparation time: one hour) and one vegetarian offering,
cheese-stuffed potatoes. Each of the 40 recipes in the book
includes a list of the calories, fat, cholesterol and sodium that
the dish contains.
</P>
<P>
   The sample menus would meet federal nutrition standards for a
family of four with two children between 6 and 11 years of age,
according to USDA.
</P>
<P>
   The cookbook was developed by Pennsylvania State University
under contract with USDA.
</P>
<P>
   The books will be available for $4.25 through the Government
Printing Office.

<HEADLINE> On Testing, Meat Recalls Soar  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Increased government testing for a deadly
pathogen in hot dogs and other processed meats has led to a sharp
increase in recalls of such products, even as the incidence of
contamination may be declining, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Meat processors have issued 23 recalls since Oct. 1, the
beginning of the government's 2000 fiscal year, for meat products
that may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. That compares
to 25 for fiscal 1999, five for all of 1998 and three in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department, which samples processed meat
products for listeria, doubled the testing rate in 1999 and also is
using more sensitive methods for detecting the bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are urged to delay shipment of products that are being
tested by USDA rather than risk having to recall the meat. Many
companies, however, go ahead and ship the meat and take their
chances that the test results will be negative, USDA officials said
Monday at a public meeting on its efforts to reduce
listeria-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made it clear that with our increased sampling and
better methods we're much more likely to find a positive,'' said
Thomas Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The increased number of recalls doesn't necessarily mean that
listeria is more prevalent, said Billy. The percentage of positive
listeria tests actually dropped last year for many products,
including hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 1.8 percent of the hot dogs and similar products that
were tested by USDA contained listeria, down from 3.5 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the incidence of listeria in large sausage products
that were tested, including bologna and salami, dropped from 1.2
percent to 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of listeria in sliced ham and beef products went
up in 1999. Some 4.6 percent of the sliced ham that was tested by
USDA contained listeria, up from 4.2 percent in 1998. The incidence
in roast beef and corned beef products went up from 2.2 percent to
2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria is estimated to kill 500 Americans a year and sicken
2,000 more. It causes flu-like symptoms in most healthy people, but
it can be serious in the young, old or weak. In pregnant women, the
bacterium can cause miscarriage or stillbirth even if the mother
feels no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced a series of steps that the
government is taking to cut down on the incidence of listeria and
reduce listeria-caused illnesses by one-half over the next five
years. Those measures will include requiring plants to check for
listeria contamination regularly to make sure their sanitation
systems are working.
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak of listeria poisoning in 1998 killed 15 people and
sickened at least 100 and was traced to meat processed at a Sara
Lee Corp. plant in Michigan. The company recalled 15 million pounds
of hot dogs and lunch meats, and USDA ordered plants nationwide to
revamp their processing methods to prevent listeria contamination.

Turkey Inaugurating New President
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey is inaugurating a reform-minded judge as its
10th president, raising expectations that the country will press forward in its
efforts to broaden democracy and increase personal liberties. Ahmet Necdet
Sezer, the chief justice of Turkey's highest court, is to be sworn in as
president Tuesday before parliament, replacing President Suleyman Demirel.
Sezer, 58, was elected earlier this month to a seven-year term. His new office
will be largely ceremonial, but many political observers think he will use the
considerable clout of the presidency to affect public -- and parliamentary --
opinion.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- With less than two weeks left before the May 28
presidential runoff, election monitors fear that President Alberto Fujimori is
rushing to a repeat of irregularities and allegations of fraud that marred the
first-round vote. Peru came to the brink of political turmoil a month ago when
supporters of candidate Alejandro Toledo took to the streets by the tens of
thousands, accusing Fujimori of trying to rig a third-term victory. The crisis
was averted three days after the April 9 vote when, amid intense international
pressure, election officials announced that Fujimori had fallen shy of the

2000, with the whole world declared polio-free five years later. However, WHO
Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland said Monday at the annual meeting of the
agency's governing body that the organization would fail to stop polio infection

Drug May Ease Tamoxifen Hot Flashes

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Postmenopausal women whose hot flashes are caused by the
breast cancer medication tamoxifen may find relief in a drug normally used to
treat high blood pressure, a study suggests. In a study of 194 women taking
tamoxifen, researchers at the University of Rochester Cancer Center found that
the drug clonidine had a ''small beneficial effect'' in reducing the frequency,
duration and severity of hot flashes. Hot flashes -- sudden spikes in
temperature that cause sweating and dizziness -- are the most common side effect
of tamoxifen, the treatment of choice for women whose breast cancer tumors are
fueled by estrogen.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Africa AIDS Victim Fund  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has approved funds to combat the
devastation of AIDS in Africa, the center of what the Surgeon
General says will soon become the worst infectious disease epidemic
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote Monday to create a World Bank-run trust fund to
address the scourge of HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa comes
amid increased awareness of the threat AIDS poses to the world's
political and economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The administration recently said it now regards the world AIDS
epidemic to be of a proportion sufficient to threaten national
security. With fragile democracies and struggling economies in
developing nations at risk, ''AIDS is a national security issue,''
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world confronts one of the most serious and urgent public
health challenges in the history of mankind,'' said Banking
Committee Chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa, co-sponsor of the bill with
Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif. Soon to surpass both the bubonic plague
of the 1300s and the influenza epidemic of 1918-1919 in deadliness,
''the global AIDS epidemic might fairly be described as a disease
of Biblical proportions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leach and others cited disastrous statistics: sub-Saharan Africa
accounts for 10 percent of the world population but 80 percent of
the worldwide deaths of more than 16 million. Every day another
6,000 Africans die of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The life expectancy in southern Africa, which stood at 59 in the
early 1990s, is expected to drop to 45 by 2015. The World Bank says
the impending deaths of up to 25 percent of adults in some
countries could destroy economies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The survival of a continent is at stake,'' said Lee. ''AIDS is
decimating the continent and leaving behind millions of orphans in
its wake. By the year 2010 the number of orphans in Africa will
equal the number of children in America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, named after the Marshall Plan under which the United
States helped Europe rebuild after World War II, authorizes U.S.
contributions of $100 million a year for five years to the World
Bank trust fund, with the aim of leveraging that to produce up to
$1 billion a year from international donors.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank would administer programs dealing with AIDS
prevention, education, treatment and care.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank HIV/AIDS coordinator Debrework Zewdie said the bill
would send a strong signal to other governments and give a sense of
solidarity to African nations. ''This is the time,'' she said.
''Otherwise it will be too late for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia French of the advocacy group AIDS Action applauded the
House bill, which now goes to the Senate with the strong support of
the administration. ''America is clearly stepping up to the
plate,'' she said. ''While most experts believe it will take more
than $5 billion to slow the epidemic in Africa, we are excited
about this down payment.''
</P>
<P>
   The African AIDS crisis was also the focus of attention last
week when President Clinton issued an executive order making clear
that the U.S. government would not stand in the way of African
nations seeking access to less expensive or generic AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week five major pharmaceutical companies agreed to
make substantial cuts in the price of AIDS drugs for Africa and
other developing countries. They were responding to criticisms that
while new AIDS treatments have prolonged the lives of HIV and AIDS
victims in the West, they are far too expensive to help the
millions of sufferers in Africa and Asia.

<HEADLINE> Saccharin Dropped From Cancer List  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saccharin has been dropped from the federal
list of cancer-causing chemicals, but tobacco, both smoked and
dipped, have been added, along with alcoholic drinks and sunlamps.
</P>
<P>
   The release Monday of the 9th National Toxicology Report on
Carcinogens deleted saccharin as a possible cancer-causing
chemical, but identified secondhand tobacco smoke, directly inhaled
tobacco smoke and smokeless tobacco as known carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the National Institute of Environmental Healthy
Sciences said that saccharin was dropped off the list after new
studies showed ''no clear association'' between the sweetener and
human cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two decades ago, when saccharin was shown to produce bladder
tumors in rats, it was a prudent, protective step to consider the
sweetener to be a likely human carcinogen,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Olden, director of the NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program.
</P>
<P>
   But Olden said an advance in scientific understanding ''allows
us to make finer distinctions today. ... In other words, with
better science we can now make a better call.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies now show that laboratory rat bladder tumors once linked
to saccharin are ''not relevant to the human situation,'' Olden
said, adding that decades of human saccharin use ''adds to our
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Saccharin previously had received a clean bill of health from
such groups as the American Cancer Society, the American Medical
Association, the American Dietetic Association and the American
Diabetes Association.
</P>
<P>
   The carcinogen report also delisted ethyl acrylate, a chemical
used in the manufacture of latex paints and textiles. It had been
listed in 1989 as ''reasonably anticipated to be a human
carcinogen.'' A review of lab studies showed the chemical caused
cancer in rats only when it was fed to the animals in high
concentrations. Human exposure in such a way, the report said, ''is
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, which identifies a total of 218 cancer threats,
formally endorses years of scientific studies that have linked
cancer with tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Additions to the list of ''known human carcinogens'' include
environmental, or secondhand, tobacco smoke; directly inhaled
tobacco smoke and smokeless tobacco (such as snuff). New items on
the list also include alcoholic beverages; sunlamps and sunbeds,
and six industrial chemicals and dyes.
</P>
<P>
   Also added to the list was tamoxifen. Although it fights breast
cancer, the drug also increases the risk of uterine cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Seven chemicals, including diesel exhaust particulates, were
added as substances ''reasonably anticipated to be human
carcinogens.'' The other additions to this list are industrial
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Linking saccharin to cancer originated with 1977 laboratory
studies in which male rats fed huge doses of the sweetener
developed bladder tumors. Some compared the dosage to a human
drinking 800 cans of diet soda daily for a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The studies led the Food and Drug Administration call for a ban
on saccharin, but Congress in 1977 placed a moratorium on the FDA
ban. That moratorium was renewed periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Congress did pass legislation requiring all saccharin products
to carry a label warning that the sweetener ''may be hazardous to
your health'' because it caused cancer in lab animals.
</P>
<P>
   The 1981 Report on Carcinogens first listed saccharin as an
''anticipated human carcinogen.''
</P>
<P>
   But human studies soon began to question the dangers of the
sweetener and in 1991, the FDA withdrew its proposed ban.
</P>
<P>
   With the delisting from the carcinogen report, saccharin
supporters will next ask Congress to remove the warning label, said
Keith Keeney of the Calorie Control Council, an association of diet
food and beverage manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Saccharin is the oldest of the common artificial sweeteners. It
was discovered by Johns Hopkins University chemist Constantine
Fahlberg in 1879 and was used in diets starting early in the 20th
century, particularly during wartime when sugar supplies were
short. Use increased in the 1950s when diet foods became more
popular.
</P>
<P>
   There are three other artificial sweeteners now in wide
commercial use -- aspartame, sucaralose and acesulfame potassium --
none of which has been linked to cancer, Keeney said.

<HEADLINE> Sheriff's Columbine Report Released  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The sheriff's department Monday released a
minute-by-minute account of the Columbine High School bloodbath,
concluding the 12 students killed by the teen-age gunmen were dead
within 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The timeline appears to support the department in disputing
claims by victims' families that the officers could have saved
lives if they had acted more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But the report also confirms that teacher Dave Sanders, who died
in a science room, and some of the 23 people wounded waited for
hours until the SWAT team finished evacuating the school after the
April 20, 1999, attack.
</P>
<P>
   The first shots were fired at 11:19 a.m., according to the
report. The gunmen killed themselves 49 minutes later, two minutes
after SWAT teams entered the school.
</P>
<P>
   There was no evidence that there was a third shooter or that
anyone had prior knowledge of the killers' plans, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone distributed the report from
the 13-month investigation to victims' families and the news media
under an order issued by a judge hearing nine lawsuits filed by 15
families of slain or wounded students.
</P>
<P>
   The voluminous CD-ROM report, with about 700 pages of text plus
photos and audio and video clips, was based on as many as 5,000
witness interviews and about 10,000 pieces of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the details already have been published or broadcast,
including the gunmen's movements through the school, firing at
will, as hundreds of students fled or cowered underneath tables, in
bathrooms and cupboards.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation determined that the gunmen didn't intend to
end up in the library but apparently changed their plan when bombs
they had brought didn't explode and police officers arrived at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the gunmen were in the library for 7.5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''In that time, they shot and killed 10 people and wounded 12
more. They carried more than enough ammunition to kill all 56
people in the library,'' according to the report, released by
Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the teen-age gunmen, Dylan Klebold and Eric
Harris, also intended to kill 488 people in the cafeteria through
the use of two bombs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the timeline set out in the report: Harris and
Klebold took the bombs into the school in duffel bags and back
packs the morning of the attack. When the bombs didn't explode,
they went back to their cars and got the guns.
</P>
<P>
   Seven minutes after the first shots were fired, Harris exchanged
fire with a school resource officer outside the school, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The resource officer called for help, and the first police
arrived at 11:26. By 11:35, 12 students were dead and 34 were
wounded. It would be half an hour more before SWAT team members
entered the building at 12:06.
</P>
<P>
   A camera in the cafeteria showed Klebold and Harris surveying
the damage at 11:57. At noon, they returned to the library, and at
12:08, they killed themselves, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   SWAT teams began escorting students from the building at 2:30
p.m. but didn't reach the library for another hour. Patrick
Ireland, who became one of the most enduring image of the attack,
crawled out the library window into the waiting arms of SWAT team
members at 2:38 p.m., the report said.
</P>
<P>
   There were three exchanges of gunfire between deputies and the
gunmen during the incident, according to the report. Deputies
exchanged gunfire with Harris twice before both gunmen entered the
library, and officers later fired at Harris and Klebold after they
shot at paramedics rescuing the students.
</P>
<P>
   ''While this report established a record of the events of April
20, it cannot answer the most fundamental question -- why,'' Stone
said in a statement. He declined to answer additional questions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the gunmen's yearbooks, videotapes,
journals and computer files listed 67 people they disliked for
various reasons, but only one of these people was wounded, ''and
there is no evidence that he was specifically targeted on April
20.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' families contend that the sheriff's office has
stonewalled them on details of the shootings and has taken too long
to complete the report.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Brown, whose son escaped unhurt from Columbine, said the
report excludes important information about the two gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff and his deputies are ''going to release the best
version of this that is going to do the best for their lawsuit,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Reopened to Residents  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- More than three-quarters of Los Alamos
was reopened to residents Monday, while the fire that burned down
260 homes raged out of control on other fronts, including an Indian
reservation where historic sites have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 9,000 residents were allowed back into the less-severely
damaged parts of this town of 11,000, which was evacuated entirely
on Wednesday. Police Chief Rich Melton said they might have to get
by without gas and electricity for a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos nuclear laboratory remained closed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the primitive conditions in Los Alamos, traffic quickly
backed up on the winding road into the city from Pojoaque, about 15
miles to the north. Once back home, Bill Starkovich immediately set
about watering his flowers, mowing the lawn and sweeping a light
coating of ash off his driveway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to make the house look nice for my wife,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gigantic blaze, with an 89-mile perimeter, was burning into
a canyon Monday on the edge of an Indian reservation, where tribal
fire spokesman Alvin Warren said it destroyed some ''culturally
sensitive archaeological sites'' over the weekend. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   So far firefighters have managed to keep the flames away from
the tribal homes at the Santa Clara Pueblo, where about 1,500
people live. However, the fire came within a quarter-mile of cliff
dwellings in a popular hunting and fishing area about 15 miles
northeast of Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the 44,000-acre blaze was 35 percent contained. More
than 1,500 firefighters worked furiously to surround it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any time they see a plume of smoke, it will be attacked
vigorously,'' fire spokesman Jim Paxon said. ''Today, we're mopping
up and holding the line.'' But Paxon warned: ''This does not mean
the total threat of fire to Los Alamos is gone. It's diminished.''
</P>
<P>
   The main worry was the National Weather Service's forecast of
wind gusting to 50 mph Tuesday. Firefighters have said it may be
more than a week before other evacuees can return and weeks before
the blaze is out.
</P>
<P>
   The wind was at 50 mph when the fire, which was set by the
government to clear brush, first jumped into Los Alamos on
Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of a total of 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Seven thousand residents of suburban White Rock were allowed
back home Sunday, and Los Alamos Fire Chief Doug MacDonald said
officials were sure there would be no problem in reopening 80
percent of Los Alamos while the fire continued to burn Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel confident or we would not make the recommendation to
come back,'' he said. ''We evacuated once and we don't want to
evacuate twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the homes in the reopened area appeared to have survived
the flames without suffering damage any more serious than dried-out
lawns and wilted petunias and tulips.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Alamos National Laboratory, spokeswoman Kay Roybal
said officials were checking to see whether the facilities might be
ready to reopen. They had been closed a full week as of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials planned to take air samples Monday to check for
radioactivity from the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos fire was started May 4 on Bandelier National
Monument by National Park Service officials hoping to clear brush
and deadwood. But the blaze raged out of control. Park
Superintendent Roy Weaver has been placed on leave pending an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, firefighters tried to keep the fire from spreading
farther into the Santa Clara Indian Pueblo or onto the Baca Ranch,
a majestic 95,000-acre volcanic area being purchased by the Forest
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said the fire had consumed more than 6,000 acres of
Pueblo land -- ''more than 10 percent of our reservation.'' Pueblo
Gov. Denny Gutierrez said the fire was burning near a creek that
the tribe depends on for its water.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our lifeline coming down from that canyon,'' he said.
''Our watershed is there, cultural matters in the valley. It's very
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said a total of 405 families have lost their homes in
the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the state's congressional
delegation will meet Tuesday in Washington to begin planning the
government compensation effort.
</P>
<P>
   In southern New Mexico, a plane assisting bombers dropping fire
retardant on another fire, a 20,717-acre fire in the Sacramento
Mountains, crashed Monday, and state police said both people aboard
were killed. That fire was 50 percent contained Monday.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Refugees Fear the Future  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- In a dimly lit warehouse full of
ancient machinery, hundreds have sought refuge. More people crowd
into storage areas, workshops and tents in the yard of the British
colonial-era train station turned refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   About 35,000 people from towns near the capital have fled into
the capital, Freetown, in recent days, fearing renewed fighting in
this West African country, aid workers say. Many have found shelter
with friends and relatives, but others have ended up here, at the
National Workstation camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are afraid,'' says Ramatu Bangura, sitting surrounded by
her five children and the few possessions she managed to grab when
gunshots rang out last week near her last home, a camp just outside
Freetown. ''Four times the rebels came to my place. They burned my
house, they looted, they killed my man. When they found his body, I
only recognized him by the clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bangura, many here have been forced to flee time and again
over eight years of civil war during which rebels have killed tens
of thousands and maimed many more men, women and children in a
campaign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Long abandoned by its former British owner, the disused railway
station filled with squatters when the rebel Revolutionary United
Front invaded Freetown in January 1999, burning, looting, maiming
and killing thousands. Soon after, organizations such as the World
Food Program, UNICEF and Doctors Without Borders began distributing
food, building latrines and installing a clean water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions here are grim. Hundreds crowd into a former
hangar-like workshop. Strips of canvas and plastic sheeting
stretched between dusty, rusting equipment demarcate the dwellings
of each family and provide some shelter from the water that drips
down through cracks in the soaring ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Others spread straw mats on the bare concrete floor of a
stifling hot brick building full of mosquitos. Outside, people
clutching old rice bags and plastic containers line up to receive a
month's supply of wheat, maize and cooking oil from the U.N. World
Food Program. Men chop wood to sell while women stir pots over open
fires and children swarm over a trash heap.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the camp already full with 7,000 residents, the 3,000
new arrivals have been forced to shelter wherever they can -- in the
food distribution center, the school tent, or an alley between two
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they want to leave, however, most shake their heads
emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, no, no,'' says Sahr Biango, whose 15-year-old daughter was
locked into her family's home and burned alive by the rebels, who
also hacked off the hands of his two brothers. ''I am afraid for my
other children.''
</P>
<P>
   Last July, the rebels signed a peace deal giving their leaders
top government posts and amnesty for the atrocities they committed.
U.N. peacekeepers deployed throughout the country, and war-weary
civilians started to move back to their villages.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels tore at the accord by taking peacekeepers
hostage. Then, a week ago, they opened fire on thousands of
demonstrators outside rebel chief Foday Sankoh's home. Thirteen
civilians and six soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since, they have clashed repeatedly with U.N. troops
and pro-government forces, but have been pushed back from
Freetown's immediate surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not expecting such,'' says Finda Sukudu, who returned
last year from neighboring Guinea, where she fled after the RUF
attacked her village and forced her brother to hold their father's
head as rebels slit his throat. ''I was feeling fine. I thought
peace had come to Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   With armed government troops once again manning checkpoints
along the main road linking the seaside capital to the interior,
some of those who fled last week to Freetown are already heading
back to their former camps and towns.
</P>
<P>
   But many have lost confidence that peace will be restored and
refuse to leave the relative security of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am old now. I can't be running all the time,'' says Isata
Sheriff, who stood in line with about a dozen recent arrivals
jostling to be registered so they can receive food and other
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Hunched over with age, she wipes tears from her eyes with the
edge of her dress as she remembers her husband shot by the rebels,
the weeks spent wandering through the forest with her five
children, and her daughter lost when a burst of gunfire sent the
family running in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart has no rest at all,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Plane Sinks in Ice Near North Pole  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Five people aboard a Russian-designed
biplane were stranded Monday when the plane landed near the North
Pole and sank through the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Center in Juneau was alerted
shortly before 11 a.m. that the group needed help, said Lt. Kevin
Dunn, who was helping arrange a rescue with Canadian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone aboard was able to get off safely and had enough gear
to camp out on the ice for about a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are stuck at the North Pole. They have survival equipment
and they're OK,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   The group was stranded about a mile from the North Pole on the
North American side. Dunn said it was near zero at the site and a
rescue flight was expected to take about nine hours.
</P>
<P>
   The five aboard the An-2 biplane were traveling with a
single-engine Cessna 185, with two people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The planes left Anchorage last Monday and stopped in Fairbanks
before heading to the North Pole. They arrived Thursday and spent
about an hour on the ice, before setting off for Spitsbergen,
Norway. They spent three nights in Spitsbergen before heading back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't claim to be on a scientific expedition,'' said Lee
Wareham, the Cessna pilot. ''We just felt like going to the North
Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Wareham was able to land his small plane and take off again
before the ice began breaking up. The larger plane couldn't get
turned around in time for takeoff before it began sinking. Wareham
and his passenger, Walt Parker of Anchorage, then flew on to
Deadhorse.
</P>
<P>
   Wareham was interviewed via a ham radio operator.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is fine,'' he said. ''The airplane is slowly
sinking. The ice is breaking up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wareham was relieved when told a rescue plane had been
dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good guys are on the way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wareham's initial call for help was to a ham radio operator in
Fairbanks who alerted the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center in
Anchorage, who called the Coast Guard's Command Center in Juneau.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska Air National Guard was sending a plane to the scene
to help with communications. Parachutists were aboard if needed,
said guard spokeswoman Kerre Martineau.
</P>
<P>
   Wareham said this was not the group's first trip to the North
Pole. In 1998, the group successfully retraced a 1928 trans-Arctic
flight by Sir George Hubert Wilkins and Alaska pioneer aviator Ben
Eielson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We tried to go in 1997 and had some technical problems,''
Wareham said. The following year five planes made it to the North
Pole and last year one plane made it.
</P>
<P>
   The stranded were identified as Ron Sheardown, John Pletcher,
and Jim Bowden, all of Anchorage; Dick Rutan from Mojave, Calif.,
and Jan Haugsad of Norway. Rutan made history in December 1986 when
he completed a nine-day nonstop flight around the world without
refueling.

Halt To Anthrax Program Sought
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen should bring an
"immediate halt" to the anthrax vaccination program, according to a letter
signed by more than two-dozen House members to be released today. The letter
written by Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., points to several recent findings and
criticisms about the program to inoculate all 2.4 million American military
personnel against anthrax as protection against biological warfare. The letter
concludes that the program, "is a flawed policy that should be immediately
stopped" until the military complies with the Feb. 17 recommendations of a House
panel, which also was critical of the program.

first-round vote. Peru came to the brink of political turmoil a month ago when
supporters of candidate Alejandro Toledo took to the streets by the tens of

was averted three days after the April 9 vote when, amid intense international

<HEADLINE> Halt To Anthrax Program Sought  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen should bring
an ''immediate halt'' to the anthrax vaccination program, according
to a letter signed by more than two-dozen House members to be
released today.
</P>
<P>
   The letter written by Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., points to
several recent findings and criticisms about the program to
inoculate all 2.4 million American military personnel against
anthrax as protection against biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The letter concludes that the program, ''is a flawed policy that
should be immediately stopped'' until the military complies with
the Feb. 17 recommendations of a House panel, which also was
critical of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf's office released a list of 27 other House members who
have agreed to sign the letter and said more names could be added
before the document is released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Names on the list included Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.,
Martin Frost, D-Texas, Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.,
and Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee's national security
subcommittee said in the Feb. 17 report that the anthrax program
should be suspended until the Defense Department obtains approval
for an improved vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the report from the House panel, Metcalf cites other
reasons for discontinuing the vaccine, including:
</P>
<P>
   --An Institute of Medicine report on March 30 that said, ''There
is a paucity of published peer-reviewed literature on the safety of
anthrax vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   --A March internal legal memorandum by two Air Force Reserve
judge advocates stating that service members should be able to
refuse the vaccine because anthrax should be considered an
investigational new drug.
</P>
<P>
   --The Defense Department inspector general's report on March 22
which Metcalf said documents troubling financial management
practices and multiple deficiencies that continue to compromise the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The military position is that many of the factors cited by
Metcalf were taken out of context -- that, for example, the legal
memorandum he cites was never tested in a court and would have been
easily knocked down by military lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Cohen ordered all active duty and reserve troops to get
the shots, starting with soldiers most likely to encounter
biological warfare overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as
soldiers have expressed concerns about taking the six-shot regimen.
Complaints included fevers, muscle pain and dizziness. Reserve and
National Guard pilots have said that morale was plummeting and
colleagues would resign rather than take the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon and Food and Drug Administration officials have
said repeatedly the vaccine is safe and effective. FDA officials
also say there is no basis for demoting the approved vaccine to an
investigational drug category.
</P>
<P>
   The military has immunized 570,000 people in two years
representing 1.6 million immunizations. About 703 people have filed
an ''adverse event report,'' meaning they cited some problem or
reaction after the shots, the military said.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Federal Rape Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL TOLME
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- A Supreme Court ruling barring victims
of rape and other ''gender motivated'' attacks from suing their
assailants in federal court will hurt efforts by Congress to
protect women, advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 ruling Monday, the court said rape victims cannot sue
their attackers under the U.S. Violence Against Women Act. It is up
to states rather than Congress to help women victimized by
violence, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider this to be a severe blow for women's rights because
of the chilling effect it will have on Congress,'' said Kathy
Rodgers of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which
represented former Virginia Tech student Christy Brzonkala.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress identified a kind of gender discrimination,'' Rodgers
said. ''Congress is trying to address that with a creative,
specific solution and the court says, 'No, you can't do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   The justices barred a federal lawsuit filed by Brzonkala against
two football players she says raped her in a dormitory room.
Brzonkala has allowed her name to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly
national and what is truly local,'' Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Rosman, who argued the case on behalf of the
two men sued by Brzonkala, called the ruling ''a very good day for
the Constitution and the rule of law.'' People who allege they are
victims of gender-based violence ''have perfectly good remedies in
state court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether Brzonkala planned to pursue
a lawsuit in state court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her plans are not mapped out right now,'' said Brzonkala's
attorney, Eileen Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Student athletes Antonio Morrison and James Crawford were
accused of assaulting Brzonkala in September 1994, but neither was
charged. Nevertheless, many people assumed Morrison was guilty,
said his lawyer, David Paxton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really has damaged him in ways people have only now been
able to appreciate,'' Paxton said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices rejected arguments by Brzonkala's lawyer and the
Clinton administration that the law was needed because states are
not doing enough to protect rape victims, and because gender-based
violence restricts women's choices in jobs and travel.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Congress may regulate gender-motivated violence, it would
be able to regulate murder or any other type of violence,''
Rehnquist noted.
</P>
<P>
   The decision followed the Supreme Court's 1995 ruling that
struck down as unconstitutional a law that made it a federal crime
to possess a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. The justices said
gun possession was not sufficiently linked to interstate commerce
and that the law usurped state authority over such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the sponsor of the Violence Against
Women Act, said the court ''really went off here in a way that I
find extremely troublesome.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton issued a statement saying
he was ''deeply disappointed'' that victims may no longer sue in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because I continue to believe that there should be remedies
for victims of gender-motivated violence, we plan to study the
Supreme Court's decision ... to determine the best means to help
these victims,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, the same
majority in a number of 5-4 decisions that boosted states' rights
vs. those of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Souter cited data
collected by Congress ''showing the effects of violence against
women on interstate commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight state attorneys general supported the right to sue
in federal court, Souter noted.

<HEADLINE> Drug May Ease Some Hot Flashes  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Postmenopausal women whose hot flashes are
caused by the breast cancer medication tamoxifen may find some
relief in a drug normally used to treat high blood pressure,
researchers suggested today.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 194 women taking tamoxifen, researchers at the
University of Rochester Cancer Center found that the drug clonidine
had a ''small beneficial effect'' in reducing the frequency,
duration and severity of hot flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Hot flashes -- sudden spikes in temperature that cause sweating
and dizziness -- are the most common side effect of tamoxifen, the
treatment of choice for women whose breast cancer tumors are fueled
by estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of women take estrogen and other hormones to ease hot
flashes brought on by menopause. But doctors are reluctant to
prescribe estrogen in conjunction with tamoxifen.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of concern among oncologists that combining two
hormones can cause inadvertent side effects. Blood clotting is the
most dreaded one,'' said Dr. Kishan Pandya, who led the study,
published in today's Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Women taking clonidine suffered a median of 2.2 fewer hot
flashes per day, according to the study. Women who received a
placebo reported a median of 1.2 fewer hot flashes per day over the
course of the eight-week study.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aikin, director of the clinical coordinating center at
the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project in
Pittsburgh, said patients have had some success with clonidine. But
the drug's side effects include dry mouth and low blood pressure.

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Taylor Honored by Queen  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Unlike Mrs., this is a title to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in an embroidered frock coat and sitting in a wheelchair,
British-born actress Elizabeth Taylor went to Buckingham Palace
today to be made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British
Empire, the female equivalent of a knight.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II presented Taylor with the award for services
to the entertainment industry and to charity, including her
prodigious fund raising for AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the much-married star -- who uncharacteristically
arrived on time -- said she wished her former husband, the late
Richard Burton, could have been there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to Buckingham Palace once before, years ago, with
Richard, when he received the OBE,'' she said, referring to his
elevation to Officer of the Order of the British Empire ''I miss
him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Today doesn't compare to anything else that's happened to me
in my life,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a heavy pearl necklace and pearl and diamond
earrings, the actress wore one of the large diamond rings lavished
on her by Burton, who died in 1984. The couple married and divorced
twice between 1964 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 68, was allowed to use a palace side entrance, where an
elevator carried her wheelchair up to the ballroom ceremony. But
she stood to receive the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who has broken her back three times, frequently uses a
wheelchair to get around. She has also been bothered in recent
years by other health problems, including hip surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was born in London in 1932 to American parents, art
dealers from St. Louis who had lived in Britain for some time. When
World War II broke out in 1939, they relocated to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the queen also made a dame of Taylor's fellow actress,
Julie Andrews, 64.
</P>
<P>
   The star of ''Mary Poppins'' and ''The Sound of Music'' called
it ''the greatest honor of my life,'' adding, ''I didn't think I
was eligible as I've lived in America for such a long time, but
I've always felt I've taken my Britishness with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Taylor, Andrews -- who is married to American movie director
Blake Edwards -- spends most of her time in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's first movie appearance was in 1942, at the age of 10,
in ''There's One Born Every Minute.''
</P>
<P>
   She was nominated for Academy Awards for ''Raintree Country''
(1955); ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' (1958) and ''Suddenly, Last
Summer'' (1959), and won her first for ''Butterfield 8'' in 1960.
She won a second Oscar in 1966 for ''Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?''
</P>
<P>
   More British honors await her.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, she will receive a British Film Institute fellowship,
the equivalent of a lifetime achievement award. Two days later, a
celebration of her life and work will be staged at the Royal Albert
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition devoted to Taylor opens at the National Portrait
Gallery on Thursday, and continues through June 16.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs First Fetal Oxygen Monitor  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Obstetricians are about to get the first fetal
monitor to measure the oxygen level inside an unborn baby's blood
during labor. This breakthrough device promises to help doctors
determine which babies really are in distress and may need to be
delivered by Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the OxiFirst system
Monday, calling it the first major technological development in
fetal monitoring in some 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long used devices called pulse oximeters that
measure oxygen saturation in the blood of children and adults. But
the proper oxygen level of a fetus was something of a mystery, and
there have been no devices that could try to measure it.
</P>
<P>
   During labor, monitors that measure fetal heart rate and the
mother's uterine contractions are routinely used.
</P>
<P>
   But just because a fetal heart rate looks a little slow doesn't
always mean a baby is in trouble, explained Dr. Diane Mitchell, an
FDA gynecologist in charge of the OxiFirst approval. Doctors
routinely struggle to determine when a so-called ''non-reassuring''
fetal heart rate is due to lack of oxygen and thus requires an
immediate C-section, or when it's not a problem and the mother
should continue trying to deliver normally.
</P>
<P>
   The OxiFirst, like other pulse oximeters, works by measuring
light waves passing through the skin. But it was developed to use
different wavelengths necessary to capture oxygen levels in a
fetus; it turns out that normal fetal oxygen saturation is lower
than the level needed even by a newborn.
</P>
<P>
   Once the mother's water breaks during labor, the sensor is
threaded up into the uterus and placed against the fetus' temple or
cheek. A cable connects it to a monitor where doctors read the
oxygen levels.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturer Mallinckrodt/Nellcor Inc. studied 1,000 women, half
of whom had standard monitoring during labor and the other half had
OxiFirst added to standard monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of C-sections because of that ''nonreassuring fetal
heart rate'' was 10 percent among women who got standard monitoring
-- but only 5 percent among women given the extra OxiFirst
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't prove OxiFirst prevents C-sections, the FDA
cautioned. For reasons scientists cannot explain, Caesareans
credited to the mother's ''difficult labor'' actually increased in
the OxiFirst group. Thus, when overall C-sections were tallied,
roughly 26 percent of women had Caesareans regardless of OxiFirst.
</P>
<P>
   To clear up the confusion, Mallinckrodt has agreed to study all
C-sections in hospitals that buy the new monitors, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a lot -- up to one-fourth of the nation's 4 million
annual births involve that puzzling fetal heart rate at some point
during labor.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasanton, Calif.-based Mallinckrodt will begin taking hospital
orders for the $11,000 OxiFirst monitors Thursday.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors used a benign inflation report as
cause for an early celebration today, sending stocks higher hours
before the Federal Reserve was due to announce its decision on
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 88.76 at 10,896.54.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 91.50 at 3,699.15, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 1,464.33.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Labor Department reported that consumer
prices, after rising sharply for two straight months, held steady
in April as energy prices posted their first decline in almost a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The report raised hopes that the Fed will not have to raise
interest rates sharply throughout the rest of this year. Central
bankers were meeting in Washington today, and were widely expected
to boost rates for the sixth time since last June to cool the
economy enough to hold inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The flat reading in the Consumer Price Index, the most closely
watched inflation gauge, allowed investors to believe that a rate
increase today could be the last for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the market's gains today. Hewlett-Packard
rose 6| to 136, leading the Dow.

   Lycos, which is expected to be acquired by Spain's Terra
Networks SA, rose 13 15/16 to 75 9/16.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Military May Get Drug Coverage  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton supports legislation to
extend prescription drug coverage to all military retirees, the
White House said today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was appearing in the Rose Garden to announce support for
a bipartisan House defense committee plan to include the coverage
for the approximately 1.4 million retirees over age 65 who are not
already covered. Retirees under 65 already get the benefit, which
helps subsidize the cost of prescription medication.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an effort to spur some action on broader reform in
Medicare to provide prescription drug coverage,'' said White House
spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been pressing the GOP-led Congress to pass universal
prescription drug coverage, arguing that the cost of drugs is far
too high for many elderly people on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Uninsured elderly buy a third less drugs than those whose
purchases are reimbursed, but pay nearly twice as much out of
pocket, the White House said.

   Republicans in Congress favor a more limited drug benefit that
would help only the neediest elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The House Armed Services Committee recommended extending
coverage as part of the defense spending bill sent to the House
last week. The House is scheduled to vote Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am particularly pleased with the committee's comprehensive
package of military health care reforms that will lead to
significant improvements in access to quality health care by all
military beneficiaries, including over-65 military retirees,''
committee Chairman Floyd Spence, R-S.C., said in a statement last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would allow retirees to purchase drugs through a
mail-order program run by the Pentagon. Retirees over age 65 would
pay $8 toward a 90-day prescription, as younger Defense Department
retirees already do.
</P>
<P>
   The provision also would allow all Medicare-eligible retirees to
buy drugs at local pharmacies. Retirees would pay 20 percent of the
cost of drugs at a Pentagon-affiliated pharmacy, or 25 at an
unaffiliated store.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 136; Nasdaq Up 103  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors used a benign inflation report as
cause for an early celebration today, sending stocks higher hours
before the Federal Reserve was due to announce its decision on
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 136.39 at 10,944.17.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 103.42 at 3,711.07, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 14.72 at 1,467.08.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose after the Labor Department reported that consumer
prices, after rising sharply for two straight months, held steady
in April as energy prices posted their first decline in almost a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The report raised hopes that the Fed will not have to raise
interest rates sharply throughout the rest of this year. Central
bankers were meeting in Washington today, and were widely expected
to boost rates for the sixth time since last June to cool the
economy enough to hold inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The flat reading in the Consumer Price Index, the most closely
watched inflation gauge, allowed investors to believe that a rate
increase today could be the last for a while. Analysts were less
sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inflation went back into dormancy in April,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. Steinberg believes
that inflation will remain subdued, but he still called for a
half-percentage point increase today and a quarter-percentage point
increase at the Fed's next meeting on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks led the market's gains today. Hewlett-Packard
rose 8 9/16 to 137 15/16, leading the Dow. Also, IBM rose 3 9/16 to
107} and Intel rose 2} to 120~.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, which is expected to be acquired by Spain's Terra
Networks SA, rose 12| to 74\.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, beverage bottler Coca-Cola
Enterprises fell 7 11/16 to 14~ after warning that earnings this
year should be lower because of unit volume weakness in certain
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, U.S. investors got a lesson in bargain-hunting from
Saudi billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal. Alwaleed, chairman of Kingdom
Holding Co. and a nephew of Saudi King Fahd, has acquired $1
billion worth of shares in Internet companies and blue chip
performers ranging from Amazon.com to McDonald's Corp. and Ford
Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   His company said in a statement Tuesday that the prince took
advantage of recent weakness in stock prices, making the bulk of
the purchases ''when the market corrected in mid-April.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 430.87 million
shares, well ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 8.20 at
506.01.

<HEADLINE> Census Targets Non-Respondents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly 40 percent of households that did not
mail back a census form have now been contacted at their doors by
census-takers, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after this latest phase of the once-a-decade census
started, enumerators have gathered information from 39 percent of
those homes that failed to return a form, Census director Kenneth
Prewitt said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   While the 39 percent figure is on target for where the Census
Bureau wants to be at, the most difficult cases are upcoming,
Prewitt said. Those cases include homes that received the
53-question long form, but chose not to fill it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seriously ahead of where we were in the 1990 census,''
Prewitt said. ''However, we're dealing with attitudes of
cooperation and patterns of resistance ... which make it more
difficult for this census than in 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Census Bureau's 14 regional offices, Denver has reached
53 percent of those homes that did not return a form, the highest
in the country. Chicago was the lowest at 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   About 42 million households failed to return a form, and the
Census Bureau will try to reach them by the time the current
10-week operations ends in early July.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt also said the bureau was in the midst of looking closer
at those census forms already mailed in to determine how completely
they were filled out. Some congressional Republicans said they had
suggested to constituents worried about the intrusiveness of census
questions to leave those questions unanswered.

<HEADLINE> Group Hails Military Child Care  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military's success in improving child care
for its families over the past decade offers lessons for making
civilian day care more available and affordable, a women's advocacy
group said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concerns that made investing in child care for the
military a high priority -- a desire for a stable work force and for
healthy child development -- apply equally outside the military,''
said Nancy Duff Campbell, co-president of the National Women's Law
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need the same commitment to get results in every state for
every child.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in the Pentagon, Campbell presented Defense
Secretary William Cohen with a copy of her organization's report on
what lessons the civilian world can learn from the military's child
care programs.
</P>
<P>
   The military provides day care for more than 200,000 children in
more than 300 locations. The programs are heavily subsidized by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the military system is now a model in several
respects, including its comprehensive standards for quality of
care; its training of care givers, and its more generous pay scale
for care givers.
</P>
<P>
   The military estimates that it meets about 58 percent of the
demand among military families for day care, and it has established
a timetable for raising that figure to 80 percent within five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The need is very desperate on the civilian side,'' Campbell
said. ''If we could even come close to serving 58 percent of
families, I think we'd be a lot happier.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the turnaround in the quality of child care in the
military began with Congress' 1989 passage of the Military Child
Care Act, which came after reports and hearings exposed serious
shortcomings.

<HEADLINE> Quiet Dinner with Woody and Ingmar  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France (AP) -- Imagine being at dinner with Woody Allen
and Ingmar Bergman. The wit. The intellect. The sparkling
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   No, says Liv Ullmann. The silence.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian actress-turned-director tells the story of how she
arranged a dinner at a New York restaurant years ago for the two
men, who'd never met.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were four of us,'' Ullmann told reporters. ''In truth, I
had not much to say to the other woman, but we talked anyway. About
the meatballs or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men, awe-struck at meeting, were silent.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she says, Bergman called and said, ''Oh, thank you, Liv.
What a genius!''
</P>
<P>
   Allen called too. ''Oh, thank you, Liv,'' he said. ''What a
genius!''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   You knew it had to be coming soon. And there it was, advertised
in a Cannes daily trade paper:
</P>
<P>
   ''Shooting now in a secret location: Elian, the Gonzalez Boy
Story. From Cuba to Miami ... And Back???''
</P>
<P>
   The film is being produced by Menahem Golan, who says he sent a
crew to Cuba to shoot footage in the streets before announcing his
film at Cannes. ''I didn't want to endanger the crew,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The ad for the movie shows three actors in the pose depicted by
the famous news photo of the armed raid that captured the world's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Golan plans to have the film ready by September.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Greg Kinnear is being very nice to reporters at the Cannes Film
Festival. Because he's been there.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, before his career as a talk show host and then actor
took off, Kinnear came to Cannes as a reporter for a small cable
entertainment outfit.
</P>
<P>
   His job was to ambush movie stars and ask them how it felt to be
at Cannes. Much the same question he's being asked now, as he makes
the rounds for his new film, ''Nurse Betty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember the look of fear on Anthony Quinn's face as I
lunged in front of him with my microphone,'' Kinnear said.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnear's living conditions during his reporting assignment were
quite different from what they've been at this year's festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't remember where it was, but it was way up in the hills
somewhere,'' he says. ''I remember it took me an hour to get there,
on my mo-ped.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''Nurse Betty,'' Kinnear, a past Oscar nominee for ''As Good
As It Gets,'' has fun with the double role of a soap opera actor
and his character, Dr. David Ravell. Some Cannes reviewers have
called it his best work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've gotta tell you, that makes me uncomfortable,'' Kinnear
said. ''Because I think (co-star) Chris Rock is right when he says,
if they're praising you now, it usually means they thought you were
pretty bad before.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   If you read film credits carefully, you may have heard of
Oscar-nominated film editor Roderick James, the magic hands behind
all of Joel and Ethan Coen's movies.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one thing: he's fictional.
</P>
<P>
   The Coen brothers, favorites at Cannes and back this year with
''O Brother, Where Art Thou,'' say they invented the name, because
they do their editing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many times on one movie can you write the names, Joel and
Ethan Coen?'' Joel said in an interview. ''It got tiring, so we
invented someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethan says it was problematic when Roderick was nominated for an
Oscar for ''Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't let you go up and accept on behalf of anybody else
now,'' he said. ''We asked ahead of time, but they weren't very
sympathetic. They weren't amused.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Roderick lost anyway.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress made plans Tuesday to
travel to Michigan's Upper Peninsula to attend the funeral of Rep.
Bart Stupak's 17-year-old son, who was found dead Sunday at his
family's home. He had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A chartered flight can take up to 58 people to Wednesday
evening's services for Bartholomew Stupak Jr., said Laura Sheehan,
spokeswoman for Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. The lawmakers and their
spouses were paying for their tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell and Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., who coordinated the trip,
expressed their condolences in House floor speeches Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The death of this bright, energetic young man has shocked and
saddened everyone close to this wonderfully loving family,''
Dingell said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the teen-ager attended his high school prom where
he was named to the prom court.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Stupak, D-Mich., issued a statement Tuesday offering thanks
for the support given to his family.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall After Fed Ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury bond prices gave up some early gains
today after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by
one-half a percentage point, the steepest increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Treasury's 10-year note, which had been rising
before the Fed acted, was down 3/32 point, or 93} cents per $1,000
in face value, at midafternoon, while its yield rose to 6.45
percent from 6.44 percent late Monday. Prices and yields move in
opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond was up [ point, giving up most of its early
gains, to yield 6.14 percent within minutes of the Fed's action,
down from 6.15 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed said it was increasing its target for the federal funds
rate -- the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans
-- from 6 percent to 6.50 percent, the highest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank also raised its mostly symbolic discount rate,
the interest that the Fed charges to make direct loans to banks, by
a half- point to 6 percent from 5.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement explaining its decision, the Fed said the rapidly
growing economy ''could foster inflationary imbalances that would
undermine the economy's outstanding performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 6.20 percent as the
discount fell 0.04 percentage point from Monday's auction to 6.03
percent at midafternoon. Six-month yields were 6.52 percent as the
discount fell 0.01 percentage point from the weekly auction to 6.24
percent. One-year yields were 6.36 percent as the discount rose
0.04 point from late Monday to 6.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Cut Gains After Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks clung to an early advance after the
Federal Reserve today announced its sixth interest-rate increase
since last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed raised interest rates by a half-percentage point, the
steepest increase in five years, saying the rapidly growing economy
''could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the
economy's outstanding performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors had widely expected the rate increase. While
market averages pared early gains, stocks held gains garnered this
morning when the government released a benign inflation report for
the month of April.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Fed's announcement, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 40.35 at 10,848.13.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 78.85 at 3,686.50, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 5.09 at 1,457.45.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Fed's announcement, the Dow had been up 134 points
and the Nasdaq was up 120 points.
</P>
<P>
   While interest rate worries have rattled the stock market in
recent weeks, investors bid stocks higher Monday and today on the
belief that a half-point increase would bring the Fed close to the
end of a long run of rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Early this morning, the Labor Department offered some evidence
that the five previous rate increases may be succeeding in holding
inflation at bay. The government's consumer price index, after
rising sharply for two straight months, held steady in April as
energy prices posted their first decline in almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   The report raised hopes that the Fed will not have to raise
interest rates sharply throughout the rest of this year. Analysts

Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. Steinberg believes
that inflation will remain subdued, but he believes today's
half-percentage point increase today will be followed by a
quarter-percentage point increase at the Fed's next meeting on June
28.

rose 4 5/16 to 138 5/16, leading the Dow. Also, IBM rose 2 11/16 to

Claudia J. Kennedy's accusation of sexual harassment against a

<HEADLINE> Newman Urges Land Preservation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTON, Conn. (AP) -- Paul Newman is urging his neighbors in
Connecticut to be ''loud and noisy and disagreeable'' in the name
of land preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot look back 50 years from now and find out that this
great heritage of open space has been lost because we didn't take
action,'' the actor said Monday at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must continuously jump up and down and pound on car
roofs,'' Newman said. ''Make your voices heard -- loud and noisy and
disagreeable -- so that you won't be lulled into complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of conservationists, politicians and private
citizens has formed to protect land in western Connecticut owned by
a water company. The group says preservation of nearly 18,000
watershed acres in 28 communities is vital to ensure the region's
water standards and quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Newman lives in Westport.

<HEADLINE> Rowland to seek help on handling Indian issues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- With more state Indian tribes seeking
federal recognition -- and possibly gambling casinos -- Gov. John G.
Rowland said he needs expert help to handle Indian issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm incapable at this juncture of understanding all the
complications of compacts and all the legal aspects of land
claims,'' Rowland said in an interview with The Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm trying to do is get some experts involved that
understand these issues because it's very complicated. It's not
your average run-of-the-mill legal education. You've got to find
people with expertise and knowledge of these issues,'' Rowland
said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Bureau of Indian Affairs has given preliminary
approval to federal recognition for the Eastern Pequot and
Paucatuck Eastern Pequot tribes, either as a single entity or
individually.
</P>
<P>
   Two additional state-recognized tribes, the Golden Hill
Paugussetts and the Schaghticokes, have also submitted petitions to
the BIA.
</P>
<P>
   If any of the tribes gets official recognition, the tribes would
be eligible to open a casino in Connecticut after negotiations with
the state.
</P>
<P>
   If a new tribe enters the casino arena, it also would force the
governor to renegotiate the state's gaming compact with the Mohegan
and Mashantucket Pequot tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Under agreements with those tribes, the state gets 25 percent of
the slot machine revenues at Foxwoods Resort Casino and the Mohegan
Sun -- about $300 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''A couple years ago it was easy for the state to negotiate with
one tribe for one compact: You get rid of the land claims, give us
25 cents on the dollar, we'll all live together happily. Now it's
much more complicated,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   A bill before the Legislature this year would have created a new
Office of State Tribal Relations within the governor's office. The
bill gained Senate approval, but died when the House of
Representatives did not vote on the bill.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Attending NY Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton threw out his schedule
Tuesday to fly to New York to be on hand as the State Democratic
Party was to nominate his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as its
candidate for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just decided I ought to be there,'' Clinton said. ''It's a
big deal for her, a big night for her and I want to be there with
her. I just want to be there to support her.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was not a registered voter in New York yet. In
fact, he said he voted in a school board election in Arkansas just
a few days ago. ''For me, it's hard, you know, on a personal
basis'' to change his voting registration to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this is a commitment we made together, something that she
wanted to do and a lot of people in New York wanted her to do,'' he
said. ''And I want to support her in every way I can. And I
certainly intend to vote for her. Since I'm a taxpaying resident of
New York now, I'm entitled to vote and I intend to take advantage
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to fly to Albany later in the afternoon. He was to
have been in Washington to address the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, and later was to have traveled to his
home in Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the convention would be the setting for retiring
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's ''farewell address'' to the people
of New York. ''I'd like to hear what he has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear who Mrs. Clinton's opponent will be.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, is hinting
that he's going to stay in the Senate race against Mrs. Clinton. In
recent weeks, the 55-year-old Giuliani has disclosed that he has
treatable prostate cancer and that he is seeking a legal separation
from his wife, TV personality and actress Donna Hanover.

   But J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported sharply lower profits before
charges amid trouble at its department stores. Nonetheless, its
results beat Wall Street estmates.
</P>
<P>
   Target Corp.'s earnings topped expectations, fueled by strong
demand at its discount stores. Tiffany &AMP; Co.'s results also were
ahead of Wall Street's estimates as shoppers bought fine jewelry
and china at the upscale chain.
</P>
<P>
   A strong housing market boosted The Home Depot's profits, as
shoppers bought supplies to renovate their homes.
J.C. Penney Co. Inc.:
</P>
<P>
   The Plano, Texas-based retailer said that its profits from
operations were $82 million, or 28 cents a share, for the quarter
ended April 29, compared with earnings of $167 million, or 67 cents
a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Its results came in ahead of Wall Street analysts' expectations
of 23 cents a share. But its stock was down 25 cents at $18.50 in
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The operating profits did not include costs associated with the
closure of about 40 Penney and 289 Eckerd stores. Including those
and other special charges, the company lost $118 million, or 48
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose to $7.7 billion from $7.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings slide comes as the retailer struggles to get its
business back on track. Penney has closed many underperforming
stores, sold some non-core businesses, overhauled merchandise
buying and hired more outside executives.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have criticized the retailer for reacting slowly to
competition from trendier competitors, including Kohl's and Old
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, its top executive, James Oesterreicher, recently
announced that he would leave the company by the end of the year.
No successor has been named.
</P>
<P>
   Penney said today sales at department stores open at least a
year fell 3.1 percent. Catalog sales declined 0.5 percent, but the
weakness was somewhat offset by strength in its Internet business,
with sales climbing nearly eight times from a year ago to $47
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't expect a meaningful pickup in sales ... until the
first quarter of 2001,'' chief operating officer Vanessa Castagna
said during a conference call with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at Eckerd drugstores were up 9.4 percent. Nonetheless, the
company said it had expected to do better, blaming disappointing
sales partly on a mild flu season and tougher prescription-drug
cost controls by managed-care insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   Penney operates about 1,183 department stores in the United
States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil. Eckerd Drugstores operates
over 2,600 U.S. drugstores.
Target Corp.:
</P>
<P>
   The Minneapolis-based retailer earned $239 million, or 52 cents
a share, in the latest quarter compared with $194 million, or 41
cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates of 49 cents a
share. The company's stock was up 50 cents at $71.50 in afternoon
trading on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 8 percent to $7.61 billion, from $7.03 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at its Target discount stores open at least a year, an
industry gauge of performance, increased 4.7 percent, while
comparable-store sales for the department stores dropped 4.9
percent and for Mervyn's were down 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we look at our business, we are very disappointed,'' said
Linda Ahlers, president of the department stores division, who said
the drop in sales was partly due to declining demand for Tommy
Hilfiger and other brands as well as merchandise markdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Performance by the department stores is expected to improve in
the second quarter but a strong comeback isn't expected until the
second half of 2000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Target, which changed its name this year from Dayton Hudson
Corp., operates 1,252 stores in 45 states. This includes 921 Target
stores, 267 Mervyn's stores and 64 department stores.
The Home Depot:
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement retailer earned $629 million, or 27 cents
per share, for the quarter ended April 30, compared with $489
million or 21 cents per share for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales were $11.1 billion, up 24 percent from $8.95 billion last
year. Sales at stores open at least a year, an industry gauge of
performance, rose 7 percent from a year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's resulted met Wall Street analysts' estimates for
the quarter. But Home Depot's shares fell $2.62{ at $53.87{ in
afternoon trading on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot's stock has fallen this year amid
concerns that rising interest rates will cause a decline in home
sales. But its business remains strong. Many people who are buying
new homes or renovating old ones turn to Home Depot for everything
from paint to bathroom tile to hammers.
</P>
<P>
   The average sale per transaction rose 3 percent in the quarter
rose to $49.53 from $47.97 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot opened 41 new stores during the first quarter,
bringing its total number of stores to 971. The company operates
stores under the names The Home Depot, EXPO Design Centers and
Villager's Hardware.
Tiffany &AMP; Co.:
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based retailer earned $30.43 million, or 40 cents a
share, in the quarter ended April 30, compared with $16.16 million,
or 22 cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates of 37 cents a
share. Tiffany's stock was up 18.75 cents at $75.37{ in afternoon
trading on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter were $343.25 million, up from $272.28
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's results benefited from strength at its U.S. stores,
where sales climbed 28 percent. Sales at stores open at least a
year, an industry gauge of performance, soared 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales overseas were also strong, climbing 26 percent. Gains were
especially big in Japan, Tiffany's largest international market.
</P>
<P>
   Its direct-marketing business, which includes corporate, catalog
and Internet sales, rose 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Prepare New Canyoning Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- The Swiss government announced Tuesday
that new safety guidelines for the river sport of canyoning would
be ready by summer following an accident last year that killed 21
people.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules are not law and will be subject to revision, the
Sports Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after a fatal accident in Switzerland in
another ''extreme sport'' -- the death of 22-year-old American
Matthew Coleman, killed Saturday when he slammed into the ground
during a bungee jump.
</P>
<P>
   Because guides attached Coleman to an elastic rope too long for
the distance he jumped, his death renewed pressure on Swiss
authorities to tighten controls on largely unregulated ''extreme
sports'' that attract young tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said the canyoning guidelines cover training of
guides, the size of groups, the number of guides, security and
insurance requirements. A label will be developed for companies
that conform with the guidelines, and firms that sign up will be
listed on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines ''will be constantly adjusted and put into final
form in 2002 on the basis of the first two years' experience,'' the
sports ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen tourists and three guides, all aged between 18 and 31
and most of them Australian, were killed in last July's accident
near Interlaken in central Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss authorities are investigating 11 people involved with the
organization of the trip on suspicion of negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   A group of relatives of the victims met Tuesday in Interlaken
with Swiss officials, representatives of tourism organizations and
adventure sport firms to discuss measures to improve security.
</P>
<P>
   Canyoning involves sliding, jumping and rappelling down ravines
and into rivers without a raft. Other extreme sports popular with
visitors to Switzerland include whitewater rafting, paragliding,
snow biking and ice climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz Keller, director of the sports ministry, said Monday that
officials plan to examine whether new laws are needed for extreme
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman had been tied to a longer elastic rope than the one
intended for the distance he was jumping. The jump was organized by
Adventure World, the same firm that conducted the fatal canyoning
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The two guides who supervised the jump from a gondola on a cable
car are being investigated on suspicion of negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   The firm issued a brief statement Saturday saying it had stopped
all activities immediately because of the bungee accident.
</P>
<P>
   Following last year's disaster, Adventure World was among the
companies that joined the newly formed Swiss Outdoor Association,
which is putting in place a standard training program for canyoning
guides.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Pushes for Euro Adoption  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A cafe-goer buying Turkish-style coffee in
Sarajevo's old town already pays with notes that correspond in
value to the German mark instead of the local currency.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the top international official in Bosnia proposed
formalizing that monetary link to powerful Western neighbors by
making the euro southeastern Europe's official currency when it is
circulated in 2002 in 11 nations, including Germany, France and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Petritsch is promoting a so-called ''eurozone,''
encompassing areas beyond the 11 euro nations where the currency
will be officially adopted, as a way to promote integration of the
war-weary Balkans. European nations have already taken a first step
with last year's Stability Pact, meant to funnel much-needed
development money to the most needy nations in an attempt to anchor
democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Petritsch pointed out that along with Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Montenegro also uses the mark as a parallel currency, and U.N.
administrators in Kosova have also established the mark as means of
payment.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens in countries across southeast Europe also rely on marks
to protect savings from often wildly inflated local currency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The official use of the euro as a payment method would be
attached to hopes, for example the erection of a modern banking
system free from political party intervention or the
depoliticization of the economy,'' Petritsch told the German
Foreign Policy Society.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the same time, the eurozone would lead to an economic
rapprochement of the countries between themselves and with
Europe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Petritsch said his idea for a eurozone is still in the
preliminary stages, and emphasized that most southeastern European
economies are still far from stable enough to officially join the
monetary union.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 101; Nasdaq Up 63  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   l NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks held onto early gains today after the
Federal Reserve announced its sixth interest-rate increase since
last June. Investors grew wary, however, as central bankers said
they remained concerned about inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed raised interest rates by a half-percentage point, the
steepest increase in five years, saying the rapidly growing economy
''could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the
economy's outstanding performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors had widely expected the rate increase, but trading
became more volatile after the Fed's decision. Still, most
investors appeared willing to stay in the market and carve out new
positions.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 101.78 at 10,909.56.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 63.77 at 3,671.42, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 8.69 at 1,461.05.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Fed's announcement, the Dow had been up 134 points
and the Nasdaq was up 120 points.
</P>
<P>
   While interest rate worries have rattled the stock market in
recent weeks, investors bid stocks higher Monday and today on the
belief that a half-point increase would bring the Fed close to the
end of a long run of rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Early this morning, the Labor Department offered some evidence
that the five previous rate increases may be succeeding in holding
inflation down. The government's consumer price index, after rising
sharply for two straight months, held steady in April as energy
prices posted their first decline in almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   The report raised hopes on Wall Street that the Fed will not
have to raise rates sharply throughout the rest of this year.
Analysts were less sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fed was on the verge of falling behind the curve,'' said
Chris Conkey, chief investment officer at Evergreen Investment
Management in Boston. ''This is a great step in terms of getting
ahead of the curve, but we foresee more increases later this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks remained in a slump after the Fed's
announcement. American Express fell { to 51 11/16 and Citigroup
fell ~ 62.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, which can see profits falter if higher interest
rates dissuade Americans from buying or renovating homes, fell 3|
to 52 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, investors embraced technology stocks. Hewlett-Packard
rose 8\ to 137|, leading the Dow. Also, IBM rose 1 13/16 to 106 and
Intel rose 2| to 120}.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, which is expected to be acquired by Spain's Terra
Networks SA, rose 12| to 74\.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, beverage bottler Coca-Cola
Enterprises fell 7[ to 15 7/16 after warning that earnings this
year should be lower because of unit volume weakness in certain
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market drew some additional strength from Goldman
Sachs &AMP; Co. chief investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen today.
Cohen told an Economic Strategy Institute conference she
anticipates ''good returns, not necessarily abnormally large
returns'' from the stock market this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Saudi billionaire prince Alwaleed bin Talal provided
a lesson in bargain-hunting, revealing that he has has acquired $1
billion worth of shares in Internet companies and blue chip
performers ranging from Amazon.com to McDonald's Corp. and Ford
Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   His company said in a statement that Alwaleed took advantage of
recent weakness in stock prices, making the bulk of the purchases
''when the market corrected in mid-April.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
NYSE, where volume came to 759.38 million shares, well ahead of
Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 4.39 at
502.20.

<HEADLINE> End to Genocide in Sudan Sought  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The conflict in Sudan appears to be worsening
and neither the United States nor the international community has
any plan to deal with it, a religious rights panel told Congress
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Sudan ''the world's most violent abuser'' of religious
rights, Nina Shea of the U.S. Commission on International Religious
Freedom urged the U.S. government to again pressure Sudan on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The commission earlier this month recommended that the U.S.
tighten sanctions against Sudan and give direct, nonlethal aid to
Khartoum's opposition if no improvements occur in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the Muslim government in the North has not prevailed
in the 17-year-old war with animist and Christian southerners
partly because it had limited money to spend on the military. But
''windfall profits'' from an oil venture opened last summer will
change that, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proceeds from the oil revenues will be used to support
Sudanese military's actions and the human tragedy in Sudan is
likely to become worse,'' Shea told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is ample evidence that this is already happening,'' she
said, pointing to a government bombing campaign started in February
against relief centers, churches and other civilian property.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither the international community nor the United State has
any plan to address the mounting tragedy in Sudan,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said the government is carrying out ''genocidal practices
against its religious and ethnic minorities'' including massacres,
slavery, forcible religious conversions ''and it's most lethal
tactic ... calculated starvation.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy from
the North. Nearly 2 million people have died from the fighting and
related famines.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the religious rights commission released its
report this month, Khartoum denied it discriminates against its
Christian minority, saying some Muslim groups have criticized it
for being too tolerant.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Minister: OPEC Hike Unlikely  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi
said Tuesday that he sees no need to increase production when the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets June 21 in
Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers we looked at during the recent meeting in Mexico
with the Mexican and Venezuelan oil ministers indicate that it's
not necessary at the moment to increase production,'' Naimi told
reporters on the sidelines of an environmental conference.
</P>
<P>
   The three oil ministers met in Mexico City a week ago and issued
a joint statement reflecting Naimi's comments.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, United Arab Emirates oil minister Obaid bin Saif
al-Nasseri said the United States has again asked OPEC to increase
oil production during its Vienna meeting, but said his country was
satisfied with current price levels.
</P>
<P>
   Naimi said the price band mechanism agreed to at an OPEC meeting
in March will trigger any necessary changes in output.
</P>
<P>
   As well as agreeing to raise production by 1.7 million barrels a
day, OPEC agreed in the March meeting to boost or lower output by
500,000 barrels a day if the average OPEC crude oil price index
over a 20-day period slipped outside a band of $22-28 a barrel.
''The price at the moment is in the middle (of that range),'' Naimi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Naimi said compliance with the March OPEC deal has been good,
standing above 85 percent, according to estimates.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. oil prices peaked on March 8 at $34.37 per barrel in
advance of the last OPEC meeting, triple what the price was just a
year earlier when OPEC slashed production.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June
contract for West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 19 cents to
close at $29.73 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   But that was still up from its closing level of $26.45 a barrel
on March 29 when OPEC agreed to boost production.

<HEADLINE> UPI Journalist Helen Thomas Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Helen Thomas, United Press International's
White House correspondent for nearly 40 years, resigned Tuesday as
the news agency's ownership turned over to the parent company of
The Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not intend to stay,'' Thomas said in a statement.
''United Press International is a great news agency. It has made a
remarkable mark in the annals of American journalism and has left a
superb legacy for future journalists. I wish the new owners all the
best, great stories, and happy landings.''
</P>
<P>
   UPI was sold Monday to News World Communications Inc. by
Worldwide News Inc., a consortium of Saudi Arabian investors that
had bought it in 1992 for about $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   UPI Chief Executive Officer Arnaud de Borchgrave initially said
Thomas, 79, would remain with the company. ''She told me 48 hours
ago that if I stayed, she was staying,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   De Borchgrave could not be immediately reached for comment
today. UPI reported on its wire that Thomas resigned after 57 years
of service -- more than half of UPI's 93 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has been a fixture at the White House since the Kennedy
administration. Considered the dean of the White House press corps,
she is known for her terse, tough questioning of presidents and
press secretaries alike.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, at a White House announcement concerning
Medicare and prescription drugs for veterans, saluted the retiring
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ''Presidents come and go, but Helen's been here for 40 years
now, covering eight presidents and doubtless showing the ropes to
countless young reporters and, I might add, more than a few press
secretaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever she decides to do, I'll feel a little better about my
country if I know she'll still be spending some time around here at
the White House. After all, without her saying, 'Thank you, Mr.
President,' at least some of us might never have ended our news
conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the
briefings he conducts ''will not be the same without Helen sitting
in the UPI chair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know she's been there for longer than I've been alive and
knows more than I'll ever know about this business, about this
building, about this town,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas portrayed herself in the film ''The American President,''
and a few weeks ago, made a cameo appearance in President Clinton's
video spoof of his lame duck days in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In that video, Thomas was the lone reporter in the abandoned
White House briefing room, snoozing in the front row as Clinton
made a statement. When Clinton called for questions, Thomas snapped
awake and quipped: ''Are you still here?''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, Thomas was born in
Lexington, Ky., in 1920. She received a bachelor's degree in
English from Wayne University, now called Wayne State University,
in 1942 and relocated to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   She was hired by United Press in 1943 as a writer for the local
radio wire, earning $24 a week. In 1956, Thomas was promoted to
covering the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Thomas was sent to cover John F. Kennedy's
post-election family vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., and remained on
the White House beat afterward to cover first lady Jacqueline
Kennedy. She was named UPI's chief White House correspondent in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   UPI's sale was the latest in a series of changes of ownership of
the wire service.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, News World Communications gets all the major
assets of UPI including its name and trademark, de Borchgrave said.
He did not disclose the terms.
</P>
<P>
   News World Communications owns news outlets around the world and
was founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, leader of the Unification
Church. The company said it would develop UPI's new focus on
providing news to Internet sites and such services as video
streaming. It also plans to boost UPI's operation with new
technologies and distribution practices.
</P>
<P>
   UPI was sold in 1982 by the Scripps family. Before Monday's
sale, it went through two bankruptcy reorganizations and four
owners, the latest Worldwide News Inc.
</P>
<P>
   De Borchgrave served as editor in chief of The Washington Times
from 1985 to 1991. Before that, he was a senior editor at Newsweek
for 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Britain Loses Pension Benefits Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- A European court ruling Tuesday could
force British businesses to pay out billions of dollars in pension
payments to part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   The European Court of Justice upheld a claim that part-time
workers could backdate professional pensions to 1976, overturning a
British limit of two-years for retroactive affiliation in such
pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Based on 22 test cases, the ruling could affect up to 60,000
individuals who have challenged the British law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, Europe has shown itself to be on the side of
ordinary working people,'' said John Monks, general-secretary of
the Trades Union Congress
</P>
<P>
   ''Before today's ruling many of the part-time workers ... faced
a very uncertain future. Now, thanks to Europe, they can look
forward to a much more comfortable and secure retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Six trade unions launched legal action over six years ago on
behalf of part-time workers excluded from professional pension
plans. The unions won the right for part-timers to be included in
pension plans but legal arguments have dragged on over how far back
payments should be backdated.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Lords, Britain's highest legal authority, handed
the case to the European Union's supreme court in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Many British occupational pension plans excluded part-time
workers, even though a 1994 European ruling said they were entitled
to equal treatment under EU regulations. Tuesday's verdict confirms
that part-timers are entitled to claim equality of treatment for
pension rights as far back as 1976 when the EU legislation was
first introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Business representatives expressed concern over the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''What particularly worries me is that it is so retrospective.
We could be talking about businesses having to pay billions of
pounds as a result of this decision which is really serious,'' said
Ruth Lea, head of policy at the Institute of Directors.

<HEADLINE> Postmaster Sees Commercialization  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The future of the Postal Service in the
Internet era is littered with uncertainties that will eventually
make the agency more like a private company, Postmaster General
William Henderson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Postal Service ultimately will be
commercialized,'' Henderson told editors and reporters of The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no pressure on the agency to change now
because ''there is no crisis,'' he said. ''What has led to
privatizations around the world, or commercialization ... has been
some sort of a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service is a semi-independent part of the government
overseen by a nine-member board of governors. It is not subsidized
by tax money but is regulated and must provide universal service to
every home at a flat rate. Postal officials have long sought more
freedom to introduce new services and products and to have flexible
rates like private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The post office has made a profit for five straight years and is
recording record service performance, Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our customers are content, they don't see the future. And the
future, from my view, is filled with potential crises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he noted that the post office has annual revenues
of $63 billion, of which $17 billion is from carrying bills and
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bills and payments will eventually go electronic. It's not if
but when,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   He likened bills and payments to the anchor store of a shopping
mall, the main attraction of the mall. People know something they
need to see is in the mail. The second anchor is magazines, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If all you got was advertising mail, you probably wouldn't
accept your mail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that the post office generates all of its
profit in the first half of its fiscal year, beginning in
September, then mail volume declines and it begins losing money.
</P>
<P>
   That makes budgeting and planning difficult and under the law
the agency can't offer volume discounts to large mailers to
generate more business in the slow season, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If volume declines, there will eventually come a point where
legal requirements to break even over time will force the post
office to raise prices, he said. That will hurt those in rural
America who depend on universal postal service and who are not
connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is currently a bill in Congress, H.R. 22, which would ease
some restrictions on the agency, but Henderson said there has not
been a groundswell of support for it.
</P>
<P>
   He is planning a speech Thursday before the Postal Customers
Council in Providence, R.I., to raise interest in the bill,
sponsored by Rep. John McHugh, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give the post office pricing flexibility and the
ability to stimulate growth, but would still require the post
office to maintain universal service.
</P>
<P>
   In his AP interview Henderson also said:
</P>
<P>
   --The post office has counseling programs, threat assessment
teams and other efforts underway in an effort to prevent outbreaks
of violence like those that have occurred in the past.
</P>
<P>
   --The agency is launching a system for customers to pay their
bills electronically via a Postal Service Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   --The Breast Cancer stamp has raised $13 million for research.
</P>
<P>
   The post office is in Henderson's blood.
</P>
<P>
   His late father was a postal worker who served as president of a
union local. Henderson recalled working as a postal manager in
Greensboro, N.C., and regularly visiting his parents in Asheville,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   His mother would try to get father and son -- union and
management -- to stop talking post office matters.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled his father gathering with other retirees on the
front porch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be coming home and they'd be on the porch. My father would
be rocking back in his rocking chair and there'd be a couple of old
letter carrier cronies of his, and he would say, 'Son, come out
here, I need to talk to you.'''

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Advance on Western Front  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ETHIOPIAN-ERITREAN BORDER (AP) -- Heavy artillery thudded
on the barren, wind-swept western front today as Ethiopia moved to
consolidate military gains made since launching an all-out
offensive against neighboring Eritrea five days ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the government
spokeswoman blasted a draft U.S. resolution aimed at ending the
latest fighting in the two-year border conflict here. The
resolution introduced in the U.N. Security Council Monday would
impose an arms embargo on both countries and travel restrictions on
senior Ethiopian officials if the fighting doesn't stop
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Selome Taddessee called the U.S. resolution ''unfair, biased and
unjust'' and said it was designed ''to punish the victim of
aggression and to lend support to the aggressor.'' If the Security
Council accepts the resolution, she said, it will send the wrong
signal to the volatile Horn of Africa region -- that ''the law of
the jungle pays.''
</P>
<P>
   She welcomed as ''constructive'' a Russian resolution calling
for continued diplomacy to revive the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting first broke out on the contested 620-mile border in
1998 when Eritrea seized a border post. In a terse statement today,
the official Eritrean News Agency said Eritrea's defense forces
were reporting heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia said its forces continued to make gains on the western
Badme front of the border. Foreign journalists escorted to the
front today heard shelling but did not witness actual fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Operations Commander Ataklti Berhe said the Ethiopians routed
large numbers of Eritrean troops in a surprise attack May 12-13.
</P>
<P>
   ''We surprised them on two flanks, surrounded them from behind
and pushed up through the center. Because they were surprised, they
fled in disarray, they just ran away,'' he said, surveying the
bleak landscape dotted by empty soft drink crates and occasional
scrubby trees.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said eight Eritrean divisions of 5,500 troops each
had been defending the position, dug in trenches cut out of the
barren hillsides. He said 25,000 Eritreans were either killed,
wounded or captured in the two-day assault. The others fled west
toward Berentu, about 80 miles from the border with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Zerai Testai, a 27-year-old former teacher, was one of 471
prisoners captured by Ethiopian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''They used heavy artillery, aircraft, tanks and mortars and so
many soldiers,'' Zerai said, his hands shaking. ''I do not want to
fight again, we need a peaceful solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Nancy Soderberg, Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the
United Nations, said Monday that Eritrea had sent a letter to the
Security Council accepting its May 12 resolution that the fighting
stop immediately or both countries would face sanctions. A
statement from Selome's office said Ethiopia ''remains open to
resolving the conflict by peaceful means, as long as Eritrea is
willing to negotiate without precondition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia claims Eritrea is placing ''preconditions'' on
implementation of an Organization of African Unity peace plan by
insisting on a cease-fire first. Analysts say that by launching the
latest attack, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi appears
determined to gain the upper hand in setting conditions for peace
with his former comrade-in-arms, Isaias Afwerki, who is now
president of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Isaias headed the Eritrean People's Liberation Front and was the
senior member of a rebel coalition that ousted the 17-year
Ethiopian military regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991.
Meles' Tigray People's Liberation Front was also part of the
coalition. Two years later, the Eritreans gained independence, and
Meles became head of Ethiopia's new government.

<HEADLINE> Justice Department says Newark discriminating against Muslim officers </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Seven months after the U.S. Supreme Court
upheld rulings allowing two Muslim officers in Newark to keep their
beards and their jobs, the Justice Department on Tuesday sued the
city, claiming it is discriminating against police because of their
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The city threatened the officers, practitioners of the Sunni
branch of Islam, with termination and other sanctions because of
their beliefs, which include wearing beards, according to the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Employers have a duty to accommodate reasonably the religious
observances, practices and beliefs of employees,'' said Bill Lann
Lee, acting assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   This lawsuit, filed on behalf of all bearded Muslim officers in
Newark, seeks an order forcing the city to end religious
discrimination in the workplace and to pay monetary damages to any
current or former officers who were the victims of such bias.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier lawsuit by two Muslim officers did not seek
compensation, so they could be able to collect in this case, which
stemmed from a complaint by two other officers filed several years
ago with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The EEOC found ''reasonable cause'' to believe the allegations
of those officers, Kevin Rhodes and Anthony Kerr. After settlement
talks between the city and the EEOC and Justice Department failed,
the latest lawsuit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Hollar-Gregory, the city administration's top lawyer,
said she had not yet seen the lawsuit, but added, ''I don't think
the filing of a complaint precludes a settlement.'' She declined to
discuss the beard issue because of the pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The city has argued the no-beard policy was intended to present
a ''professional and dignified image to the public'' and establish
discipline and solidarity within the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court decision, Newark Police Director Joseph
J. Santiago said the department would change its rules to abide by
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The department has since submitted a revised ''grooming policy''
to the city for review, and has not disciplined any officers for
wearing a beard, the department said in a statement issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The department declined to comment on the latest lawsuit, as did
a spokeswoman for Mayor Sharpe James.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the earlier case involving Muslim officers
said they were puzzled that the city had not settled.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should be a slam-dunk for the Justice Department,'' said
Kevin J. Hasson, founder of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty,
which joined the original case on behalf of the officers, along
with the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and
the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still can't understand why the city wasted so much taxpayer
money,'' Hasson said. ''I could never understand why the city
fought so hard to keep religious police officers from following
their consciences in the first place. I'm completely baffled as to
why they're continuing the fight now.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the officers in the first case, Robert R. Cannan,
said the Justice Department has a ''very strong case.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a long, long paper trail of where the courts have come
down on behalf of the officers' rights,'' Cannan said.
</P>
<P>
   A related beard ruling came last month, when U.S. District Judge
Faith S. Hochberg, in Newark, blocked New Jersey from enforcing a
new policy barring its Sunni Muslim prison guards from wearing
beards. That case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The first Newark police case reached the Supreme Court, which
announced Oct. 4 that it would not hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   That decision upheld rulings from another judge in Newark, U.S.
District Judge John W. Bissell, and the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in favor of the officers, Shakoor Mustafa and Faruq
Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd Circuit found the department's no-beard policy was
discriminatory, asserting the two officers ''are entitled to a
religious exemption since the department already makes secular
exemptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Newark Police Department instituted a policy in 1971 barring
officers from wearing beards, but allowing mustaches and sideburns.
But the policy was largely unenforced until 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover officers, and those who could get a doctor to attest
to a medical condition that makes shaving painful, could maintain
beards.

<HEADLINE> US Praises Cuba Prisoner Release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The State Department welcomed on Tuesday the
release of two prominent political prisoners in Cuba and urged the
Cuban government to free two of their colleagues who remain in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cuba released Maria Beatriz Roque, one of four
members of the Dissident Working Group, all of whom were arrested
in July 1997. She was set free eight months before her 3{-year term
was due to end. On Friday, Felix Bonne Carcasses was released,
having served less than three years of a four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher also urged Cuba to
free all other political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   He said Cuba should heed nations around the world that have
urged the country to abolish laws which are used to punish free
expression.

<HEADLINE> Child Labor Fight Program Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is announcing how
it will spend $36 million this year to end exploitive child labor
around the world, including getting kids out of a Guatemalan quarry
and Bangladeshi garment factories and into school.
</P>
<P>
   Projects in Asia will get $18 million, nearly $9 million will go
to Africa, $8 million to countries in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and $1 million to the Middle East and Europe, Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman told The Associated Press in an interview
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The childrens programs will be highlighted at an international
conference hosted by Herman in Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. contributions to child labor projects have increased from
$3 million spent in 1999, and President Clinton has asked Congress
for $100 million in his 2001 budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has taken very seriously the commitment to put a
human face on the global economy and this is the work that in fact
will help do that,'' said Herman.
</P>
<P>
   In the Guatemalan program, children who had been working in a
stone quarry breaking up rubble by hand are being sent to school as
their families are helped to boost their incomes in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Among children who have been helped by the Bangladeshi program,
one little girl, who started working in a garment factory at age 7
after her father fell ill, is now, at age 14, attending school with
the aid of a small stipend and works only part time.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is promoting its support for such programs as
members of Congress give final consideration to how they will vote
next week on Clinton's proposal to grant permanent favored trade
status to China.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and human rights advocates are arguing that new
trade privileges for China and for other countries should be
accompanied by requirements that they improve conditions and
protections for their workers. The administration says it is
working toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   China is not a participant in an international agreement to
stamp out the worst forms of child labor, which the administration
helped negotiate last year. However, Herman said that she has
discussed the issue with Chinese officials.

<HEADLINE> Blair Fights Vs. Husband's Gov't  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Cherie Blair, the prime minister's very pregnant
wife, went to the High Court on Tuesday under her professional name
as a leading lawyer doing battle against her husband's government.
</P>
<P>
   As Cherie Booth, she is an employment law specialist and a
Queen's Counsel, a designation reflecting her seniority and
success.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days before her fourth child is due, the 45-year-old
lawyer represented 2.7 million workers from the Trades Union
Congress who she contended were being unlawfully excluded from a
new right to take parental leave.
</P>
<P>
   She accused the government of breaching European law by
stipulating that parental leave rights covering the first five
years of a child's development were available only to employees
whose children were born or adopted after Dec. 15, 1999, when the
new regulations went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   She argued that parents of children under 5 and born before that
date should also qualify for the right to take 13 weeks unpaid
leave spread over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Booth called the government's claim that the burden on employers
was already excessive an exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Booth, who spent more than two hours on her feet in the
courtroom, told the judges the European Parental Leave Directive on
which the regulations were based had ''a very long gestation
period, which is something I am beginning to think is a curse.''
</P>
<P>
   When the court reserved judgment until next week, she said: ''I
hope your lordships will excuse me if I am not available.''
</P>
<P>
   If the court refers the matter to the European courts for
determination, which could take two years, many of the excluded
parents would lose their parental leave rights.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair will not be taking parental leave.
Instead, he said he planned to scale back his official workload
when the new baby, due on May 24, is born.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ripped on War Criminal Visit  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Yugoslav defense
minister, held five days of talks in Moscow earlier this month and
stood among other foreign officials in Red Square for a military
parade to mark the anniversary of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ojdanic, like Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who sent
him to Moscow, has been indicted by an international tribune in The
Hague on charges of war crimes in the conflict between Serbs and
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the State Department criticized the Russian
government for inviting him and said it was urgently seeking an
explanation for the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said ''Russia, like all U.N. member
states, has the obligation under Security Council Resolutions 827,
1244 and other resolutions to arrest war criminals who enter its
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia was served with a copy of Ojdanic's indictment by the
international tribunal in May of 1999. There can be no doubt,
therefore, that they knew that he was an indicted war criminal when
they received him,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Ojdanic went to Russia to discuss prospective military
cooperation with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Chief of
General Staff Anatoly Kvashnin.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the defense ministry deliberately defied the
tribunal by inviting Ojdanic to Moscow, its spokesman, refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has historic, religious and cultural ties to the Serbs,
who unlike many other groups in Europe resisted German occupiers in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Russia tried to stop the United States and its allies from
taking military action in the Balkans against Yugoslavia. It has
contributed some troops to post-war peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The visit by the indicted war criminal, Ojdanic, we found very
deeply dismaying, frankly,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All UN members are required to carry out the tribunal's arrest
orders against an indictee who enters their territory. And there
are no exceptions to this obligation,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. view, Boucher said, the only subject Russians should
be taking about with Ojdanic ''is his immediate surrender for
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Russia could be criticized while U.S. peacekepers had
refrained from making arrests, Boucher said ''there's a difference
between picking somebody up in the Balkans and inviting him to come
and visit and have a big ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said 48 of the 94 publicly indicted war criminals had
been apprehended. ''So, we have been taking people into custody,''
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said he was not certain the United States knew of
the visit at the time. But, Boucher said, ''we are raising this on
urgent basis.''

<HEADLINE> 'Golden Rice' To Be Donated to Poor  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- In a move aimed at combatting blindness, two
biotech companies said Tuesday they have reached agreement with the
inventors of a genetically modified rice to donate seeds to poor
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamin-enriched yellowish new grain, known as ''Golden
Rice,'' has the potential ''to make a major contribution to the
health of many millions in the developing world,'' said one of the
companies, the Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca, which is in
partnership with Germany's Greenovation.
</P>
<P>
   But the donation of the seeds was denounced by a British food
watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a huge amount of public relations going on at the
moment in the biotech industry, which is in crisis and desperate to
improve its image with investors, the public and developing
countries,'' said Sue Dibb of The Food Commission, an independent
British organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why they're promising these benefits,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many biotechnology companies that make drugs have been
criticized for not doing enough to make the medicines more
affordable for poor nations. In addition, Europeans in particular
have been slow to embrace the concept of genetically modified food.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have spliced three genes into the Golden Rice to
make it rich in beta carotene, the source of vitamin A, and other
carotenoids. Some 500,000 people each year in developing nations
are believed to suffer from blindness caused by vitamin
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rice's two inventors -- Ingo Potrykus, a researcher
with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology's Institute for
Plant Sciences -- said Tuesday that up to 80 developing nations have
been approached across Asia, Africa and Latin America, and that all
have welcomed the prospect of receiving the seeds.
</P>
<P>
   India and China, although not classified as developing nations
by the United Nations, also have been sounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the seeds would be distributed to
government-run centers and local farmers would be allowed to earn
an annual $10,000 without paying royalties. Greenovation is acting
as intermediary between the inventors and AstraZeneca.
</P>
<P>
   ''The response from government agencies has been overwhelming.
Interest is enormous,'' Potrykus said, singling out Vietnam,
Thailand, Bangladesh and Pakistan. ''There will always be skeptics,
especially in Europe, but this is a humanitarian exercise.''

   AstraZeneca also is exploring ways of eventually selling the

plausible market. To be successful there, Golden Rice would be
promoted as a health food, AstraZeneca spokesman Ian Weatherhead

   Its inventors say it could be ready for distribution as early as
2003.

   But Dibb, of The Food Commission, said such claims were ''wildly

tests were far from being ready, and that a 10-year timeframe was
more realistic.

   She also said it remains ''highly doubtful'' that nutritional
problems can be solved by adding a single nutrient to food.

also wants to develop crops that would be resistant to drought,

<HEADLINE> Alleged Korea Killings Still Probed  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday
the Army has not yet reached conclusions in its investigation of
whether American soldiers killed numerous South Korean civilians at
the village of No Gun Ri in the opening weeks of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation, or inquiry I should say, is still under
way, and any declarations on the part of some that there have been
conclusions reached is premature,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has indicated it probably will not issue its final
report until this fall. ''Until there is a report then there will
be no conclusions reached,'' Cohen told reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Army Secretary Louis Caldera ordered the investigation last
October after The Associated Press reported eyewitness accounts
that Korean refugees, many of them women and children, were shot to
death near No Gun Ri on July 26, 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The Army issued a brief written statement Tuesday denying that
its investigators have confirmed that U.S. soldiers intentionally
fired on civilians. ''No such conclusion or any other conclusions
have been reached within the Department of Defense,'' the Army
said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times cited unidentified senior Defense Department
officials last weekend as saying the Army has confirmed that U.S.
troops fired on refugees, and that hundreds of civilian deaths
resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Army investigators have interviewed more than 100 people and
reviewed several thousand pages of historical documents. Officials
have said the Army is aware that a tragedy occurred at No Gun Ri
but that unanswered questions remain about the circumstances and
the extent of the killing. For years the Army denied that its
troops were in the area of No Gun Ri at the timing of the incident.

<HEADLINE> Jury Sides With Billiards Tour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- A federal jury found that R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. hustled a professional billiards organization with
sponsorship promises, but then backed out of contracts to support
the group's pool tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded Pro Billiards Tour Association Inc. $886,000 in
damages on Monday. The nation's second biggest tobacco company has
not decided if it will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The association had accused the maker of Winston, Camel and
Salem cigarettes in the suit of fraud, unfair trade practices and
breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Osteen dismissed the tour's claims of fraud and
unfair trade practices, but allowed the case to proceed on the
claim that the tobacco company left the billiards group financially
ruined when it promised to sponsor it in 1997 and then backed out
at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded the damages to make up for lost income and debt
incurred during 1996 and 1997, the years the jury found Reynolds
did not fulfill its contract.
</P>
<P>
   Tour commissioner Don Mackey said the verdict will enable the
tour to stage pool tournaments again in 2001. It hasn't held a
tournament since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds officials believed that evidence presented during
the trial showed that the company was ''honorable and lawful in its
dealings'' with the tour, said Jack W. Henson, the company's senior
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Sperling, one of the tour's attorneys, said RJR agreed to
pay the pool association $500,000 in 1996 to help defray its
expenses, but the company paid only $80,000. The financially
strapped tour that year bounced checks to players and owed money to
hotels that hosted tournaments, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Reynolds again promised to sponsor PBTA tournaments,
but then backtracked and unveiled its own Camel Pro Billiards
tournaments. RJR took over tournaments previously run by the PBTA,
solicited players who had played for the association and hired the
PBTA's tournament manager.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Copenhaver, a Reynolds' attorney, argued that the company
neither made a long-term financial commitment to the pool
association nor did it promise to pay the association $500,000 in
1996.

<HEADLINE> April Consumer Prices Held Steady  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in almost a year, consumer
prices held steady as costs fell for gasoline, airfares and
clothing, helping to offset higher prices for tobacco products,
prescription drugs and cars.
</P>
<P>
   The flat reading in April for the Consumer Price Index, the most
closely watched inflation gauge, followed two straight months of
sharp price increases, mostly reflecting surging energy costs, the
Labor Department said Tuesday,
</P>
<P>
   The last time consumer prices showed no change was last June.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core''
rate of inflation rose a modest 0.2 percent in April, following a
strong 0.4 percent increase the month before.
</P>
<P>
   April's performance -- both the main CPI figure and the core rate
-- matched many analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, stocks rose after the report's release and held
onto those early gains after the Federal Reserve announced its
sixth interest rate increase since last June. The Dow Jones
industrial average ended up 126.79 points to close at 10,934.57,
according to preliminary calculations. The Nasdaq gained 109.88
points to finish at 3,717.53.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists believe the good news on inflation may be
fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''May's CPI will come in a good deal less user-friendly,''
predicted First Union's chief economist, David Orr. One of the main
reasons: a rebound in energy costs, Orr and other economists said.
</P>
<P>
   To slow the supercharged economy and keep inflation at bay, the
Fed raised a key interest rate Tuesday by an aggressive half point
to 6.50 percent. The Fed's interest rate increases are designed to
make borrowing more expensive, thus cooling demand for big-ticket
items such as cars and homes, something that would help keep
inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, housing construction rose a solid 2.8
percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.66
million, the Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the strength came from builders beginning work on
condominiums, apartments and other multifamily housing, but starts
of single-family homes also ticked up, suggesting that rising
interest rates haven't sidelined demand.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, consumer prices have been rising at an annual
rate of 4.3 percent, compared with 2.7 percent for all of 1999. The
pickup in this year's prices mostly came from rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   However, last month energy prices fell 1.9 percent, the largest
decline in nearly three years. That followed a big 4.9 percent rise
in March. Increased crude-oil production accounted for April's
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel oil prices went down by a sizable 4.8 percent in April and
gasoline prices, which soared in February and March, fell by a
sharp 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After two straight months of increases, transportation prices
declined 0.7 percent in April, the best showing since May 1997,
reflecting lower fuel costs. Similarly, airfares fell 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing prices went down by 0.5 percent as retailers discounted
merchandise, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   These and other declining prices helped set rising prices
elsewhere in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco products prices, including cigarettes, rose a whopping
4.4 percent, the largest increase since September 1999. Companies
have raised cigarette prices to pay settlement costs for tobacco
lawsuits, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drug prices increased 0.4 percent, something
economists partly blamed on increased demand by aging Baby Boomers
and the introduction of more expensive new drugs. Prices for
hospital services rose 0.7 percent, the biggest jump since December
1999.
</P>
<P>
   New car prices rose 0.3 percent, the largest increase since
August 1998. That reflected a number of factors including strong
demand, U.S. car makers passing along increased labor costs and
higher prices for car electronics, said Paul Taylor, economist for
the National Automobile Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, food prices for the second month in a row grew by
just 0.1 percent in April.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir 990 Tape Released  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- EgyptAir Flight 990 sent no transmissions to
air traffic controllers or other aircraft in the final minutes
before the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean last October,
killing all 217 aboard. The last word was a routine ''good
morning'' signoff.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of transmission, revealed in a tape of air traffic
control communications released Tuesday, did not prove or disprove
the theory that a crew member intentionally crashed the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, whose investigators
are examining a suicide crash as one possibility, has not yet
completed its investigation and has reached no conclusion on its
cause, said spokesman Keith Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We let the transcript speak for itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration authorities played the tape and
released the transcript without comment on what it contributed to
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you can read anything into it either way,'' said
John Mazor of the Airline Pilots Association. A number of factors
could have prevented transmissions, he said, and ''in an emergency,
a crew's primary responsibility is to deal with flying the plane.
They were probably frantically trying to figure out what was going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear from the tape whether the voice giving routine
responses from EgyptAir 990 was that of pilot Ahmed Mahmoud
el-Habashy, co-pilot Gameel El-Batouty, or another crew member.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, the Egyptian government and El-Batouty's family
have rejected suggestions that he may have deliberately caused the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   After the new release, EgyptAir Chairman Mohammed Fahmi Al-Rayan
issued a brief statement claiming release of the routine
transmissions at the end of the flight ''is considered in
EgyptAir's favor which is one of the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate, saying only, ''We need to know the truth
of what happened and the reasons for the plane's fall, which will
be in the best interest of international civil aviation and the
safety of hundreds of planes.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions that the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane
resulted from reports of things said in the cockpit, including a
possible prayer and appeals from the pilot to help correct the
plane. Those words would have been picked up by a cockpit recorder
inside the plane. Investigators have heard that tape, but U.S. law
prohibits it from being released.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board chairman Jim Hall has told
Congress the movements of the plane were ''consistent with a
deliberate action on the part of one of the crew members,'' but has
said that no firm conclusion has been reached on the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The new tape and transcripts revealed no additional information
on possible problems with the weather, mechanical malfunctions or a
bomb -- all of which have been floated as possible causes for the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   On the new tape, an unidentified New York controller is heard
seven minutes after the plane's last transmission saying she had
lost radar contact with EgyptAir 990.
</P>
<P>
   That began an agonizing effort to locate the airliner. She and
other controllers contacted other civilian and military planes in
the area and even phoned the Canadian military to see if the plane
might have gone astray on its flight from New York to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   There was no emotion in the polite and businesslike voice from
the flight in six short clips -- words that would be heard in
routine transmissions as a flight headed out over the Atlantic on a
quiet night.
</P>
<P>
   The voice from EgyptAir 990 repeated back his flight plan, using
aviation lingo. Five minutes later, at 1:47 a.m. EST, his last
words after being asked to switch to another frequency:
''One-two-five-nine-two, good day,'' followed by an unintelligible
utterance, then, ''Nine-nine-zero heavy, good morning.'' The heavy
referred to his big aircraft, a Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication that something was wrong came seven minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
   The New York air traffic controller said, ''EgyptAir 990, radar
contact lost, recycle transponder squawk one-seven-one-two.'' It
was a declaration that the plane no longer appeared on radar
screens and a request for it to send out a signal. But that and
several other efforts failed to get a response.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA figures the plane hit the water at about 1:51 a.m., four
minutes after its last transmission.

<HEADLINE> 40 Activists Detained in Serbia  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Police briefly detained 40 student
activists opposed to President Slobodan Milosevic -- some on
suspicion of murder -- as a top government official called Tuesday
for a crackdown against Yugoslav opposition leaders and their
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Key opposition figures accused Milosevic and his aides of trying
to foment civil war as a pretext to impose full dictatorial
control.
</P>
<P>
   ''Civil war is being provoked by those who are conducting
repression, those who speak the language of hatred, those who are
arresting all those who think differently,'' said Nebojsa Covic, a
former Milosevic ally turned opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Police and government officials say the student group Otpor, or
Resistance, was behind the assassination of Bosko Perosevic, a top
official of the ruling Socialist party who was shot last Saturday
in the northern town of Novi Sad. The government appears ready to
seize on the killing to crack down on dissent fed by growing
poverty and isolation during Milosevic's more than 10 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian state television said Tuesday that police arrested 20
Otpor activists in the Novi Sad region on suspicion of being behind
the Perosevic slaying. It quoted a police statement as saying that
''printed material and objects'' were found in their possession and
that they were being investigated in connection with the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained another 20 Otpor activists in the central
Serbian town of Valjevo Tuesday after they distributed the group's
leaflets on the streets, opposition groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Pedja Lecic, an Otpor activist from Belgrade, said that all 40
were later released.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation between Milosevic and his critics is
increasing tensions in Serbia, the larger of the two remaining
Yugoslav republics and Milosevic's power base. Unlike in
Montenegro, the smaller Yugoslav republic whose leadership has
turned away from Milosevic, Serbia's government remains loyal to
the Yugoslav president, despite growing grass-roots opposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ivan Markovic, a spokesman for the neo-communist JUL
party of Milosevic's wife, described an anti-government rally
Monday as ''a gathering of terrorist leaders and their followers.''
He charged that the rally's call for an uprising against
Milosevic's government actually was ''a call for the destruction of
the country and its institutions.'' He linked the demonstrators to
NATO, which last year bombed Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are asking the appropriate authorities, above all the
public prosecutor, to undertake all legal measures for the
protection of the country and all its citizens,'' Markovic said in
a statement carried by the state Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders said such calls for a crackdown could lead to
a civil war between Milosevic's followers and opponents. The
critics charged that Milosevic would then introduce a state of
emergency that would ban basic civil rights and opposition parties
and indefinitely postpone elections scheduled for later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Milosevic camp ''is ready to stay in power by all means,
abandoning even the semblance of democracy,'' opposition leader
Goran Svilanovic said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Myanmar Democracy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright used the
10th anniversary of Myanmar's last free elections to urge the
country's military leaders to free political prisoners and abide by
the democratic wishes of their people.
</P>
<P>
   Albright paid particular tribute to Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel
Peace Prize winner and leader of the National League for Democracy,
which prevailed in the elections but was denied power by the
Myanmar military.
</P>
<P>
   As the 10th anniversary approaches, Suu Kyi has been renewing
her call for a return to democracy but the authorities have
responded ''with a new wave of arrests and slanders,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke to a gathering of the National Endowment for
Democracy, a government-backed pro-democracy group.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a sense, the battle of wills between Aung San Suu Kyi and
the government is grossly unequal,'' she said. ''The military has
all the weapons of coercion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each time Aung San Suu Kyi speaks to her supporters, she is
vulnerable. Each time she expresses outrage about the lack of
opportunities available to children, or the decline in education,
the spread of disease, the loss of freedom, she is vulnerable. ...
Always, she is vulnerable.''

<HEADLINE> Duchovny Return to X-Files Unknown  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fox TV has solved the mystery of whether
''The X-Files'' will return for one more season, reaching a
last-minute deal with series creator Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still suspense Tuesday over whether David Duchovny
will star for an eighth year as FBI agent Fox Mulder. Fox
Broadcasting Co. was to present its fall schedule to advertisers in
New York on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My contract connects me to the show for another season,''
Carter said. ''I've agreed to do it either way,'' with or without
Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could figure out a way to write around a missing
Duchovny but would prefer not to.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Anderson, who co-stars in the offbeat drama about FBI
agents on the trail of supernatural forces and alien invaders,
already was signed for another year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his agreement, Carter said he expects ''The Lone
Gunmen,'' an ''X-Files'' spin-off, to be part of Fox's 2000-01
midseason schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Duchovny's representatives were not immediately
returned Tuesday. His contract negotiations -- he's seeking more
money and a less-grueling work schedule -- have been complicated by
a lawsuit he filed against 20th Century Fox Film Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims Fox gave its own stations sweetheart deals on
''The X-Files'' reruns when the program should have been sold to
the highest bidder. The result, the suit claims, was that Duchovny
was underpaid on the series' profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely could do another year, but I really don't know if
it'll happen,'' Duchovny said in an interview last month. ''I'm
kind of happy that decision's been taken away from me. I've made my
terms clear.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The X-Files'' has been one of Fox's most popular shows and a
key part of its schedule. The series, which moved here from
Vancouver at Duchovny's request, will continue production in Los
Angeles, Carter said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sidesteps Police Plan  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain on Tuesday sidestepped
plans to rename Northern Ireland's terrorism-hardened police force,
a maneuver designed to help the province's major Protestant party
through a difficult vote that instead appeared to backfire.
</P>
<P>
   The British government unveiled long-awaited legislation to
reform the Royal Ulster Constabulary, a particularly divisive
element in the province's 2-year-old peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   That accord, aimed at ending decades of sectarian violence,
created a Catholic-Protestant administration for the British
province. But that power-sharing arrangement was suspended in
February and Britain has been trying to reinstall it.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation dropped any specific commitment to rename it the
Police Service of Northern Ireland, which Britain had vowed to do
in hopes of boosting Catholic support for the predominantly
Protestant force.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the legislation called for British Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson to have the final say next year on what
name the province's police should have, in consultation with a new
civilian police-oversight board.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's shift had been calculated to encourage the Ulster
Unionists, the major British Protestant party, to vote this
Saturday in favor of resuming Northern Ireland's suspended
province's administration.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the sales pitch, Mandelson wrote a detailed letter to
Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble that promised Britain would
''find ways of retaining an honorable and permanent place for the
RUC name.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Ulster Unionists -- who have insisted they won't allow
the power-sharing government to be reformed unless the Royal Ulster
Constabulary's name is kept -- said the latest British assurances
appeared to be a ruse.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that Mandelson, in an article published Tuesday in
Irish newspapers, emphasized the RUC name would be changed next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot allow the government to denigrate the people who,
through 30 years of bloodshed, stood faithfully between the
terrorists and the law-abiding community,'' said Ulster Unionist
lawmaker Ken Maginnis, one of the party's leading moderates.
''Hence the name must be retained.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's deputy leader, John Taylor, said his prediction that
Saturday's vote was 90 percent likely to result in approval no
longer applied.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fairly scared that ... it could end up in an adverse
way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain had hoped to transfer powers back to local hands Monday,
the second anniversary of the ratification of the peace pact,
following an unprecedented pledge by the Irish Republican Army on
May 6 to begin revealing its hidden weapons dumps to international
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA's blanket refusal to disarm had long been a primary
obstacle to political progress. In February, Britain suspended the
power-sharing Cabinet and resumed direct control of the province
after the Ulster Unionists threatened to walk out of the four-party
coalition over the IRA's refusal to disarm.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton backs a bipartisan measure
to give prescription drug benefits to military retirees, but on
Tuesday used the proposal to try to shame Congress into offering
the same benefits to every senior in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can they do this and say they're not going to do it for
people in the same situation in the rest of the country?'' Clinton
asked reporters in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   On other subjects, Clinton touched on his wife's Senate race,
the resignation of veteran UPI White House correspondent Helen
Thomas, presidential politics, gun control, the economy and the
upcoming vote on trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to reporters before leaving for Albany, N.Y., to
attend the New York state Democratic Party's convention where
Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to be nominated as a Senate
candidate. ''It's a big deal for her,'' said Clinton, who decided
at the last minute to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The House is to vote Wednesday on a bill that would extend
prescription drug coverage to about 1.4 million military retirees
over age 65 who are not already covered by another prescription
drug plan. Retirees under 65 already get the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would allow all military retirees on Medicare to
buy drugs at local pharmacies or through an established mail-order
program run by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the plan proves that Republicans in Congress agree
with him about the need to help seniors pay for costly prescription
drugs. Now Congress should pass legislation to offer it to all
seniors, not just military retirees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That ought to be our next goal, because today, more than three
in five American seniors lack such coverage,'' Clinton said. ''Too
many spend huge percentages of their income on prescription
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been pressing Congress to add drug coverage to
Medicare that any senior citizen could get for about $25 a month.
An alternative being developed by House Republicans would help
senior citizens get private drug insurance and provide subsidies
for those with the lowest incomes and highest bills.
</P>
<P>
   Before making remarks about prescription drug benefits, Clinton
noted that the 79-year-old Thomas was a White House reporter
through eight presidencies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton brushed off a question about Texas Gov. George Bush's
edge in national polls, saying Vice President Al Gore's contest
with the presumed Republican presidential nominee is still a long
way off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in these elections the fundamentals tend to take over
and the American people tend to take the measure of both the
candidates, especially in the course of the debates,'' Clinton
said. ''And I trust them to make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said polls showing Americans might prefer Bush on the
issue of gun control reveal ''that people don't know what the
respective positions are.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he needs more specifics before he knows whether
Bush's newly announced Social Security reform plan mirrors earlier
Democratic recommendations for private investment. Gore has
attacked the Bush plan as risky.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he trusts House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., to work for a compromise over HMO legislation. In a private
White House meeting last week, Hastert told Clinton he favors HMO
legislation that extends new rights to all Americans with
insurance, rather than a more limited series of protections in a
Senate-passed bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said that was his position. And I must say, so far, he's
been as good as his word on everything he said,'' Clinton said.
''Now, we do have some differences there. You know, he admitted
that we still don't have the liability issues worked out and we've
got some other issues to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is confident Congress will approve his request
for more than $1 billion for anti-drug efforts in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to send a signal to those people down there who are
fighting for democracy, fighting for freedom, fighting for the rule
of law, fighting against the narco-traffickers, fighting against
terrorism, that we're on their side,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Post Office Commercialization Seen  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The future of the Postal Service in the
Internet era is littered with uncertainties that will eventually
make the agency more like a private company, Postmaster General
William Henderson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Postal Service ultimately will be
commercialized,'' Henderson told editors and reporters of The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no pressure on the agency to change now
because ''there is no crisis,'' he said. ''What has led to
privatizations around the world, or commercialization ... has been
some sort of a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service is a semi-independent part of the government
overseen by a nine-member board of governors. It is not subsidized
by tax money but is regulated and must provide universal service to
every home at a flat rate. Postal officials have long sought more
freedom to introduce new services and products and to have flexible
rates like private businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The post office has made a profit for five straight years and is
recording record service performance, Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our customers are content, they don't see the future. And the
future, from my view, is filled with potential crises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he noted that the post office has annual revenues
of $63 billion, of which $17 billion is from carrying bills and
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bills and payments will eventually go electronic. It's not if
but when,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   He likened bills and payments to the anchor store of a shopping
mall, the main attraction of the mall. People know something they
need to see is in the mail. The second anchor is magazines, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If all you got was advertising mail, you probably wouldn't
accept your mail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that the post office generates all of its
profit in the first half of its fiscal year, beginning in
September, then mail volume declines and it begins losing money.
</P>
<P>
   That makes budgeting and planning difficult and under the law
the agency can't offer volume discounts to large mailers to
generate more business in the slow season, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If volume declines, there will eventually come a point where
legal requirements to break even over time will force the post
office to raise prices, he said. That will hurt those in rural
America who depend on universal postal service and who are not
connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is currently a bill in Congress, H.R. 22, which would ease
some restrictions on the agency, but Henderson said there has not
been a groundswell of support for it.
</P>
<P>
   He is planning a speech Thursday before the Postal Customers
Council in Providence, R.I., to raise interest in the bill,
sponsored by Rep. John McHugh, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give the post office pricing flexibility and the
ability to stimulate growth, but would still require the post
office to maintain universal service.
</P>
<P>
   In his AP interview Henderson also said:
</P>
<P>
   --The post office has counseling programs, threat assessment
teams and other efforts underway in an effort to prevent outbreaks
of violence like those that have occurred in the past.
</P>
<P>
   --The agency is launching a system for customers to pay their
bills electronically via a Postal Service Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   --The Breast Cancer stamp has raised $13 million for research.
</P>
<P>
   The post office is in Henderson's blood.
</P>
<P>
   His late father was a postal worker who served as president of a
union local. Henderson recalled working as a postal manager in
Greensboro, N.C., and regularly visiting his parents in Asheville,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   His mother would try to get father and son -- union and
management -- to stop talking post office matters.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled his father gathering with other retirees on the
front porch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be coming home and they'd be on the porch. My father would
be rocking back in his rocking chair and there'd be a couple of old
letter carrier cronies of his, and he would say, 'Son, come out
here, I need to talk to you.'''

<HEADLINE> Drought Likely To Linger In Midwest  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A drought that grips much of the Gulf Coast
and Midwest won't go away this summer even though more rain is
likely because an expected heat wave will evaporate much of the
moisture before it can help crops and replenish water supplies, the
government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In its summer drought forecast, the National Weather Service
said severe to extreme dry conditions will continue in Florida,
Georgia, western South Carolina, western Texas, northern Arkansas
and southern parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Severe drought conditions are expected to linger in eastern
Nebraska, northern Indiana and most of Missouri, Iowa and Illinois,
a region that is the heart of the nation's corn and soybean
production.
</P>
<P>
   Although the drought will hurt many farmers, it is not affecting
enough of the country to have much impact on food prices, said
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. ''It is not a drought of
national scope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   April was the driest month in 106 years in Missouri and the
state is still 11 inches below normal precipitation. Areas near St.
Louis received 8 to 14 inches of rain in early May, but later high
temperatures evaporated much of the water that wasn't lost through
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rains like these can't erase overnight what two years of La
Nina, and long-term drought helped to produce. These are major
precipitation deficits,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina is a cooling of the Pacific Ocean that is blamed for the
drought in the eastern United States last summer, as well as this
year's dry conditions in the South and Midwest. La Nina is expected
to continue diminishing over the next several months,
meteorologists say.
</P>
<P>
   Central and southern Louisiana have rainfall deficits of 29
inches this year. Georgia is 20 inches below normal and western
South Carolina is 18 inches behind.
</P>
<P>
   Relief is on the way to New Mexico, where the drought has
contributed to the wildfires that have scorched thousands of acres
of forest this spring, according to the forecast. The weather
service says the state should see ''monsoon'' rains in July.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the forecast, the Clinton administration also
released a special commission's recommendations for lessening
damages from drought and improving the coordination of government
disaster programs.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's suggestions included establishing a national drought
council and modernizing government climate-monitoring networks,
including the National Weather Service, to better predict where
droughts will develop.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service started issuing three-month drought
forecasts for the first time this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Droughts cause an estimated $6 billion to $8 billion in damages
every year. ''Drought is a fact of life somewhere in the country,''
said Kelly.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Baffles Dutch Officials  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- Three days after an explosion at a
fireworks warehouse engulfed an entire neighborhood in flames, city
officials insisted Tuesday that only 20 people were killed, but
struggled to explain why hundreds others remained missing.
</P>
<P>
   The city's refusal to release the 200 names on the
unaccounted-for list added to the mystery surrounding the blast and
created anger among locals demanding an explanation why such a
dangerous store of explosives was allowed in the heart of a
residential area.
</P>
<P>
   The S.E. Fireworks warehouse caught fire Saturday afternoon,
unleashing at first a colorful display that drew curious onlookers,
and then a firestorm from 100 tons of explosives that left several
city blocks looking like a war zone. More than 600 people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering mystery reminded many of the still unanswered
questions from the last major calamity in the Netherlands -- the
Oct. 4, 1992, crash of an El Al cargo jet into an Amsterdam
apartment block.
</P>
<P>
   Both disasters struck low-income neighborhoods inhabited by
large immigrant communities.
</P>
<P>
   After forensic teams recovered 16 bodies from a small part of
the stricken neighborhood in Enschede, the city stuck to its
estimate of 20 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Officials played down the significance of the missing figure,
which was largely based on municipal records. They noted that some
people were listed several times or had their name written with
three different spellings.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who had been found ended up listed as ''missing''
later after being reported by someone else, officials said. Since
the blast, 4,500 people have been on the list at some point.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Geevan, the head of the team keeping track of the missing,
said the figure has fluctuated vastly each day, making it a very
unreliable measure of the final toll.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is changing all the time,'' he said. ''It is not more than
an indication.''
</P>
<P>
   However, officials refused to release the names on the list,
saying it would cause undue alarm.
</P>
<P>
   After the El Al crash, Amsterdam authorities found records of
hundreds of people registered at addresses in the destroyed
building. An amnesty offer for illegal aliens who lived there added
hundreds more to their list.
</P>
<P>
   While early death toll estimates in that crash topped 200, the
final figure was 43.
</P>
<P>
   Justice authorities announced they were launching a criminal
probe into the Enschede firm, a major supplier of pyrotechnic
displays for rock concerts and public events in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A former national ombudsman, Marten Oosting, was appointed to
lead a commission investigating the causes of the explosion and
measures to prevent a repeat in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials have admitted that in addition to underground
bunkers, the firm had been licensed stored large quantities of
fireworks in aboveground shipping containers.
</P>
<P>
   A Berlin police inspector who visited the firm several months
ago told German ZDF television he was shocked to find the doors of
the containers open.
</P>
<P>
   And Dutch television reported that the army official responsible
for supervising safety measures at fireworks companies was
suspended earlier this year after he was suspected of corruption.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's-Boston Market Deal OK'd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. said Tuesday that a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court decision has cleared the way for its acquisition
of the Boston Market restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said they expect to complete the transaction
around the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's disclosed its intention in December to pay $173.5
million in cash for struggling Boston Chicken Inc., which operates
851 Boston Market restaurants in 33 states and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The final amount of the transaction is $176.15 million,
including additional money paid to creditors, McDonald's said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, Colo.-based Boston Chicken sought federal bankruptcy
court protection from its creditors in October 1998 as it attempted
to reorganize its finances while continuing to operate.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's said a federal court in Arizona had approved the
reorganization plan for Boston Chicken, enabling the deal to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kindler, McDonald's executive vice president, said the
company will begin converting certain Boston Market sites to
McDonald's, Donatos Pizza and Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants
over the next year, although a ''significant majority'' will remain
Boston Market restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the bankruptcy process, McDonald's can reject
unfavorable leases on underperforming restaurants without incurring
the usual termination costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This opportunity -- combined with the great work of Boston
Market's employees improving restaurant operations and customer
satisfaction -- allows the business to emerge from bankruptcy with a
strong base of profitable restaurants,'' Kindler said.

<HEADLINE> Marines' Remains Identified  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has identified the remains of six
Marines who were among 18 American servicemen who were listed as
missing in action after an attempt to rescue the crew of the
American merchant ship Mayaguez 25 years ago this week, defense
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plans to announce the identifications this week.
</P>
<P>
   The men lost in the tragic rescue attempt on Tang Island off the
coast of Cambodia on May 15, 1975, were the last U.S. combat
casualties in Southeast Asia, just a month and a half after the
official end of the war in neighboring Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Among the six Marines whose remains have been positively
identified by U.S. Army forensics experts is Lance Cpl. Andres
''Andy'' Garcia, 20, of Carlsbad, N.M., whose family was notified
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Pfc. Kelton Turner, 18, of San Antonio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the four others could not be learned Tuesday in
advance of the Pentagon's planned announcement. The names of Turner
and Garcia were provided by an official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jones, head of the Pentagon office in charge of
accounting for missing American service members, said in an
interview last week that nine sets of remains from the Mayaguez
incident were in the final stage of identifications, and that he
believed ''another two or three'' were approaching the final stage.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were recovered during a series of searches on Tang
Island over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   The six to be disclosed this week are among 13 U.S. servicemen
who were lost when the CH-53 helicopter in which they were riding
was hit by a rocket from communist Khmer Rouge troops as it
approached the island.
</P>
<P>
   The CH-53 was part of a raid meant to rescue 40 members of the
Mayaguez crew, who had been taken captive near the island in the
Gulf of Thailand on May 12. President Gerald Ford ordered U.S.
forces into action to rescue the crew.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of May 15, a team of Marines was flown by Air
Force special operations helicopters to Tang Island, where they
encountered unexpectedly strong resistance. As it turned out, the
crew of the Mayaguez already had been removed from the island and
were released to the United States unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   The CH-53 chopper crashed into the sea just of the coast of the
island. Thirteen aboard the helicopter swam away from the wreckage
and were rescued. Among those who went missing, at least a few
apparently were buried on the island by the Khmer Rouge forces;
remains of some of the others were recovered in shallow waters
along the coastline by U.S. search teams over the past several
years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   All were members of the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines of the 3rd
Marine Division.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 13 missing from the CH-53 crash was the co-pilot, Air
Force 2nd Lt. Richard Van de Geer, 27, of Columbus, Ohio. He had
participated in the final evacuation of Americans from Saigon in
April.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the six Marines whose remains have been
positively identified, the Pentagon also has recovered -- but not
yet confirmed the identifications of -- some others among the 13
lost in the CH-53 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Much about the fate of the lost Marines remains unknown. A
former Khmer Rouge soldier who participated in the attack on the
Marines recently told the Phnom Penh Post newspaper that the Khmer
Rouge hunted down and killed at least one U.S. troop who was left
when the Marines withdrew from Tang Island.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been reports that remains of other U.S.
servicemen missing in the raid have been found on the Cambodian
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 81 American servicemen and civilians were lost in
Cambodia during the Vietnam War era.

<HEADLINE> Nader slams corporate subsidies, political parties jcstfpr </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Consumer advocate Ralph Nader vowed
Tuesday to wage an active campaign for presidency as he slammed
elected officials in both parties for subsidizing corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party candidate made a series of campaign stops in
Hartford, calling for a grass roots movement to enact reforms such
as universal health care, public financing of campaigns and
stronger labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''When are we going to get sufficiently upset to roll up our
political sleeves and start a progressive movement to take our
democracy back?,'' Nader said. ''Our politicians are increasingly
bought and sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader accused Democrats and Republicans of catering to corporate

<HEADLINE> House Eyes Budget Process Overhaul  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Tuesday rejected a proposal to
move to a two-year budget, a key part of a bill to bring sweeping
changes to what most lawmakers agree is a flawed budget process.
The legislation also includes setting up a rainy-day fund for
emergencies and ending the possibility of year-end government
shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial budget idea was backed by President Clinton and
lawmakers who argued it would give Congress more time to oversee
the federal programs it funds. But opponents said having only one
shot at the budget every two years would weaken congressional
power.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial budget, defeated 217-201, was offered as an
amendment to the most far-reaching overhaul in more than a
quarter-century of the way Congress puts together the budget. It
faces uncertain prospects in the Senate, which is generally more
resistant to institutional change.
</P>
<P>
   Under a biennial budget, Congress would spend the first year of
a two-year congressional session drawing up a budget and passing
appropriations bills, reserving the second year for formulating
policy and overseeing federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very clear that the budget process that we have now
doesn't work,'' said House Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier,
R-Calif., a champion of the biennial budget idea. ''It's a
disorganized patchwork of decades old rules and laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents warned that the bill as a whole could result in less
fiscal discipline and the ceding of power to the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are walking away from our constitutional obligations to
defend the power of the purse,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin,
the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The central element of the bill is a revamping of the budget
resolution that is drawn up every spring and serves as an outline
for later spending bills. The budget resolution would be given the
status of a law, subject to the president's signature, a move that
would bring the president into the process much earlier in the year
and help avoid year-end showdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about doing business properly in an organized way,'' said
Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who has been working for budget
reform since he was a counsel in the Reagan White House.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said it would tip the balance of power to the
president. Members of the Appropriations and policy-making
committees also warned of a shift of authority to the Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions either in the bill or to be considered as
amendments:
</P>
<P>
   -- A rainy-day reserve fund to cover emergencies such as natural
disasters or military campaigns. Now Congress must pass special
supplemental spending bills to cover unexpected expenses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Automatic continuation of federal programs to prevent
government shutdowns when Congress and the White House fail to
enact all 13 appropriations bills by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   -- A requirement that all federal programs come up for renewal
every 10 years to ensure periodic reviews.
</P>
<P>
   -- A savings lockbox to ensure that budget savings from spending
cuts not be used to boost spending elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supports the idea of a biennial
budget, as did past Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   But it said setting up a reserve fund for emergencies could lead
to abuses, and threatened a veto if the final bill contains the
spending lockbox or the automatic continuation of programs, which
it said could ''do more to weaken than to strengthen fiscal
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is no coincidence that virtually every president, including
President Clinton, has endorsed biennial budgeting,'' Democratic
leaders wrote their colleagues in a letter urging opposition to the
bill. ''Biennial budgeting can mean less congressional oversight
and more power for the executive branch at the expense of
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 853.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Rebels Renew Jaffna Fight  </HEADLINE>
By HEMA SHUKLA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Ending a lull in their separatist fight,
rebels in Sri Lanka resumed an assault on their former stronghold
of Jaffna Tuesday, while the island's government said it was time
to talk peace.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar acknowledged that
Vellupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the Tamil rebels, was fighting a
''good battle'' but said it was time to come to the peace table
after 17 years of war.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is futile to carry on this battle. Tens of thousands of our
people are directly being affected,'' Kadirgamar said. ''Think
about it, Mr. Prabhakaran, and let us talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's appeal for peace talks came less than a week
after it had rejected a temporary cease-fire to allow nearly 40,000
government soldiers withdraw from the northern Jaffna Peninsula,
which the rebels seek as part of a Tamil homeland.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment on the government peace offer on the Tamil
guerrilla' Web sites, but the latest update showed the rebels had
resumed their attack on Jaffna after a three-day lull.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites said the rebels had launched assaults on their
former stronghold of Jaffna from two fronts and were within one
mile of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decisive battle for Jaffna resumed with great intensity,''
the Web site statement said, adding that rebels were also involved
in ''bloody battle'' against a military base outside Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government spokesman Ariya Rubasinghe said at least 40
rebels and six soldiers were killed in the clash that erupted late
Monday and lasted nearly 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting took place 2{ miles southeast of the center of
Jaffna, the center of Tamil culture and the largest city in the
north where most of the country's Tamil minority live.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamils claim they face discrimination from the Sinhalese
majority, which controls the government and the military. The Tamil
rebels are fighting for a separate homeland the Tamils in the
northern Sri Lanka, an Indian Ocean nation off India formerly known
as Ceylon. More than 62,000 people have been killed since fighting
erupted in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ''Due to the concentrated artillery and mortar fire of the
terrorists, the senior ground commanders shifted the defenses to
prepared positions more toward the northeast,'' said spokesman
Rubasinghe in a statement faxed to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side allows journalists into the battle areas, but a
military official speaking on condition of anonymity said the
army's movement amounted to a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombo, Sri Lanka's government Tuesday said it was
increasing its defense spending for the year 2000 by $180 million
to help fight Tamil Tiger separatists. The extra spending will
bring military spending to $880 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are buying new weapons and other military hardware from
seven different countries and we need the extra money to make the
purchases,'' Kadirgamar, the foreign minister, said.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 500,000 civilians are caught in the fighting
between the military and the rebels for control of Jaffna, the
rebels' capital from 1990-95.
</P>
<P>
   The international medical agency Doctors Without Borders accused
the Sri Lankan military Tuesday of preventing civilians from
leaving Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Isabel Simpson said international humanitarian law
''clearly forbids putting civilians in danger by using their
presence to shield military objectives from attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, have warned civilians to move to places of safety because of
the heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Warning civilians of military operations does not take away
the responsibilities of the safety of civilians,'' said Simpson.

<HEADLINE> Duchovny 'X-Files' Return Unknown  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fox TV has solved the mystery of whether
''The X-Files'' will return for one more season, reaching a
last-minute deal with series creator Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But there was still suspense Tuesday over whether David Duchovny
will star for an eighth year as FBI agent Fox Mulder. Fox
Broadcasting Co. was to present its fall schedule to advertisers in
New York Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My contract connects me to the show for another season,''
Carter said. ''I've agreed to do it either way,'' with or without
Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could figure out a way to write around a missing
Duchovny but would prefer not to.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Anderson, who co-stars in the offbeat drama about FBI
agents on the trail of supernatural forces and alien invaders,
already was signed for another year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his agreement, Carter said he expects ''The Lone
Gunmen,'' an ''X-Files'' spin-off, to be part of Fox's 2000-01
midseason schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Duchovny's representatives were not immediately
returned Tuesday. His contract negotiations -- he's seeking more
money and a less-grueling work schedule -- have been complicated by
a lawsuit he filed against 20th Century Fox Film Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims Fox gave its own stations sweetheart deals on
''The X-Files'' reruns when the program should have been sold to
the highest bidder. The result, the suit claims, was that Duchovny
was underpaid on the series' profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely could do another year, but I really don't know if
it'll happen,'' Duchovny said in an interview last month. ''I'm
kind of happy that decision's been taken away from me. I've made my
terms clear.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The X-Files'' has been one of Fox's most popular shows and a
key part of its schedule. The series, which moved here from
Vancouver at Duchovny's request, will continue production in Los
Angeles, Carter said.

<HEADLINE> Deere Posts 36 Percent 2Q Increase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOLINE, Ill. (AP) -- Deere &AMP; Co. reported a 36 percent increase
in second-quarter earnings Tuesday, beating analysts' predictions
despite continued low agricultural commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended April 30, the farm equipment manufacturer
reported net income of $204.3 million, or 87 cents a share. Last
year's second-quarter earnings were $150.1 million, or 65 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   The report exceeded the expectations of analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial, who had predicted earnings of 71
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   	   The report helped push Deere stock up $1.63 a share to $46.56 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   JoAnna Shatney, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said Deere
was helped by better-than-expected North American sales of farm
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were great numbers,'' she said. ''This is Deere's
seasonally most important quarter, and the fact that they blew away
expectations is a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Deere, based in Moline, also reported slightly increased
revenues for the quarter at $3.79 billion, up nearly 10 percent
from $3.46 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the farm economy is continuing to feel the impact of
low commodity prices, our operations are benefiting from
efficiencies associated with higher agricultural equipment
production schedules and the continued progress of quality and
efficiency-improvement initiatives under way in the company,'' said
chairman Hans Becherer.
</P>
<P>
   Deere &AMP; Co. is one of the world's largest manufacturers of
agricultural machinery, including John Deere tractors. It also
manufactures and distributes equipment for construction, forestry
and public works, and a variety of commercial and consumer
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Deere's net income
rose to $242 million, or $1.03 a share, from $200 million, or 86
cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Six-month revenue rose to $6.13 billion from $5.93 billion.

<HEADLINE> Fed Rate Increase Lifts Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against European currencies
Tuesday after the Federal Reserve raised short-term borrowing rates
by an aggressive margin of half a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The move, while widely expected in financial markets, confirmed
expectations that U.S. interest rates would remain higher than
those in Europe for the time being. That gap makes yields on the
dollar more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 90.13 cents,
down from 91.20 cents late Monday, and the British pound fell to
$1.4928 from $1.5060. The dollar also was quoted at 1.7224 Swiss
francs, up from 1.7069.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has tumbled in recent sessions to the lowest levels
since it was introduced in January 1999 as currency traders bet
that the European Central Bank, reluctant to chock off economic
growth, would not raise interest rates aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ECB officials have also voiced reservations about intervening in
markets on behalf of their currency, a practice that is used more
frequently by the Bank of Japan to influence the value of the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also received support Tuesday from higher prices on
Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 126.79 at
10,934.57 as traders bet that the Fed would be successful in its
campaign to wring inflationary pressures out of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar edged down against the yen, giving
up some recently won ground. In late New York trading, the dollar
was changing hands at 109.44 yen, down from 109.53.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was also quoted at 1.4863 Canadian dollars, down from
1.4868.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1698 German
marks, up from 2.1448; 7.2771 French francs, up from 7.1933; and
2,148.07 Italian lire, up from 2,123.34.

<HEADLINE> Corn, Soybeans Sink on Forecasts  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forecasts for substantial rains this week in Midwest growing
regions, soaking fields in the heart of planting season, sent
soybean and corn prices tumbling Tuesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, cocoa rallied and gold gave up minor gains
after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans and corn both fell sharply after midday forecasts
called for as much as 3 inches of rain in the Midwest in coming
days. Corn came under additional pressure from the outlook for
significant rainfall in the Corn Belt during the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The short-term forecasts for rain outweighed support the
agricultural commodities normally would have gotten from a drought
forecast by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The weather service predicted a drought lasting through the summer
and said recent rains have not replenished soil moisture.
</P>
<P>
   A severe dry spell would reduce the harvest and prop up crop
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors are focused on the near-term soil
condition now after hearing for weeks about the worsening drought.
Traders say that the recent rains have persuaded them to wait for
evidence of a drought before once more pushing prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the volatility they've seen, traders have decided
to exercise the old Missouri adage about the drought: 'Show me,'''
said Tim Hannagan, grains analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Corn for July delivery fell 3\ cents to $2.35{ a bushel; July
soybeans fell 6 cents to $5.43} a bushel; July wheat fell } cent to
$2.81{ a bushel; July oats fell } cent to $1.19 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Cocoa jumped more than 3 percent to a three-week high on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange, as investors closely watched
political jockeying in Ivory Coast, the world's No. 1 cocoa-bean
producing nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ivorian officials talked of possibly reducing production to 1
million tons from more than 1.3 million tons this year as part of a
restructuring of the cocoa sector.
</P>
<P>
   July cocoa settled up $27 at $837 a ton.
</P>
<P>
   Gold had inched slightly higher on the Comex division of the New
York Mercantile Exchange before the rate hike. The Fed's action
makes gold less attractive by keeping a lid on inflationary
pressures and boosting the dollar. In addition, rising interest
rates make returns more attractive on investments that pay
interest, unlike gold.
</P>
<P>
   June gold settled down 20 cents at $276.20 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, which generally follows gold, went the other way this
time. July silver pushed to a one-month high of $5.19 an ounce,
rising 8.5 cents in what analysts said was a technical recovery
from Monday's price slump.

''we're going to be victorious in November,'' was to be nominated
for the U.S. Senate on Tuesday in her adopted state by the New York
Democratic Party's state convention.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking hands with supporters, signing autograpghs and posing
for photograpghs with admirers before the convention kicked off,
the first lady boasted of victory and told reporters that ''I see
the attention as a wonderful indication of how everybody's going to
pull together.''
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute addition to the festivities, President Clinton
changed his schedule Tuesday in order to join the crowd of more
than 5,000 people at the convention in a downtown Albany sports
arena. On Monday, aides to the first lady and the president had
said he would not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just decided I ought to be there,'' Clinton said before
leaving Washington. ''It's a big deal for her, a big night for her
and I want to be there with her. I just want to be there to support
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was not expected to address the convention, but
did plan to make remarks later Tuesday night at a reception at a
local hotel hosted by top New York Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Still uncertain as the party's 352 delegates gathered was
whether the first lady would face Republican Rudolph Giuliani, the
New York City mayor whose candidacy was expected to make the Senate
race a clash of political titans.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the mayor stunned New York with the
announcement he has prostate cancer and might have to quit the
race. Things turned even more topsy-turvy when the married mayor
subsequently confirmed he was seeing ''a very good friend,'' Judith
Nathan, and then announced he and his wife of 16 years, Donna
Hanover, were discussing a formal separation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, on Monday night, Giuliani told supporters at a
Manhattan fund raiser that he was ''very much inclined'' to stay in
the race, but still had to determine his course of medical
treatment before he could decide on the Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not making any decision today,'' Giuliani's campaign
manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried to keep the focus on their convention and on the
first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of excitement we haven't seen since Bobby
Kennedy,'' state Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said on the eve
of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the only first lady to run for public office, is
seeking the Senate seat from New York once held by Kennedy and
later by the man she hopes to replace in the Senate, fellow
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan is retiring at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hope said Tuesday that she felt sympathy for her Republican
Party counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sure am glad I'm not Bill Powers today,'' she told Albany's
WROW-AM radio. ''The best thing we've got going for us at this
convention is a simple thing -- we've got a candidate ... It's like
they've got a big party and everybody's dressed up and no date for
the prom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican state convention in Buffalo is just two weeks
away.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's camp was jubilant Tuesday over a statewide poll from
the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute showing that despite
Giuliani's medical and marital problems, he remains deadlocked with
Clinton among New York voters. She was favored by 44 percent to 43
percent for the mayor. That is statistically unchanged from a May 1
Quinnipiac poll.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the
mayor was ''grateful and heartened'' by the poll results.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a reaffirmation of the strength of the mayor's
candidacy and evidence that performance and record are what New
Yorkers care about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has faced charges from Giuliani of being a
carpetbagger -- she only moved to New York in January -- and not
having a record in elective office, Republicans face a New York
electorate in which Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost
5-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Since kicking off her Senate campaigning last July at Moynihan's
farm near Oneonta, Clinton has visited all 62 New York counties.
She formally announced her candidacy in February in a state
university gymnasium not far from her new $1.4 million home in
suburban Westchester County just north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   More a coronation than a convention, Tuesday's gathering in
Albany was a far cry from recent state party conventions at which
Democrats often nominated multiple Senate candidates who then had
to face off in a September primary.
</P>
<P>
   Several little-known New York Democrats have expressed an
interest in this year's nomination, but to force a Sept. 12 primary
they would have to go through the arduous process of collecting the
signatures of 15,000 New York Democrats between June 6 and July 13.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Elections on Track for Sunday  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP -- After repeated delays and weeks of
political violence, Haiti appeared set to hold parliamentary and
local elections, after the last opposition party announced Tuesday
that it would field candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barring circumstances beyond our control, the first round will
take place on Sunday,'' said Leon Manus, president of the electoral
council.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is pivotal to this desperately poor Caribbean country,
after a tumultuous decade that saw its first free election, a
military coup, a U.S.-led invasion and a political paralysis after
a 1997 parliamentary election in which only 5 percent voted and
results were widely contested.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's legislative and municipal elections come after
President Rene Preval disbanded parliament in 1999, effectively
ruling by decree ever since.
</P>
<P>
   About 93 percent of Haiti's electorate of 4 million have
registered to vote Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Political parties and all sectors of the country have decided
to participate in elections,'' said Hubert Deronceray, spokesman
for the nine-party Patriotic Movement to Save the Nation, which
threatened a boycott unless the government did more to guarantee
security.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the entire 83-seat lower house, 19 seats in the
27-seat upper house, and 7,500 local government positions across
the country. Parliamentary posts are elected in districts, with an
absolute majority required to avoid a runoff June 25. Some 29,500
candidates are running for all posts.
</P>
<P>
   The elections are also something of a test run for the
presidential election planned for December -- in which ex-President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide is expected to run and win.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide, the country's first elected leader, was ousted by a
military coup in 1991 and was restored four years later after the
U.S.-led invasion. Prevented constitutionally from a consecutive
term, he handed over the reins to Preval in 1996 -- but many here
are convinced that he has continued to pull the strings behind the
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians have claimed electoral authorities are
biased in favor of Aristide's Lavalas Family party. They also say
Lavalas is secretly behind a wave of unsolved killings of
opposition figures. Lavalas officials have rejected the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Since March 27, 15 people have been killed in politically
related slayings, five of them provincial election campaign
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say 3,500 police are ready to prevent violence at
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 foreign observers will be on hand Sunday, including
delegations from the Organization of American States and the
National Democratic Institute, an arm of the U.S. party. The local
National Observation Council also planned to deploy some 30,000
observers.

<HEADLINE> Kmart Top Executive Hall Leaving  </HEADLINE>
By E.A. KHALIL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Kmart Corp.'s top executive Floyd Hall will leave
the giant retail chain within a year, but before his departure the
discounter will spend heavily to build its presence on the Internet
as well as renovate and open new stores.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Kmart's annual meeting with shareholders on Tuesday,
Hall said the company had started a search for his replacement. He
has been Kmart's chairman and chief executive for almost five
years, and his current contract expires next April.
</P>
<P>
   Under his reign, Troy, Mich.-based Kmart has stepped up the
fashions in its stores and brought in some key brands, such as the
Martha Stewart Everyday home and garden line.
</P>
<P>
   But the retailer still has struggled to keep pace with rivals
like Wal-Mart and Target. Its stock has lost more than half of its
value in the last year, due in part to the tough competition in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart's shares rose 18.75 cents to $7.62{ Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Kmart is not yet the retailer we all want it to be, we
have built a company of fundamental strength that is now well
positioned for the future,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   At the shareholders' meeting, Kmart unveiled a $340 million plan
to open 20 new Big Kmart stores, expand 12 to 15 existing stores
and adding five new Super Kmarts -- 24-hour centers that combine
traditional Kmart discount stores with grocery operations.
</P>
<P>
   In 2001, the plan calls for adding 30 Big Kmarts and 20 new
Super Kmarts, as well as expanding 11 stores with new facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart's goal for the next five years is to open 125 new Super
Kmarts, which Hall called ''offensive and defensive weapons in
capitalizing on our rightful market share.''
</P>
<P>
   Kmart will also keep promoting its private-label goods,
expecting $1.4 billion in sales from Martha Stewart Everyday, which
Hall said ''continues to be a home run.'' A Martha Stewart
housewares line, which will include kitchenware and other
home-related goods, is expected to debut this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart will also invest $328 million -- up from $131 million in
1999 -- to improve its technology systems, including the
installation of new scanners that will dramatically speed-up time
spent on check-out lines.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at the investment firm
PaineWebber, said Kmart should concentrate on its current 2,171
stores, making them more friendly to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''New stores are important, and where they can they should take
advantage,'' Edelman said, but he added that the retailer ''can't
lose sight of what they should be doing to drive sales in existing
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Kmart also spoke of the retailer's free Internet service,
BlueLight.com, which was launched late last year with online portal
Yahoo!, Softbank Venture Capital and Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia. Kmart owns 60 percent of the service, which now has
about 2 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart will roll out an online store on BlueLight this summer,
which will eventually be stocked with about three times the amount
of goods available at a Kmart store.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the BlueLight site would extend Kmart's reach to
customers who wouldn't usually shop at a Kmart store.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the Internet, every company is relatively new. Shopping
preferences haven't been firmly established and rewards will go to
those that earn them,'' Hall said. ''Companies that consistently
excel in assortment, convenience, speed and great service will
succeed...We aspire to be that company.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Up 127, Nasdaq Up 110  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors, undeterred by the Federal Reserve's
warning about rising inflation, sent stock prices sharply higher
Tuesday after the central bank announced a long-anticipated
half-percentage point interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose on hopes Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will win his
fight to keep inflation under control, although analysts said it's
likely the Fed will continue to push rates higher later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed raised interest rates by a half-percentage point, the
steepest increase in five years, and it warned that rapid economic
growth could foster a resurgence of inflation that eventually would
''undermine the economy's outstanding performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase, the sixth since last June, was widely
expected, so after a brief tumble in the wake of the Fed's
announcement, stocks resumed a ''relief rally.'' The Dow Jones
industrial average rose 126.79 to close at 10,934.57.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Nasdaq
composite index rose 109.92 to close at 3,717.57 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 rose 13.68 to 1,466.04.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's rally marked the fourth consecutive day of gains as
investors have convinced themselves that a half-point increase
would bring the Fed close to the end of a long run of rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, said many
investors were also hoping to capitalize on a pattern of market
rallies in the sessions following previous rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market has been improving since last Thursday on very
little fundamental good news,'' he said. ''Volume has been low and
the broadness of the advance has not been that great, so that
raises questions about the rally's staying power.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose from the start of trading after the Labor Department
offered some evidence that the five previous rate increases may be
succeeding in holding inflation down. The government's consumer
price index, after rising sharply for two straight months, held
steady in April as energy prices posted their first decline in
almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   The report raised hopes on Wall Street that the Fed will not
have to raise rates sharply throughout the rest of this year.
Analysts were less sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fed was on the verge of falling behind the curve,'' said
Chris Conkey, chief investment officer at Evergreen Investment
Management in Boston. ''This is a great step in terms of getting
ahead of the curve, but we foresee more increases later this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive stocks remained in a slump after the Fed's
announcement. American Express fell 1 1/16 to 51[ and Citigroup
fell 1 3/16 to 61 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, which can see profits falter if higher interest
rates dissuade Americans from buying or renovating homes, tumbled 3
to 53{.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, investors embraced technology stocks. Hewlett-Packard
rose 2~ to 136~, leading the Dow. After the close of trading, the
computer maker announced second-quarter results that easily
surpassed Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, IBM gained 4 13/16 to 109 and Intel rose 3} to 121~.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos rose 11 to 72|. After trading ended, Spain's Terra
Networks SA said it will acquire Lycos for about $12.5 billion, or
$97.55 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said stocks of every sort, from ''new economy''
technology companies to ''old economy'' industrial and consumer
stocks, will face pressure if interest rates continue rising.
Higher rates threaten corporate profits by making it more expensive
to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, with six weeks before the Fed's next meeting and
about two months before most companies report second-quarter
earnings, investors might struggle to find reasons to buy stocks,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be laying ground for a better rally in June or July,
but I don't think we're at the starting point for that yet,''
McCabe said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market drew some additional strength from Goldman
Sachs &AMP; Co. chief investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen. Cohen
told an Economic Strategy Institute conference she anticipates
''good returns, not necessarily abnormally large returns'' from the
stock market this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Saudi billionaire prince Alwaleed bin Talal provided a
lesson in bargain-hunting, revealing that he has has acquired $1
billion worth of shares in Internet companies and blue chip
performers ranging from Amazon.com to McDonald's Corp. and Ford
Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   His company said in a statement that Alwaleed took advantage of
recent weakness in stock prices, making the bulk of the purchases
''when the market corrected in mid-April.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.16 billion shares,
compared with 1.02 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.76 to 505.80.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.4 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 2.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
gained 1.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 2.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Vows More Debt Reduction  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the federal budget outlook improving by
the month, House Republican leaders promised Tuesday to craft
legislation requiring that any increase in this year's surplus be
devoted to reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Republicans would use at least $14 billion of
this year's projected surplus from non-Social Security programs for
debt reduction. The effort underlines the political popularity of
driving down the $3.6 trillion publicly held debt, which economists
say can strengthen the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so will ''make a better future for our kids,'' said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office bumped up
its estimate for this year's non-Social Security surplus by $14
billion, saying it will be at least $40 billion. It is that $14
billion -- plus any additional growth in the surplus before fiscal
2000 ends Oct. 1 -- that Republicans want to use for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rest of the non-Social Security surplus that the two
parties feel free to use for extra spending or tax cuts. Both
parties have already promised to use this year's entire Social
Security surplus -- expected to be at least $160 billion -- to shave
down the debt.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders said they were setting aside the remaining $26
billion of this year's projected surplus for emergency spending for
U.S. troops in Kosovo, anti-drug efforts in Colombia and other
last-minute needs that might emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to use most of the non-Social Security surplus
projected for 2001 and beyond for tax cuts. But with less than four
months left in fiscal 2000 and vast disagreements between President
Clinton and the GOP over tax reduction, it would be nearly
impossible to enact a tax cut that would take effect in the
remaining months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The national debt totals $5.7 trillion, of which $3.6 trillion
is held by the public. The remaining $2.1 trillion is debt the
government owes its own trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already voted to set aside $4 billion of this
year's surplus for debt reduction, but the measure has yet to
become law.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, top White House officials met with House Democratic
leaders and promised a long battle this fall, if necessary, to
force Republicans to boost spending for hiring teachers, building
schools and other Clinton initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta said a massive spending
measure for education, health and social programs that the House
Appropriations Committee wrote last week deserves an ''F for
failure.'' White House budget chief Jack Lew assigned the same
grade to the Senate version.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill eliminated the teachers and construction
programs, while the Senate measure would let states use the money
for other education needs.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Bonds Maintain Gains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices of long-term Treasury bonds and
intermediate government notes rose Tuesday for a second straight
day on hopes that inflation remains under control. But an
aggressive increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal
Reserve, amid signs that the central bank inflation-fighters are
prepared for further rate hikes, pushed down shorter-term
Treasurys.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32
point, or $1.56\ per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
in the opposite direction, fell to 6.42 percent from 6.44 percent
late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond rose 19/32 point with the yield
falling to 6.10 percent from 6.15 percent a day earlier, according
to Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Federal Reserve on Tuesday increased short-term
interest rates by one-half percentage point. It was the sixth time
the Fed has increased the federal funds rate since June 1999 but
the first half-point move. Combined with the other five
quarter-point increases, the target for the federal funds rate --
the interest on overnight loans between banks -- has now been raised
1.75 percentage points in less than a year, climbing from 4.75
percent to 6.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fed policy-makers issued a hawkish statement of
concern about the risks of rising inflation, signaling they may not
be through raising rates to cool off the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates reduce the value of investments that pay a
fixed rate of return, such as bonds. But the Fed's resolve to
contain inflation and a government report Tuesday of unchanged
consumer prices in April helped calm some jitters about another
danger to fixed-income investments.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Tuesday, short-term Treasury securities fell
1/32 to 1/16 point, while intermediate maturities ranged from
declines of 1/32 point to a rise of 5/32 point.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 6.19 percent while
the discount rate was 6.02 percent, down 0.05 percentage point from
Monday's Treasury auction. Yields are the interest bills pay by
maturity, while the discount is the interest at which they are
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Six-month yields finished at 6.50 percent with a discount of
6.22 percent, falling 0.03 percentage point from the weekly
auction. One-year yields settled at 6.35 percent with a discount of
6.04 percent, rising 0.03 percentage point from late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, fell to 5.75 percent from 6.37{ percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 3/32 to 92\. The average yield to
maturity was unchanged at 6.21 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard 2Q Profits Jump  </HEADLINE>
By CLIFF EDWARDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Strong demand for printers and personal
computers helped Hewlett-Packard Co. breeze past Wall Street profit
expectations for the company's latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
   HP earned $935 million, or 79 cents a share, in the three months
ended April 30, the second quarter of the company's fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The profit was only slightly better than the $918 million, or 73
cents a share, HP earned in the same period a year ago, but easily
topped analyst projections for a per-share profit of 82 cents,
based on a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The results from the most recent quarter include one-time
expenses related to HP's planned spinoff of Agilent Technologies, a
maker of semiconductor test and measurement equipment, as well as
costs from an early retirement package and some investment gains.
Excluding those factors, the company's profit from continuing
operations came to $899 million, or 87 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   HP's shares had risen $6, or 4.5 percent, to $140 in New York
Stock Exchange trading ahead of the earnings announcement. In
after-hours trading on other markets, the stock rose as high as
$141.50 before retreating to about $137 per share.
</P>
<P>
   ''This quarter's terrific result is linked directly to our
reinvention efforts,'' said Carly Fiorina, HP's president and chief
executive. ''We are delivering the growth we promised, sharpening
our focus on customers and using our global presence to accelerate
our win rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven by strong overseas demand, particularly in Asia, the
company's revenue grew 15 percent to $12 billion from $10.46
billion a year ago. That figure was in line with Wall Street
expectations, but some investors were betting ahead of the earnings
release that sales also would exceed expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's global shipments of personal computers,
including desktop machines and notebooks, have surged this year
amid heavy demand in the consumer segment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also credit a strong marketing campaign instituted by
Fiorina, who took over as CEO last July.

   Sales of printers, which accounted for 61 percent of the
company's operating profit last year, also rose. Sales of Unix
servers rose 26 percent in the quarter.

   Separately, Agilent reported net income of $166 million, or 36
cents a share, in the latest quarter, compared to $157 million, or
41 cents a share, a year ago. The latest results, which matched
most forecasts, included a gain of 4 cents a share on the sale of
investments. Revenue rose to $2.5 billion from $2 billion.

<HEADLINE> Ark. Crash Victims Seek Statements  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Lawyers for survivors and the families
of victims who died when an American Airlines jet crashed asked a
judge Tuesday to reject the airline's attempt to keep eyewitness
statements secret.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public's right to know what happened on American Airlines
Flight 1420 greatly outweighs American Airlines' privacy interests
in keeping the sworn testimony of witnesses from being published,''
the lawyers said in papers filed in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The jet skidded off a runway, broke apart and caught fire June 1
after landing at Little Rock during a storm. Eleven people,
including the pilot, died and 110 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs responded Tuesday to the airline's request for a
protective order to block the release of pretrial testimony in
federal lawsuits against the company.
</P>
<P>
   The airline argued in court papers filed April 27 that public
disclosure of statements could influence potential jurors and harm
the airline's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers argued Tuesday that the airline's primary
complaint was that TV stations used clips from three videotaped
depositions in a news story in April.
</P>
<P>
   The airline was informed in advance that the story based on the
testimony would run but declined to provide comment or rebuttal,
the plaintiffs said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the statements in question were comments from Capt. Cecil
Ewell, American's chief pilot and vice president of flight
operations at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Ewell said in his deposition that ''only an idiot would attempt
to land in a thunderstorm.''
</P>
<P>
   American said Ewell's statement was taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits against American claim the deadly crash resulted
from violations of federal aviation regulations and airline policy.

   BUFFALO, N.D. (AP) -- An explosion and fire on Tuesday rocked a
building used to make fireworks components. One person working
inside was believed dead and a man who tried to rescue him was
severely burned, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of the large steel building, which was located on a
farm 50 miles northwest of Fargo, were blown out by the explosion
around 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gentleman that was working inside is believed to have
expired inside. We have not been able to pull him out yet,'' Cass
County Detective Steve Gabrielson said. The victim's name was not
immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Cass County Sheriff's Lt. Rick Majerus said another man, who
tried to rescue the man trapped in the building, was being treated
for severe burns and a 10-year-old girl was being treated for smoke
inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   The building was used by the Lightning Pyrotechnics company to
make fireworks components.
</P>
<P>
   ''The building was totally engulfed when we arrived here,'' said
Jim Jaeger, an assistant fire chief in Buffalo.

<HEADLINE> Researcher: Effective 'smart gun' technology three years away  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- It will take at least three years before
technology is advanced enough to build an effective ''smart gun,''
a researcher at the New Jersey Institute of Technology said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Sebastian, the university's associate provost for
research and development, said the available technologies to make
guns that only their owners can shoot are not personalized enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're all subject to the same vulnerabilities as traditional
lock and key systems,'' Sebastian said at a university conference
on smart gun technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian is heading a group of 15 researchers armed with a $1
million state grant to investigate the effectiveness of smart gun
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature approved the grant last year, after a bill
sponsored by Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco to require
smart gun technologies on new handgun purchases failed to pass in
the Assembly. A Senate committee last week passed the same bill,
and it faces a full Senate vote on Thursday. The bill would require
the state attorney general to decide when smart gun technology is
effective and available before mandating it.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian said his study has been hampered by the unwillingness
of major gun manufacturers to share the technology they're working
on. His researchers have test-fired guns manufactured by Fulton
Arms that require owners to activate their guns with a ring on
their finger.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers haven't been able to test prototypes for a gun
that uses technologies like wristbands and personal identification
numbers to activate guns, as well as technology that would let a
gun use fingerprints to identify its owner.
</P>
<P>
   But Sebastian said all the technologies are currently flawed.
Guns that activate with the rings are problematic because more than
one person could use the gun, he said. Fingerprint technology is
hampered by sensitivity to things like moisture in the skin, which
could prevent a gun owner from activating a personalized gun,
Sebastian said.
</P>
<P>
   NJIT is working on a prototype for a smart gun that could
identify its owner by the shape of the owner's hand and the way the
hand grips the gun, Sebastian said.
</P>
<P>
   But he estimated that it would take at least three years before
the technology exists to mass-produce the smart guns.
</P>
<P>
   The NJIT study won't be complete until at least December, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, who has criticized smart gun
legislation as premature, agreed Tuesday that more research is
needed. DiFrancesco was scheduled to speak at the two-day
conference on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Florio, Corzine to face off in third debate of Senate Democratic primary </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, N.J. (AP) -- U.S. Senate candidates Jim Florio and
Jon Corzine are likely to resume their war of words here Tuesday at
the third of four scheduled debates in the Democratic primary
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Florio in two previous debates has taken his opportunities at
the microphone to develop sharp attacks against Corzine, his
wealthy opponent who is spending more than $2 million a week on TV
commercials and has now begun to blanket the state's billboards,
buses and mailboxes with posters and mailings.
</P>
<P>
   The former Wall Street financier was caught somewhat off-balance
in the first debate last week at a Trenton public television
studio, but in a debate Monday at a New York radio station he
fought back with concise answers and some attacks of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The Livingston debate at the Beth Shalom synagogue, the only one
open to the public, should place the two candidates in front of
their largest audience yet, but it will not be broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has not spent any money on TV commercials and has tried
to turn Corzine's heavy spending into a campaign issue, accusing
his opponent of using waves of cash to overwhelm the electoral
process and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Florio lashed out at Corzine for avoiding a debate
next week to be hosted by WPVI-TV, Philadelphia's ABC network
affiliate, for broadcast there and on WABC-TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four primary campaign debates, only two were to be
televised, one last week on New Jersey public television and one
scheduled Thursday on the cable news channel News 12 New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine replied that he had agreed to four debates and so would
agree to no others. He said network stations had been free to cover
any of the debates.

<HEADLINE> Helen Thomas Quits After UPI Sale  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Veteran White House correspondent Helen Thomas
resigned Tuesday from United Press International, ending a UPI
tenure that spanned six decades -- longer than the lives of
President Clinton and most of her press corps colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old Thomas announced her resignation a day after UPI
was sold to News World Communications Inc., the parent firm of The
Washington Times. News World Communications was founded by the Rev.
Sun Myung Moon, leader of the Unification Church.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas did not say why she quit UPI, which hired her as a
$24-a-week radio script writer during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no plans to join the new UPI,'' she said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nearly century-old United Press International is a great
news agency and has made a remarkable contribution to the legacy of
American journalism,'' she said. ''I have loved working for this
organization for 57 years in Washington, and especially loved
covering the White House. I wish the new management well and hope
they will continue the tradition in the future that this wire
service has represented.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She has outrun the best of them -- because she is the best of
them,'' said UPI Chief Executive Officer Arnaud de Borchgrave.
</P>
<P>
   Through the day, White House press corps colleagues wandered
over to UPI's corner booth in search of her, only to see her empty
desk, and its phone ringing unanswered. Thomas was in Indiana
promoting her memoirs, ''Front Row at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The news made its way into the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Presidents come and go, but Helen's been here,'' Clinton told
reporters. ''I'll feel a little better about my country if I know
she'll still be spending some time around here at the White House.
After all, without her saying, 'Thank you, Mr. President,' at least
some of us might never have ended our news conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart, who was barely a year old
when Thomas joined the White House beat, said her departure leaves
a void.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly hope she will find a way ... (to) bug me like
she's done since the day I took this job,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   De Borchgrave initially said Thomas would remain with UPI. Diane
Nine, Thomas' agent, said Thomas ''felt he misunderstood'' her
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's resigned from UPI. She does not plan on retiring,'' Nine
said. ''She is exploring a number of opportunities that are out
there. She hopes to be at the White House in the role of a
reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has been a White House fixture since the Kennedy
administration, covering eight presidents. She is known for her
terse, tough questioning of presidents and press secretaries alike.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, she was born in Lexington,
Ky., in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   United Press hired her in 1943 to write for the local radio wire
and edit city newswire copy. In 1956, Thomas was promoted to
covering the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, she was sent to cover John F. Kennedy's postelection
family vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., and went on to cover first
lady Jacqueline Kennedy. She was named UPI's chief White House
correspondent in 1970, the first woman to hold the job.
</P>
<P>
   She later became the first woman president of the Gridiron Club,
a once all-male journalistic group established in 1885, and of the
White House Correspondents Association.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas portrayed herself in the film ''The American President,''
and made a cameo appearance in Clinton's recent video spoof of his
lame duck days.
</P>
<P>
   In that video, Thomas was the lone reporter in the abandoned
White House briefing room, snoozing in the front row as Clinton
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton called for questions, Thomas snapped awake and
quipped: ''Are you still here?''

<HEADLINE> Miss. Construction Said Unjustified  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new independent analysis concludes that
costly lock expansions on the upper Mississippi River favored by an
Army Corps of Engineers study and the agribusiness industry are not
economically justified.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by a panel of economists unrelated to
players in the controversy over whether top corps officials
manufactured a case for the construction, is to be released
Thursday by the Northeast-Midwest Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's critical of the corps,'' the Institute's George Dusenbury
said Tuesday. He would not provide any other details.
</P>
<P>
   But a source knowledgeable about the report, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the economists found that the corps'
projections of future grain exports -- which largely drive the
amount of barge traffic on the river and thus the need for expanded
locks -- were way too high.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing is based on export demands that are just not
justified by the evidence,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute asked three economists -- Yale University's Steven
Berry, Geoffrey Hewings of the University of Illinois, and
Washington University's Charles Leven -- to review the corps'
7-year-old, $54 million study of what modernizations are needed on
the upper Mississippi River navigation system.
</P>
<P>
   The report was commissioned months before a whistleblower
alleged in February that top corps brass altered his original
conclusions to favor a $1 billion project to double the length of
seven barge locks on the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The sworn affidavit filed by corps economist Donald Sweeney
prompted ongoing investigations by the Army inspector general, the
National Academy of Sciences and several members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Corps officials have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying new
data -- not foul play -- has caused the still-unfinished study to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue the corps is too attentive to the needs
of politically connected agribusiness companies to the detriment of
the river's fragile ecosystem. They say the region cannot handle
more large-scale changes without serious losses in habitats and
fish and bird populations.
</P>
<P>
   But shipping interests predict traffic on the river will double,
meaning massive expansions to the navigation system are crucial to
ensuring that barges have faster, cheaper trips and Midwestern
grain is able to compete on the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, corps and Army officials told a Senate subcommittee
Tuesday that Congress has given a green light to $38 billion worth
of navigation, flood control and other water construction projects
without providing the corps with the funding to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous backlog -- the corps receives about $1.6 billion a
year for civil works construction -- is only expected to increase as
members of Congress approve more new projects. The shortfall
involves about 500 projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''The needs are not going away,'' said Sen. George Voinovich,
R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works
subcommittee on transportation and infrastructure. ''It's obvious
we need another billion at least.''
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of environmental groups suggested that the backlog
could be at least partially addressed by calling for a project's
benefits to be at least twice its costs and requiring the corps to
restore the same amount of wetlands now required of private
businesses. As a result, many projects now authorized would be
disqualified from funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of these projects which appear on paper to be justified
have turned out to be horribly unjustified,'' said Scott Faber with
American Rivers.

<HEADLINE> Jesse Jackson Delays Africa Trip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson is delaying a
five-nation trip to West Africa aimed at helping restore peace to
Sierra Leone, a State Department official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who serves as President Clinton's special envoy to
Africa, was scheduled to depart for Liberia on Tuesday but is
postponing his trip for unexplained reasons, said the official,
asking not to be identified. Jackson's office in Chicago had no
comment beyond what the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   No new date has been set. In addition to Liberia, Jackson plans
to visit Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the purpose of
Jackson's trip is to help resolve the Sierra Leone crisis and to
help the United Nations secure the release of U.N. hostages being
held by Sierra Leonean rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to reinstate a 1999 agreement that
temporarily ended the fighting in Sierra Leone. But Amnesty
International USA said in a statement Tuesday that President
Clinton should acknowledge that the agreement is beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States has demonstrated a lack of engagement with
the realities of ensuring justice and peace in Sierra Leone,'' said
AIUSA executive director William F. Shulz. ''This is an opportunity
to set a new policy that protects the human rights and safety of
the citizens of Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the flaws of the agreement was blanket amnesty
for human rights violations committed during eight years of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said a Marine Corps
officer and an Air Force master sergeant are in Sierra Leone to
coordinate with British officials on security needs at the airport
for possible future U.S. military flights.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has offered to fly peacekeepers from
Bangladesh and other countries into Sierra Leone to beef up the
U.N. peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said five more U.S. military personnel are scheduled to go
to Sierra Leone on Wednesday to perform a more in-depth assessment
of conditions at the airport. The five are scheduled to stay there
for two days.

<HEADLINE> US Notes Possible Caspian Oil Find  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The possibility of a new vast petroleum reserve
in the northern Caspian Sea near Kazakstan would, if confirmed,
have an enormously positive impact on that country and others in
the region, a State Department official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was
responding to an account in The Washington Post, which said that
initial indications suggest that the find may well be the largest
oil discovery worldwide in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's public response was cautious, with
spokesman Richard Boucher pointing out that the claims are based on
the production of a single well. He also noted that the commercial
interests involved have not made any announcements as yet.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the matter was one of great interest to the United
States, pointing out oil was high on the agenda of Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright during her recent trip to Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has taken a keen interest in the placement of
the pipelines that are planned or under construction for carrying
Caspian oil to European markets. Boucher said officials have
''worked very hard in a concerted way with the people of the
region'' on the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which traverses
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials noted that the administration wants to prevent
Iran and Russia, two other Caspian countries, from dominating the
oil trade in that region.

<HEADLINE> Dem Convention To Nominate Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, calling on her newly
adopted state to join her in a ''common mission,'' was to be
nominated for the Senate on Tuesday at the state Democratic Party's
convention.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady signed autographs and posed for pictures as she
waited for a vote on her Senate bid. Predicting ''we're going to be
victorious in November,'' she told reporters: ''I see the attention
as a wonderful indication of how everybody's going to pull
together.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton changed his schedule at the last minute
Tuesday to join the expected crowd of more than 5,000 people in a
sports arena. On Monday, aides to the Clintons had said he would
not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just decided I ought to be there,'' he said before leaving
Washington. ''It's a big deal for her, a big night for her and I
want to be there with her. I just want to be there to support
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was not expected to address the convention but did
plan to make remarks later Tuesday at a reception held by top New
York Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Advance copies of Mrs. Clinton's nomination acceptance speech
were not made available but her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said she
will ask New Yorkers to join her on a ''common mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new poll shows that the Republican Senate
candidate, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, is locked in a tight
race with Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac College Polling Institute survey had the first
lady favored by 44 percent of voters, while 43 percent said they
backed Giuliani. The numbers are statistically unchanged from a
Quinnipiac poll out May 1 that had Mrs. Clinton at 46 percent and
Giuliani at 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican state convention in Buffalo is just two weeks
away. Three weeks ago, the mayor stunned New York with the
announcement he has prostate cancer and might have to quit the
race. Things turned even more topsy-turvy when he announced that he
and his wife are headed for a separation.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani told supporters at a fund raiser Monday night that he
was ''very much inclined'' to stay in the race but still had to
determine his course of medical treatment before he could decide.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has faced charges from Giuliani of being a
carpetbagger -- she moved to New York in January -- Democrats
outnumber Republicans almost 5-to-3 in New York.

<HEADLINE> House Mulls Tougher Sleepwear Rules  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since a federal agency lowered fire safety
standards for children's pajamas, one of the nation's top burn
hospitals for children has seen the number of sleepwear-related
serious burns more than double in three years, officials told a
congressional committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are now weighing whether to repeal the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we as physicians who care for burned children can say to
you is that we are seeing more burn injuries involving sleepwear
and what should be categorized as sleepwear than ever before,'' Dr.
David N. Herndon of the Shriners Hospitals for Children told a
House Commerce subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to raise the overall standards for children's
sleepwear and daywear to protect our most vulnerable citizens -- our
infants and children,'' Herndon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission voted 2-1 in 1996 to
permit the use of flammable material, such as cotton, in some
children's sleepwear as long as the garments were snug-fitting and
thus difficult to ignite. The standard was dropped completely for
sleepwear for children younger than nine months, who are immobile
and unable to move to sources of fire, such as a candle or a
lighter.
</P>
<P>
   The decision relaxed a 1972 requirement that all children's
pajamas, nightgowns and other sleepwear be made of flame-resistant
materials.
</P>
<P>
   The standard was changed because many parents were putting
children to bed in loose, cotton T-shirts that were highly
flammable, commissioners said. These parents wanted natural fabrics
rather than synthetics or chemically treated cotton, both of which
met the standard. The commission decided that snug sleepwear, even
untreated, was safe for young children.
</P>
<P>
   Commission spokesman Russ Rader said the Shriners' survey was
misleading since the standards are designed to protect children
from small open flames, not huge house fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a whole house fire or a situation...even a flame resistant
sleeper is not going to protect the child,'' Rader said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Shriners Hospitals, their hospitals treated 14
children in 1995-1996 for sleepwear-related burn injuries. The year
1997 was not included because it was a transition year for the new
rules. By the 1998-1999 period, the number of children treated at
Shriners for sleepwear-rleated burns had increased to 36.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing-related burn injuries, from garments that were not
technically sleepwear but may have been used to sleep in, increased
from 70 to 147 in the same time span, the hospitals' survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers expressed their concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children can't run from fires,'' said Rep. John Shimkus,
R-Ill., as he held his 7-month-old son Daniel in the hearing. ''Why
should we have a separate standard?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the author of legislation to
repeal the 1996 rules, ''We must not wait for more children to be
burned before we accept the simple fact that the stronger standard
is better.''

<HEADLINE> Windshield Fluid Bottles Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 335,000 bottles of Aqua Mist Windshield
Washer Fluid are being recalled because they are not childproof and
the methanol can cause blindness and death if ingested, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The recall covers the one-gallon bottles with twist-off caps
made by Filter Tech Inc., of Huntington, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no injuries have been reported, but the recall is being
conducted to prevent the possibility of injury, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Superamerica and other automotive stores in Kentucky,
Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia sold the windshield
washer fluid from October 1999 through April 2000 for about $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   The commission advised that consumers immediately return the
bottles to the store where they purchased them for a full refund,
exchange or child-resistant cap.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can also get more information by calling Filter Tech
at (800) 834-5832.
</P>
<P>
   Aqua Mist bottles with caps marked ''while pushing down, turn,
close tightly'' are child-resistant and not being recalled.

<HEADLINE> Bush Injects Self in Kosovo Debate  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate efforts to impose a July 2001 deadline
for withdrawing U.S. troops from Kosovo became entangled in
presidential politics on Tuesday as Republican George W. Bush
signaled opposition to the plan as ''legislative overreach.''
</P>
<P>
   Such opposition would likely kill the proposal, said Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, tied up in parliamentary knots over a separate
issue, did not get around as scheduled on Tuesday to debating the
amendment by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner,
R-Va., and Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-Va.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, which initially appeared to be picking up growing
GOP support, would cut funds for the 5,900 U.S. troops in Kosovo
beyond July 1, 2001, unless Clinton or his successor first obtained
express congressional approval for keeping them there.
</P>
<P>
   But top Republicans said that Bush's newly expressed opposition
to the measure threw new uncertainty into the debate. The
veto-threatened amendment is part of a $6.8 billion spending bill
for military construction.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators said that Bush's opposition was initially
conveyed privately to them.
</P>
<P>
   But late Tuesday, Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClelland
confirmed that the GOP presidential candidate had serious
reservations about the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton-Gore administration has failed to instill trust in
Congress and the American people when it comes to our military and
deployment of troops overseas. But the governor does not believe
this provision is the way to resolve the lack of presidential
leadership. Gov. Bush views it as a legislative overreach on the
powers of the presidency,'' McClelland said, reading a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Gov. Bush objects, the amendment is dead,'' said Stevens,
who is a co-sponsor of the withdrawal proposal. ''Among our people,
there are enough who will support the Bush position.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and a principal opponent of the
amendment, said, ''I'm pleased that this would be his point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugar said that Bush did not appear to be calling senators
directly -- but was clearly passing the word along through his
campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the amendment, Bush was siding with former rival
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who backed Bush's presidential bid last week, told
reporters he felt the amendment was ''inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to fight strenuously to have this language taken
from the bill. It's unnecessary,'' McCain said. ''I think we should
wait until after this election before we make fundamental changes
in our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who oversaw the NATO air war
as Supreme Allied Commander Europe, met privately with senators to
lodge his objections to the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Armed
Services Committee, said that Clark suggested the troop withdrawal
measure would create ''a year of uncertainty'' in the Balkans and
embolden Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Amendment sponsor Warner said he ''respectfully disagreed'' with
the four-star general.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody says Milosevic is going to get a signal. We have
adequate military firepower to knock him back on anything he does
and believe me, Milosevic knows that,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying military construction bill would provide funds
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 for the construction of
barracks, family housing, military hospitals and child care
centers. It is usually the least controversial of the 13
appropriations bills Congress must pass each year to keep the
government running.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed its version of the bill by a 380-22 margin on
Tuesday in less than an hour of debate. The House bill does not
contain a provision dealing with Kosovo troops.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are S. 2521 and H.R. 4425

<HEADLINE> Ecstasy May Dull Intelligence  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Even light weekend use of the party drug Ecstasy
might harm intelligence, a new study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   German scientists report that weeks after partying, those who
used Ecstasy along with marijuana performed worse on intelligence
tests than people who just smoked pot or took no drugs at all.
Their results are reported this week in the Journal of Neurology,
Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy, a hybrid of the hallucinogen mescaline and the
stimulant amphetamine chemically known as MDMA, has been popular
among young clubgoers in Europe for years and recently has become
increasingly widespread in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have suggested the drug can cause a long-term
decrease in a brain chemical involved with thought and memory.
Other research has indicated Ecstasy can impair brain function, but
mostly investigated people who used it more often or with other
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest research, by scientists at the University of Aachen
in Germany, also assessed a broader range of cognitive functions
than any other study to date.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leschner, director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug
Abuse, said the study provides the first clear demonstration of
what was predicted from earlier studies linking the drug to changes
in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ''If your brain is getting zinged, then you ought to have some
kind of deficit in cognitive ability, and here it is,'' Leschner
said. ''There is this misconception that it's a benign, fun drug,
and it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 28 Ecstasy users in their mid-20s recruited
off the dance floor of a nightclub. They also were pot smokers, but
did not get drunk often and did not regularly take other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because almost every Ecstasy user smokes cannabis, it was
impossible to recruit a reasonable number of exclusive Ecstasy
users,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers therefore compared the group to two others of
the same size, age range and education level -- one consisting of
drug-free people and another of people who smoked about as much pot
as the Ecstasy group but did not take any other drug.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy users abstained for about three weeks and everybody in
the study passed urine tests for traces of other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects were given general knowledge tests to make sure one
group was not naturally more intelligent than the other. They then
spent three hours taking psychological tests that evaluated
everything from immediate memory to logical thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecstasy group performed just as well as the other two on
simple tests of alertness, but worse in more complex tasks of
attention, in memory and learning tests, and in tasks reflecting
aspects of general intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The more Ecstasy they used, the worse they performed on the
tests, but their scores still were in the ''normal'' range.
</P>
<P>
   Those who only smoked pot performed no differently than those
who were drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were not heavy Ecstasy users. On average, they took four
tablets a month -- that's one every weekend,'' said Dr. Euphrosyne
Gouzoulis-Mayfrank, the neurologist who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Callaghan, a neurotoxicologist at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said that even though
the study showed worse test scores for Ecstasy users, that would
not matter if the effect of the drug was only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not evidence that brain damage has occurred, that it's
not reversible or that the lower intelligence wasn't there to begin
with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is illegal, it is difficult to measure how widely
Ecstasy is used. But a 1998 survey by the U.S. National Institute
on Drug Abuse found that an estimated 1.5 percent of Americans 12
years old or older, or 3.4 million people, had used it at least
once.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy users report the drug can break down barriers and make
people trust each other.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Make Trucks Cut Pollution  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The Environmental Protection Agency will
require large trucks and tractor-trailer rigs to cut pollution by
more than 90 percent as well as require cleaner diesel fuel under
new regulations to be proposed this week, government and private
sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which has been debated at the White House for
months, also will require that refiners produce low-sulfur diesel
so the fuel does not interfere with pollution control devices
needed to comply with the stiffer emission standards, according to
the sources.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements represent the most stringent environmental
controls ever imposed on large tractor-trailer rigs and heavy duty
trucks that critics say are major contributors to soot and
smog-causing chemicals in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is expected to announce the proposed
regulations on Wednesday, which will be made final before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations have been the focus of intense lobbying with the
petroleum industry, truck engine manufacturers and the trucking
industry arguing that the rules will be too costly, cause problems
with diesel supplies and may not be technically feasible in the
required time frame.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will require that the cleaner diesel contain no more
than 15 parts per million of sulfur, beginning in 2007. That's a 95
percent reduction from current sulfur levels in fuel used by large
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers will have to begin reducing the amount of soot and
smog-causing nitrogen oxide coming from new large trucks beginning
with their 2007 models, although part of the standards will be
phased in over four years, according to sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   While the regulations will apply only to new trucks and truck
engines, federal regulators and environmentalists say they hope the
new standards also will lead to existing trucks becoming cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and state air pollution regulators have argued
for years that the government should tighten pollution controls on
trucks, which they say, account for half of the soot and a quarter
of the smog-causing chemicals that come from motor vehicle
tailpipes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's big rigs are like rolling smokestacks,'' says Candace
Morey, a transportation analyst for the Union of Concerned
Scientists, an environmental advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial
Air Pollution Program Administrators, said that if the EPA requires
the new emission controls, ''it will prevent tens of thousands of
cancers and result in huge pollution reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   Diesel exhaust particulates -- or microscopic soot -- is
classified by the federal National Toxicology Program as
''reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen,'' according to
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Cancerous
tumors have been found in rats after exposure to diesel exhausts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the sources, the proposed EPA regulations would
require:
</P>
<P>
   -- Diesel exhaust particulate, or soot, be cut to 0.01 grams per
unit of engine energy, compared to 0.1 under current standards.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nitrogen oxide emission must be reduced to 0.2 grams per unit
of engine energy, compared to the current 2.5 grams. These
reductions can be phased in so not all new trucks would be required
to meet them until 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Engine manufacturers have said that such emission reductions
would require sophisticated new pollution control devices, that
need extremely clean diesel fuel to work properly.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the EPA will require that the amount of sulfur in
diesel fuel be cut to no more than 15 parts per million, from the
current 340 to 500 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sulfur levels have prompted heated debate within
the administration and vigorous lobbying by the oil industry, which
had recommended cutting sulfur levels to 50 parts per million.
Industry executives questioned whether the EPA requirement can be
met without supply disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that's excessively costly,'' said Ed Murphy of the
American Petroleum Institute, referring to the EPA proposal. ''It's
going to interfere with distillate supplies and doesn't get any
more environmental benefits over the proposal we made.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs of the clear diesel are unclear. But Murphy said that
some refiners will be unable to afford the capital improvements to
meet the proposed standard.

<HEADLINE> NM Residents Return to Burned Homes  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The thousands of people streaming back
into fire-devastated Los Alamos on Tuesday found smoke still
lingering in the air and most stores closed or without such staples
as meat and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   It was a city entirely different from the one they had left just
six days before, when they fled ahead of a wall of flames that
raced up the sides of canyons and left 405 families homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory remained closed, and
pockets of the town remained without gas or electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our neighborhood burned down. What happens now? Are people
going to leave? Are they going to stick around and rebuild?''
wondered Jerry Kindsfather, who with his brother Gary operates Ed's
Food Market, a small grocery store on the edge of one of the city's
hardest-hit sections. People filed in Tuesday to stock up on things
like eggs, milk and bread.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty percent of Los Alamos, where the homes burned, was still
off-limits Tuesday, and the devastation there appeared
overwhelming. Entire neighborhoods were burned by a fire that left
the few trees still standing looking like blackened toothpicks.
Smoke from the fire, now burning a safe distance away, still filled
the canyons.
</P>
<P>
   The 46,000-acre fire, 35 percent contained, was moving
northeast, away from Los Alamos and toward unburned forest land
Tuesday, said David Seesholtz, a fire information spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It started outside of town on National Park Service land on May
4, at Bandelier Monument, when a controlled burn meant to clear
away dry brush and prevent future wildfires was pushed out of
control by high winds.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the danger, all 11,000 residents of Los Alamos
and 14,000 people from surrounding communities were ordered out of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the devastated neighborhoods, the fire raced down block after
block, destroying almost everything in its path, but occasionally
sparing a home here or there. On one street, a big blue house was
still standing, while everything around it burned. On another, a
two-story salmon-colored residence stood untouched, the only home
left on the block.
</P>
<P>
   John Jaramillo's house and restaurant survived, but his
girlfriend lost her home. They weren't sure they wanted to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of me wants to help rebuild the town and the other part
wants to just pack it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of Los Alamos had its electricity back on
Tuesday, said Chris Ortega, utilities manager for Los Alamos
County. He said it would be at least another day before power was
restored everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gas is also available to about 75 percent of the town, but even
in areas where it has been restored it won't be turned on for
individual homes until people return and request it. Utility
workers were circling neighborhoods Tuesday, volunteering to turn
on the gas wherever they found someone home, Ortega said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 2,000 people who were still not allowed to return
home were briefly escorted by the National Guard into the
devastated area so they could retrieve personal belongings such as
clothes and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''The freezers have just got to be a mess. We're hoping to grab
garbage bags and throw everything in there,'' said Mary Holmes, who
went with her husband, Herb, to Los Alamos High School to arrange a
National Guard escort.
</P>
<P>
   At Ed's Market, Kindsfather returned to find refrigerators
filled with spoiled eggs and melted ice cream that had oozed out of
containers and formed a colorful sludge on the shelves. He also had
to dump $20,000 worth of frozen food and won't get another order
until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got rid of the chicken first,'' he said. ''That's like a
time bomb sitting around.''
</P>
<P>
   At the True Value hardware store, manager Dennis George expects
to do a brisk business in the days ahead in buckets, brooms,
hammers, nails, flashlights and axes.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the first sales his employee Brenda Law made Tuesday
was for flower seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone has their own way of healing,'' she said, ''and
flowers represent life.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Reform U.N. Peacekeeping  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. peacekeeping system is on the
brink of collapse and the world body urgently needs to reform its
organization and financing, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless we act together, peacekeeping will fail, crippled by an
organizational and financial system that cannot support the
increasing demands now being put on it by the member states,''
Holbrooke told the General Assembly committee, which controls the
peacekeeping budget.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said the United Nations had to learn from its errors,
including in the current operation in Sierra Leone where fighting
has resumed and rebels hold 350 U.N. peacekeepers hostage. The
United Nations has been criticized for sending poorly equipped and
badly trained soldiers to the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failures in Sierra Leone or elsewhere will inevitably cast a
shadow over the U.N.'s successes,'' Holbrooke said. ''Unless we
move decisively, those who threaten peacekeepers in Africa and
elsewhere may draw the conclusion that -- rhetoric and resolutions
aside -- the U.N. lacks the will, the cohesion and the resources to
challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most countries agreed that reform was needed to render
U.N. peacekeeping more effective, there was widespread disagreement
on how to go about it -- and most of all on how to reform the
financing.,
</P>
<P>
   Many developing countries said peacekeeping operations did not
have the necessary funds because the United States was not paying
its dues.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's Ambassador Arthur Mbanefo, speaking on behalf of the
G-77, a U.N. lobbying group of developing countries and China that
now includes 133 nations, said the U.S. had to pay up its arrears
on time and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has made U.N. reform a condition of paying its
arrears which the United Nations say now total $1.8 billion.
Holbrooke said it was high time for other countries to finance
peace missions.
</P>
<P>
   The funding of peacekeeping operations is based on a scale
agreed to in 1973 for a peace operation in the Sinai. The United
States, which according to the scale must pay 31 percent of all
peacekeeping operations, says the agreement was not supposed to be
used as a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, Holbrooke said, ''54 countries have joined the U.N.
Some have grown richer, some poorer; some more and some less active
on the world stage. Yet the peacekeeping assessment system has
remained the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States suggested a new assessment bracket for some
countries and a minimum assessment rate for the five permanent
Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke praised Cyprus for announcing Tuesday that it was
voluntarily contributing more to peacekeeping. Another Western
diplomat said Israel, Hungary, Estonia and the Philippines had also
agreed to increase their contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But Mbanefo said the G-77 opposed any unilateral change in
assessments and said any discussion must take into account the
economic conditions of developing countries and must not be
conducted ''under pressure of time.''

<HEADLINE> Florida Has Key Role in Election  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The presidential campaign in Florida
should be about Social Security, Medicare and prescription drugs,
not a little Cuban boy, says 76-year-old Anita Finkelson.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, fighting uphill in this critical state, couldn't agree
more. And he's trying to change the subject back in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way Democrats are talking about these issues is better for
us,'' Finkelson said, as she and her husband Seymour left a
shopping center in this affluent south Florida community in Palm
Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   And when the vice president addresses an AARP convention in
Orlando on Wednesday, he will undoubtedly talk about such issues as
protecting Social Security and helping the elderly get health care.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would like the race to focus on George W. Bush's
proposals -- a big tax cut, local control of government and freedom
for individuals to invest Social Security money -- as well as Bush's
claim that Gore is willing to say whatever it takes to get elected.
</P>
<P>
   The party also is counting on Gov. Jeb Bush's continuing
popularity to work in his brother's favor come November. ''George
W. Bush should have the advantage in Florida,'' says former GOP
state chair Tom Slade.
</P>
<P>
   What Gore said in the case of Elian Gonzalez -- that the issue
should be decided in a family court -- was consistent with the
desires of the Cuban-American community in Miami. But it struck
many voters elsewhere as political pandering. And the Cuban
Americans ended up outraged at the Clinton administration's Miami
raid anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you asked me a few months ago, I would have said Florida
was really in play, but the Elian fiasco really hurt Gore, not
really among Cuban Americans, but among white, independent and
Democratic voters,'' said independent pollster Jim Kane.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state, but Bush was at 47
percent and Gore at 40 in a recent Florida poll.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton won Florida in 1996 by splitting the vote in
many counties throughout the state and overwhelming Republicans in
the three big counties in south Florida -- Palm Beach, Broward and
Dade, now called Miami-Dade.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic chairman Bob Poe visited south Florida recently
to assess the fallout from the Gonzalez case and he says Florida is
still competitive for the November election. But even if the Elian
fallout blows over, Gore has a battle for Florida's 25 electoral
votes, the fourth most in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore lacks charisma, lacks vision, lacks the excitement'' that
enabled Clinton to draw support of other voters than Democrats,''
said Republican Rep. Mark Foley of Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Copeland, a 33-year-old resident of Boynton Beach, said most
of his friends are for Bush and don't give Democrats much credit
for the strong economy. While Palm Beach County, about 50 miles
north of Miami, leans Democratic, plenty of Republicans live there.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're tired of Clinton,'' Copeland said of the people in his
neighborhood, adding the best thing about Bush is ''that he's not
Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''With his brother as governor in a strong Republican state and
the Cubans behind him, if Bush can't win this one, then he's not
going to win the election,'' said political scientist James Witt of
the University of West Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Merle Black of Emory University agrees that
the GOP has advantages, but he adds, ''Florida is a state Democrats
can win, a state Republicans can't take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez case also hurt Gore among Florida blacks, many of
whom believe preferential treatment is given to Cuban Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore made his hill higher to hustle,'' said Rep. Alcee
Hastings, a Democratic congressman from south Florida. ''But by
Labor Day, it is conceivable that his misstep on Elian Gonzalez
might be a fading memory.''
</P>
<P>
   A solid bloc of Cuban-American voters for Bush means Gore will
have to get more support around the state from seniors citizens,
blacks, suburbanites and even the ''Dixiecrats'' of north Florida,
who often vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, several old Cuban men paused from their game of
dominoes to consider whether Gore had much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout Miami, Gore will get few votes,'' said Armando
Gutierrez, 80, as he clicked the dominoes in preparation for
another game. At a nearby cigar shop in Little Havana, a mention of
Democrats brought a derisive chant from the women as they rolled
cigars: ''Clinton forget it, Clinton goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's vice president says he's not giving up on the state.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope strong showings by Senate candidate Bill Nelson,
a former congressman, as well as several strong congressional
challengers, will cut into Republican advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, a popular Florida Democrat, has been mentioned
frequently as a vice presidential possibility, and by all accounts
that choice would give Gore a boost in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Florida campaign manager Bob Butterworth said he's been
assured the Democrat will compete in the state until Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the experts tell me,'' Butterworth said, ''is that if Al
Gore wins Florida he'll be president.'' Then Gore's man added, ''If
he loses Florida, he could still be president.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Joins in Kosovo Debate  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate efforts to impose a July 2001 deadline
for withdrawing U.S. troops from Kosovo became entangled in
presidential politics on Tuesday as Republican George W. Bush
signaled opposition to the plan as ''legislative overreach.''
</P>
<P>
   Such opposition would likely kill the proposal, said Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, tied up in parliamentary knots over a separate
issue, did not get around as scheduled on Tuesday to debating the
amendment by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner,
R-Va., and Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, which initially appeared to be picking up growing
GOP support, would cut funds for the 5,900 U.S. troops in Kosovo
beyond July 1, 2001, unless Clinton or his successor first obtained
express congressional approval for keeping them there.
</P>
<P>
   But top Republicans said that Bush's newly expressed opposition
to the measure threw new uncertainty into the debate. The
veto-threatened amendment is part of a $6.8 billion spending bill
for military construction.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators said that Bush's opposition was initially
conveyed privately to them.
</P>
<P>
   But late Tuesday, Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClelland
confirmed that the GOP presidential candidate had serious
reservations about the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton-Gore administration has failed to instill trust in
Congress and the American people when it comes to our military and
deployment of troops overseas. But the governor does not believe
this provision is the way to resolve the lack of presidential
leadership. Gov. Bush views it as a legislative overreach on the
powers of the presidency,'' McClelland said, reading a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Gov. Bush objects, the amendment is dead,'' said Stevens,
who is a co-sponsor of the withdrawal proposal. ''Among our people,
there are enough who will support the Bush position.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and a principal opponent of the
amendment, said, ''I'm pleased that this would be his point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugar said that Bush did not appear to be calling senators
directly -- but was clearly passing the word along through his
campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the amendment, Bush was siding with former rival
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who backed Bush's presidential bid last week, told
reporters he felt the amendment was ''inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to fight strenuously to have this language taken
from the bill. It's unnecessary,'' McCain said. ''I think we should
wait until after this election before we make fundamental changes
in our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Army Gen. Wesley Clark, who oversaw the NATO air war
as Supreme Allied Commander Europe, met privately with senators to
lodge his objections to the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Armed
Services Committee, said that Clark suggested the troop withdrawal
measure would create ''a year of uncertainty'' in the Balkans and
embolden Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Amendment sponsor Warner said he ''respectfully disagreed'' with
the four-star general.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody says Milosevic is going to get a signal. We have
adequate military firepower to knock him back on anything he does
and believe me, Milosevic knows that,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying military construction bill would provide funds
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 for the construction of
barracks, family housing, military hospitals and child care
centers. It is usually the least controversial of the 13
appropriations bills Congress must pass each year to keep the
government running.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed its version of the bill by a 380-22 margin on
Tuesday in less than an hour of debate. The House bill does not
contain a provision dealing with Kosovo troops.	   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bills are S. 2521 and H.R. 4425

<HEADLINE> Gore Explains Stock Market Stance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Missing out on maybe millions in Wall Street's
bull market ''is not the greatest thing in the world,'' Vice
President Al Gore said with a touch of wistfulness Tuesday. ''But
for me it was the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was explaining his spokesman's surprising revelation a day
earlier that the Democratic presidential candidate has no
investments in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Twenty-four years ago when I ran for Congress, for good or ill
I made the decision that in order to avoid even the appearance of
any conflict of interest on the many subjects that would come up
for a vote,'' Gore said at a news conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''Missing the bull market is not the greatest thing in the world
financially but for me it was the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added that his wife Tipper once owned stock in her father's
plumbing supply company but no longer does.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Urged on Ritalin Money  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA MCQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children are selling Ritalin to their friends
in the school yard. Principals and teachers are stealing it from
the school nurses' office. Educators tell parents to give the mild
stimulant to their children so they behave in class.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers examining the use of Ritalin heard these and other
stories Tuesday and also were asked to provide more money for
researching into the drug's use -- and its abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the pill is a lifesaver that allows a child overcome
a serious behavior disorder. But concern also is being raised over
whether the medicine is over-prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do not give into the sensationalism now associated with the
name Ritalin,'' Mary Robertson, of Lexington, Ky., told a
congressional hearing. Her two children suffer from attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, a condition often treated with the
drug. She said she wants government to support more research into
the cause and treatment of her children's disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson recalled that searching for the right combination of
medication and therapy to help one of her sons. ''The guilt of
turning to medication took years to overcome,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the lawmakers on the House Education and Workforce
Committee, who are reviewing major laws governing schools, said
Tuesday the drug's growing use is a cause of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's being overused and we're making a huge mistake,'' said
Rep. Lynn Woolsley, D-Calif., a member of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa., said special education budgets
are being stretched further by increasing numbers of children that
may be falsely diagnosed with the type of behavior disorders
treated by Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's find out where it's legitimate (to use) and where it's
not legitimate,'' Goodling said. ''Let's not continue to hook
little children on such a tremendous drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies document Ritalin's rise in use and abuse: the
United States makes and uses 85 percent of the world's supply; 1 in
5 college students take it recreationally and more toddlers are
getting prescriptions for it -- despite opposition by the drug's
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the drug was linked to the death of a 14-year-old
Michigan boy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence Diller, a San Francisco pediatrician who has
prescribed the drug for 22 years, told lawmakers he began to
question his own actions after seeing a growing number of parents
of preschoolers and teen-agers demanding the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wondered if Tom Sawyer or Pippi Longstocking would also
leave with a Ritalin prescription,'' Diller said of the fictional
children known for their mischief-making.
</P>
<P>
   He urged more attention to reducing class sizes and helping
parents stressed by work and child-rearing, instead of so quickly
turning to the drug for help.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Hillary Rodham Clinton, announced a task force to
study the use of the prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Woodworth, a Drug Enforcement Administration official,
urged lawmakers to keep watch on how Ritalin is handled in schools.
He told them, for example, one teacher was secretly videotaped
stealing a stash from the nurses' office during an awards ceremony.
In another school, a child was caught giving nearly a month's
supply of his medicine to his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''Few schools kept records,'' Woodworth said. ''Frequently
supplies were kept in unlocked desks and a variety of people were
tasked with giving medication to students. Many junior and senior
high school students carried or administered their own
medication.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said, ''It's not fair to ask
administrators and teachers to take on the role of physicians and
pharmacists.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Ecstasy Drug May Dull Mind  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Even light weekend use of the party drug Ecstasy
might harm intelligence, a new study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   German scientists report that weeks after partying, those who
used Ecstasy along with marijuana performed worse on intelligence
tests than people who just smoked pot or took no drugs at all.
Their results are reported this week in the Journal of Neurology,
Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy, chemically known as MDMA, has been popular among young
clubgoers in Europe for years but recently has become increasingly
widespread in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have suggested the drug can cause a long-term
decrease in a brain chemical involved with thought and memory.
Other research has indicated Ecstasy can impair brain function, but
mostly investigated people who used it more often or with other
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest research, by scientists at the University of Aachen
in Germany, also assessed a broader range of cognitive functions
than any other study to date.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Leschner, director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug
Abuse, said the study provides the first clear demonstration of
what was predicted from earlier studies linking the drug to changes
in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ''If your brain is getting zinged, then you ought to have some
kind of deficit in cognitive ability, and here it is,'' Leschner
said. ''There is this misconception that it's a benign, fun drug,
and it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 28 Ecstasy users in their mid-20s recruited
off the dance floor of a nightclub. They also were pot smokers, but
did not get drunk often and did not regularly take other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because almost every Ecstasy user smokes cannabis, it was
impossible to recruit a reasonable number of exclusive Ecstasy
users,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers therefore compared the group to two others of
the same size, age range and education level -- one consisting of
drug-free people and another of people who smoked about as much pot
as the Ecstasy group but did not take any other drug.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy users abstained for about three weeks and everybody in
the study passed urine tests for traces of other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects were given general knowledge tests to make sure one
group was not naturally more intelligent than the other. They then
spent three hours taking psychological tests that evaluated
everything from immediate memory to logical thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecstasy group performed just as well as the other two on
simple tests of alertness, but worse in more complex tasks of
attention, in memory and learning tests, and in tasks reflecting
aspects of general intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The more Ecstasy they used, the worse they performed on the
tests, but their scores still were in the ''normal'' range.
</P>
<P>
   Those who only smoked pot performed no differently than those
who were drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were not heavy Ecstasy users. On average, they took four
tablets a month -- that's one every weekend,'' said Dr. Euphrosyne
Gouzoulis-Mayfrank, the neurologist who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Callaghan, a neurotoxicologist at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said that even though
the study showed worse test scores for Ecstasy users, that would
not matter if the effect of the drug was only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not evidence that brain damage has occurred, that it's
not reversible or that the lower intelligence wasn't there to begin
with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is illegal, it is difficult to measure how widely
Ecstasy is used. But a 1998 survey by the U.S. National Institute
on Drug Abuse found that an estimated 1.5 percent of Americans 12
years old or older, or 3.4 million people, had used it at least
once.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy users report the drug can break down barriers and make
people trust each other.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Feinstein Helps Disabled Woman  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced
legislation Tuesday to grant citizenship to a disabled woman born
in India who suffers from illnesses that make it impossible for her
to take the oath of allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   The California Democrat urged Congress to take immediate action
for 24-year-old Vijai Rajan, whose family members have already been
granted citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ms. Rajan has been left out of her family's American dream for
no other reason than because her physical disabilities prevent her
from taking the oath of allegiance,'' Feinstein said. ''I urge my
colleagues to act on this private legislation and to grant Ms.
Rajan citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., also has submitted a bill to the
House to make the Anaheim woman a citizen, saying the way the
Immigration and Naturalization Service handled the case was
''appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   Rajan suffers from cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, seizures
and Crohn's disease, a severe intestinal ailment. She uses a
wheelchair and receives 24-hour care. She cannot understand, recite
or raise her hand to take the oath.
</P>
<P>
   Born when her mother was visiting India, Rajan has lived in the
United States since she was a baby and has a green card. Her father
became a naturalized citizen in 1980, her mother in 1994. Her older
sister was born in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rajan's parents sought citizenship for their daughter in 1994,
when she turned 18. Officials denied the application in 1998 and
rejected an appeal the following year, citing ''applicant's
inability to comprehend the oath of allegiance due to medical
certified condition,'' according to INS documents.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Sunder Rajan, filed a federal discrimination lawsuit
in April to force the INS to grant her citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was excited by Feinstein's legislation, he said he
would not drop the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these are good things and I'd like to believe it's going
to happen, that Vijai will become a citizen,'' he said. ''But until
that happens, I cannot afford to let go of any options, including
the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS would not comment, citing the pending litigation.

<HEADLINE> Justice 21 Years After Fatal Fire  </HEADLINE>
By MARK PRATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOANNA, S.C. (AP) -- Vera Johnson always had suspicions about the
fire that killed her son in his mobile home 21 years ago, despite
investigators' ruling that the blaze was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Now she may get justice.
</P>
<P>
   Harold David Scott III, who is serving a four-year robbery
sentence at a federal prison in Atlanta, was charged recently with
murder in the death of Johnson's son, William Robert Beeks. Scott's
mother turned him in.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was 15 at the time of the deadly fire and apparently
thought that Beeks, 36, was trying to steal his girlfriend,
relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew all the time that someone killed William, but I thought
they had given up on it,'' Johnson, 79, said Tuesday at her modest
home. ''I thought the case was closed forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in 1979 said the fire that killed Beeks -- a
carpenter and father of five -- was caused by a cigarette in his
bedroom. His body was found near a door, but the doors were
tampered with so they couldn't be opened from inside, said Beeks'
brother-in-law, Jim Overstreet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scott assumed William was going after his girlfriend and he
decided to get even with him,'' said Jeanette Overstreet, Beeks'
sister. But she doesn't think Beeks even knew Scott or the
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Scott's mother went to the sheriff's office in
nearby Union County and told deputies that her son set the fire,
Laurens County sheriff's Capt. Joe Koon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scott always denied it to law enforcement, but he told it to
close family and they all cooperated with us,'' Koon said.
</P>
<P>
   The murder warrant for Scott was issued earlier this month but
had not been served by Tuesday. It was unclear whether he had an
attorney who could comment on the new developments.
</P>
<P>
   Beeks' family would like to see Scott tried as an adult despite
his age at the time of the fire. Prosecutor Townes Jones did not
immediately return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad they're putting it to rest,'' Jim Overstreet said.
''But it's taking my wife back to that period of time and really
upsetting her -- that's the really sad part.''

   Harris said the visit doesn't mean McCain has patched up his
differences with the state GOP. The Arizona senator canceled two
events with Republican candidates in Michigan this week after
accusing the party of ignoring a delegate selection agreement at
its convention last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement -- signed by McCain, Gov. John Engler
and others -- the people elected as McCain's 46 national convention
delegates were supposed to be McCain supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But in many districts, supporters of presumptive Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush were elected instead. Harris
said after the convention that only about 15 McCain activists won
seats.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won 52 of Michigan's 58 delegate seats by winning the
state's GOP presidential primary in February. After suspending his
campaign in March, he gave six seats to Bush.

<HEADLINE> Rams' Warner Has Emergency Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SALTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Super Bowl MVP Kurt Warner had emergency
surgery for an inflamed appendix Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback was in good condition after the operation, which
took about an hour, the St. Louis Rams said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not in any pain right now,'' his wife, Brenda, said .
''He's eating clear fluids right now. He had some Jell-O. He's
doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her husband was already up and walking around Tuesday
evening. That was ahead of the schedule Rams coach Mike Martz was
hoping for. Earlier Tuesday, Martz predicted it would take Warner a
day or so to return to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as his participation in the next minicamp, we'll have
to wait and see,'' Martz said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's agent, Mark Bartelstein, told St. Louis television
station KTVI that Warner became ill over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Rams team physician Bernard Garfinkel told St. Louis television
station KSDK there was a chance Warner's appendix could have
eventually burst.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to protect the appendix from rupturing and spreading
infection into the free abdomen,'' he said. ''He was no where close
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner led the Rams' remarkable rise in 1999. A year removed
from a 4-12 season, the Rams went 13-3 and beat the Tennessee
Titans 23-16 in the Super Bowl. Warner was named MVP for both the
regular season and the title game.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, Warner was bagging groceries at a Hy-Vee
store in Iowa. He eventually landed in the Arena Football League
and World League before becoming a third-string quarterback for the
Rams in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He won the starting job last season only after Trent Green went
down with a season-ending knee injury in preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Warner passed for 4,353 yards, completed 65.1 percent of his
passes and had a quarterback rating of 109.2. He threw 41 touchdown
passes, becoming only the second player to top 40.
</P>
<P>
   Warner attended the Rams' April 28-30 minicamp.

<HEADLINE> Railroad Killer Trial Nears End  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Even if confessed railroad killer Angel Maturino
Resendiz is mentally ill, it doesn't mean he was legally insane
when he killed a genetic researcher, a court-appointed psychologist
testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Laval concluded his second day on the witness stand by
explaining to the jury that mental illness and insanity are
different concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can have one without the other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Maturino Resendiz have said he was responsible for
nine murders in three states and entered a plea of innocent by
reason of insanity in the 1998 rape-slaying of Dr. Claudia Benton.
</P>
<P>
   Laval and an FBI psychologist were the final witnesses to
testify before the prosecution rested its rebuttal phase. The jury
is expected to receive the case after hearing closing arguments
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Laval determined that the 40-year-old Mexican citizen suffers
from several personality disorders that cause him to have
unorthodox thoughts about religion, politics and his own purported
supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Maturino Resendiz' unusual value system and apparent
belief that he was an agent of God, Laval told the jury that his
condition does not rise to the level of acute mental illness the
defense tried to prove.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Allen Tanner noted that the rail-riding drifter
was on antipsychotic medication for depression-related psychosis
when Laval interviewed him in April. Two defense experts, who both
blamed severe paranoid schizophrenia for the defendant's admitted
killing spree, interviewed him before he went on the drugs late
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Laval responded that, without the drugs, he might not have been
able to fulfill his court-ordered obligation to determine Maturino
Resendiz' state of mind when he killed Benton.
</P>
<P>
   If found innocent, Maturino Resendiz likely would be sent to a
mental institution for an undetermined time and still would face
other capital murder cases.
</P>
<P>
   A guilty verdict would mean either lethal injection or life in
prison, with no chance of parole for 40 years. Besides Benton, he
is accused of killing five other people in Texas, two in Illinois
and one in Kentucky from 1997 to 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Watch Lebanese Retreat  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISGAV AM, Israel (AP) -- Residents of this Israeli border
community watched anxiously Tuesday as soldiers removed concrete
walls, artillery batteries and even kitchen tables from the outpost
that has protected them for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   For all that time, the swath of territory Israel holds in
southern Lebanon has shielded northern Israeli residents from
Lebanese guerrillas. But Israel's promised withdrawal from Lebanon
has begun now -- and it includes outposts along the border that
residents hoped would be their last line of defense against the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the army pulls out of there, we're left without any
defense,'' said Berta Trebitsch, 46, a manager of the community's
hospital equipment factory.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's self-imposed deadline for the withdrawal is July 7, but
if the southward migration of troops and equipment continues at the
current pace, it could be completed sooner.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several days, Israel has been quietly pulling its
soldiers out of outposts in Lebanon, turning them over to allied
Lebanese militiamen or dismantling them. Security officials said
they would evacuate six border outposts that jut out into Lebanon
by the end of the week, leaving just a few soldiers to guard the
skeleton structures until an order is given to abandon them or blow
them up.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak has decided to withdraw all the way to
a 1923 border, which the United Nations set as a condition for
sending more troops to the area. A United Nations force has
patrolled part of the border area since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomatic and military observers say that instead of a
ceremony, Israel will simply announce at some point that the last
of its troops are out of Lebanon, with very little of the
withdrawal activity taking place in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, cranes lifted prefab buildings and concrete
fortifications from the Olesh outpost, just across the border, and
unloaded them at another outpost a few hundred yards down the road,
inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers at Olesh were reassigned to bases inside Israel. Some
were put to work exploding minefields on the Lebanese side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm relieved that we're leaving,'' said a 21-year old soldier
in the engineer corps who, in accordance with army rules, declined
to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Misgav Am residents, however, are wary of the withdrawal, which
leaves the new border just yards from their homes and apple
orchards and, they fear, means a return to the deadly terrorist
infiltrations that preceded Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In
1980, five guerrillas infiltrated the kibbutz and took over the
children's house, killing a toddler, a soldier and the kibbutz
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   As Trebitsch, the equipment factory manager, spoke of such
fears, her words were punctuated every minute or so by explosions.
They came at first from the nearby minefield and then from
artillery fire, as Hezbollah guerrillas shelled outposts all along
the new line. Two Israeli civilians, fortifying a border position
on the Israeli side, were slightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas also infiltrated an Israeli-held border enclave
and shot dead a former militiaman of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army militia, Lebanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks -- launched while troops were dismantling bases and
withdrawing -- prompted retaliatory air strikes by Israeli warplanes
that injured Lebanese teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army said its troops and allied militiamen returned
fire, and Israeli jet fighters thrice attacked guerrilla targets on
the edge of the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, backed by Iran, are fighting to oust Israel from
a border zone it set up in 1985 to protect its northern towns. In
the absence of a peace agreement, neither Lebanon nor Syria, the
main power in Lebanon, will guarantee the guerrilla attacks will
stop after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that danger, Israel initially planned to retain
border outposts like Olesh, but in the end chose international
guarantees over strategic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Misgav Am Secretary Hanan Rubinski, whose house is 20 yards from
the border, understands the trade-off but is angry about the
last-minute security arrangements. Work on a border fence and
patrol road began just two weeks ago, and he has no idea what, if
any, other fortifications are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has promised a harsh response to attacks after the
withdrawal -- a prospect that does not reassure Rubinski, regardless
of whether other countries would support Israeli retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, then the prime minister would have full international
backing to go to another war,'' Rubinski said. ''Where does that
leave us? We're in the middle of it.''

<HEADLINE> Murdered Boy's Parents Sue NAMBLA  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The parents of a 10-year-old boy who was killed by
two men after he resisted their sexual advances filed a $200
million lawsuit Tuesday against the North American Man/Boy Love
Association, claiming one of the killers was incited by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara and Robert Curley allege that NAMBLA ''encourages its
members to rape male children.'' Their wrongful death suit filed in
federal court also claims that ''NAMBLA serves as a conduit for an
underground network of pedophiles in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Curley was killed on Oct. 1, 1997. Salvatore Sicari was
convicted of first-degree murder in the case, while Charles Jaynes
was convicted of second-degree murder and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the two young men were sexually obsessed with
the boy, lured him from his Cambridge neighborhood with the promise
of a new bike, and then smothered him with a gasoline-soaked rag
when he resisted their sexual advances.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that Jaynes joined NAMBLA in the fall of
1996, read the group's publication and Web site and ''became
obsessed with having sex with and raping young male children.''
</P>
<P>
   The message box at the North American Man/Boy Love Association
phone listing in New York City was full late Tuesday. The message
said the organization ''speaks out against societal repression and
celebrates the joys of men and boys in love.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also names an Internet provider, Verio Inc., of
Englewood, Colo., saying it has violated its own policies by
hosting the NAMBLA Web site and is providing an international
communication system for pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said the company hadn't reviewed the lawsuit and
couldn't comment.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Seek Anthrax Program Halt  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly three dozen House members urged Defense
Secretary William Cohen Tuesday to stop vaccinating military
personnel against anthrax until the Pentagon finds an improved
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The letter by Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., and signed by 34
colleagues said the vaccination program ''is a flawed policy that
should be immediately stopped,'' based on findings and criticisms
from the General Accounting Office, American Public Health
Association Governing Council and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The letter comes three months after a Feb. 17 report by the
House Government Reform Committee's national security subcommittee
urged the Defense Department to suspend the anthrax program should
be suspended until it obtains approval for an improved vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf spokesman Jim Troyer said the letter aimed to gather
some common criticisms of the program in one place and attempted to
pressure on the Defense Department to suspend the vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials on Tuesday rejected Metcalf's request.
</P>
<P>
   ''Suspension of the program would recklessly jeopardize the
safety of the very people for whom you are concerned,'' wrote
Charles Cragin, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and
readiness, in a letter to Metcalf.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a disease that typically afflicts animals, especially
sheep and cattle. When inhaled, dry anthrax spores, which can be
put into weapons, can cause death in humans. The U.S. vaccine,
licensed by the Food and Drug Administration in 1970 is given in a
series of six shots over 18 months plus an annual booster.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered all 2.4 million
active duty and reserve troops to get shots of the anthrax vaccine,
starting with soldiers most likely to encounter biological warfare
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The military so far has immunized 570,000 people representing
1.6 million immunizations. About 703 people have filed an ''adverse
event report,'' meaning they cited some problem or reaction after
the shots, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as
soldiers have expressed concerns about taking the six-shot regimen.
Complaints included fevers, muscle pain and dizziness. Reserve and
National Guard pilots have said that morale was plummeting and
colleagues would resign rather than take the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon and Food and Drug Administration officials have
said repeatedly the vaccine is safe and effective. FDA officials
also say there is no basis for demoting the approved vaccine to an
investigational drug category.

<HEADLINE> Effort To Disredit Article Underway  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House lawyer asked human rights
activists to help ''discredit'' an impending article raising
questions about drug policy director Barry McCaffrey's conduct as
an Army general in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The request, sent by fax from the White House two days before
The New Yorker published Seymour Hersh's article, arose from a
campaign to blunt the impact of a story that McCaffrey labeled
''nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of National Drug Control Policy also sent some 30
organizations and several reporters a package of information about
McCaffrey's commitment to human rights this week in advance of the
''inaccurate'' magazine story, said spokesman Bob Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner said the fax was poorly worded but was otherwise
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the activists, who have no knowledge of McCaffrey's
actions during the war, found the appeal unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Amnesty International was being asked ''to help
bury a story'' about the kind of abuses the organization protests,
said Carlos Salinas, the group's acting legislative director.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one thing to refute charges or refute information. I
think it's quite another to ask for participation in a pre-emptive
strike to discredit,'' Salinas said. ''I let them know this was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas said he referred Hersh's article to the group's Iraq
specialists for possible follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh reported allegations by soldiers and officers that
McCaffrey, as commander of the 24th Infantry Division, led a
devastating, unwarranted attack on fleeing Iraqi soldiers two days
after the cease fire at the end of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that some troops fired on prisoners of war,
including a group of wounded soldiers and medical staff unloaded
from a hospital bus -- actions that may have been unintended but
weren't included in the official record of the war.
</P>
<P>
   An Army criminal investigation into the allegations in 1991
found no wrongdoing. Army officials said Monday there was no reason
to reopen the case.
</P>
<P>
   The fax to six human rights activists or experts was sent by
David Shull, deputy general counsel and human rights officer at
anti-drug office. The cover sheet, on Executive Office of the
President letterhead, included the line: ''Would ask for your help
to discredit the Hersh article from your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   It was sent with copies of an Associated Press account of
documents from the closed criminal investigation that were released
by the Army last week under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Shull said McCaffrey was aware of the package sent to activists
and reporters but didn't see the fax. ''It was unfortunate wording
and a mistake. It should have said 'to discredit the allegations'
instead of 'the article,''' Shull said.
</P>
<P>
   But Shull said he felt the activists, who have met often with
McCaffrey to discuss human rights abuses in Latin America, should
know the article might ''put Director McCaffrey's commitment to
human rights in question.''
</P>
<P>
   George Vickers, executive director of the Washington Office on
Latin America, a think tank, said the fax he received was a
questionable use of drug office staff time.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers said he has long been impressed by McCaffrey's
commitment to training U.S. troops about human rights and
encouraging respect of human rights in Latin American militaries.
''But there's no way I can comment on what happened in the Gulf
War,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said the focus should be on the events in the Gulf, and he
dismissed White House attacks against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is ugly,'' Hersh said. ''But it's much less ugly than
what happened out there.''

<HEADLINE> Nader Slams Corporate Subsidies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Consumer advocate Ralph Nader vowed
Tuesday to wage an active campaign for president as he slammed
elected officials in both parties for subsidizing corporations.
</P>
<P>
   During a series of campaign stops, the Green Party candidate
called for a grass-roots movement to enact such reforms as
universal health care, public financing of campaigns and stronger
labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''When are we going to get sufficiently upset to roll up our
political sleeves and start a progressive movement to take our
democracy back?'' Nader said. ''Our politicians are increasingly
bought and sold.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused Democrats and Republicans of catering to corporate
interests and cited efforts to lure the New England Patriots
football team to Hartford and the Adriaen's Landing riverfront
development as examples.
</P>
<P>
   ''The program of the Green Party is to get the rich off
welfare,'' Nader said, adding that corporate subsidies amount to
hundreds of billions of dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   He said those who think the economy is healthy fail to realize
that 20 percent of children grow up in deep poverty and that a
majority of workers earn less money today than 25 years ago when
inflation is taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a lawyer who first gained prominence taking on the auto
industry in the 1960s, also ran for president in 1996. He got 1
percent of the vote.

<HEADLINE> 3 Ivory Coasts Journalists Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Soldiers stormed a newspaper office,
arresting three journalists and destroying equipment on Tuesday
amid mounting opposition protests against Ivory Coast's young
military regime.
</P>
<P>
   The move came as army leaders lifted a ban on political
meetings, but warned all party leaders to seek government
permission before leaving the West African country.
</P>
<P>
   The privately-owned La Reference newspaper was raided on Tuesday
afternoon by soldiers who arrested three employees, publisher
Patrice Pohe and writers J.C. Ragaza and Eugene Kanga, the
newspaper said in a statement. Computers and other equipment were
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from military officials.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists at the paper believed the operation was prompted by
a recent article suggesting that military ruler Gen. Robert Guei's
wife was touring the country as part of a campaign to promote her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Guei, who took power in a Christmas Eve coup that toppled
President Henri Konan Bedie, has not said whether he would run in
elections scheduled for Sept. 17, as some observers expect.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative ballot will be held on Oct. 29 and a
constitutional referendum is tentatively scheduled for July.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition party, the Rally of the Republicans, accused
Guei of planning to prevent party leader Alassane Ouattara from
running for president.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Abidjan, RDR official Ali Coulibaly told several
thousand party members that Ivory Coast was fast becoming a
''fascist dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Another party leader, Jean-Jacques Bechio, warned that Guei and
other political parties were deepening bitter ethnic divisions in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although the army takeover was initially popular with Ivorians
who had grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism under
Bedie, that enthusiasm has since faded.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers have been accused of harassing civilians and summarily
killing suspected criminals. Guei himself has suggested he may not
allow some popular opposition leaders such as Ouattara to run for
the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jackets Sign Two Players  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The expansion Columbus Blue Jackets signed
two free agents Monday -- including their first defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jeremy Reich, who spent five seasons in the Western
Hockey League, and defenseman Dan Watson, who played four years in
the Ontario Hockey League, became the fifth and sixth players for
the Blue Jackets -- who begin play next season.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus previously signed free agent forwards Jonathan Schill
and Mathieu Darche and goalie Greg Gardner. The three donned home
jerseys Monday at an afternoon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a dream come true to sign a pro contract,'' said Darche,
who played at McGill University in Montreal and was chosen this
year to the All-Canada college team. ''Every kid in Canada grows up
hoping they can play in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich, 21, was selected by the Chicago Blackhawks in the second
round, 39th overall, in the 1997 draft. He played with Swift
Current of the WHL last season, scoring 33 goals and adding 58
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, 21, was a member of Sarnia of the OHL the last four
seasons. He played in every game the past three years, a stretch of
202 in a row.

   Columbus' roster also includes center Chris Nielsen, who was
acquired in a trade with the New York Islanders.

<HEADLINE> Eckerd OKs Building Preservation  </HEADLINE>
By VICKIE CHACHERE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- One of the nation's largest drugstore chains
has agreed to preserve historic buildings rather than tear them
down to make way for new stores.
</P>
<P>
   Eckerd Corp., based in nearby Clearwater, Fla., agreed to no
longer destroy buildings on the National Register of Historic
Places and has backed off its plan to tear down an 1890s school in
Albany, N.Y., to make room for a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Eckerd Interim President John E. Fesperman gave his commitment
to protect registered buildings in an April 26 letter, Peter Brink,
vice president of programs for the National Trust for Historic
Preservation, announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   During the past six months, Eckerd officials had canceled
several meetings with the National Trust to even discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugstore chains, such as Walgreens, Rite Aid and CVS,
have met with the National Trust and agreed to not tear down
historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The National Trust set out last year to secure agreements from
the nation's major drugstore chains to protect historic buildings
as the chains aggressively pursue downtown properties for new
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Brink said he did not believe Fesperman knew that other Eckerd
officials had canceled meetings and refused to return telephone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Fesperman) has been very apologetic for the fact that his
staff would not meet with us, not communicate with us,'' Brink
said. ''He said that's not the way Eckerd should behave.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the National Trust, Fesperman wrote: ''We try
very hard to be a good citizen of the communities in which we
operate and have no intention of destroying such properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckerd officials would not make themselves available for
questions Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Article on McCaffrey Sparks Furor  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House lawyer asked human rights
activists to help ''discredit'' an impending article raising
questions about drug policy director Barry McCaffrey's conduct as
an Army general in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The request, sent by fax from the White House two days before
The New Yorker published Seymour Hersh's article, arose from a
campaign to blunt the impact of a story that McCaffrey labeled
''nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of National Drug Control Policy also sent some 30
organizations and several reporters a package of information about
McCaffrey's commitment to human rights this week in advance of the
''inaccurate'' magazine story, said spokesman Bob Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner said the fax was poorly worded but was otherwise
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the activists, who have no knowledge of McCaffrey's
actions during the war, found the appeal unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Amnesty International was being asked ''to help
bury a story'' about the kind of abuses the organization protests,
said Carlos Salinas, the group's acting legislative director.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one thing to refute charges or refute information. I
think it's quite another to ask for participation in a pre-emptive
strike to discredit,'' Salinas said. ''I let them know this was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas said he referred Hersh's article to the group's Iraq
specialists for possible follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh reported allegations by soldiers and officers that
McCaffrey, as commander of the 24th Infantry Division, led a
devastating, unwarranted attack on fleeing Iraqi soldiers two days
after the cease fire at the end of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote that some troops fired on prisoners of war,
including a group of wounded soldiers and medical staff unloaded
from a hospital bus -- actions that may have been unintended but
weren't included in the official record of the war.
</P>
<P>
   An Army criminal investigation into the allegations in 1991
found no wrongdoing. Army officials said Monday there was no reason
to reopen the case.
</P>
<P>
   The fax to six human rights activists or experts was sent by
David Shull, deputy general counsel and human rights officer at
anti-drug office. The cover sheet, on Executive Office of the
President letterhead, included the line: ''Would ask for your help
to discredit the Hersh article from your perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   It was sent with copies of an Associated Press account of
documents from the closed criminal investigation that were released
by the Army last week under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Shull said McCaffrey was aware of the package sent to activists
and reporters but didn't see the fax. ''It was unfortunate wording
and a mistake. It should have said 'to discredit the allegations'
instead of 'the article,''' Shull said.
</P>
<P>
   But Shull said he felt the activists, who have met often with
McCaffrey to discuss human rights abuses in Latin America, should
know the article might ''put Director McCaffrey's commitment to
human rights in question.''
</P>
<P>
   George Vickers, executive director of the Washington Office on
Latin America, a think tank, said the fax he received was a
questionable use of drug office staff time.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers said he has long been impressed by McCaffrey's
commitment to training U.S. troops about human rights and
encouraging respect of human rights in Latin American militaries.
''But there's no way I can comment on what happened in the Gulf
War,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh said the focus should be on the events in the Gulf, and he
dismissed White House attacks against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is ugly,'' Hersh said. ''But it's much less ugly than
what happened out there.''

<HEADLINE> No Charges in Rep. Kennedy Case  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rep. Patrick Kennedy won't face any charges
stemming from his encounter with an airport security guard, the
city attorney's spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The matter was satisfactorily resolved at hearing and we will
take no further action,'' said Mike Qualls, spokesman for City
Attorney James Hahn. ''As far as the criminal justice system is
concerned this is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island Democrat had been accused of battery by Los
Angeles International Airport security guard Della Patton, 58. She
said Kennedy shoved and grabbed her on March 26 after she told him
his bag was too big to fit through an X-ray scanner.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 32, the son of Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., expressed
his ''regret that I acted rudely,'' but denied hurting the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am obviously happy that the Los Angeles city officials agree
that I did not do what I was accused of,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation by police, the case went to the city
attorney's office, which called Kennedy and Patton to a hearing
last week. Such hearings typically resolve such cases without
charges being filed.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's attorney, George L. Mallory Jr., said he likely will
approach Kennedy about a settlement and, if those talks fail,
''we'll move forward with a lawsuit.'' He said he was not
disappointed by the decision to not file charges.
</P>
<P>
   At their hearing, Kennedy and Patton viewed a surveillance
videotape of the incident that police have said showed physical
contact between the two. Both sides said the tape bolsters their
description of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration told police not to release
the videotape until the agency has a chance to review it.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Seeks Elian MD Return to US  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The Cuban government said Tuesday it had requested
that Elian Gonzalez's pediatrician be allowed to return to the
United States and pressed its earlier request for visas for the
6-year-old's four grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   During a regular evening program on state television designed to
provide updates on the international custody case, panelists said
that Dr. Caridad Ponce de Leon had returned to Havana from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce de Leon on Monday left the United States, where she had
been staying with Elian and his family, because her visa had
expired.
</P>
<P>
   While the doctor had said American officials had refused to
extend her visa, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
said there had been a lack of communications and Ponce de Leon
wouldn't have had to depart after all.
</P>
<P>
   Word reached Ponce de Leon in Houston, Texas -- where she was
changing planes -- that she had been granted 15 more days, Cuban
officials said. But with the trip already started, the doctor
decided it was too late to turn back.
</P>
<P>
   Ponce de Leon, Elian's pediatrician since his infancy, had spent
almost three weeks caring for the child at a rural retreat on
Maryland's eastern shore. Elian and his immediate family are
awaiting a court decision on whether they can return to Cuba, as
his father wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said that authorities earlier Tuesday had issued
a new request to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana that Ponce de
Leon be allowed to return to the United States to care for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is also pressing its request for U.S. visas for Elian's
paternal grandparents, Mariela Quintana and Juan Gonzalez, and his
maternal grandparents, Raquel Rodriguez and Rolando Betancourt, so
they can visit with the boy.

<HEADLINE> Christian Group Reinstated at Tufts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- An evangelical Christian group at Tufts
University has been reinstated, a month after a student board found
it discriminated when a lesbian wasn't allowed to hold a leadership
post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're back on campus. We're delighted that Tufts has sought to
uphold religious freedom and we're looking forward to the fall to
come back and worship Jesus on the campus and to share the love of
God with the campus,'' said Curtis Chang, chaplain of the Tufts
Christian Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Tufts Community Union Judiciary decided to strip
the group of recognition as a campus organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee on Student Life, a faculty and student group,
reviewed the campus judiciary decision and found flaws in the
process, university spokeswoman Christen Graham said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The committee found that the Christian group should have been
given a hearing and it wasn't. The case will now go back to the
student court in the fall, but in the meantime the group's status
will be restored.
</P>
<P>
   Chang said his group wasn't anti-gay or anti-lesbian, but it
didn't want Julie Catalano to be one of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He said Catalano didn't share the beliefs of other members of
the group who believe there should be no sex except between a
married man and woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still welcome her as a member,'' he said. ''We have always
welcomed her as a member. we have expressed to her our desire that
she return to our group, if she wishes to.''
</P>
<P>
   Catalano did not immediately return a phone call Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Lott Asks Cos. To Donate to Abraham  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has urged
high-tech corporations to donate to a privately funded group
running ads supporting Michigan Sen. Spencer Abraham and his
legislation to allow more skilled foreign workers into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the ads do not specifically urge a vote for Abraham,
the organization running the commercials, Americans for Job
Security, does not have to identify its contributors and can accept
funds from corporations barred by law from donating to federal
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., denied any wrongdoing, but Democrats called his
actions ''outrageously unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads are running in response to television commercials
running in Michigan that depict Abraham as willing to give American
jobs to low-paid foreign workers. Those ads have been funded by the
Federation for American Immigration Reform, an organization Abraham
has called ''a hate group.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an exchange of e-mails obtained by The Associated
Press and other news organizations, some lobbyists appeared to
believe the donations were connected to passage of legislation
allowing 297,000 more skilled foreigners into the United States
over the next three years. High-tech companies are strong
supporters of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have heard that regardless of our 'limitations,' we need to
do something for Abraham if we want to see something moved in the
Senate,'' wrote a lobbyist for Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, called Lott's actions ''outrageously
unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This certainly is not business as usual in the United States
Senate,'' said he said. ''This is extortion and nothing short of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott spokesman John Czwartacki denied that the donations were
connected to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's an out and out falsehood,'' Czwartacki said. ''Senator
Lott was committed to this bill for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki said there was nothing wrong with Lott's involvement
in fund raising. He said the meeting was held at the National
Republican Senatorial Committee -- not Lott's taxpayer-supported
office -- and compared the solicitation to fund raising for a
charity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is 100 percent legal to letter and spirit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, president of the advocacy group Common Cause,
said the law was not intended to allow Senate leaders to raise
money for issue ads run by outside groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''It leads to a breakdown in the right of the public to know
who's funding these campaigns,'' said Harshbarger, whose group
supports overhauling campaign finance laws. ''It shows the
loopholes are swallowing the law.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an e-mail from one industry lobbyist, about 20-25
high-tech industries were represented at a meeting called by Lott
in early April.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were asked for our support (no surprise),'' the e-mail
said. ''The good news for us is that most of the companies in the
room are going to contribute -- either because of Spence or because
of Lott.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham spokesman Joe Davis said the senator and his staff were
not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no quid pro quo here,'' he said. ''There's no
coordination with any of these groups. We haven't told them they
have to do that to get this bill passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Job Security President Michael Dubke also denied
any connection.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never sat down with Trent Lott to discuss any ad
campaign,'' he said. ''There is no coordination.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't know whether the group received more
contributions as a result of Lott's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Butler, campaign manager for Abraham's Democratic
opponent, Rep. Debbie Stabenow, said it would be appropriate for
the Federal Election Commission or the Senate Ethics Committee to
investigate the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Bishops Rip Abortion-Rights Group  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The U.S. Catholic bishops conference
denounced an abortion-rights group Tuesday for campaigning to have
the Holy See's permanent-observer status revoked at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion-rights group, Catholics for a Free Choice, was
trying to ''silence the moral voice of the Holy See at the United
Nations,'' the bishops said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public relations effort has ridiculed the Holy See in
language reminiscent of other episodes of anti-Catholic bigotry
that the Catholic Church has endured in the past,'' the
Washington-based bishops group said in a statement carried in the
daily Vatican bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, although a non-member and lacking a vote, has
special observer status at the United Nations which allows it to
take part in U.N. debates and conferences. The Church has used the
position to play an active role in debate on family planning and
abortion issues.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-based Catholics for a Free Choice currently is
challenging the Holy See's entitlement to the permanent-observer
status, saying its status as a ''state'' is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops said Catholics for a
Free Choice cannot rightly claim to be a Catholic organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, the group's activity is directed to rejection and
distortion of Catholic teaching about the respect and protection
due to defenseless unborn human life,'' the bishops conference
said, calling the activist group ''an arm of the abortion lobby in
the United States and throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics for a Free Choice president Francis Kissling in March
accused the Holy See of misusing a status ''that it obtained within
the U.N. to some extent by accident.''

<HEADLINE> House Nixes Budget Overhaul Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Tuesday emphatically rejected a
bill aimed at overhauling a budget process almost everyone agrees
is flawed. Among the proposals defeated were a switch to a two-year
budget and ending the possibility of year-end government shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, defeated 250-166, would also have gotten the
president involved in budget negotiations earlier in the year to
prevent end-of-session deadlocks, created a rainy-day reserve fund
for emergencies and ensured that spending cuts in one area of the
budget not be used to boost spending elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the opportunity to fix a process that is broken,''
said Rep. Jim Nussle, R-Iowa, a chief supporter.
</P>
<P>
   The House first turned down, 217-201, an amendment to move to a
two-year budget, an idea backed by President Clinton and lawmakers
who argued it would give Congress more time to oversee the federal
programs it funds. But opponents said having only one shot at the
budget every two years would weaken congressional power.
</P>
<P>
   Under a biennial budget, Congress would spend the first year of
a two-year congressional session drawing up a budget and passing
appropriations bills, reserving the second year for formulating
policy and overseeing federal programs.
</P>
<P>
   House Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier, R-Calif., a
champion of the biennial budget idea, said it could be ''the most
significant government-wide fiscal reform that we've seen in a
quarter of a century.''
</P>
<P>
   The central element of the bill was the revamping of the budget
resolution that is drawn up every spring and serves as an outline
for later spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The budget resolution would have been given the status of a law,
subject to the president's signature, a move that would bring the
president into the process much earlier in the year and help avoid
year-end showdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about doing business properly in an organized way,'' said
Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who has been working for budget
reform since he was a counsel in the Reagan White House.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents warned that the bill as a whole could result in less
fiscal discipline and the ceding of power to the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are walking away from our constitutional obligations to
defend the power of the purse,'' said Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin,
the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Appropriations and policy-making committees also
warned of a shift of authority to the Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also defeated, 236-173, an amendment proposed by Rep.
George Gekas, R-Pa., that would have automatically kept federal
programs running when Congress and the White House fail to enact
all 13 appropriations bills by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Gekas argued that his provision would relieve Americans from the
fear of another government shutdown as occurred during a budget
battle between Congress and the White House in 1995. But opponents
said it would take away pressure for budget negotiators to reach a
compromise.

<P>
   The Clinton administration supported the idea of a biennial
budget, as did past Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   But it said setting up a reserve fund for emergencies could lead
to abuses, and threatened a veto if the final bill contained the
spending lockbox or the automatic continuation of programs.

</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 853.

<HEADLINE> Reagan Kin Seeks Alzheimer's Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- President Reagan's daughter Maureen
asked state lawmakers Tuesday to spend $2.4 million on an
Alzheimer's education effort to help doctors and families recognize
the early signs of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan said the disease that has stricken her father and 4
million other people nationwide often isn't caught until about a
year after family members have an inkling that something is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we find new ways of testing and make doctors more and more
aware of early signs of Alzheimer's, I hope we can buy a family two
to five years of cognitive health,'' Reagan said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis this week proposed spending $2.4 million for a
statewide Alzheimer's disease education program in his state
budget. Reagan wants lawmakers to endorse that plan.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan said her 89-year-old father ''is doing wonderful. The
disease he has is horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the same affable person he's always been,'' she said.
''He makes it easier on us.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From Tuesday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Royals-Athletics:
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: OF Jermaine Dye, hitting .329 and among the AL
leaders in most offensive categories, missed his second straight
game because of lower back tightness. ''It's been bothering him for
three or four days. And it gets to the point where you give him a
couple of days off to see if you can calm it down,'' manager Tony
Muser said, adding he expects Dye to return for Wednesday's game
against the A's. ... Royals pitchers have allowed 15 homers in the
last six games, including two on Tuesday. They have failed to allow
a homer in just four games this season.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The A's began Tuesday in sole possession of first place
in the AL West for the third time in four days, the first time
Oakland has been alone in first outside the month of April since
winning the AL West title in 1992. ... Ten of the A's last 18 games
have been decided in the seventh inning or later, including
Tuesday's 8-7 loss to the Royals in which Kansas City broke a 6-6
tie in the ninth. ... The A's are 4-2 on a season-long 11-game
homestand that continues Wednesday with a game against Kansas City
and then concludes with four games against Minnesota.
Tigers-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Manager Phil Garner wasn't wearing any disguises when
he arrived at Jacobs Field for Monday's game. Garner has been a
marked man in Cleveland since the spring when he said the Indians
were ''vulnerable.'' Garner isn't backing down from his comments,
which made the bulletin board in the Indians' spring training
clubhouse in Florida. ''I meant what I said and I stand by it,''
Garner said. ''The crow that I'm eating is about us.'' Detroit
entered Tuesday night's game a major league worst 12-23. ... Luis
Polonia and Juan Gonzalez homered in the first inning of Tuesday
night's game, making 20 of the Tigers' last 22 homers solo shots.
When Juan Encarnacion hit a two-run homer on May 4, it snapped a
string of 15 straight solo homers.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: If all goes well in a doctors' visit on Thursday,
manager Charlie Manuel could be back with the Indians for the
series finale against Detroit. Acting manager Grady Little spoke
with Manuel on Tuesday and said he was getting stronger. Manuel had
his colon reattached on May 5, his second surgery since February.
... C Sandy Alomar was back in the lineup on Tuesday night. Alomar
has been sharing the catching duties with Einar Diaz since
returning from the disabled list on May 8. However, Little said
Alomar will catch the majority of games the rest of the season. In
23 games this season, Diaz is batting .333 and has been outstanding
behind the plate, throwing out 36 percent of potential
basestealers.
Red Sox-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: RHP Bret Saberhagen was recalled from injury rehab.
Saberhagen left his first rehab start after one inning Monday
complaining of a sore back. ... Before the game, Brian Daubach
played home run derby on a video game. Donnie Sadler, Wilton Veras
and Darren Lewis huddled around Daubach as he tried to go deep with
Red Sox players. He didn't hit many. ... OF Troy O'Leary was given
the day off.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays sent struggling RHP Roy Halladay to
Triple-A Syracuse and recalled RHP Peter Munro on Tuesday. Halladay
was 2-4 record with a 11.97 ERA in eight games, including seven
starts. Last week, the Blue Jays moved him to the bullpen, shifting
left-handed reliever Lance Painter to the starting rotation.
Halladay was 8-7 with a 3.92 ERA last season in Toronto. Blue Jays'
manager Jim Fregosi and pitching coach Rick Langford will drive to
Buffalo on Thursday to see Halladay pitch against Triple-A Buffalo.
... The Blue Jays said Syracuse manager Pat Kelly will be replaced
by pitching coach Mel Queen. Kelly compiled a 88-90 record with
Syracuse.
White Sox-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: A scouting report on Orlando Hernandez was prominently
displayed on the lineup card in the White Sox locker room. ''Uses
both sides of the plate very well. Don't be fooled (underlined
three times) by motion and various arm angles!'' ... The White Sox
are starting the toughest stretch of their season, playing the
Yankees and Cleveland in 22 of their next 38 games. ... LHP Kelly
Wunsch, who leads the AL with 22 appearances, is the first White
Sox reliever to win two straight games since Terry Leach in
September 1992. ... OF Chris Singleton was back in the lineup after
leaving Sunday's game against Minnesota with a dislocated right
index finger.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: SS Derek Jeter sat out his fourth straight game with
an abdominal strain. He said he won't know when he'll be able to
return until he can swing a bat. ... Owner George Steinbrenner, in
attendance for the first time since the home opener, has made it
known that he is not happy with the play of OF Ricky Ledee, who
entered hitting .217. Ledee, himself, is bothered by his
inconsistent performance this season. ''It's tough not to pay
attention (to the critics),'' he said. ''I'm going to go out there
and play and hope it gets better. I'm not happy right now.'' ...
The production from the top of the lineup has also been a problem,
with Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch struggling early this season.
Knoblauch, who walked 83 times last season, last drew a walk on
April 18 against Texas, a span of 53 at-bats. ... The Yankees
launched YankeesXtreme.com, a subscription-based Web site that
gives fans e-mail, Internet access, up-to-the minute stats and
chats.
Devil Rays-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Entering Tuesday night's game against the Rangers,
the Devil Rays had played 16 one-run games, most in the majors.
Tampa Bay split the first 16 one-run contests, but lost four of
their previous five. ... The Devil Rays also had a major league
high 14 games decided in the final inning over the first 37 games.
Heading into Tuesday night, Tampa Bay was 5-9 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: With 15 homers in 38 games, Ivan Rodriguez is off to the
fastest start in Rangers history. Juan Gonzalez was the previous
38-game leader with 14 homers in 1993. Gonzalez went on to hit 46
homers in '93. ... The single-season club record is 47 homers
shared by Gonzalez (1996) and Rafael Palmeiro (1999). Both players
had nine homers after 38 games. ... Texas surpassed two million
tickets sold on Tuesday night.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Diamondbacks-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Randy Johnson made his first start at Olympic Stadium
since 1989. Johnson, who made his major league debut with the Expos
in 1988, was one of three pitchers Montreal traded to Seattle on
May 25, 1989 for LHP Mark Langston. Johnson was a combined 3-4 with
a 4.69 ERA in 11 games for Montreal, including 10 starts. ... The
Expos are the only major league team Johnson has faced and yet to
beat. Johnson went 0-1 against Montreal in two starts at home last
season. He has yet to pitch against Houston. ... The Diamondbacks
haven't lost a road series since last July. The Diamondbacks have
won 16 series and split a four-game series over that span. ...
Arizona is 77-28 (.733) since last July 20.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: SS Orlando Cabrera entered the game batting .414
(12-for-29) against left-handers. ... 1B Lee Stevens, who was
0-for-1 with a walk in two career appearances against Johnson, was
the only left-handed batter in the Expos' lineup Tuesday night.
Swith-hitter Wilton Guerrero started in center field in place of
Peter Bergeron. ... Closer Ugueth Urbina will have arthroscopic
surgery Wednesday morning to remove one or more possible bone chips
from his ailing right elbow. Urbina, who also had bone chips
removed from the same elbow in Dec. 1996, is expected to be
sidelined for the next 4-6 weeks.
Cardinals-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals made a flurry of roster moves on
Tuesday, activating RHP Mark Thompson from the disabled list and
purchasing the contract of LHP Jose Rodriguez from Triple-A
Memphis. To make room on the roster, St. Louis optioned RHP Justin
Brunette and 1B Larry Sutton to Memphis and moved RHP Dave
Wainhouse from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day DL. ... The
Cardinals are making their final appearance in Philadelphia this
season. They will not play the Phillies again until Aug. 18-20
after playing them six times in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: RHP Mike Jackson threw off the mound for the first
time on Tuesday, throwing 25 pitches during batting practice. ''I
felt pretty good but didn't want to overdue it,'' Jackson said. I
felt a little fatigued but I just want to take it day by day. You
have to crawl before you can run.'' ... Last month, the Phillies
were swept by the Cardinals, marking the first time they had been
swept at home since 1986. They then got swept by the Braves this
past weekend.
Padres-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Tony Gwynn, who had been bothered by an inflamed left
knee, started his first game since April 29. Gwynn, who has played
in just 14 of San Diego's first 37 games, has a sub-.300 average at
Pro Player Stadium, only one of three major league stadiums that he
has had at least 20 at-bats at. Atlanta's Turner Field and Bank One
Ballpark in Phoenix are the other two. ... With a day off Monday,
San Diego C Carlos Hernandez, OF Kory DeHaan, minor league pitching
coach Urbano Lugo and Spanish broadcaster Eduardo Ortega flew to
Caracas, Venezuela to put on a youth baseball clinic in hopes of
raising $80,000 to go toward the relief efforts for victims of last
December's flood.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Dave Berg has a bulging disc but was available to play.
... Marlins RHP Alex Fernandez met with management before the game
to discuss his ailing elbow and the possibility of going on the DL.
GM Dave Dombrowski said that Fernandez is fine and will start
Thursday's game against the Padres. Reliever Dan Miceli's tender
forearm will keep him out at least for Tuesday's game.
Pirates-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: The Pirates called up OF Emil Brown from Triple-A
Nashville and swapped two pitchers. RHP Josias Manzanillo was
called up from Nashville and RHP Jose Parra was designated for
assignment. Manzanillo, a nonroster player in the Pirates' camp
this spring, went 0-2 with three saves and a 2.70 ERA for
Nashville. ... Wil Cordero, who has a career-high 12-game hitting
streak, was given permission to miss Tuesday's game against the
Cincinnati Reds. Cordero had to return to Puerto Rico on a family
matter. ... Jimmy Anderson, scheduled to start Wednesday's game,
has made only one other career appearance at Cinergy Field, and it
wasn't good. He gave up a walk and allowed three runs to score
while getting one out.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: SS Barry Larkin was activated from the disabled list
and SS Gookie Dawkins was optioned to Double-A Chattanooga. Dawkins
hit .220 in 14 games while Larkin recovered from an injury to his
glove hand. ... Larkin was off to his best start since 1995 when he
tore tissue at the base of his left middle finger while diving for
a grounder April 21. ... The Reds went 13-9 with Larkin out. ...
Dante Bichette, who was 1-for-13 during a four-game series in
Houston, was given a day off. Michael Tucker was in right field.
... The Reds didn't take batting practice before the game. They
arrived back from a night game in Houston around 2:45 a.m.
Rockies-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Rickey Henderson, released Saturday by the Mets, was
still in the team's clubhouse before the game. His name plate had
already been taken off his locker and two packed cardboard boxes
sat inside his locker. ''He either came back for his check or he
really liked it here,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ... Mets
SS Rey Ordonez, who missed four games with a shoulder injury,
returned to the starting lineup. ... OF Darryl Hamilton returned to
the team following foot surgery, he expects to begin light running
in about two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The Rockies had three former Mets in the starting
lineup, RHP Masato Yoshii, C Brent Mayne and 1B Aaron Ledesma. ...
Ledesma was subbing for Todd Helton, who strained his hamstring
Sunday against San Francisco and is expected to be out until
Thursday night, but is available for pinch-hitter. Coming into
Tuesday, Helton leads the NL with a .417 batting average and 41
RBIs. ... The Rockies also were without RF Larry Walker, on the
15-day disabled list with an elbow injury. ... Colorado came into
the game leading the majors with 22 triples. No other NL team had
more than 11 (San Francisco).
Giants-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: LF Barry Bonds underwent conditioning Monday and
Tuesday for his ailing back. The workouts, supervised by assistant
trainer Dave Groeschner and conducted at Pac Bell Park, have gone
well but there is no word on when Bonds will return to the Giants.
The slugger suffered a lower back sprain Saturday at Colorado and
was removed from the field on a cart. He will miss the three-game
series in Atlanta but is aiming to return to the team Friday in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: So much for the days when Atlanta's offense relied on
the three-run homer. The Braves began Tuesday's game against the
Giants with 32 steals, ranking second in the NL to Houston. Two
newcomers, Quilvio Veras and Rafael Furcal, have led the increased
reliance on speed. ... Kerry Ligtenberg, sent back to Triple-A
Richmond last weekend, did not allow a run in his first two
appearances for the Triple-A team. In two innings, he struck out
four but walked three, continuing to struggle with his control
since coming back from Tommy John elbow surgery. The former closer,
who had 30 saves as a rookie in 1998, missed all of last season.
Dodgers-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: RHP Mike Fetters, on the disabled list since May 10
with a sore right elbow, might get his wish and not go on rehab
assignment. ''If he doesn't have any adverse reaction from his
catch, we could probably throw him pen in the weekend. Once you can
throw a couple pens with no problem, you don't need to go out on
rehab,'' manager Davey Johnson said. ''He was deathly worried about
going out on rehab.'' ... SS Alex Cora is batting .333 with a pair
of three-hit games since being called up from Triple-A Albuquerque
on May 5. ''He's outstanding,'' Johnson said. ''He's playing like
we felt he's capable of playing. He's relaxed, enjoying it.'' ...
Bad news for the Cubs. In their last starts, RHPs Kevin Brown,
Darren Dreifort and Chan Ho Park combined to go 2-0 with an 0.72
ERA. Dreifort tossed a complete game shutout. The Cubs faced Brown
on Tuesday, and will get Dreifort on Wednesday and Park on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RHP Kerry Wood will pitch Saturday, giving him an extra
two days of rest. But don't read anything into that, Wood and Cubs
manager Don Baylor said. ''My philosophy was to give him the extra
day or two days if I could,'' Baylor said of Wood, who missed all
of last season after having reconstructive elbow surgery.
''Nothing's wrong,'' Wood said. ''We talked about (extra time off)
when I first got up here. It's no surprise to me.'' ... Dave
Martinez was back in a Cubs uniform Tuesday for the first time
since 1988. Martinez, who was drafted by the Cubs and played on the
North Side from 1986-88, was acquired from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
last Friday. ''This place keeps calling,'' said Martinez, who also
played for the crosstown rival White Sox from 1995-97. ''I don't
look at it as leaving home. I look at it as coming back to my
second home.'' ... Baylor has seen a lot in his 23 years in
baseball, but even he can't explain some of the Cubs' lowlights
this season. Take Sunday's game in Montreal. The Cubs got six hits,
Eric Young stole five bases, Henry Rodriguez homered twice and
drove in seven RBIs -- and the Cubs still lost 16-15. ''(Bench
coach) Rene Lachemann and I put our experience together and it's
about 75 years worth,'' Baylor said. ''We've said we've never seen
any of these things before. I need to stop saying that.''
Astros-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers will recall P John Snyder from a
rehabilitation assignment with Triple-A Indianapolis and he will
start Saturday night against the San Francisco Giants. ... Injured
OF Geoff Jenkins, out since May 6 with a broken finger, hopes to
return to action by the end of the month. He was tied for the
league lead in home runs with 11 when he broke his right middle
finger while batting. ... The Brewers have scored first in eight of
their last games, four of which they won.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: The Astros began a two-city, six-game road trip Tuesday
night when it opened a three game series against the Brewers. It
was the Astros second trip to Milwaukee in two weeks. ... Shane
Reynolds, Tuesday night's starter, has won his first five decisions
of the season, his best start ever. ... Houston's Roger Cedeno, who
swiped four bases in the series with Cincinnati, is tied with Eric
Young, Pokey Reese, and Johnny Damon for the major league lead in
thefts with 14.

<HEADLINE> Gun Control Brings Senate to Halt  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two days after the Million Mom March for gun
control, Democrats on Tuesday brought the Senate to a standstill
over the issue and won a promise for a pair of politically
sensitive votes on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Leader Tom Daschle unexpectedly injected the topic
into debate on routine spending legislation, and told reporters he
had informed Majority Leader Trent Lott, ''you will not finish this
bill this week or maybe next week'' without allowing votes on gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Lott promised votes on Wednesday on two nonbinding measures
involving plans to reduce juvenile crime. Democrats had sought
resolutions commending the Million Mom March this past weekend, but
the GOP measure does not mention the march.
</P>
<P>
   The gun control issue has been simmering for a year. In the wake
of the 1999 student massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado,
the Senate cleared legislation to crack down on juvenile crime that
included White House-backed restrictions on sales at gun shows and
a requirement for safety devices to be sold with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans broke ranks on the issue, and Vice President Al Gore
cast a tie-breaking vote on May 20 to clear the measure over
opposition by the GOP leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the bill did not include the gun control
provisions, though, and negotiations on a compromise have been
stalled for months.
</P>
<P>
   The Million Mom March was designed to pressure Congress to act
on gun control, and Daschle went to the Senate floor at the first
available opportunity since then to raise the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed a non-binding measure commending those involved in
the march, and declaring that Congress should ''immediately pass''
legislation that includes the gun control provisions that cleared
the Senate a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lott immediately used a parliamentary device that suspended
proceedings on the floor for several hours. Republicans have 10
first-term senators on the ballot this fall, and his maneuvering
appeared designed in part to shelter them from difficult votes.
</P>
<P>
   But when Lott returned to the floor, it was Daschle's turn to
use the Senate rule book to his advantage. He forced a series of
time-consuming votes that made clear he could tie up proceedings
for hours, even days at a time, when Republicans must work on
must-pass spending measures.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lott produced a rival Republican proposal, and agreed
to permit votes on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP measure, also non-binding, includes no mention of the
Million Mom March or gun control. Instead, it says the ''Clinton
administration has failed to protect law-abiding citizens by
inadequately enforcing federal firearms laws.''
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for passage of a ''comprehensive approach to
juvenile crime'' including better enforcement, upgrading the
national instant criminal background checks and providing grants to
states to impose mandatory sentences.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Daschle also told reporters that 12 children a day
die to gun violence. ''We will begin reading their names on a daily
basis for the Senate (and) to the extent possible we will tell some
of their stories,'' he promised.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Students Cope With Fire  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- On the day their yearbook would have
been released, many Los Alamos High seniors were busy moving back
into their homes. Their prom, sports banquet and Advanced Placement
exams have been postponed. And at least one girl plans to cancel
her graduation party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would feel bad to give somebody an invitation and be like,
'Too bad your house burned down, but we're having a party,''' says
Noelle Stillman, an 18-year-old headed to the University of Arizona
this fall on a soccer scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   While high school seniors across the country have been picking
out prom dresses and cramming in quality time with their best
friends, members of Los Alamos' Class of 2000 have been anxiously
watching TV news in the homes of out-of-town relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   The raging wildfire that forced them to flee the pine-covered
hills of Los Alamos and neighboring White Rock started just two
weeks after another tragedy rocked the school. Sweethearts Ricky
Martinez and Karen Castanon, who were juniors, were shot to death
while making a Good Friday pilgrimage to a church that the faithful
believe contains healing dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to stay upbeat, but everybody is just down,''
said Kenny Knight, a 19-year-old senior. ''Everybody's trying to
deal with the death of Ricky and Karen, and now all of a sudden
this hits. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The school year also was marked by the deaths of a recent
graduate and a freshman girl in separate car accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just trying to get through the year as quickly as
possible after all this,'' said Lizzie Kee, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Lynne Saccaro said the school would reopen Monday,
with about 20 counselors present. The students have been off since
May 8, two days before 25,000 people began to evacuate, because the
smoke was so thick in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Saccaro did not know how many students lost their homes in the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids need to see each other,'' a choked-up Saccaro said.
''They need to know everyone is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Graduation will go on as planned on June 3, she said, mainly
because so many out-of-town relatives already have booked their
trips. Saccaro said no decision had been made on whether the
students will take final exams.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a couple of bright spots amid the devastation.
At state championships last weekend, Los Alamos senior Magdalena
Sandoval won the 3,200-meter and 1,600-meter races, and teammate
Christina Gonzales won the triple jump with a state record 36 feet,
2{ inches.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos girls' tennis team also won the singles, doubles
and overall team titles. And in March, the boys basketball team won
the Class AAA state championship -- their first in 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some students, such as Knight and his best friend, 18-year-old
A.J. Stevens, plan to volunteer this summer to help rebuild some of
the 260 homes destroyed by the fires.
</P>
<P>
   But with the fire coming on the heels of the Good Friday
killings, Stevens said, ''It's not going to be the same in Los
Alamos for a real long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many wish they could get back those precious moments dedicated
to signing yearbooks and sharing hugs. Stillman will miss most of
prom because she already had a soccer game scheduled for the new
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything got so messed up,'' she said. ''I was telling my
mom it feels unfair, but she told me to think of all those who lost
their homes.''

<HEADLINE> O's' Ripken Sees Back Specialist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Cal Ripken Jr. rejoined the Baltimore
Orioles on Tuesday for their two-game series against the Anaheim
Angels after spending his off day seeing a back specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, 39, flew in from Cleveland, where he visited orthopedic
surgeon Dr. Henry Bohlman. The Orioles' third baseman was given a
shot of medication for inflammation of two nerve roots that are in
the same area where Bohlman had performed surgery on Ripken's back
last Sept. 23.

   ''There's a small disc fragment that's helping causing the
irritation, along with some scar tissue,'' Ripken said a before
missing his fourth consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically it's because of the activity -- the diving, the
hyperextending, the bouncing and the jarring. But they're not
overly concerned and I'm not overly concerned. I want to feel
better and I want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, back problems limited baseball's ''Iron Man'' to 86
games and forced him to take several cortisone shots in the general
area of the pain. The injection Ripken received on Monday was
directly into the nerve root. It had immediate effects, he
reported, adding that there was deadness in the area Tuesday and
lingering soreness from the needle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The source of the irritation was pretty much known when I went
to Cleveland, and then Dr. Bohlman recommended that I have the
shot,'' Ripken said. ''I didn't pay that much attention to the
actual substance that was put in there, but it's supposed to help
take away the inflammation. So I would assume it's cortisone.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year veteran, who was used as a DH last week for the
first time in his career, had scheduled the checkup date for Monday
because of the nerve irritation. He thought it would stay at that
level until he could see his doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday, he dived for a ball and the intensity of the
pain increased, limiting the pressure Ripken could put on his left
leg. So he underwent an MRI on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's doctor changed the anti-inflammatory medication his
patient had been taking orally, and has prescribed medicine
designed to deal with the area more directly and quicker so that
he'll be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel fine. I feel very encouraged,'' said Ripken, who has
been on the disabled list twice since ending his major
league-record streak of 2,632 consecutive games. ''The nerve
irritation that is causing it has subsided, and it's just matter of
letting the medicine work.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll give it one more day and try it tomorrow. I think I
probably could push it and attempt to play today, but I don't think
it would be the smartest thing to do. But I expect to play tomorrow
and I expect to be able to move and to do everything I need to
do.''

<HEADLINE> Ky. Kids When Tour Buses Collide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Two tour buses carrying Kentucky
schoolchildren home from a sightseeing trip to Washington, D.C.,
collided Tuesday on a highway exit ramp, causing minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 55 people who were taken to Morgantown hospitals for
examination appeared to have serious injuries. They included
children, chaperones and the two drivers, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said one driver blamed the accident on his brakes, which
failed as he pulled off Interstate 68 onto an exit ramp. He said
his bus slammed into the back of the other, pushing it into the
ordinarily busy highway and blocking both lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the injured suffered only bumps, bruises, minor cuts and
pulled muscles. One child complaining of stomach pains was admitted
to the hospital overnight.
</P>
<P>
   There were 122 people in the three-bus caravan to Lexington. New
buses were to take them back to Kentucky.

<HEADLINE> Queen Honors Elizabeth Taylor  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- They divorced (twice) decades ago, but when
Elizabeth Taylor became a dame Tuesday, she wished the late Richard
Burton could have been by her side.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came to Buckingham Palace once before, years ago, with
Richard, when he received the OBE,'' the much-married screen diva
said, referring to Burton's elevation to Officer of the Order of
the British Empire.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ''I miss him so much. I wish he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II made Taylor a Dame Commander of the Order of
the British Empire -- the female equivalent of a knight -- for
services to the entertainment industry and to charity, including
her fund-raising for AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a heavy pearl necklace and pearl and diamond
earrings, Taylor, 68, wore one of the large diamond rings lavished
on her by Burton, the Welsh actor who died in 1984. The couple went
through two tempestuous marriages between 1964 and 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who wore an embroidered frock coat in mauve Thai silk
and rode in a wheelchair, was allowed to use a palace side entrance
and the queen's private elevator. She stood to meet the sovereign,
supported by a royal page.
</P>
<P>
   The actress has broken her back three times and has been
bothered in recent years by other health problems, including hip
surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   She even arrived on time, confessing afterward, ''I have a
reputation for being late. I thought, 'God no, don't let me live up
to my reputation.'''
</P>
<P>
   All of her children -- Michael Wilding, 47, Chris Wilding, 45,
Liza Todd-Tivey, 42, and Maria Burton-Carson, 39 -- attended the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the queen also made a dame of actress Julie Andrews,
64.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, who won an Academy Award for her portrayal as the
magic-making governess in the 1964 film ''Mary Poppins,'' called it
''the greatest honor of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Taylor, Andrews is a British citizen who spends most of her
time in the United States. Andrews is married to American movie
director Blake Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was born in London in 1932 to American parents, art
dealers from St. Louis, Mo. When World War II broke out in 1939,
the family relocated to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's first movie appearance was in 1942, at the age of 10,
in ''There's One Born Every Minute.'' She was nominated for Academy
Awards for ''Raintree Country'' (1955); ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof''
(1958) and ''Suddenly, Last Summer'' (1959), and won her first for
''Butterfield 8'' in 1960. She won a second Oscar in 1966 for
''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, she will receive a British Film Institute fellowship,
a lifetime achievement award. Two days later, a celebration of her
life will be staged at the Royal Albert Hall.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition devoted to Taylor opens at the National Portrait
Gallery on Thursday, and continues through June 16.

<HEADLINE> Supremacist Said Admits LA Spree  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The white supremacist gunman who allegedly
wounded children at a Jewish community center admitted he later
killed a Filipino-American postman and said he would kill all
nonwhites if he could, the government alleged Tuesday in court
papers seeking the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Buford O. Furrow Jr. also declared himself to be ''at war with
the Jewish-controlled federal government'' and said he hoped others
would emulate his actions of Aug. 10, federal prosecutors said in a
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendant explicitly stated that he is not sorry for his
crimes,'' they added in filings submitted to U.S. District Judge
Nora Manella.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that two months after his incarceration last
summer, Furrow threatened to kill a Latino prison inmate and guards
assigned to his housing unit.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow is charged with killing letter carrier Joseph Ileto just
hours after allegedly wounding three boys, a teen-age girl and a
woman at the North Valley Jewish Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow has pleaded innocent, and his team of public defenders
has launched an effort to save him from the death penalty. They
have argued that the federal death penalty statute is
unconstitutional and that the factors presented to justify it in
the Furrow case were too vague.
</P>
<P>
   The next hearing on the death penalty issue is scheduled for
June 5.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Ready for Autonomy  </HEADLINE>
By KIM GAMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The Dalai Lama said Tuesday he was
seeking autonomy and not independence for Tibet, but that
officially atheistic China must not have control over spiritual
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''China maintains strict control over all aspects, including
cultural and spiritual,'' the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader said.
''Those fields that we in Tibet can manage, we should manage.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner was making his first stop on a
swing through Scandinavia. He was to meet Wednesday with Prime
Minister Goeran Persson despite objections by China, which controls
Tibet and sees the Dalai Lama as a rallying point for
pro-independence forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, who later appeared in his first interactive
Internet interview with the daily Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, said
countries around the world were becoming increasingly intertwined
and needed to show mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the economic field and also in the ecological field, the
concept of one-sided defeat is impossible,'' he said. ''Different
views are always there ... we have to address those different
views, but not through violence or using force but in the spirit of
values.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for more interaction between Chinese and Tibetan
people and said he did not advocate policies cutting off communist
China from the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''The policy of containing China is not only impractical but
morally wrong,'' he said. ''They must have the chance to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 with thousands of supporters
after a failed revolt. From his headquarters at Dharmsala, in
northern India, he has headed a nonviolent struggle against Chinese
rule, while saying he is prepared to hold talks with China on
autonomy for his homeland.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Push Into West Eritrea  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ETHIOPIAN-ERITREAN BORDER (AP) -- Ethiopian troops
continued their push into western Ertirea on Tuesday in an attempt
to cut retreating Eritrean forces off from their main supply route
and the rest of their army.
</P>
<P>
   But Eritrea called Ethiopian claims of major gains ''nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our objective is to make sure the invading army is not capable
of occupying our territory again,'' said Col. Ghebre Kidane, one of
the officers commanding Ethiopia's five-day assault. The successful
attack was intended to produce a swift end to Ethiopia's two-year
border conflict with its small neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Ghebre spoke from inside Eritrea, where artillery thudded
in the distance and an Eritrean jet fighter swooped in low and
bombed a hillside.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is very fluid, and there are no fixed
positions,'' Eritrean presidential spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel
said in the Eritrean capital of Asmara. He denied that Ethiopian
troops had pushed deep into Eritrean territory.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, diplomats worked on a proposed U.N. Security
Council resolution, a U.S. plan for an arms embargo on the two
nations if they fail to adhere to a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Russia dropped its objection to the embargo but joined France
and other countries in demanding a time limit on any ban approved
by the Security Council. Another council meeting was set Wednesday
to try to reach agreement on a final text, and ambassadors
expressed hope that the council would vote on the resolution late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At Shambiko, just inside the Eritrean border, shiny artillery
shell casings were scattered on the hard-baked earth, rifles
stacked in piles and fatigues hanging from scrubby bushes bore
evidence to the flight of Eritrean soldiers when they were
surprised and surrounded in their trenches by the Ethiopians in
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   When journalists toured the area Tuesday -- accompanied by
Ethiopian officers and a government representative -- they saw the
bloated and decomposing bodies of 15 Eritrean troops, far fewer
than expected after the Ethiopian claim to have killed thousands.
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation why there weren't more bodies, and when
asked, captured Eritrean troops said they had seen few of their
comrades die.
</P>
<P>
   But both nations continued to boast of inflicting major losses
on each other.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Ghebre said the next objective was Barentu, 25 miles
northwest of Shambiko and 80 miles east of the Sudanese border. He
said the town was now the command and logistics center for the
retreating Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse's
office raised the ante in the verbal warfare, attempting to
discredit the Eritrean government as ''a rogue regime'' that lies
to the international community.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that by launching the latest attack, Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi appears determined to gain the upper
hand in setting conditions for peace with Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki, his former comrade-in-arms.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, Isaias was
the senior member of a rebel coalition, including Meles' Tigray
People's Liberation Front, which ousted the 17-year-old Marxist
military regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. Two years
later, the Eritreans gained independence from Ethiopia after a
30-year guerrilla war with Emperor Haile Selassie and Mengistu.
Meles became head of Ethiopia's new government formed by a
coalition of four rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 20 trucks sped south from Asmara carrying some 600
Eritrean troops toward Mendefera, the western end of the east-west
road to Barentu. People along the road thrust water and food at the
soldiers, clapping and cheering as they passed.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Ghebre, the Ethiopian officer, said his troops had pushed
as far as Areza, 19 miles west of Mendefera. The Ethiopian forces
are estimated to outnumber Eritrea's by a ratio of 15 to 1.

<HEADLINE> Co. Sells Electronic Treated Beef  </HEADLINE>
By GREGG AAMOT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN CENTER, Minn. (AP) -- A Minnesota company said Tuesday
it is the first in the nation to begin selling electronically
pasteurized beef, which uses electricity to kill bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Huisken Meats, based in Chandler in the southwestern part of the
state, is selling the pasteurized frozen beef patties in some
grocery stores in the Twin Cities.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials compared the development of electronic
pasteurization to the introduction of heat-pasteurized milk. The
process kills E. coli, listeria and other bacteria and parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Health Department Commissioner Jan Malcolm and former
state epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, now a consultant
specializing in infectious disease, said the process is safe,
biting into pasteurized hamburgers at a news conference Tuesday to
illustrate their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   They said electronic pasteurization will save lives and reduce
health-care costs. Each year in the United States, 76 million
people get sick and 5,000 die because of food-borne bacteria,
according to the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic pasteurization takes a few seconds and is done after
the ground beef is prepared and packaged. A San Diego-based company
called SureBeam is providing the electronic pasteurization at a
facility in Sioux City, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA approved electronic pasteurization in 1997. In December,
the Department of Agriculture established guidelines for the
process, paving the way for Huisken and SureBeam to collaborate on
the beef patties.
</P>
<P>
   Officials made a point of distinguishing between electronic
pasteurization and irradiation, a process in which low levels of
radiation are used to kill bacteria and parasites. Critics say not
enough is known about its safety.

<HEADLINE> Henderson Still Hanging Around Mets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rickey Henderson, released last weekend by the
New York Mets, was still in the team's clubhouse before the game on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in street clothes with sunglasses on his head, Henderson
was seen walking around a relatively empty clubhouse hours before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, baseball's career steals leader, was placed on
unconditional release waivers Saturday, one day after failing to
run out a drive. Barring an unexpected waiver claim, he becomes a
free agent at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine said he didn't mind that Henderson
was still in the team's clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was in my office the other day and we had a nice talk,''
Valentine said. ''I think he feels he has an opportunity that will
benefit his career. I have no problem with him being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's name plate had already been taken off his locker and
two packed cardboard boxes sat inside his stall Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He either came back for his check or he really liked it
here,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, angry all year because he wanted a raise from his
$1.9 million salary, hit .219 for the Mets this year with no homers
and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm certainly disappointed that Rickey didn't play like he did
last year here, because he was a very important part of the team,''
Mets co-owner Fred Wilpon said. ''I think it left our manager and
general manager scratching their heads. But I think our guys
handled the situation very well, with a lot of respect and
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's replacement, Joe McEwing, started in center field
and was the Mets' leadoff hitter for the third straight game.

<HEADLINE> Pragmatic Rule Vowed for Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- If he's elected president of
Venezuela, Hugo Chavez's main challenger in this month's elections
said Tuesday he will move away from the president's revolutionary
rhetoric and concentrate instead on creating jobs and curbing
rampant crime.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Arias Cardenas, a former army officer who helped
Chavez stage a failed coup attempt in 1992, said he considers
himself much more of a ''public manager'' than a military commander
-- and insisted Chavez has brought Venezuela dangerously close to
dictatorship since taking office last year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to foreign reporters Tuesday, he said as president he
would ''increase investor confidence,'' respect private property,
cooperate fully with the United States in the war on drugs and turn
Venezuela ''into a modern country in international trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias's words were a far cry from Chavez's call for a ''social
revolution'' and portrayal of business, Church and media leaders as
members of a ''rancid oligarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans go to the polls on May 28 to vote for president,
Congress, governors and local councils as part of a new
constitution pushed through by Chavez last year that requires most
public offices to be ''re-legitimized'' through new balloting.
</P>
<P>
   With his call for pragmatic leadership and a coherent economic
program to end a severe recession, Arias, a former governor of the
oil-rich state of Zulia, has won over most of the middle and upper
classes in the South American nation of 23 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But in the slums that are home to the majority of the
population, Chavez still rides high. Polls show he leads Arias in
this month's elections by 20 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   When Arias walked through a slum in western Caracas last Friday,
some residents greeted him with shouts of ''Chavez! Chavez!'' and
displayed an effigy of him with a sign on its chest reading
''traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has repeatedly called Arias a traitor for distancing
himself from the government.
</P>
<P>
   The two other military commanders who helped Chavez lead the
1992 coup attempt have also broken away from the president,
insisting he has abandoned the goals of their rebellion and grabbed
too much power.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions inside Chavez's government intensified on Monday
when Fatherland for All, one of three parties making up the ruling
coalition, withdrew its support for the president's re-election bid
and abandoned the government.
</P>
<P>
   That move had potential international ramifications, since
Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez, who is now the president of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is a member of
Fatherland For All.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a ministry spokeswoman said Rodriguez was not likely
to resign because of the political split. The minister was in San
Diego, Calif. on Tuesday and unavailable for comment.

<HEADLINE> Panama Rescues Sunken French Train  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Work crews have pulled a 15-car
French train and steam locomotive from the bottom of Lake Gatun,
recovering part of the history of the earliest attempts to build
the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
   The algae-covered steel train was pulled from the man-made lake
by special Canal Authority cranes Monday, a century after malaria
and financial problems forced a French private firm to abandon them
on land that was later flooded to form the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a true jewel, a treasure,'' said the government's
minister for canal Affairs, Ricardo Martinelli. ''I think every
Panamanian has the right to get to know the legacy left by the
French.''
</P>
<P>
   Panama has plenty of artifacts from the U.S. canal-building
project in the early years of the last century: Many of the lock
mechanisms still in use date from the period.
</P>
<P>
   But the train, abandoned in the late 1890s and discovered by
divers months ago, is one of the few vestiges of the 20-year French
project here.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a rail route known as Penas Blancas, the French trains
were used to carry employees and equipment under a French plan for
the canal that began in 1880. The Americans flooded the former rail
yard to form a reservoir around 1910 to provide water to lift boats
through the locks.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more rail cars are believed to be under the lake. The
train cars recovered Monday will be cleaned and put on display.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Rodriguez Leaves Game Injured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs outfielder Henry Rodriguez left
Tuesday night's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers after fouling
a pitch off his right knee in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who also fouled a pitch off a toe last week, suffered
a bruised knee and is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit the 0-2 pitch from Kevin Brown and the ball

pain, and grabbed his knee. He lay on the ground for several
minutes before being helped to his feet.
</P>

<HEADLINE> People Return After Los Alamos Fire  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The thousands of people streaming back
into fire-devastated Los Alamos on Tuesday found smoke still
lingering in the air and most stores closed or without such staples
as meat and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   It was a city entirely different from the one they had left just
six days before, when they fled ahead of a wall of flames that
raced up the sides of canyons and left 405 families homeless. A
Forest Service spokesman, Jim Paxon, called it the largest fire in
the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory remained closed, and
large pockets of the town remained without gas or electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our neighborhood burned down. What happens now? Are people
going to leave? Are they going to stick around and rebuild?''
wondered Jerry Kindsfather, who with his brother Gary operates Ed's
Food Market, a small grocery store on the edge of one of the city's
hardest-hit sections. People filed in Tuesday to stock up on things
like eggs, milk and bread.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty percent of Los Alamos, where the homes burned, was still
off-limits Tuesday, and the devastation appeared overwhelming.
Entire neighborhoods were burned, leaving the trees looking like
blackened toothpicks. Smoke from the fire, now burning a safe
distance away, still filled the canyons.
</P>
<P>
   Crews were finding hazardous chemicals in the off-limits areas,
including loose asbestos, swollen cans of paint, and propane
bottles in the ash, state Environment Secretary Pete Maggiore said.
</P>
<P>
   The 46,000-acre fire, 35 percent contained, was moving
northeast, away from Los Alamos and toward unburned forest land
Tuesday, said David Seesholtz, a fire information spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It started outside of town on National Park Service land on May
4, at Bandelier Monument, when a controlled burn meant to clear
away dry brush and prevent future wildfires was pushed out of
control by high winds.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the danger, all 11,000 residents of Los Alamos
and 14,000 people from surrounding communities were ordered out of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Tuesday, the House unanimously called on the
federal government to take responsibility and reimburse wildfire
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''This wasn't an act of God. It was an act of man,'' said Rep.
Heather Wilson, R-N.M., the measure's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   In the devastated neighborhoods, the fire raced down block after
block, destroying almost everything in its path, but occasionally
sparing a home here or there. On one street, a big blue house was
still standing, while everything around it burned. On another, a
two-story salmon-colored residence stood untouched, the only home
left on the block.
</P>
<P>
   John Jaramillo's house and restaurant survived, but his
girlfriend lost her home. They weren't sure they wanted to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of me wants to help rebuild the town and the other part
wants to just pack it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of Los Alamos had its electricity back on
Tuesday, said Chris Ortega, utilities manager for Los Alamos
County. He said it would be at least another day before power was
restored everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gas was also available to about 75 percent of the town, but even
in areas where it has been restored it won't be turned on for
individual homes until people return and request it. Utility
workers were circling neighborhoods on Tuesday, volunteering to
turn on the gas wherever they found someone home, Ortega said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 2,000 people who were still not allowed to return
home were briefly escorted by the National Guard into the
devastated area so they could retrieve personal belongings such as
clothes and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ''The freezers have just got to be a mess. We're hoping to grab
garbage bags and throw everything in there,'' said Mary Holmes, who
went with her husband, Herb, to Los Alamos High School to arrange a
National Guard escort.
</P>
<P>
   At Ed's Market, Kindsfather returned to find refrigerators
filled with spoiled eggs and melted ice cream that had oozed out of
containers and formed a colorful sludge on the shelves. He also had
to dump $20,000 worth of frozen food and won't get another order
until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got rid of the chicken first,'' he said. ''That's like a
time bomb sitting around.''
</P>
<P>
   At the True Value hardware store, manager Dennis George expects
to do a brisk business in the days ahead in buckets, brooms,
hammers, nails, flashlights and axes.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the first sales his employee Brenda Law made Tuesday
was for flower seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone has their own way of healing,'' she said, ''and
flowers represent life.''

<HEADLINE> Man Shot, Ex-Wife Survives Jump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A prominent attorney was shot to death in his
home and his ex-wife survived a 175-foot jump off the Sunshine
Skyway Bridge on Tuesday as detectives searched for her as a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Cleveland Freeman, 54, managed to call 911 but died
Monday night from a gunshot, police said. Freeman's wife, Connie,
50, suffered minor injuries after she was beaten with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the attacker was Freeman's ex-wife, Katherine
King Freeman, 41. Hours after the attack, she jumped from the
bridge and was pulled from Tampa Bay by a fire rescue crew, police
said. She was in critical condition later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said it is rare that someone survives a jump from
the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Freeman was charged with first-degree murder, said
sheriff's spokesman Rod Reder.
</P>
<P>
   The killing shocked Tampa's legal and medical communities.
Grover Freeman had earned a top reputation for defending doctors
being disciplined by state medical regulators.
</P>
<P>
   He won statewide notoriety in successfully defending the
licenses of a Tampa surgeon accused of amputating the wrong foot
and a Sebring surgeon accused of hastening the death of a cancer
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine and Grover Freeman have a 13-year-old daughter, who
was being cared for by family members. The couple divorced in 1996
and friends said it was an amicable split, Reder said.

<HEADLINE> Expos 2, Diamondbacks 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Randy Johnson made his first start at Olympic
Stadium in 11 seasons, and the Montreal Expos became the first team
to beat him in a regular-season game since last Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White hit a 440-foot homer in the seventh inning and
Mike Mordecai singled home a run in the eighth as Montreal beat the
Arizona Diamondbacks 2-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (7-1), traded by Montreal to Seattle on May 25, 1989,
had won 10 consecutive regular decisions and was unbeaten in 12
starts since losing to the Expos last August.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched his major league-leading fifth complete game,
allowing one earned run and walking none. He struck out 12 to raise
his major league-leading total to 110, reaching double digits for
the eighth time this year and the 133rd time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's ERA, the best in the majors, rose from 0.95 to 0.97.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Vazquez (4-1) held the Diamondbacks to five hits in
eight-plus innings, struck out seven and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Erubiel Durazo singled leading off the ninth to chase Vazquez.
Steve Kline got Scott Finley to fly to center, and Dustin Hermanson
walked Greg Colbrunn and Kelly Stinnett.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Harris then grounded to shortstop Orlando Cabrera, who
started a game-ending double play. Hermanson got his second save in
three chances.
</P>
<P>
   White hit a 3-2 pitch from Johnson for his fifth home run of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera singled leading off the eighth and advanced to third
when Johnson's pickoff attempt sailed into the Expos' dugout for an
error. Mordecai followed with a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson retired 17 of his first 18 batters, allowing just a
two-out double to Vazquez in the third before Wilton Guerrero
singled to center with two outs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona threatened in the first, getting runners to second and
third with one out. The Expos escaped when first baseman Lee
Stevens snared Durazo's liner and Vazquez struck out Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, 0-for-1 with a walk against Johnson coming in, was
0-for-3 with three strikeouts. He was the only left-handed batter
in the Expos' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Johnson was a combined 3-4 with a 4.69 ERA in 11 games
for Montreal, including 10 starts. ... Only Nolan Ryan (215) has
more double-digit strikeout games. ... The Expos are the only major
league team Johnson has faced and yet to beat. Johnson went 0-1
against Montreal in two starts at home last season. He has yet to
pitch against Houston. ... The Diamondbacks haven't lost a road
series since last July. Arizona has won 16 series and split a
four-game series in that span. ... Arizona is 77-28 (.733) since
last July 20. ... Switch-hitter Wilton Guerrero started in center
field in place of Peter Bergeron and made a nice leaping catch at
the wall on Jay Bell's drive to center leading off the sixth. ...
Closer Ugueth Urbina will have arthroscopic surgery Wednesday
morning to remove one or more possible bone chips from his right
elbow. Urbina, who also had bone chips removed from the same elbow
in Dec. 1996, is expected to be sidelined for 4-6 weeks.

<HEADLINE> Booted Napster Fans Want Back On  </HEADLINE>
By RON HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Thousands of Metallica fans booted by
online music sharing software company Napster Inc. for allegedly
swapping the heavy metal band's music want their access reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Napster said Tuesday it received notice from more than 30,000
MusicShare software users claiming they were misidentified as
persons illegally trading Metallica's copyrighted songs in the
popular MP3 digital format.
</P>
<P>
   If Metallica does not take legal action against individual users
within 10 days of Tuesday's notice, Napster will restore those
blocked accounts, citing federal copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has begun forwarding those petitions to Metallica's
attorney, who disputed their claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're (the users) absolutely lying. There's no question that
they're lying,'' said attorney Howard King. ''Each and every one of
them was offering Metallica MP3s for uploads.''
</P>
<P>
   Metallica sued the company last month for copyright infringement
and racketeering, alleging that Napster's software encouraged users
to freely trade the band's songs without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica compiled 317,377 Napster usernames they allege were
trading the band's tunes. The band's drummer, Lars Ulrich,
hand-delivered the list of usernames to Napster headquarters in San
Mateo two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Napster responded by blocking access to those listed, but it
also posted information on its Web site telling users how to file a
counter notification if they felt they had been misidentified.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that so many people have come forward and disputed
Metallica's accusation that they did not break the law demonstrates
that this is not a black and white issue,'' Napster's 19-year-old
founder Shawn Fanning said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Metallica's attorney said he expects another client,
rap artist Dr. Dre, to notify Napster on Wednesday of more than
200,000 users who illegally traded his music.

Ross Littell:
</P>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Ross Littell, an internationally
renowned designer of furniture and textiles in New York City and
Europe, died April 17 of a brain tumor. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Littell and partners William Katavolos and Douglas
Kelley created an elegant T chair -- a three-legged construction of
chrome and leather. Their chairs are in the permanent collections
of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and other museums.
</P>
<P>
   The three-man design team was part of a minimalist movement
which produced furniture often made with lightweight materials.
</P>
<P>
   Littell and fellow Pratt students Katavolos and Kelley combined
to form a design studio, producing an award-winning line of
furniture that included the T chair and a coffee table made of
tubular steel and wooden dowels. They also produced wallpapers and
award-winning fabrics exhibited at the Milan X Triennale and the
Brussels World's Fair in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   After the partnership dissolved, Littell went to Europe as a
Fulbright scholar. He took 2,200 photographs specializing in
patterns, such as the cobblestones of Paris -- leading him to design
textile patterns inspired by mathematical ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years while living in Italy and Denmark, Littell
concentrated on creating fine art metallic pieces called
''Luminars.''
Alexander MacDonald:
</P>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Alexander MacDonald, the American
founding editor of Thailand's oldest English language newspaper,
the Bangkok Post, died Sunday of a heart attack. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald, formerly an agent with the U.S. Office of Strategic
Services in the Pacific during the Second World War, was one of a
small group of Thais and foreigners who helped set up the newspaper
in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He produced a four-page newspaper six days a week for some 200
subscribers and wrote a column called ''Postmen Say.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald was forced out of the editorship and banished from
Thailand by a military regime that objected to the Post's
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   He settled in his native state of Massachusetts and edited a
weekly newspaper in Marblehead.
Joe McNamara:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Joe McNamara, chronicler of crime for the Daily
News, died Monday from a blood clot in his lungs and a heart
attack. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara spent the past 17 years writing the popular ''Justice
Story'' feature for the Sunday paper. It reveled in murder, mayhem
and mystery, recounting the histories of the infamous.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara retired from day-to-day journalism in 1991 after 40
years editing and writing, but continued the weekly feature.
</P>
<P>
   His last project, finished just weeks ago, was editing a
collection of his pieces for a book, ''The Justice Story,''
scheduled for publication next month.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara began as a reporter-photographer at the former Denville
(N.J.) Herald. He moved to the Newark Star-Ledger, then to the New
York Journal-American, before joining the Daily News in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara is survived by his wife, Josephine, six children, five
brothers and sisters, and 18 grandchildren.
Werner Rosinski:
</P>
<P>
   HUNSTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- Werner Rosinski, part of a team of
former German scientists headed by Werner Von Braun who helped
build the U.S. Army's rocket program and NASA's space program, died
Sunday. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Rosinski worked with von Braun on the electrical system of the
German V-2 rocket before the scientists surrendered to U.S. troops
near the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950 the scientists arrived in Huntsville to develop
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Rosinski became branch chief of the electrical-systems division
at Marshall Space Flight Center during the Apollo missions to the
moon, the first of which took place in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rosinski who often pressed the button to launch rockets
during the team's experiments developing a propulsion system.
</P>
<P>
   Guidance systems for the early rockets were primitive.
Sometimes, when a rocket flew far off course, Rosinski had to
transmit a signal to destroy it to ensure the rocket didn't turn
back and endanger the rocket team.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 8, Phillies 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Andy Benes homered and pitched seven strong
innings, and Jim Edmonds homered and drove in three runs Tuesday
night as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Philadelphia Phillies
8-2.
</P>
<P>
   Benes (3-2) allowed two runs and 10 hits, struck out eight and
walked none. He extended the Cardinals lead to 3-1 in the fifth
with his seventh homer in 641 career at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Person (3-2) allowed seven runs and six hits in 6 1-3
innings. He also hit a pair of batters and they both scored.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has lost four straight and five of seven.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds' 442-foot homer in the first was his 13th of the season
and just the 16th home run in the right-field upper deck in the
29-year history of Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew, the object of Philadelphia fans' ire when he failed
to sign with the Phillies in 1997, was hit by a pitch in the
second, advanced on Craig Paquette's double and scored on Eli
Marrero's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Drew added an RBI groundout in the sixth for a 4-1 lead, and the
Cardinals added three runs in the seventh on Edmonds' two-run
single and Edgar Renteria's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which got all its offense from the top of the
order, scored on Mickey Morandini's RBI double in the third and
Scott Rolen's run-scoring single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The first four hitters in the Philadelphia lineup were 10-for-16
with two runs and two RBIs. Doug Glanville and Morandini were both
3-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Renteria added the eighth run in the ninth on an RBI single by
Ray Lankford. Renteria was 3-for-4 with three runs scored.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The crowd 18,399 was the smallest for a game involving the
Cardinals this season. ... Glanville is 13-for-28 against Benes in
his career. ... Benes is 17-6 against Philadelphia. ... The loudest
cheers of the night came from those listening to the Flyers-Devils
playoff game on the radio. Every time the Flyers scored, the crowd
roared ''Let's Go Flyers!''

<HEADLINE> Suspect Faces New Slay Charges  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A man police believe was a serial killer
of prostitutes will be charged this week in nine slayings, plus one
attack in which the victim survived, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lee Yates Jr. had been charged only with a single count
of first-degree murder in the 1997 slaying of a 16-year-old
runaway.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's statement was the first indication that officers had
identified a survivor in an attack allegedly involving Yates.
Sheriff's spokesman Dave Reagan said the survivor was female, but
he declined to provide any other details.
</P>
<P>
   Since the April 18 arrest of Yates, a 47-year-old married father
of five, sheriff's officers have said they believed he was the
serial killer who preyed on prostitutes in Spokane and Tacoma in
the late 1990s and could be responsible for more than a dozen
slayings. Investigators have said DNA and other evidence tie Yates
to the Spokane and Tacoma killings.
</P>
<P>
   Yates' court-appointed public defender, Richard Fasy, has
declined to comment on the possibility of further charges.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police in Germany are investigating whether Yates
might be involved in the deaths of as many as 26 women in that
country, FBI Agent Norm Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Yates served two tours of duty in Germany with the Army, and
German authorities are especially interested in any evidence found
in a 1988 Chevrolet van that Yates had shipped to Germany. Spokane
authorities have the van and are searching it for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Yates is being held in the Spokane County Jail on $1.5 million
bail.

<HEADLINE> Gore Daughter Graduates Law School  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Political daughter, campaign adviser and
fund-raiser Karenna Gore Schiff, whose mother teasingly calls her
''the next senator from Tennessee,'' claimed her degree at Columbia
Law School on Tuesday and took another step toward inheriting the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the commencement address, Vice President Al Gore, who
dropped out of law school 24 years ago to dive undistracted into
politics, mixed lawyer jokes (''the shark that won't eat the lawyer
out of professional courtesy'') and Gore jokes (''I invented
Lexis-Nexis'') with a paean to elected office and public service.
</P>
<P>
   As for his daughter, the Democratic presidential candidate told
the Class of 2000: ''I understand that one of today's graduates
even works as a volunteer on a presidential campaign. I wish her
success in that effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore offered the standard handshake to each of the about 400 law
graduates who paraded across the Lincoln Center stage with their
degrees -- including his daughter, who wrapped him in a hug instead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has praised Karenna as having ''very nearly perfect pitch''
for politics. And few who watched her work the campaign trail and
the New York fund-raising circuit doubt she feels the call.
</P>
<P>
   With school finished and no immediate plans for employment,
Schiff, 26, the eldest of the Gores' four children, is expected to
become more active in her father's campaign, where she heads
Gorenet, an effort to attract young voters.
</P>
<P>
   For the Gores, the commencement was a celebration of the
generation. Grandmother Pauline Gore, 87, one of the first women to
graduate from Vanderbilt Law School 64 years ago, presided over the
prime box seats reserved for the Gores and Schiffs. Gore saluted
her as a pioneer of women practicing law.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper Gore held hands with her frail mother-in-law and wore
sunglasses as she flipped through the program beside her other two
daughters. Albert III was not present.
</P>
<P>
   Both the vice president and his late father, who pressured his
son into Vanderbilt Law School as a stepping stone to politics,
represented Tennessee in the U.S. Senate. Gore left Vanderbilt
after less than two years to run for a House seat in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Tipper Gore has teasingly called her daughter ''the
next senator from Tennessee,'' according to a family friend,
although the political base she's building through Gorenet is
centered in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hope one day she would run,'' said Robert Zimmerman,
who chairs Gore's New York campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman said Schiff, despite her classes and infant son Wyatt,
was instrumental in marshaling the Christmastime volunteers needed
to circulate petitions to get Gore on the state ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into connections to her husband Andrew's wealthy banking
family, she also organized several fund-raisers, mostly with
younger donors writing modest checks of between $50 and $100.
</P>
<P>
   Filling in for her mother on a campaign bus trip through
Tennessee in March, Schiff said she had no immediate plans to run
for office, but like a good politician didn't rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   Father and daughter have a close -- and competitive, as is the
family way -- relationship. When she graduated Harvard in 1995,
friends say Gore was playfully peeved that she bested the mediocre
grades he earned there in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent one post-college year working in Spain, using her
mother's maiden name, Aitcheson, to avoid attention, Schiff tutors
her father in the Spanish he uses to court Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Gore takes seriously his daughter's political
instincts and speaks to her daily about the campaign. It was Schiff
who pushed for the controversial hiring last year of feminist
author Naomi Wolf to advise Gore on his image.

Hillary Clinton Nominated for Senate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With thousands of supporters cheering in a packed sports
arena, Hillary Rodham Clinton was nominated for the Senate today in her adopted
state by the New York Democratic Party's convention. The nomination by the 352
delegates of the only first lady to run for public office was unanimous. ''Make
no mistake, this election is not about me or my Republican opponent,'' Clinton
said in a draft of her acceptance speech. ''It's about the people of New York
and our common mission.'' The first lady said she wanted to improve the lives of
New York's families and children.

Dalai Lama Ready for Autonomy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The Dalai Lama said Tuesday he was seeking autonomy
and not independence for Tibet, but that officially atheistic China must not
have control over spiritual issues. ''China maintains strict control over all
aspects, including cultural and spiritual,'' the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
said. ''Those fields that we in Tibet can manage, we should manage.'' The 1989
Nobel Peace Prize winner was making his first stop on a swing through
Scandinavia. He was to meet Wednesday with Prime Minister Goeran Persson despite
objections by China, which controls Tibet and sees the Dalai Lama as a rallying
point for pro-independence forces.

House Nixes Budget Overhaul Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today emphatically rejected a bill aimed at
overhauling the federal budget process. Among the proposals defeated were a
switch to a two-year budget and ending the possibility of year-end government
shutdowns. The legislation, defeated 250-166, would also have gotten the
president involved in budget negotiations earlier in the year to prevent
end-of-session deadlocks, created a rainy-day reserve fund for emergencies and
ensured that spending cuts in one area of the budget not be used to boost
spending elsewhere.
</P>

Fed Raises Interest Rates
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates today by a
half point, pushing a key rate to its highest level in nine years. Fed
policy-makers signaled they were prepared to move even more aggressively if
needed to fight inflation. The central bank raised its target for the federal
funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, to 6.5 percent. It was
the sixth time the Fed has increased the funds rate since last June but the
first half-point move. Combined with the other five quarter-point increases, the
funds rate has now been raised 1.75 percentage points in less than a year.

regular-season game since last Aug. 31. Rondell White hit a 440-foot homer in
the seventh inning and Mike Mordecai singled home a run in the eighth as
Montreal beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 2-0 tonight. Johnson (7-1), traded by
Montreal to Seattle on May 25, 1989, had won 10 consecutive regular decisions
and was unbeaten in 12 starts since losing to the Expos last August.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Together for Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In a supporting role on the sideline,
President Clinton applauded Tuesday night as New York Democrats
nominated his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as their candidate for
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton walked hand in hand with the first lady as she was
introduced on stage at a downtown arena before an audience of more
than 11,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   After a few waves and without a word, the president stepped back
as Mrs. Clinton moved to the microphone and accepted the unanimous
nomination from the 352 delegates to the State Democratic Party
convention.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first time a first lady has run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton mentioned her husband briefly in her remarks
saying, ''I am so grateful for his support. I would not be standing
here tonight were it not for Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I just decided I ought to be there,'' the president had said
earlier. ''It's a big deal for her, a big night for her and I want
to be there with her. I just want to be there to support her.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was not a registered voter in New York yet. In
fact, he said he voted in a school board election in Arkansas just
a few days ago. ''For me, it's hard, you know, on a personal
basis'' to change his voting registration to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this is a commitment we made together, something that she
wanted to do and a lot of people in New York wanted her to do,'' he
said. ''And I want to support her in every way I can. And I
certainly intend to vote for her. Since I'm a taxpaying resident of
New York now, I'm entitled to vote and I intend to take advantage
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew to Albany late Tuesday afternoon. He was to have
been in Washington to address the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, and later was to have traveled to his home in
Chappaqua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the convention would be the setting for retiring
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's ''farewell address'' to the people
of New York. ''I'd like to hear what he has to say.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear who Mrs. Clinton's opponent will be.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, is hinting
that he's going to stay in the Senate race against Mrs. Clinton. In
recent weeks, the 55-year-old Giuliani has disclosed that he has
treatable prostate cancer and that he is seeking a legal separation
from his wife, TV personality and actress Donna Hanover.

<HEADLINE> Five Rescued From North Pole  </HEADLINE>
By T.A. BADGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Five adventurers -- including the
aviation legend Dick Rutan -- were rescued from the North Pole after
their biplane broke through the ice and sank more than 13,000 feet
to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   An airplane dispatched from Canada picked up the men Monday
night after they had spent 12 hours at the top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   They were not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions were mild by polar standards -- winds were calm, and
the temperature was a little above zero, said Coast Guard spokesman
Darrell Wilson. And the 24-hour daylight made the rescue easier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being able to perform a mission like this in daylight is
better than trying to do something like this in the dark,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rutan, who is from Mojave, Calif., was traveling with Ron
Sheardown, John Pletcher and Jim Bowden, all of Anchorage, and Jan
Haugsad of Norway. They were aboard Sheardown's single-engine,
Polish-made biplane, which was traveling with a smaller Cessna with
two people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Rutan in 1986 was part of the two-person crew that made the
first flight around the world without stopping or refueling.
</P>
<P>
   He told Anchorage television station KTUU on Tuesday that he
wasn't too worried about being stuck on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people I was with were very highly experienced and highly
skilled in arctic flying and arctic survival,'' he said from a
Canadian weather station via a ham-radio connection.
</P>
<P>
   The adventurers left Anchorage last week, arrived at the North
Pole on Thursday, then went to Norway. They spent the weekend in
Norway and were heading back to Alaska when they put down at the
pole again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't claim to be on a scientific expedition,'' said Lee
Wareham, the Cessna pilot. ''We just felt like going to the North
Pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Wareham landed his small plane and took off again Monday before
the ice began breaking up. The larger biplane couldn't get turned
around in time for takeoff before it began sinking.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone aboard the 4-year-old biplane got off safely and had
enough gear to camp out on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were very well-prepared,'' Wilson said. ''They were the
perfect people for that to happen to.''
</P>
<P>
   The rescued men were taken to Eureka, Canada, about 700 miles
south of the pole. Another plane chartered by their families was
scheduled to bring them back to Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia-Eritrea Embargo Splits UN  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ETHIOPIAN-ERITREAN BORDER (AP) -- Ethiopian troops
continued their push into western Eritrea on Tuesday in an attempt
to cut retreating Eritrean forces off from their main supply route
and the rest of their army.
</P>
<P>
   But Eritrea called Ethiopian claims of major gains ''nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our objective is to make sure the invading army is not capable
of occupying our territory again,'' said Col. Ghebre Kidane, one of
the officers commanding Ethiopia's five-day assault. The successful
attack was intended to produce a swift end to Ethiopia's two-year
border conflict with its small neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Ghebre spoke from inside Eritrea, where artillery thudded
in the distance and an Eritrean jet fighter swooped in low and
bombed a hillside.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is very fluid, and there are no fixed
positions,'' Eritrean presidential spokesman Yemane Gebremeskel
said in the Eritrean capital of Asmara. He denied that Ethiopian
troops had pushed deep into Eritrean territory.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, diplomats worked on a proposed U.N. Security
Council resolution, a U.S. plan for an arms embargo on the two
nations if they fail to adhere to a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Russia dropped its objection to the embargo but joined France
and other countries in demanding a time limit on any ban approved
by the Security Council. Another council meeting was set Wednesday
to try to reach agreement on a final text, and ambassadors
expressed hope that the council would vote on the resolution late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At Shambiko, just inside the Eritrean border, shiny artillery
shell casings were scattered on the hard-baked earth, rifles
stacked in piles and fatigues hanging from scrubby bushes bore
evidence to the flight of Eritrean soldiers when they were
surprised and surrounded in their trenches by the Ethiopians in
mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   When journalists toured the area Tuesday -- accompanied by
Ethiopian officers and a government representative -- they saw the
bloated and decomposing bodies of 15 Eritrean troops, far fewer
than expected after the Ethiopian claim to have killed thousands.
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation why there weren't more bodies, and when
asked, captured Eritrean troops said they had seen few of their
comrades die.
</P>
<P>
   But both nations continued to boast of inflicting major losses
on each other.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Ghebre said the next objective was Barentu, 25 miles
northwest of Shambiko and 80 miles east of the Sudanese border. He
said the town was now the command and logistics center for the
retreating Eritreans.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Taddesse's
office raised the ante in the verbal warfare, attempting to
discredit the Eritrean government as ''a rogue regime'' that lies
to the international community.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that by launching the latest attack, Ethiopian
Prime Minister Meles Zenawi appears determined to gain the upper
hand in setting conditions for peace with Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki, his former comrade-in-arms.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, Isaias was
the senior member of a rebel coalition, including Meles' Tigray
People's Liberation Front, which ousted the 17-year-old Marxist
military regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. Two years
later, the Eritreans gained independence from Ethiopia after a
30-year guerrilla war with Emperor Haile Selassie and Mengistu.
Meles became head of Ethiopia's new government formed by a
coalition of four rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 20 trucks sped south from Asmara carrying some 600
Eritrean troops toward Mendefera, the western end of the east-west
road to Barentu. People along the road thrust water and food at the
soldiers, clapping and cheering as they passed.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Ghebre, the Ethiopian officer, said his troops had pushed
as far as Areza, 19 miles west of Mendefera. The Ethiopian forces
are estimated to outnumber Eritrea's by a ratio of 15 to 1.

<HEADLINE> Reds 6, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Michael Tucker hit a sacrifice fly and stole
home on a pickoff attempt as the Cincinnati Reds beat the
Pittsburgh Pirates 6-2 Tuesday night for their eighth victory in
nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Bell (3-2) made a strong recovery from his worst major
league start, allowing one run and six hits in six innings against
the only team he's faced twice.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, called up from Double-A to be the fifth starter in spring
training, also beat the Pirates 2-1 with six strong innings April
30 in Pittsburgh. The right-hander had lasted only two innings last
Thursday against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Barry Larkin was back in the Reds' lineup for the
first time since April 21, when he tore tissue at the base of the
middle finger on his glove hand while diving for a ball.
</P>
<P>
   Although Larkin still can't make a tight fist and still has
swelling in the hand, he persuaded the Reds to activate him from
the disabled list. He went 0-for-3 with a pair of walks, stole a
base and was caught stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Taubensee had four of Cincinnati's 12 hits and the Reds
made minimal use of their scoring threats against Todd Ritchie
(2-2). Aaron Boone and Tucker had sacrifice flies, and Dmitri Young
singled home a run for a 3-0 lead after five innings.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been much worse -- Cincinnati stranded runners on
second and third in the second inning and left the bases loaded in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker pulled off the game's most daring play in the sixth, when
he walked and reached third on a sacrifice and a fly out. After
Larkin walked, Tucker took off when left-hander Scott Sauerbeck
made a pickoff throw to first.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker slid into home feet-first, beating the hurried throw from
first baseman Kevin Young.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a Red stole home since Reggie Sanders at
Shea Stadium on June 22, 1996. The last player to steal home on
Pittsburgh was the Reds' Jacob Brumfield at Cincinnati on July 10,
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Pokey Reese's two-run single in the seventh off Jeff Wallace
made it 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates once again failed to give Ritchie much help,
managing only Young's run-scoring groundout in the sixth.
Pittsburgh has scored only 16 runs while he's been on the mound in
his eight starts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Pirates called up OF Emil Brown from Triple-A Nashville
and swapped two pitchers. RHP Josias Manzanillo was called up from
Nashville and RHP Jose Parra was designated for assignment. ... Wil
Cordero, who has a career-high 12-game hitting streak, was given
permission to miss the game. Cordero had to return to Puerto Rico
on a family matter. ... The Reds went 13-9 while Larkin was out.
... Dante Bichette, who was 1-for-13 during a four-game series in
Houston, was given a day off. ... The Reds threw two more wild
pitches, raising their total to 34, most in the majors. ... The
Reds didn't take batting practice before the game. They arrived
back from a night game in Houston around 2:45 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Senior Dem OKs China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to grant permanent trade benefits
to China won what could be a crucial endorsement Tuesday, that of
Rep. Charles Rangel, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and
Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes sense for the United States to have normal trade
relations with all countries,'' the New York congressman said in
announcing his long-awaited decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel's choice was important because other wavering Democrats
on the committee, which takes up the trade bill on Wednesday, were
looking to him for guidance in the election-year-charged debate
over trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   His decision was a blow to organized labor, which has maintained
close ties with Rangel, who also is a senior member of the
Congressional Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton called Rangel's support
''an enormously important decision.''
</P>
<P>
   While a majority of House Democrats are still expected to vote
against the bill when it reaches the House floor next week, Rangel
predicted a solid majority of the 16 Democrats on the Ways and
Means Committee would support it.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill also picked up the support of Rep. Xavier
Becerra, D-Calif., also a member of the Ways and Means panel.
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bill would end annual congressional review of
China's access to U.S. markets and give it so-called normal
permanent trade relations -- the same favorable trade treatment the
United States extends to nearly every other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the legislation would ease China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based organization which
oversees global trade.
</P>
<P>
   Because of strong opposition from unions, the vote is expected
to be extremely close in the House. It has far greater support in
the Senate.

   Clinton, taking questions at the White House, told reporters
''My view is that, in the end, it will pass, not only because the
economic benefits are clear and overwhelming, but in a larger
sense, because the national security interests are so clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel is the highest-ranking Democrat to support the measure.
It is opposed both by House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of
Missouri and House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior has claimed as many as two-thirds of the 211 House
Democrats will vote ''no'' on the bill. Head counts by both sides
have shown the battle extremely close, although supporters have
recently asserted that momentum is on their side.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press survey of members updated on Tuesday showed
that 40 Democrats say they will vote for the bill, 105 say they
will oppose it, and 66 said they remain undecided. Among
Republicans, 102 say they will vote for the bill, 35 will vote
against it and 83 are undecided. Two did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   It takes 218 yes votes for a bill to pass in the 435-member
House if all members vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said he did know why labor unions ''have decided to make
this a litmus test'' in an election year when Democrats are within
striking distance of winning back control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that a key to the measure's passage would be a
favorable vote on side legislation that would set up a commission
to monitor human rights and labor conditions in China once the
trade measure is enacted.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Rangel was asked if he had gotten
anything from the White House in exchange for his support.
''They're going to give me a free plane ride to Albany so I can
endorse the president's wife (in her Senate race),'' Rangel joked.
''Big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP presidential
hopeful, said granting China permanent trade status ''will be good
for the state of Washington and good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I've been critical at times of the Clinton-Gore
administration but they're doing the right thing on this issue,''
he said. ''I urge Republicans to vote with the president on China.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- U.S. Rep. Chris Shays won
little-publicized Republican delegate primaries in three towns on
Tuesday, the first test of his party support since he voted not to
impeach President Clinton in December of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Darien, New Canaan and Bridgeport picked Shays over
challenger James Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a school teacher, is faced with the task of winning 30
of the 199 delegates, or 15 percent, to the 4th District Republican
nominating convention in July to force a September primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport has 22 delegates, Darien 12 and New Canaan 11. The
elections were winner-take-all.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial returns showed Shays winning 61 percent of the vote
in New Canaan, 59 percent of the vote in Darien and 63 percent of
the vote in Bridgeport. He won 63 percent of the overall vote.
</P>
<P>
   Shays issued a brief statement Tuesday saying he was ''thrilled
with the results.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciated the delegates who stood by me and all those who
took the time to come out and vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell characterized his showing as strong and said he would
continue to fight for a primary in September.
</P>
<P>
   ''When 40 percent of the voters in these three towns say 'we
want Jim Campbell on the ballot, we want a choice,' I hope the
delegates, uncommitted as they all are, are paying attention to all
of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Republicans, including presidential candidate George
W. Bush, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Speaker of the House
J. Dennis Hastert, wrote letters urging voters to support Shays.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Peace Conference Targeted  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana pledged on
Tuesday to block a rebel-hosted international peace conference to
protest a woman's killing by suspected guerrillas who placed an
explosive-packed collar around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're horrified, we're indignant, but most of all we're
determined to put an end to this barbarity,'' the president told a
police ceremony in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana announced he would inform Colombia's largest leftist
insurgency of his intention to ''suspend'' the group's plans to
invite foreign delegates to a rebel stronghold later this month to
discuss peaceful ways to battle drug crops.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came a day after 53-year-old dairy farmer Elvia
Cortez and a police bomb expert were killed when the collar, placed
by men demanding money, detonated while the technician worked to
defuse it.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials immediately accused the rebel Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, although Colombia's chief
prosecutor said Tuesday his investigation had just begun.
</P>
<P>
   A guerilla spokesman on Tuesday denied any FARC fighters were
even in the vicinity when the crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had nothing to do with this condemnable act,'' Commander
Ivan Rios told Radionet Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The killings outraged the Andean country and prompted calls from
some prominent Colombians for Pastrana to break off peace talks,
which are his government's top priority.
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of that Tuesday, the president pulled no
punches in blaming Cortez' death on the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   ''I demand of this movement a change of attitude and clear
actions that demonstrate to Colombians and the international
community its will to make peace,'' Pastrana said. ''The violent
ones have placed a dynamite collar not only around Elvia ... but
around the hopes of every Colombian.''
</P>
<P>
   Often accused of bending over backward to defend the guerrillas
and his negotiations with them, Pastrana has been under pressure to
take a harder line.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel attacks and kidnappings have continued despite peace talks
begun last year in a huge FARC-controlled southern enclave from
which Pastrana pulled his troops as a gesture of peace.
</P>
<P>
   European and Canadian delegates had been invited to the
demilitarized zone at the end of May to inspect projects to wean
poor peasants from planting the coca and opium crops fueling
Colombia's 36-year civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not explain how he would block the event
inside the FARC-controlled enclave.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 4, Yankees 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cal Eldred pitched six scoreless innings,
becoming the latest mediocre pitcher the shut down the struggling
Yankees, and the Chicago White Sox handed New York its fifth
straight loss, 4-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With owner George Steinbrenner on hand for the first time since
the home opener, the World Series champions couldn't break out of
their offensive funk.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner told reporters Monday that he ''was not happy with
the way some of our guys are playing.'' He clearly couldn't have
liked what he saw in person. The Yankees have fallen out of first
place in the AL East and have lost five straight for the first time
since May 11-15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The skid coincides with the absence of Derek Jeter, sidelined
since last Thursday because of a strained abdominal muscle. New
York has scored 11 runs since then and hasn't held a lead at the
end of any inning.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of baseball is taking advantage of lively balls,
weak pitching and small stadiums to put up record offensive
numbers, the Yankees haven't had an extra-base hit in three games.
New York's 166 runs ranks 28th in the majors, ahead of only Detroit
and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez (4-3) took his second straight tough-luck
loss, after losing 1-0 to Tampa Bay last Thursday. He allowed a
solo homer to Carlos Lee in the fifth inning and an RBI double to
former Yankees farmhand Chris Singleton in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred (3-2) followed the lead of Tampa Bay's Steve Trachsel and
Detroit's C.J. Nitkowski, Jeff Weaver and Dave Mlicki to shut down
the Yankees. Those pitchers had a 5-19 record before beating New
York the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred, who improved to 67-67 in his career, took a no-hitter
into the fifth inning. He allowed three hits and four walks. Bobby
Howry pitched two hitless innings, and Keith Foulke finished.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' frustrations at the plate were most evident in the
fifth inning, when four of their first five batters reached safely
but produced no runs.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer led off with a single but was erased on Scott
Brosius' double play. The Yankees then loaded the bases when Clay
Bellinger was hit by a pitch, Chuck Knoblauch singled and Ricky
Ledee walked. But Eldred got out of the jam when Paul O'Neill flied
harmlessly to left.
</P>
<P>
   Lee broke a scoreless tie with one out in the fifth inning when
he hit a high fly over the left-field fence for his eighth homer.
The White Sox added a run in the seventh when Paul Konerko led off
with a triple and scored on Singleton's ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scored twice in the ninth off Mariano Rivera on an RBI
groundout by Lee and a run-scoring single by Greg Norton.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hernandez allowed four hits and two runs in eight innings.
... The White Sox started a stretch in which they'll play the
Yankees and Cleveland in 22 of their next 38 games. ... Knoblauch
walked in the third inning, the first time he had drawn a walk
since April 18, a span of 54 plate appearances. ... The Yankees led
1-0 after the top of the second on Saturday in Detroit, before the
Tigers scored four runs in the bottom half. ... Many of the Yankees
are in a slump, including: Brosius (2-for-25), Ledee (0-for-14),
Jorge Posada (2-for-19), and Bellinger (2-for-24). ... Mark
Johnson, who entered the game 2-for-2 with two walks against
Hernandez, walked in his first two at-bats on eight pitches.
Hernandez finally retired him in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> EPA Orders Big Truck Pollution Cut  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- The Environmental Protection Agency will
require large trucks and tractor-trailer rigs to cut pollution by
more than 90 percent as well as require cleaner diesel fuel under
new regulations to be proposed this week, government and private
sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which has been debated at the White House for
months, also will require that refiners produce low-sulfur diesel
so the fuel does not interfere with pollution control devices
needed to comply with the stiffer emission standards, according to
the sources.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements represent the most stringent environmental
controls ever imposed on large tractor-trailer rigs and heavy duty
trucks that critics say are major contributors to soot and
smog-causing chemicals in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is expected to announce the proposed
regulations on Wednesday, which will be made final before the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations have been the focus of intense lobbying with the
petroleum industry, truck engine manufacturers and the trucking
industry arguing that the rules will be too costly, cause problems
with diesel supplies and may not be technically feasible in the
required time frame.
</P>
<P>
   The agency will require that the cleaner diesel contain no more
than 15 parts per million of sulfur, beginning in 2007. That's a 95
percent reduction from current sulfur levels in fuel used by large
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers will have to begin reducing the amount of soot and
smog-causing nitrogen oxide coming from new large trucks beginning
with their 2007 models, although part of the standards will be
phased in over four years, according to sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   While the regulations will apply only to new trucks and truck
engines, federal regulators and environmentalists say they hope the
new standards also will lead to existing trucks becoming cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and state air pollution regulators have argued
for years that the government should tighten pollution controls on
trucks, which they say, account for half of the soot and a quarter
of the smog-causing chemicals that come from motor vehicle
tailpipes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's big rigs are like rolling smokestacks,'' says Candace
Morey, a transportation analyst for the Union of Concerned
Scientists, an environmental advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial
Air Pollution Program Administrators, said that if the EPA requires
the new emission controls, ''it will prevent tens of thousands of
cancers and result in huge pollution reductions.''
</P>
<P>
   Diesel exhaust particulates -- or microscopic soot -- is
classified by the federal National Toxicology Program as
''reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen,'' according to
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Cancerous
tumors have been found in rats after exposure to diesel exhausts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the sources, the proposed EPA regulations would
require:
</P>
<P>
   -- Diesel exhaust particulate, or soot, be cut to 0.01 grams per
unit of engine energy, compared to 0.1 under current standards.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nitrogen oxide emission must be reduced to 0.2 grams per unit
of engine energy, compared to the current 2.5 grams. These
reductions can be phased in so not all new trucks would be required
to meet them until 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Engine manufacturers have said that such emission reductions
would require sophisticated new pollution control devices, that
need extremely clean diesel fuel to work properly.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the EPA will require that the amount of sulfur in
diesel fuel be cut to no more than 15 parts per million, from the
current 340 to 500 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sulfur levels have prompted heated debate within
the administration and vigorous lobbying by the oil industry, which
had recommended cutting sulfur levels to 50 parts per million.
Industry executives questioned whether the EPA requirement can be
met without supply disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that's excessively costly,'' said Ed Murphy of the
American Petroleum Institute, referring to the EPA proposal. ''It's
going to interfere with distillate supplies and doesn't get any
more environmental benefits over the proposal we made.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs of the clear diesel are unclear. But Murphy said that
some refiners will be unable to afford the capital improvements to
meet the proposed standard.

Privacy Commissioner Warns Of Gov't Database
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- There's a massive government database that tracks
the lives of ordinary Canadians -- a Big Brother that wasn't
supposed to exist, the federal privacy commissioner revealed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Phillips sounded an alarm in his annual report to
Parliament, warning Canadians that the Human Resources Department
database is ''tantamount to a citizen profile'' and vulnerable to
misuse.
</P>
<P>
   The ''extraordinarily detailed database'' holds a dossier on
almost every person in Canada with as many as 2,000 pieces of
information about each person's education, marital status, ethnic
origin, mobility, disabilities, income tax, employment and social
assistance history.
</P>
<P>
   The information on 33.7 million people, dead and alive, is taken
from income-tax returns, child tax benefits, immigration and
welfare files, the National Training Program, Canadian Job
Strategy, employment services, employment insurance, job records
and the social insurance master file.
Committee Recommends Phase-Out Of Cosmetic Pesticides
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Pesticides used to treat lawns, golf courses and
parks should be phased out over five years, says the
Liberal-dominated Commons environment committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The committee heard compelling testimony that pesticides pose
a threat to human health and the environment,'' says a report
released Tuesday after a year of research, including hearings with
health experts.
</P>
<P>
   Food-related pesticide use should be more tightly controlled to
protect children, Canadians should be better informed and more
pesticide research is needed, adds the report.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests new cosmetic pesticides should not be registered and
current ones should be gradually removed.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Public Health Association, Ontario College of
Family Physicians, Canadian Institute of Child Health and the
Learning Disabilities Association of Canada all said children's
behavior and learning skills are affected by pesticides, Caccia
said.
Ontario Man Wants 41-year-old Murder Conviction Set Aside
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Steven Truscott, who escaped the death penalty
but spent a decade in jail for murder, says it's time to clear his
name in a case that has haunted Canada's justice system for 41
years.
</P>
<P>
   Truscott, who has always maintained his innocence, appeared
Tuesday before the nation's television cameras to personally detail
the next phase of a campaign to have his 1959 conviction set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Truscott said the Association in Defense of the Wrongfully
Convicted will complete an ''exhaustive'' review of his case before
applying to have his conviction examined under a section of the
Criminal Code that allows reviews in cases where appeals have been
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   As a 14-year-old in 1959, Truscott was convicted of the slaying
of his 12-year-old classmate, Lynne Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Anne McLellan suggested she would wait for
Truscott's lawyers to file their formal request before deciding
what to do next.
CDC Proposes Chopping Its Local English Newscasts
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The CBC is proposing to chop its local English
suppertime newscasts, a move that has Liberal backbenchers
squirming over federal funding cuts come home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   CBC president Robert Rabinovitch confirmed Tuesday a leaked
proposal that could see up to 672 job losses at 14 local newscasts
from St. John's, Newfoundland, to Yellowknife.
</P>
<P>
   National supper-hour newscasts would have lineups weighted to
suit each region by time zone. Savings would eventually go into
beefed up national programming, including children's shows, arts
coverage, documentaries and national specials.

<HEADLINE> British Plane Has Emergency Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- The wing of a British plane carrying
48 passengers and crew touched the runway during an emergency
landing Tuesday, after the craft's landing gear apparently failed
to open, officials and passengers said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no serious injuries aboard the British Regional
Airlines turboprop as it landed at Liverpool's airport. It had
circled for nearly three hours to burn off fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''On touchdown the left-hand wing touched the runway,'' said
airline spokesman Michael Bathgate. ''There were some sparks. The
aircraft came to a stop perfectly safe.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the 44 passengers left the plane via emergency chutes.
One passenger was treated for whiplash and another for minor shock.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the aircraft's landing gear was noticed shortly
after takeoff from Manchester Airport for an 80-minute flight to
Belfast, Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Bathgate would only say that the pilot had a problem with the
left-hand undercarriage. But passenger Philip Ewing said they were
told that one of the gear's wheels wouldn't come down.
</P>
<P>
   It diverted to Liverpool Airport, 30 miles west of Manchester,
where a full emergency was declared. Fifteen ambulances awaited the
plane's landing, while four fire engines plus numerous specialist
support teams were also at the scene. Police closed roads around
the airport.

   BUFFALO, N.D. (AP) -- An explosion and fire on Tuesday rocked a
building used to make decorative smoke products, killing a man
working inside and severely burning another who tried to rescue

</P>
<P>
   The explosion at the Lightning Pyrotechnics building was

<HEADLINE> O'Hair Disappearance Trial Resumes  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The leader of atheist activist Madalyn
Murray O'Hair's organization testified Tuesday she suspected
something was ''terribly wrong'' during her last telephone contact
with the O'Hair family in 1995, before they were never heard from
again.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Johnson, president of American Atheists Inc., said
O'Hair's granddaughter, Robin Murray O'Hair, seemed very upset
during Johnson's last phone conversation with her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what she was thinking. She was totally
distraught,'' Johnson said. ''She wasn't responding. I was so
upset, something was terribly wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion when Johnson called the O'Hairs' cellular phone,
a man answered whose voice she did not recognize, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the first witness for the prosecution in the trial
of Gary Paul Karr, a 52-year-old ex-con charged with conspiring
with others to kidnap and extort money from O'Hair, her son Jon
Garth Murray and Robin Murray O'Hair. Karr could face life in
prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair is best known for starting the legal challenge that led
to the 1963 Supreme Court decision that, along with an earlier
decision, struck down organized prayer in public schools as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Hairs vanished from San Antonio with $500,000 in gold
coins purchased with money from the United Secularists of America.
At the time O'Hair was 77 and ailing, and there was some
speculation she had gone off to die somewhere where Christians
wouldn't pray over her.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the O'Hairs were robbed, kidnapped and then
killed. Federal investigators believe their bodies were dismembered
and put into 55-gallon drums and buried somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies have never been found, however, and defense attorneys
have suggested that the atheists fled to escape an investigation by
the Internal Revenue Service and that authorities haven't
diligently pursued reported sightings of them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson she came to Texas from Rockaway Township, N.J., to look
for the family after they did not attend a planned picketing of
Pope John Paul II in New York City in the fall of 1995. She noticed
that O'Hair's medicine and wheelchair were still in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't look like they had packed up to go anywhere,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe they were kidnapped from Austin by Karr,
O'Hair's former office manager, David R. Waters and another man,
Danny Fry.
</P>
<P>
   Waters is in prison on federal weapons charges and Fry was found
dead in 1995. Waters has not been charged but investigators
consider him the mastermind behind the alleged plot. His attorney
has denied it.

<HEADLINE> British, Turkish Soccer Fans Clash  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- An Arsenal fan was stabbed as British
and Turkish soccer fans clashed outside bars on a downtown square
early Wednesday, hours before the UEFA Cup final between
Galatasaray of Turkey and the English club.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people in all were injured, including a British fan who
sustained a head wound and a police officer. Four Britons and four
Turks were arrested, police said after the hour-long melee was
brought under control.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Finn Bach said the Arsenal fan ''received a
stabbing,'' that damaged a lung but said he was not ''in a
life-threatening condition.'' The fan was not identified in line
with Danish practice.
</P>
<P>
   Helmeted riot police looked on as groups of people lingered on
Raadhuspladsen, or City Hall Square, which was littered with
plastic and broken glass, while several English fans emerged from
the bars where they had been holed up and headed back to their
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting broke out at about 1 a.m., when dozens of Turkish
fans attacked a club in which English fans had been spending much
of the evening. Police move in quickly and the rioters began
running around the City Hall Square, approaching another bar.
</P>
<P>
   Many English fans responded by rushing out of the bars and
people were throwing bottles and chairs at each other and fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Galatasaray would become the first Turkish club to win one of
Europe's two major club championships.
</P>
<P>
   The game has been classified as high risk by soccer officials,
partly because of fears that British hooligans may attempt to
avenge the killing of two English fans last month on the eve of
Leeds' first-leg semifinal in Istanbul against Galatasaray.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 2,000 officers -- or 20 percent of Denmark's total
police force -- were taking part in what is the country's largest
soccer security operation ever. Galatasaray players are escorted by
unarmed members of Turkey's anti-terrorism squad.
</P>
<P>
   Danish police bodyguards also were to protect some 200 lawmakers
and a dozen government members from Turkey who were expected to
attend the match. The group, including Foreign Minister Ismail Cem,
is scheduled to arrive a few hours before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Some 24,000 tickets were sold in Turkey and Britain. Upon
arrival in Copenhagen, fans were receiving leaflets in which
authorities warned that troublemakers will be arrested and
foreigners violating Danish law face immediate expulsion from the
country.
</P>
<P>
   A Kurdish group canceled an anti-Turkey demonstration scheduled
for Wednesday after authorities said they could not gather near
Copenhagen's Parken stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb-sniffing dogs have searched the players' hotels and the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the downtown, 39,000-seat stadium, some 1.7 miles of
fence have been erected to keep British and Turkish supporters
separated before and after the match.

<HEADLINE> 1 Map Light Found in Swissair Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- One of the 11 map lights suspected
as a possible source of the fire aboard a Swissair jetliner that
crashed off Nova Scotia two years ago killing 229 people has been
found unburned, investigators said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that a problem with the map lights might have caused the
fire, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in March ordered
similar map lights on other MD-11 airplanes unplugged and inspected
as a precautionary move.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Babin of Canada's Transportation Safety Board said one
map light recovered from the copilot's side of the cockpit of
Swissair Flight 111 showed no sign of burning.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe insulation around the halogen map lights
may have helped spread the fire on the plane, which crashed on
Sept. 2, 1998, killing all aboard.
</P>
<P>
   They have recovered pieces of the plane's 10 other map lights,
but say there may be too much damage to get any information.
</P>
<P>
   In examining the map lights on other MD-11s, investigators
discovered that blanket insulation pressed against some of the
light fixtures showed signs of heat damage. The FAA subsequently
ordered changes in the flammable insulation aboard hundreds of
aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuits Upheld Against Gun Makers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A judge Tuesday refused to throw out Wayne
County's lawsuit against more than 30 gun manufacturers and
dealers, one of dozens of such suits around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Jeanne Stempien denied a motion brought by gun
manufacturers and dealers to dismiss the lawsuit, which seeks $400
million in damages for not stopping gun sales in which buyers act
as front men for felons and juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit and Wayne County filed separate lawsuits last April,
with Wayne County making the move after videotaping gun dealers
selling firearms to felons and underage buyers during sting
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gun manufacturers have said that suggesting that manufacturers
don't take steps to prevent the criminal misuse of their products
is off-base. Three cities' lawsuits have been dismissed and are
under appeal.

<HEADLINE> Captives in Sierra Leone May Be Ill  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- About 30 to 40 of the U.N. peacekeepers
held captive by Sierra Leone's rebels are suffering from illnesses
and injuries, including gunshot wounds, Liberia's president said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages are among 350 U.N. personnel who have been held for
two weeks by the rebels. They are now in the rugged jungles of
eastern Sierra Leone, near the border with Liberia, Liberian
President Charles Taylor told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on the seriousness of their ailments. The
rebels' bases are generally crude camps with little medical care
and no modern facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who helped negotiate the release of 139 hostages over
the weekend, said a helicopter was ferrying the freed U.N.
peacekeepers Tuesday from the remote border region to Liberia's
capital, Monrovia. Ninety-three had reached Monrovia as of Tuesday
night, while the rest were expected to be flown Wednesday from the
remote town of Foya, just on the Liberian side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone on Tuesday, a small contingent of U.S. military
personnel toured the airport in the capital, Freetown. They were
there to make an assessment in case the United States gets involved
in any logistical operations in the war-ravaged West African
nation. Several more military personnel were scheduled Wednesday to
perform a more in-depth assessment, the Pentagon said in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has offered to fly peacekeepers into Sierra
Leone to beef up the U.N. mission. But it has not agreed to send
any of its own personnel. If it did, their functions could range
from assisting the U.N. mission to evacuating U.S. diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-year civil war in Sierra Leone came to a halt last July
with a peace agreement between the government and the Revolutionary
United Front rebels, and U.N. peacekeepers were sent in to enforce
the accord. But the peace was shattered this month when the rebels
seized about 500 U.N. captives and fighting broke out between
rebels and government troops, throwing the U.N. operation into
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend hostage releases raised hope that the troubled peace
mission could be salvaged. The rebels have clashed with
pro-government forces in recent days, but no fighting was reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who has close ties to the rebels, said a team of
Liberian negotiators was trying to secure the release of the
remaining 350 captives, most of whom are believed to be Zambian.
The talks were taking place at a rebel base in Sierra Leone, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the wounded peacekeepers were hurt, but
Taylor said injuries might have occurred when the rebels seized and
disarmed them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is absolutely imperative that there should be a total
cessation of hostilities'' to improve the climate for the release
of the remaining hostages, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had been asked by West African leaders to mediate in the
crisis. It remained unclear who was handling the negotiations on
the rebel side: Rebel leader Foday Sankoh disappeared a week ago,
and there has been no word on his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   During their eight-year campaign against the government, Sankoh
and the rebels have killed tens of thousands of people and
mutilated and dismembered many more in a bid to gain power through
intimidation. Before he vanished, Sankoh denied that his men were
holding U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy to
Africa, was planning to visit the region this week. But on Tuesday,
Sierra Leone's state-run radio announced he was not welcome because
of recent statements he made expressing sympathy for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Later Tuesday, Jackson postponed his trip by a day, and was
scheduled to arrive in Ivory Coast on Thursday. He hoped to visit
Sierra Leone later in the week.	   The Clinton administration wants to reinstate
a 1999 agreement
that temporarily ended the fighting in Sierra Leone. But Amnesty
International USA said in a statement Tuesday that President
Clinton should acknowledge that the agreement is beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States has demonstrated a lack of engagement with
the realities of ensuring justice and peace in Sierra Leone,'' said
AIUSA executive director William F. Shulz. ''This is an opportunity
to set a new policy that protects the human rights and safety of
the citizens of Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Tuesday
said 600 refugees from western Sierra Leone have fled to
neighboring Guinea over the past three days, and aid workers are
gearing up to accommodate as many as 25,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Florio, Corzine face off in third debate of Democratic primary  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, N.J.(AP) -- U.S. Senate candidates Jim Florio and Jon
Corzine resumed their war of words here Tuesday at the third of
four scheduled debates in the Democratic primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Florio continued to take his opportunities at the
microphone to develop sharp attacks against Corzine, a former Wall
Street executive who has spent $15 million or more on TV
commercials and, more recently, to blanket the state's billboards,
buses and mailboxes with posters and mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine was firm in response. In his closing statement he gave
the clearest and most concise summary of his ideas so far. He even
threw some of the first jabs of the debate, but stumbled over some
unexpected questions.
</P>
<P>
   The debate before 500 people at the Beth Shalom synagogue here
is the only one open to the public, placing the candidates in front
of their largest audience yet, but it was not broadcast. The cable
TV news channel RNN intends to air segments of the debate at 7:30
p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates tangled over Social Security, foreign policy
toward Israel, gun control and the conduct of this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine defended his decision in the campaign to criticize
Florio's 1990 tax increases as governor. ''My opponent won't say he
is wrong about misleading voters 10 years ago about a tax increase,
or misleading them now about my record or views. If the governor
wants to pick a fight, I prefer to fight for the people of New
Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio defended his attacks on the Goldman Sachs investment
firm's activities while Corzine was a key executive there.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the only way we have to evaluate his value system, what
he did in his professional life,'' the governor added. Then during
a discussion on gun control, he criticized Corzine because the firm
provided financing to help gun manufacturers expand.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said guns should not be banned, only licensed, noting
that manufacturers are not to blame for gun crime and they provide
weapons for the police.
</P>
<P>
   Florio accused Corzine of proposing to invest Social Security
funds in the stock market instead of setting aside future tax
revenues. ''To walk away from this commitment is totally
inappropriate,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said Florio has no long-term plan to keep retirement
benefits secure. ''He doesn't have an answer. Well, it is time we
have some answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first question from the audience threw a hot-potato issue --
gay and lesbian marriage -- into the debate. Corzine said they
should be permitted. Florio said gay couples deserve legal
protection, but should not have the right to get married.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe its generational or whatever it happens to be, I just do
not think that marriage is able to be certified between two people
of the same sex,'' Florio said. ''Jon obviously disagrees with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio will rely on coverage by news reporters to get the
details of their encounter to the general public while Corzine can
continue to depend on his blitz of TV commercials on six network
affiliated TV stations in New York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has not spent money on TV commercials and has tried to
turn Corzine's heavy spending into a campaign issue, accusing his
opponent of using waves of cash to overwhelm the electoral process
and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The former chairman of Goldman Sachs, Corzine has a personal
fortune of at least $400 million and is poised to shatter national
records for Senate campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   Florio got a laugh from the crowd when he revealed the fact that
Corzine, in 1993, donated $3,600 to Florio's re-election campaign.
The Corzine staff confirmed that he had made the contribution.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Florio lashed out at Corzine for avoiding a debate
next week to be hosted by WPVI-TV, Philadelphia's ABC network
affiliate, for broadcast there and on WABC-TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four primary campaign debates, only two were to be
televised, one last week on New Jersey public television and one
scheduled Thursday on the cable news channel News 12 New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said that he had agreed to four debates and so would
agree to no others. He said network stations had been free to cover
any of the debates.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: US-British Bombing Injures 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq said Tuesday that six Iraqi civilians
were injured during raids by U.S. and British warplanes against
targets in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the Monday raids by aircraft
enforcing no-fly zones over northern and southern Iraq targeted
''service and civil installations.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aircraft weapons fired back at the warplanes, according to
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the U.S. European Command, officials
said Iraqi anti-aircraft batteries fired on allied aircraft near
Bashiqah, Tall'Afar, and Mosul, prompting them to retaliate. The
statement the aircraft returned to base safely.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq does not recognize the no-fly zones set up after the 1991
Gulf war to provide aerial protection from government forces for
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south.
</P>
<P>
   It says about 300 people have been killed and more than 800
injured since it began challenging the patrols in December 1998.
Allied forces often have responded by firing on Iraqi anti-aircraft
artillery and radar installations.

Dalai Lama Ready for Autonomy

aspects, including cultural and spiritual,'' the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
said. ''Those fields that we in Tibet can manage, we should manage.'' The 1989
Nobel Peace Prize winner was making his first stop on a swing through
Scandinavia. He was to meet Wednesday with Prime Minister Goeran Persson despite
objections by China, which controls Tibet and sees the Dalai Lama as a rallying

shutdowns. The legislation, defeated 250-166, would also have gotten the
president involved in budget negotiations earlier in the year to prevent
end-of-session deadlocks, created a rainy-day reserve fund for emergencies and
ensured that spending cuts in one area of the budget not be used to boost

needed to fight inflation. The central bank raised its target for the federal
funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, to 6.5 percent. It was
the sixth time the Fed has increased the funds rate since last June but the
first half-point move. Combined with the other five quarter-point increases, the
funds rate has now been raised 1.75 percentage points in less than a year.

<HEADLINE> Mayor: Philly Schools Might Close  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia public schools are expected to
receive a total of $900 million under the budget state lawmakers
passed Tuesday, but Mayor John F. Street said that isn't enough to
keep the district running.
</P>
<P>
   The district, which has a proposed $1.6 billion school budget,
is facing a $115 million shortfall. Street warned that the city's
256 public schools might be unable to open in the fall unless the
state comes up with an additional $64 million in funding. The
schools serve 217,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Street also said the district would be unable to make payroll
starting in July unless the budget gap is closed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But House Majority Leader John Perzel said Street would have a
hard time convincing lawmakers that the district needs more money
because the state is contributing more money to the schools than
the city is.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Reeves, a spokesman for Gov. Tom Ridge, said the state is
prepared to take over the school district if necessary, but the
governor wants to avoid doing so.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Steak Killing Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAYTON, Mo. (AP) -- A suburban St. Louis man was sentenced to
five years in prison Tuesday for shoving a piece of steak down his
girlfriend's throat until she choked to death.
</P>
<P>
   James Krebs, 42, pleaded no contest to a charge of involuntary
manslaughter in March. He was originally charged with second-degree
murder before reaching a deal with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs admitted that on June 23 he told his girlfriend her steak
was too fatty and undercooked. Jeri Troll, 44, replied that she
would eat what she wanted. In his anger, Krebs shoved a hunk of
meat into Troll's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   When paramedics arrived at the home the couple shared, they
found a piece of steak 5 inches long in Troll's throat. An autopsy
determined that she asphyxiated.

<HEADLINE> Defendant in Sweden Fire Case Sorry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- One of four young men accused of
setting Sweden's worst fire apologized in court to relatives of the
63 teen-agers killed and those who survived the 1998 blaze that
raced through a crowded dance hall.
</P>
<P>
   Meysam Mohammadyeh said he deeply regretted not calling the
police to the two-story brick building where the dance was taking
place in Goteborg, 300 miles southwest of Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an effort to sleep,'' he was quoted as saying by the
Swedish news agency TT. ''I should have extinguished the fire or
called the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammadyeh, Housein Arsani, 19, Shoresh Kaveh, 19, and Mohammad
Mohammadamini, 21 -- all Iranian-born Swedish residents -- are facing
trial for aggravated arson. All the defendants have pleaded
innocent to the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started in an emergency stairwell and spread rapidly
through the rented second-floor dance hall, killing 63 youths and
injuring more than 200. More than 400 people were jammed into a
space legally licensed for 150 when the blaze broke out just before
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which began May 3, was being held in an exhibition
center divided into three rooms to accommodate up to 600 survivors
and relatives of victims. Most of the youths attending the dance
were immigrants or children of immigrants and the trial proceedings
were translated from Swedish into 13 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Kaveh has admitted that he set fire to a chair because he felt
humiliated when the dance's teen-age organizers insisted he pay the
$5 entrance fee even though they knew each other. He said he meant
to make the organizers pay for the chair and clean up the mess, but
not to hurt anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been hard for us all. I think that we all understand
that we are very sorry for what happened,'' Kaveh said.
</P>
<P>
   The two were allowed to address the court Tuesday, a day set
aside for examining the personalities of the defendants. Arsani and
Mohammadamini declined to make a statement. Closing arguments were
scheduled for Wednesday, and a verdict was expected to take two to
four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   An aggravated arson convction would carry a sentence of six
years to life in prison, but Swedish law would allow a lesser
sentence because the suspects were under age 20 at the time of the
Oct. 29, 1998, fire.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said Mohammadyeh, who was at the party and allegedly let
the other three in through a backdoor, did not usually hang out
with the other three. He was perceived as compliant and afraid of
Kaveh, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Kaveh had been sentenced previously with robbery, theft and
assault, while Mohammadamini had been sentenced for aggravated
assault. Arsani had been sentenced for attempted manslaughter but
was on his way to getting his life together and was seeing a
psychologist before the fire occurred, TT reported.

<HEADLINE> 400th Anniversary of English Colony  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Complaints by Virginia's Indian tribes
have prompted planners of the upcoming 400th anniversary of the
founding of the Jamestown colony to drop references to
''celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   The word had been part of the event's planning committee, the
Celebration 2007 Steering Committee. But on Tuesday, the panel was
renamed the Jamestown 2007 Steering Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart W. Connock, a trustee of the Jamestown-Yorktown
Foundation that is putting together the observance, said it has
never been given an official name or theme.
</P>
<P>
   During recent anniversary talks, Indian representatives told
planners that the 1607 founding of the English settlement amounted
to an invasion and wasn't something to celebrate. Representatives
of the Virginia chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People also objected to the term.
</P>
<P>
   Roxane Gilmore, Virginia's first lady and honorary chairwoman of
the planned commemoration, promised last month that the concern
would be honored.

<HEADLINE> Indians 11, Tigers 9  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Travis Fryman had four RBIs and Charles Nagy
stayed around long enough to get his first win since April 11 as
the Cleveland Indians beat the Detroit Tigers 11-9 in a steady rain
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians won for the fourth time in five games despite some
dreadful pitching and a five-homer game by the Tigers, including
two by Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting between the teams this season was Cleveland's
first chance to get back at Detroit manager Phil Garner, who during
spring training called the Indians ''vulnerable'' and predicted a
close race in the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Those comments were tacked up on the Indians' bulletin board in
Florida, but so far this year they've been accurate as the
five-time defending division champs have struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman hit a three-run homer off Hideo Nomo (1-3) and Jim Thome
added three RBIs for Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel had two triples and Sandy Alomar hit his first
homer as the Indians improved to 31-7 against the Tigers at Jacobs
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez hit a solo homer in the first and added a two-run shot
in the eighth off Paul Shuey to bring the Tigers within 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Polonia and Gregg Jefferies hit solo homers, and Rich
Becker had a two-run homer for Detroit, which will play Cleveland
13 times in the next 42 days.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy (2-4) won for the first time in six starts, but again
pitched poorly. He allowed eight hits and five runs in five
innings, but improved his career record to 17-5 against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   It took five Indians relievers to close it out with Steve Karsay
getting four outs for his his eighth save.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman's sixth homer in the third chased Nomo and pushed the
Indians' lead to 7-2. Nomo, who struggled with his control from the
outset, walked Thome and David Justice before Fryman connected.
</P>
<P>
   But Becker, signed by the Tigers last week, hit a two-run homer
in the fourth to bring the Tigers within 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians added two runs in the fifth off Willie Blair on
Kenny Lofton's RBI groundout and Vizquel's second triple.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferies led off the sixth with his first homer off Sean
DePaula, and the Tigers cut it to 9-7 in the inning on Polonia's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   With Cleveland's bullpen struggling, Alomar provided an
insurance run in the seventh by hitting his first home run since
Sept. 23, which also came off Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Thome had an RBI single in the eighth to make it 11-9.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez followed a two-out single by Juan Encarnacion in the
eighth with his sixth homer. Shuey gave up a single to Dean Palmer
before Karsay got Becker to fly out to center.
</P>
<P>
   Thome hit a two-run double and Fryman had a run-scoring single
in the first to put the Indians up 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel's RBI triple in the second made it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Polonia, a .400 career hitter against Nagy, led off the game
with his second homer. One out later, Gonzalez hit his sixth career
homer in 52 at-bats off Nagy.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo was tagged for seven runs and six hits in three-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Fryman's .319 average against Detroit is his highest
against any AL team. He played seven seasons for the Tigers. ...
Gonzalez's 36th career two-homer game also gave him 11 homers at
Jacobs Field, the most by any opponent at the ballpark. Mark
McGwire and Frank Thomas have hit nine each there. ... It was
Vizquel's second career two-triple game. He previously did it on
May 7, 1998, at Texas. ... Detroit had not allowed an extra-base
hit in 19 innings before Vizquel's triple in the second.

<HEADLINE> Stadler Withdraws From Colonial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Craig Stadler, a 12-time winner on the
PGA Tour, withdrew Tuesday from this week's Colonial tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler also withdrew from last week's Byron Nelson Classic
because of a rib injury. He was a past champion of that event.
</P>
<P>
   His best finish at Colonial was a tie for 10th in 1992. He
missed the cut last year for only the second time in 14 Colonial
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 events this season, Stadler has won $472,462 to rank 41st
on the PGA Tour money list and pass $8 million in career earnings.
His last victory was the 1996 Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   The best finish for Stadler this season was second at the Shell
Houston Open three weeks ago when he lost in a playoff to Robert
Allenby. He has not played since that tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A field of 112, including defending champion Olin Brown, is
expected to tee off Thursday for the first round at Colonial
Country Club.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Star Transferred to Galaxy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Major League Soccer completed the deal
Tuesday to bring high-scoring Mexican forward Luis Hernandez to the
Los Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Tim Leiweke called Hernandez ''one of the most
important and best ever'' players to join the 5-year-old league.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez signed a multiyear contract with MLS. Terms of the
contract and amount of the transfer fee paid to Tigres, Hernandez's
Mexican First Division team, were not disclosed under league
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very excited to be joining the Galaxy to play in Major
League Soccer,'' Hernandez told league officials in a telephone
call from Monterrey, Mexico. ''It's been a dream of mine to make it
big in the United States. The time is right for me to move on and
experience soccer outside of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is scheduled to join the Galaxy on Friday. If he
passes a physical, he is expected to make his MLS debut Saturday
night when the Galaxy play host to defending champion D.C. United
at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a personal challenge for me to be successful in Major
League Soccer,'' Hernandez said. ''I'm happy to be going to a city
I am very familiar with. I love Los Angeles and look forward to
scoring many goals for the great fans of Southern California.''
</P>
<P>
   Under MLS' single-entity structure, all players sign contracts
with the league. Players of Hernandez's stature are then assigned
to teams.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Galaxy were not due to be allocated a player, they
agreed to make midfielder Clint Mathis and defender Joe Franchino
available to all 11 other MLS teams for a special draft.
</P>
<P>
   The New York/New Jersey MetroStars had the first choice in the
draft based on it having the fewest points in the league over the
past 32 matches and selected Mathis. The New England Revolution
then chose Franchino.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy will also have to relinquish one of their four other
foreign players to stay under MLS' salary cap and foreign-player
limitations. Costa Rican midfielder Roy Myers is expected to be
that player, likely returning to the MetroStars, which traded him
to the Galaxy last season.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Hernandez was Mexico's player of the year in
1997 and 1998. He spent the last four seasons with the
Monterrey-based Tigres, scoring 38 goals in 64 matches. His 13
goals during the recently completed 2000 summer season were the
second-highest figure in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's 35 goals for Mexico's national team ties former
Galaxy forward Carlos Hermosillo for the team record.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a unique player whose on-field ability and dynamic
personality are matched by few players throughout the world,'' said
MLS executive vice president Ivan Gazidis who negotiated with
Hernandez's representatives and Tigres officials for more than a
month.

<HEADLINE> Braves 9, Giants 7  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Brian Jordan homered twice in a game for the
second time in less than a week and Terry Mulholland got the the
final out as the Atlanta Braves held on for a 9-7 victory over the
San Francisco Giants on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan nearly had his third homer in the eighth inning, but a
380-foot drive was caught at the base of the wall for a sacrifice
fly and his third RBI of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones also homered and drove in two runs for the Braves,
Andres Galarraga had three RBIs and Tom Glavine picked up his sixth
win despite lasting only 5 1-3 innings in his shortest start this
season.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker entered in the ninth with a four-run lead but
couldn't get the final out. He gave up two hits and walked two,
leaving after a walk to pinch-hitter Ramon Martinez with the bases
loaded forced in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McGlinchy walked Rich Aurilia to bring in another run
before Mulholland, who started four days earlier, retired Armando
Rios on a grounder to second for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves used seven pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who has been bothered by muscle strains in both sides,
hit solo shots in the second and fifth innings, giving him six
homers for the season after a slow start. He also hit two homers in
an 8-7 victory Friday at Philadelphia to begin Atlanta's four-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won't have Barry Bonds for the three-game series at
Turner Field. He returned to San Francisco with an ailing back
after being injured at Colorado over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Even without their most feared hitter, the Giants rallied from a
6-2 deficit in the sixth when Aurilia, Armando Rios and Doug
Mirabelli had consecutive RBI singles, pushing the potential tying
run to third with only one out.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Remlinger, who replaced Glavine after Aurilia's hit,
struck out pinch-hitter Russ Davis. Calvin Murray walked to load
the bases before Remlinger retired J.T. Snow on a weak popup to
Jones just behind third base.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom half, Jones sent a 3-0 pitch over the 400-foot
sign in center for his ninth homer, restoring the Braves to a
two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (6-1) had gone at least six innings in every start until
the Giants roughed him up for nine hits and five runs. He
continually worked deep into the count, having thrown 104 pitches
when manager Bobby Cox finally made a change.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, which lost its fourth straight, went ahead in the
first on Jeff Kent's two-out, run-scoring single. Jordan tied it up
in the second with his first homer against Russ Ortiz (2-5) and the
Braves went back in front on Galarraga's two-run single in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants pulled to 3-2 when Kent scored while the Braves were
turning a double play in the fourth, but rookie Rafael Furcal
produced a run with pure speed in the bottom of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   First, the 19-year-old reached first by beating out an infield
hit, moving to second when first baseman Snow threw the ball away.
Furcal moved to third on a Glavine's sacrifice, then got caught in
a rundown on a sharp rounder to shortstop. But Mirabelli, the
catcher, threw the ball away again while Furcal scrambled back
toward third.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga brought home another run in the eighth with a double
against reliever Mark Gardner, went to third on the throw home and
scored on Jordan's long fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz went five innings, surrendering 10 hits and five earned
runs for his third straight loss.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Braves are 19-5 with Jordan in the lineup, 7-7 when he
sits out. ... Jordan has eight two-homer games in his career. ...
Davis is 0-for-9 at pinch-hitter. ... Mirabelli had the first
stolen base of his career. ... Mueller extended his hitting streak
to 12 games. ... Mulholland has five saves in his career.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With thousands of supporters cheering in a
packed sports arena, Hillary Rodham Clinton was nominated for the
U.S. Senate on Tuesday in her adopted state by the New York
Democratic Party's state convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pledge to you that I will work my heart out every single day
of this campaign to become your senator,'' the first lady said as
she accepted the convention's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination by the 352 delegates of the only first lady to
run for public office was unanimous. As she came to the podium, she
raised her arms triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make no mistake, this election is not about me or my
Republican opponent,'' Clinton said in an address that went on for
38 minutes and ended with the triumphant theme from the ''Chariots
of Fire'' movie. ''It's about the people of New York and our common
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said the mission was to improve the lives of New
York's families and children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are producing countless new fortunes, yet we have the
second highest rate of poverty in the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still uncertain was whether Clinton would face Republican
Rudolph Giuliani, the New York City mayor whose candidacy was
expected to make the Senate race a clash of political titans. Three
weeks ago, the mayor announced he had prostate cancer and said he
was uncertain if he could continue in the race. As of Tuesday, New
Yorkers were still waiting to hear the mayor's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking hands with supporters, signing autographs and posing for
photographs with admirers at the arena in downtown Albany even
before the convention began, the first lady predicted she would be
''victorious in November'' and told reporters that ''I see the
attention as a wonderful indication of how everybody's going to
pull together.''
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute addition to the festivities, President Clinton
changed his schedule Tuesday in order to join the crowd of about
10,000 people at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just decided I ought to be there,'' Clinton said before
leaving Washington. ''It's a big deal for her, a big night for her
and I want to be there with her. I just want to be there to support
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not address the convention, but at a later
reception at a local hotel hosted by top New York Democrats, he
told supporters he was ''profoundly grateful for the way you have
embraced her ... She will not disappoint you.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady lavished praise on her husband during her
convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not be here tonight were it not for Bill and were it
not for all he has done for me,'' she said. ''I could not be
prouder, as an American and as a New Yorker, to have a president
who has meant so much to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribute that had the thousands in the arena on their feet
and cheering. He mouthed a silent ''thank you'' to his wife as he
bowed his head.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Giuliani stunned New York with the announcement
that he had been diagnosed with cancer and might have to quit the
race. Things turned even more topsy-turvy when the married mayor
subsequently confirmed he was seeing ''a very good friend,'' Judith
Nathan, and then announced he and his wife of 16 years, Donna
Hanover, were discussing a formal separation.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, on Monday night, Giuliani told supporters at a
Manhattan fund raiser that he was ''very much inclined'' to stay in
the race, but still had to determine his course of medical
treatment before he could decide on the Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried to keep the focus on their convention and on the
first lady. There was no mention of Giuliani in the speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who is considering a run
for New York governor in 2002, said after speaking to the
convention that it was right to avoid attacks on the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about the Republicans, it's about us,'' Cuomo
said. ''I also think it's right on a personal level. Mr. Giuliani
is going through a very difficult personal period.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates didn't seem to care, cheering lustily for speaker
after speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of excitement we haven't seen since Bobby
Kennedy,'' state Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said on the eve
of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking the Senate seat from New York once held by
Kennedy and later by the man she hopes to replace in the Senate,
fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan is retiring at
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hope said Tuesday that she felt sympathy for her Republican
Party counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sure am glad I'm not Bill Powers today,'' she told Albany's
WROW-AM radio. ''The best thing we've got going for us at this
convention is a simple thing -- we've got a candidate ... It's like
they've got a big party and everybody's dressed up and no date for
the prom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican state convention in Buffalo is just two weeks
away.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's camp was jubilant Tuesday over a statewide poll from
the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute showing that despite
Giuliani's medical and marital problems, he remains deadlocked with
Clinton among New York voters. She was favored by 44 percent to 43
percent for the mayor. That is statistically unchanged from a May 1
Quinnipiac poll.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the
mayor was ''grateful and heartened'' by the poll results.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a reaffirmation of the strength of the mayor's
candidacy and evidence that performance and record are what New
Yorkers care about,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has faced charges from Giuliani of being a
carpetbagger -- she only moved to New York in January -- and not
having a record in elective office, Republicans face a New York
electorate in which Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost
5-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Since kicking off her Senate campaigning last July at Moynihan's
farm near Oneonta, Clinton has visited all 62 New York counties.
She formally announced her candidacy in February in a state
university gymnasium not far from her new $1.4 million home in
suburban Westchester County just north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   More a coronation than a convention, Tuesday's gathering in
Albany was a far cry from recent state party conventions at which
Democrats often nominated multiple Senate candidates who then had
to face off in a September primary.
</P>
<P>
   Several little-known New York Democrats have expressed an
interest in this year's nomination, but to force a Sept. 12 primary
they would have to go through the arduous process of collecting the
signatures of 15,000 New York Democrats between June 6 and July 13.

   TORONTO (AP) -- Raul Mondesi tied the game with a two-run double
in the ninth inning and scored on Tony Batista's single as the
Toronto Blue Jays beat the Red Sox 7-6 Tuesday night, stopping
Boston's six-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   With Boston leading 6-4, Shannon Stewart singled off Derek Lowe
(2-1) leading off the ninth, Jose Cruz doubled and Mondesi tied it
with a double off the wall in left-center field, just missing a
home run.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado was intentionally walked, Brad Fullmer struck out
and Mondesi stole third. Batista then singled off the glove of
second baseman Jose Offerman, capping Toronto's comeback from a 4-0
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who went 2-for-5, came to the plate with the bases
loaded twice, but popped out and hit into a forceout.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Munro (1-2) pitched the top of the ninth for his first
major league win, allowing one hit and striking out one.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which has moved into first place in the AL East, one
game ahead of the New York Yankees, has outscored opponents 38-10
since Nomar Garciaparra and Carl Everett were injured last Friday.

   With the score 4-all, Lewis doubled off Paul Quantrill leading
off the seventh and scored with a head-first dive on Trot Nixon's
single. Pinch-hitter Brian Daubach added a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hatteberg's two-run double put Boston ahead in the second,
and the Red Sox made it 4-0 on Lewis' RBI double in the third and
Hatteberg's run-scoring groundout in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Boston starter Tim Wakefield allowed just two hits until Darrin
Fletcher homered with one out in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto tied it in the sixth on RBI singles by Tony Batista and
Homer Bush, and a passed ball by Hatteberg with a runner on third.
Before Hatteberg's error, shortstop Manny Alexander saved a run by
keeping Bush's single in the infield.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Pedro Martinez toyed with fans by throwing a ball on to the
top of the dugout and then pulling it back with a string. Two fans
did a belly flop trying to get it. ... Donnie Sadler, who played
shortstop on Monday, was the left fielder Tuesday. Sadler made a
nice running grab at the wall in the fourth inning. ... The Red Sox
were playing their sixth game without Garciaparra (on the 15-day
disabled list with a strained left hamstring) and fifth without
Everett (day to day with a strained right quadriceps). ... The Blue
Jays sent struggling RHP Roy Halladay to Triple-A Syracuse and
recalled Munro. Halladay was 2-4 with an 11.97 ERA in eight games,
including seven starts.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Nominate Clinton for Sen.  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With thousands of supporters cheering in a
packed sports arena, Hillary Rodham Clinton was nominated for the
Senate on Tuesday at the Democratic Party convention in her adopted
state.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination by the 352 delegates of the only first lady to
run for public office was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make no mistake, this election is not about me or my
Republican opponent,'' Clinton said in a 38-minute address that
ended with the triumphant theme from the movie ''Chariots of
Fire.'' ''It's about the people of New York and our common
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said the mission was to improve the lives of New
York's families and children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are producing countless new fortunes, yet we have the
second-highest rate of poverty in the country and the biggest gap
between the rich and the poor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still uncertain was whether Clinton would face Republican
Rudolph Giuliani, the New York City mayor whose candidacy was
expected to make the Senate race a clash of political titans. Three
weeks ago, the mayor announced he had prostate cancer and said he
was uncertain if he could continue in the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican state convention in Buffalo is on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking hands with supporters, signing autographs and posing for
photographs with admirers at the arena in downtown Albany before
the convention began, the first lady told reporters that ''I see
the attention as a wonderful indication of how everybody's going to
pull together.''
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute addition to the festivities, President Clinton
changed his schedule Tuesday in order to join the crowd of about
10,000 at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just decided I ought to be there,'' Clinton said before
leaving Washington. ''It's a big deal for her, a big night for her
and I want to be there with her. I just want to be there to support
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not address the convention, but at a reception
afterward hosted by top New York Democrats, he told supporters he
was ''profoundly grateful for the way you have embraced her ... She
will not disappoint you.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady lavished praise on her husband during her
convention speech, a tribute that had the thousands in the arena on
their feet and cheering. He mouthed a silent ''thank you'' to his
wife as he bowed his head.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Giuliani stunned New York with the announcement
that he had been diagnosed with cancer and might have to quit the
race. Things turned even more topsy-turvy when the married mayor
subsequently confirmed he was seeing ''a very good friend,'' Judith
Nathan, and then announced he and his wife of 16 years, Donna
Hanover, were discussing a formal separation.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani told supporters at a fund-raiser Monday night that he
was ''very much inclined'' to stay in the race, but still had to
determine his course of medical treatment before he could decide on
the Senate contest.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried to keep the focus on their convention and on the
first lady. There was no mention of Giuliani in the speeches.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates didn't seem to care, cheering lustily for speaker
after speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the kind of excitement we haven't seen since Bobby
Kennedy,'' state Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said on the eve
of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is seeking the Senate seat from New York once held by
Kennedy and later by the man she hopes to replace in the Senate,
fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan is retiring after
24 years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Several little-known New York Democrats have expressed an
interest in this year's nomination, but to force a Sept. 12 primary
they would have to collect the signatures of 15,000 New York
Democrats between June 6 and July 13.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's camp was jubilant Tuesday over a poll from the
Quinnipiac College Polling Institute showing that despite
Giuliani's medical and marital problems, he remains deadlocked with
Clinton among New York voters. She was favored by 44 percent to 43
percent for the mayor. That is statistically unchanged from a May 1
Quinnipiac poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a reaffirmation of the strength of the mayor's
candidacy and evidence that performance and record are what New
Yorkers care about,'' Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover
Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has faced charges from Giuliani of being a
carpetbagger -- she only moved to New York in January -- and not
having a record in elective office, Democrats outnumber Republicans
in New York by an almost 5-3 margin.

<HEADLINE> Padres 7, Marlins 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Sterling Hitchcock is ready to have fun again.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock (1-5) allowed three runs on seven hits in seven
innings for his first win in nine starts this season as the San
Diego Padres defeated the Florida Marlins 7-3 Tuesday in front of a
franchise-low 7,101.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is wins and losses,'' said Hitchcock, who
struck out four and walked none. ''When you're not winning, it's
not fun. Tonight was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin was 3-for-4, including two homers and five RBIs, for
the Padres who won their second in a row after an eight-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's (Hitchcock) our ace,'' said Nevin, who matched his career
high with five RBIs. ''We haven't given him much run-support when
he's pitched well. We didn't go out there saying, 'Hey, let's win
one for Sterling,' but it's nice to get him back on his game.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Tony Gwynn, sidelined since April 29 because of an
injured left knee, was 2-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez (4-2) allowed four runs on five hits, struck out
eight and walked two in seven innings for the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sanchez did a good job pitching,'' Marlins catcher Mike
Redmond said. ''That was his (Nevin) win. He single-handedly beat
us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Damian Jackson's single in the sixth, Nevin connected for
his second multihomer game of the season and fourth of his career
to give the Padres a 4-3 lead in the sixth. Four of Nevin's 10
homers this season have come against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins manager John Boles was disappointed in the poor turnout,
particularly after winning four of their last five against the Mets
and Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, it was kind of like an instructional league
atmosphere,'' Boles said. ''What are you going to do? It's a major
league game and unfortunately it's a major league game we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevin added an RBI single in the eighth. Joe Strong came on to
pitch for Florida and gave up a two-run single to Carlos Hernandez
to give San Diego a 7-3 cushion. All three runs in the inning were
unearned because of Luis Castillo's error at second base to start
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-out walk to Jackson in the first inning, Nevin hit
an opposite-field home run to give the Padres a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins countered with a run in their half, when Preston
Wilson's smash was deflected by Hitchcock for an infield single.
Hitchcock threw home, but too late to get Castillo, who had led off
the inning with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson hit his fifth homer in six games, ninth overall, and
drove in all three Marlins runs. His two-run shot in the fourth
gave the Marlins a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Padres are 1-15 in games started by Hitchcock (1-8),
Woody Williams (0-3), Brian Boehringer (0-3) and Stan Spencer
(0-1). ... After not attempting a steal in their last five games,
Bret Boone stole second in the second inning. But a few pitches
later, Boone was picked off by Sanchez, who leads the NL with four
pickoffs. ... The Padres are 4-9 against left-handers, including
two in the last two games. They beat Arizona's Omar Daal on Sunday.
... After a long run, Gwynn made a sliding catch of Castillo's fly
ball to right field. However, it never hit his glove. The ball
caromed off his chest and, with his glove on the ground, Gwynn
snared it with his bare hands. ... The Marlins received good news
before the game when RHP Alex Fernandez said his tender elbow,
which caused him to miss his last start, felt good after a brief
catch. He'll start Thursday against the Padres. ... Marlins
reliever Dan Miceli should be OK in a few more days after
experiencing a sore forearm. RHP A.J. Burnett, out all season with
a ruptured ligament of his right thumb is way ahead of schedule and
will begin throwing next week. Boles hopes to have him back by July
1.

<HEADLINE> Devils Blame Loss on Letdown  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils haven't lost any
confidence despite letting the Philadelphia Flyers back into their
series.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, in a rare defensive lapse, wasted a two-goal lead in
less than three minutes as the Flyers rallied for a 4-3 victory to
even the Eastern Conference finals Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils return home for Game 3 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost that game in three minutes. That's the bottom line,''
New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur said. ''We lost the game in a
three-minute span. After that, we outplayed them badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Tocchet keyed the three-goal outburst in 2:37 that bridged
the end of the second period and start of the third.
</P>
<P>
   He set up Eric Desjardins' goal with 38.8 seconds left in the
second, cutting the deficit to 3-2. Tocchet scored 1:06 into the
third to tie it at 3, then 52 seconds later crashed the net,
pushing defenseman Colin White into the puck as it bounced off his
back for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Daymond Langkow was credited with the goal after 643 hats were
thrown on the ice, prematurely celebrating Tocchet's would-be hat
trick.
</P>
<P>
   ''For about a five-minute segment, we lost our composure,'' New
Jersey coach Larry Robinson said. ''We played Flyers hockey,
instead of Devils hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Devils forward Scott Gomez said the team got a bit complacent
after taking a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a little lapse, and they're a good team. They took
advantage,'' he said. ''We let down. We took things for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers scored more than two goals on Brodeur just once in
six games this season. They scored a total of seven in the last
five games against him -- all losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We let Marty out to dry,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the series began, New Jersey hoped to gain a split on the
road. After winning Game 1, the Devils set their sights higher.
They left Philadelphia disappointed they missed an opportunity to
take control of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't dwell on this,'' Gomez said. ''We still got the home
ice. Now it's a series.''
</P>
<P>
   Devils forward Patrik Elias hopes the team learned it must stay
focused the entire game to beat Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't disciplined,'' he said. ''It doesn't matter how
much of a lead you have, you have to play disciplined for 60
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss came with a price for New Jersey. Forward John Madden
left the game with a right knee injury after colliding with Keith
Primeau with just over three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Madden is scheduled to have an MRI on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't feel good,'' Madden said.

<HEADLINE> Devils' Madden Hurts Right Knee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- New Jersey rookie center John Madden and
Philadelphia center Daymond Langkow were both hurt in the Flyers'
4-3 win over the Devils in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Langkow was knocked woozy and sustained a facial cut that
required stitches after being checked by defenseman Scott Stevens
with about 17 minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Langkow, who scored the game-winner about a minute earlier when
his shot went in off Devils defenseman Colin White, was almost out
on his feet on the ice. He had to be helped to the bench. He did
not return to the game and was not available after for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Madden hurt his right knee after being checked by Keith Primeau
and falling awkwardly to the ice. He had to be helped off the ice
and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know,'' Madden said when asked about the severity of
his injury. ''I'll have to wait for an MRI tomorrow, but it doesn't
feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 of the best-of-seven series is Thursday at the
Continental Airlines Arena.
