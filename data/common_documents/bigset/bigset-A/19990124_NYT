HALAS' NIGHTMARE BECOMES REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As 88-year-old owner  &UR; George Halas was lying on his death bed in
1983, he supposedly had one request about the direction of the
Chicago Bears franchise.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't care which of his 11 grandchildren ran the team as
long as it was ``anyone but Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   Halas' oldest grandchild, team President  &UR; Michael McCaskey, has
made a mess of one of the NFL's most storied teams.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis never showed up at
a Friday news conference to announce his hiring and bolted Saturday
to return to the Valley and resume his position with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis left Chicago a cult hero because he told McCaskey to
take his head-coaching job and shove it.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has ever stood up to the man known as the ``Miser of the
Midway'' and looked better.
</P>
<P>
   How many ways did McCaskey mess up the hire?
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis heard that he had accepted a job he hadn't taken from a
candidate for an assistant coaching position on the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Congratulations,' '' McGinnis said of former
Bears defensive back  &UR; Leslie Frazier. ``I said, `For what?' He
said, `You're the Bears' new head coach. They've issued a press
release.' I told him I hadn't accepted any job.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis' family members found out he supposedly was the Bears'
new head coach on the radio and TV. ``I didn't even get to tell my
mother,'' said McGinnis, who also was upset that he didn't get a
chance to inform Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin and team owner  &UR; Bill
 &UR; Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   He shows up at the Bears' office in Lake Forest, Ill., and is
informed the team has called a noon (Arizona time) news conference
to introduce McGinnis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I wasn't going to any news conference,'' he said.
``We didn't have a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears low-balled him on the salaries he was going to be able
to pay assistant coaches and offered to guarantee his four-year
contract for only two years, unheard of for an NFL head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They underestimated me,'' McGinnis. ``They must have thought I
wanted the job so badly, I'd take anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in Palm Springs, Calif., McGinnis' old boss,  &UR; Mike
Ditka, was smiling.  &UR; Dave Wannstedt, fired as Bears coach last
month, also reportedly got a good laugh in Miami, where he is
assistant head coach of the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are they going to attract free agents?'' asked one NFL
executive. ``Who's going to want to play there?'' &QL; 
Trestman fan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former 49ers Coach  &UR; Bill Walsh, the new general manager of the
team, said he enjoyed the one season (1996) working with  &UR; Marc
Trestman, who was the team's offensive coordinator at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Trestman was fired after one season by 49ers owner  &UR; Eddie
DeBartolo and then went to Detroit as quarterback coach where Tobin
hired him as offensive coordinator a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went as expected,'' Walsh said. ``It was to be one
year, and it was one year. Marc Trestman and I got along famously.
He's a terrific guy, and he's doing well in Phoenix. He's very
intellectual, a smart man.'' &QL; 
In demand &QL; 
Brigham Young's  &UR; John Tait, out of Tempe McClintock High School, is
considered the top offensive tackle in this year's draft, according
to &UR; Joel Buchsbaum, ``Pro Football Weekl''y's draft expert.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chris McCalister of Arizona is the second-highest-rated
cornerback behind Georgia's  &UR; Champ Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Grey Rugamer of Arizona State is the second-ranked center
behind Boston College's  &UR; Damien Woody.
</P>
<P>
   At fullback, Arizona State's  &UR; Jeff Paulk is rated fifth and UA's
 &UR; Kelvin Eafon is rated seventh.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yusaf Scott of the Wildcats is the ninth-best offensive guard,
rated five spots ahead of teammate  &UR; Edwin Mulitalo.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's  &UR; Lenzie Jackson and  &UR; Kenny Mitchell are rated 21st and
28th, respectively, at wide receiver. &QL; 
NFL nerd &QL; 
New Baltimore Ravens Coach  &UR; Brian Billick knows he's a computer
geek.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the game planning is via a slide presentation with Power
Point that every businessman in America uses with his
presentations, because anything with color, movement and action
heightens the learning curve,'' said Billick, formerly offensive
coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think you can stand up in front of those guys with the
old chalkboard or a black overlay, you can forget it. This is the
MTV generation.'' &QL; 
Shortshots &QL; 
Denver's  &UR; John Elway (38) and Atlanta's  &UR; Chris Chandler (33) are
the oldest starting quarterback combination in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl XXXIII will be the Falcons' first game on grass in 10
games.
</P>
<P>
   Former ASU assistant  &UR; Mike Martz is expected to be named
offensive coordinator of the St. Louis Rams. He currently is their
quarterbacks coach.
</P>
<P>
   New Cleveland Coach  &UR; Chris Palmer, who was an assistant in 1996
with former Browns Coach  &UR; Bill Belichick at New England, went out
of his way to make Browns fans realize he has a much different
personality than Belichick, who is hated in Cleveland for dumping
quarterback  &UR; Bernie Kosar. ``I came through the Bill Parcells
school,'' said Palmer, formerly offensive coordinator at
Jacksonville. ``My personality is different. I hope you can see
that. Bill Belichick was his guy. I'm my guy.'' &QL;

AMERICA WEST'S WOES: LACK OF NICHE, PRESTIGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With new planes on order, big expansion plans and a sparkling
headquarters building going up in downtown Tempe, America West
Airlines doesn't seem like a company with a giant ``For Sale'' sign
on the door.
</P>
<P>
   But the carrier found itself in the center of merger mania last
week, with United Airlines publicly expressing interest in a buyout
and other big airlines saying they might take a look.
</P>
<P>
   America West isn't talking, but apparently hasn't resisted the
overtures.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Bill Franke said earlier this month that he'd love to
talk to United and Delta ``about deals that involved some kind of
venture that expands both our service and theirs.'' Still, he said
last week that America West didn't invite or solicit the attention.
</P>
<P>
   So what's drawing the airline to the negotiating table, other
than a responsibility to shareholders to entertain any offer?
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point to a seat-back pocket full of reasons: money,
prestige and problems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AIRLINE INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND ECONOMICS &QL; 
America West has long been an airline without a clearly defined
place in the airline universe. Yes, it's huge in Phoenix and Las
Vegas and a big boon for travelers there, but as the nation's
ninth-largest carrier, it's not a name player on the national
scene.
</P>
<P>
   It's routinely left off lists of the major airlines and is often
mistakenly referred to as American West. This makes it tough to
compete for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it. The big 10 is really only seven or maybe six,''
said Ray Neidl, airline analyst with ING Barings, an New York
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   While they are the two fastest-growing cities in America, the
Phoenix and Las Vegas hubs of America West also are viewed
primarily as vacation spots. That means lots of cheap tickets.
Airlines make their money on business travelers and the expensive,
last-minute tickets they buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to increase its share of business travelers,'' Steve
Lewins, airline analyst with Gruntal &AMP; Co., another New York
investment bank, said of America West.
</P>
<P>
   America West has been aggressively courting business travelers _
adding more flights to big cities and more first class service _
with success, but that part of the business accounts for just a
fraction of the airline's $2 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the efforts come as business travel is slowing
down nationwide. For the first time since 1995, sales from business
tickets showed a year-to-year decline in December, according to a
report last week by Samuel Buttrick, an analyst with the investment
bank and stock brokerage PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only hope that the new year brings in new reinvigorated
business travelers with replenished travel budgets,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Given the slowdown, America West and its major investors might
want to get out before a recession hits. America West admits how
vulnerable it is in its SEC filings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, `Is it (America West) going to be worth more
a year from now than it is now?' If the industry looks a little
soft this year, then it may not be worth more and maybe it's the
time to sell,'' analyst Neidl said. ``It's a question of one bird
in the hand or two birds in the bush.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONEY
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The chief men behind America West, namely Franke and its
controlling investor, Texas financier David Bonderman, are number
crunchers, not up-through-the-ranks veterans with airlines in their
blood. Both got into America West _ Franke as chairman, Bonderman
as lead investor _ to, ultimately, make money.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs like America West founders Ed Beauvais and Mike
Conway, gone from America West since its bankruptcy days in the
early 1990s, would have had much more interest in an independent
America West.
</P>
<P>
   Bonderman, whose investment company is Texas Pacific Group,
generally buys into troubled companies and gets out when they're
fixed. He recently sold his Continental Airlines stake to Northwest
as part of a major marketing pact between those two carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Bonderman has already cashed out some of his stake in America
West. In May, he sold 1.95 million shares of America West stock for
$56 million. He didn't waste any time. It was the earliest he could
sell the shares without giving up his nearly 1 million shares with
super voting power.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in those types of funds invest for a turnaround, and
the company (America West) has turned around,'' Neidl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may want to cash out,'' Lewin adds.
</P>
<P>
   In Franke's case, a sale of America West would be the perfect
exit strategy. He joined the airline in 1992 and has stayed much
longer than originally expected. A buyout at $30 a share _ the high
end of analysts' estimates _ would give him more than $30 million.
Just three months ago, America West's stock was at $10.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed Friday at around $22.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Boyd, an airline consultant in Evergreen, Colo., doesn't
have a problem with this retirement rationale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I owned an airline, the first thing I'd be looking at doing
is selling,'' he said. ``That's a nightmarish job.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SELLING IS EASIER THAN FIXING
</P>
<P>
   This is the cynics' view, of course. While America West recently
reported record earnings for 1998, it's not operating at full
throttle.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings boost came largely from sharply lower fuel prices
and travel agent commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was marked by more bad news than good. America West's
labor woes continued, with its 2,100 flight attendants threatening
to strike if a contract agreement isn't reached soon, and ramp
workers voting in a union.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, a contract was reached with the mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   The airline struggled with maintenance problems and was hit with
a $5 million fine by the Federal Aviation Administration, half of
which will be forgiven if it complies with a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   It canceled a lot of flights over the summer _ many of which it
blamed on mechanics' union tactics _ and is still struggling with
its on-time performance.
</P>
<P>
   In November, it ranked next to last among the major airlines,
with a 73.3 percent on-time record. Much of it was eerily
reminiscent of operating problems in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The problems didn't go unnoticed on Wall Street. The stock
lagged the industry last year and, in fact, has badly trailed most
of the other airlines since it emerged from bankruptcy in August
1994. This despite an unprecedented boom in the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part it never got out of its own way,'' one rival
airline executive said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, if America West is sold, the sale might have been
ordained by the kinds of people running the airline, what they did
and didn't do, and what they decided they didn't want to do. &QL;

DEVILS BOUNCE BACK BIG  
 HOUSE RULES DUCKS, GUARD SCORES 34 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ One of the Oregon coaches, who was in a position
to know these things, knew his team was in trouble the moment
Arizona State walked into McArthur Court on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in extremely focused, they came in to get a job done
and they came in to be on their `A' game,'' said Ducks assistant
Don Newman, who was ASU interim coach last season and thereby has a
special window into the Sun Devils' collective soul. ``And they
were. I could sense it from the time they said hello.''
</P>
<P>
   And then it was good-bye, Oregon. Despite all warnings, there
was little Newman nor any of the Ducks could do about guard Eddie
House. Between hugging Newman before and after the game, like many
of his teammates, House squeezed the life out of the Ducks with 34
points as the Sun Devils won, 64-60.
</P>
<P>
   House made 13 of 22 shots, including 5 of 11 from three-point
range, as the Sun Devils turned around Thursday's 30-point loss to
Oregon State. It was House's fourth game of 30 points or more, all
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie was screaming, he was hollering on the floor, he was in
a zone,'' Newman said. ``That's his form of getting himself
motivated. (Oregon Coach) Ernie (Kent) said it best in the locker
room. He's an assassin, and he plays that way.''
</P>
<P>
   House confessed that against Oregon State he was still feeling
the effects of last week's auto accident in which he banged up a
knee and some ribs, and generally felt stiff and sore. He
downplayed it at the time because ``I didn't want to make any
excuses,'' he said. ``I was a lot more loose today.''
</P>
<P>
   House saw a lot of time at point guard because of the absence of
Alton Mason, who was attending his father's funeral. He added three
assists and four steals, and during a stretch of the first half
when ASU was opening up a 12-point lead (that would crumble to one
by halftime), House made 7 of 8 shots and scored 16 of 18 Sun
Devils points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't get after it on Thursday,'' he said. ``Today,
I pressured some people, got some steals and got us going. Once I
start rolling on defense, that's when the offense comes pretty
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8,874 at Mac Court must have felt like the Bill Murray
character in ``Groundhog Day,'' whose day keeps repeating. This was
the Ducks' fourth straight home loss, by the combined total of nine
points. And, House's damage came two days after guard Jason Terry
rained 37 points on Oregon in an 85-83 Arizona victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two great players that are probably going to the next level,''
Oregon guard Darius Wright said. ``I just didn't do my job on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing without swingman Derrick Davis (academic difficulties)
in addition to Mason, ASU Coach Rob Evans employed a zone defense
early and often. Evans is a man-to-man guy who prefers the flu to
the zone, but he wanted to control the pace.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, thanks largely to Oregon (10-7, 2-6 Pac-10) hoisting
up 32 three-point attempts and making only eight.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Evans presided over a lengthy meeting of coaches,
players, managers _ to sort out a few things. Freshman Kenny
Crandall said everybody voiced ``what was wrong with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was?
</P>
<P>
   ``No patience,'' he said. ``No one wanting to play together.
Everyone playing for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils (11-8, 3-4) then went out and played far harder
and smarter than they did Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw great effort and great concentration,'' Evans said.
``Those are the things we were focusing on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the game came down to the final minute. ASU led, 60-56,
with guard Ron DuBois at the line shooting one-and-one with 41
seconds left. DuBois, a former walk-on, played 26 minutes. That's
12 minutes fewer than he played all of last season under Newman,
and he admitted afterward he had something to prove. But he missed,
and an Alex Scales tip-in made it 60-58 with 26 seconds to go.
House was fouled a second later and he also missed the front end of
a one-and-one. &QL;

SUNS FINALLY GET THE GOOGS  
 FREE AGENT REACHES DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It was a game of high-stakes poker. The Minnesota
Timberwolves bluffed. The Suns didn't blink.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns won the hand and Tom Gugliotta without giving up a
player Saturday in a victory that they hope will offset the
stunning loss of Antonio McDyess to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta, his agent Richard Howell, and the Suns agreed on a
six-year contract worth $58.5 million, or nearly $30 million less
than he could have had in a return to Minnesota, which was offering
the seven-year, $86.7 million deal allowed under the NBA's new
collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta and Howell are expected to sign the papers today after
arriving in Phoenix before an afternoon practice at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly something that helps ease the pain of losing
McDyess, no question,'' said General Manager Bryan Colangelo, who
expects Gugliotta, a 6-foot-10 forward, to participate in the
practice, the sixth in the Suns' abbreviated training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with Gugliotta, an All-Star last year, marked the
end of a nerve-wracking, whirlwind week for the Suns. For awhile,
it looked as if they were doomed in the first season after the
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   After McDyess' long, strange trip back to Denver, Suns President
Jerry Colangelo said he was told by a media member that his team
looked like a poor victim, a charity case, that had been rendered
helpless by restrictions in the league's new collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Jerry, you know, I think your franchise is the
poster child,' '' said Colangelo, whose agreement with Gugliotta
includes an opt-out clause after the fifth year. ``Well, I don't
think so. Not anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta's impact on a brand new team will be impossible to
judge until at least the midway point of the shortened 50-game
season. Nevertheless, Gugliotta's acquisition clearly boosted Coach
Danny Ainge's confidence. At least, his team has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Thursday, Friday and Saturday morning, Ainge had
neither a starting lineup nor a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was risky business,'' said Ainge, whose starting five
figures to be Gugliotta, center Luc Longley and playmaker Jason
Kidd in addition to unsigned forward Clifford Robinson and unsigned
shooting guard Rex Chapman. ``This was anything but a guarantee. We
let a lot of the free agents go by. But we waited and got a guy
we're all very excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   A key decision was made Saturday afternoon as the Suns
considered dwindling options. There was speculation that the
Timberwolves had a sign-and-trade deal in the works with the Los
Angeles Lakers. According to a widely circulated rumor, Minnesota
would sign Gugliotta for the maximum and then trade him to the
Lakers for Elden Campbell, Eddie Jones and rookie Sam Jacobsen.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: All the pieces of the proposed deal did not fit
within the salary cap formula. It simply couldn't be done.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota General Manager Kevin McHale tried, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   McHale called Ainge, his former Boston Celtics teammate, and
Bryan Colangelo with the hint that he had the Lakers' possibility
in hand. Indications are that McHale made the call after Minnesota
owner Glen Taylor said farewell to Gugliotta early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished Tommy good luck,'' Taylor told the ``St. Paul
Pioneer'' ``Press'' of his phone conversation with the six-year
veteran, who reportedly was not not comfortable alongside Wolves
playmaker Stephon Marbury.
</P>
<P>
   McHale then tried to lure the Suns into a sign-and-trade
arrangement that would have forced them to part with one or two key
players. The Suns didn't take the fake, thanks to Jerry Colangelo,
who preached patience amid the brinksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Bryan, `Don't bite. They don't have a deal with LA. Why
would they pull a sign-and-trade at the last second? We'll take our
shot,' '' said the elder Colangelo, who was confident Gugliotta
would sign after meeting with him Friday over pizza at 2 a.m. ``It
was high-risk poker. But it was the right call.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns had bought the bluff, they still would be
scrambling. Chances are the Timberwolves would have asked for a
starter, perhaps Robinson. Ainge would have been without a
projected starting five all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing has been confusing, not only for us but I'm
sure for him (Gugliotta),'' said Minnesota Coach Flip Saunders, who
said the Lakers' possibility was called viable by Howell.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Suns still have to sign Robinson and Chapman. Both
deals are expected to proceed smoothly within the next couple of
days, according to Bryan Colangelo, who said a Robinson deal is
near completion. Speculation has put it at five years for $30
million. Chapman has said he will sign for the annual average of
$2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Gugliotta to Chapman, Robinson, Longley and Kidd
creates an intriguing lineup that, Ainge said, will take some time
to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a very versatile player in a guy who can play a
little bit of center in a pinch, can play small forward and can
play power forward,'' he said of Gugliotta, who averaged 20.1
points, 8.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can pass. He can shoot. He can create off the dribble,''
Ainge continued. ``He's a complete basketball player. He really
knows how to play the game and make people better on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Suns continue to search for some help in the
backcourt, especially at shooting guard. Two possibilities are
Vinny Del Negro and Blue Edwards. Del Negro, formerly of San
Antonio, is playing for Bologna in the Italian League. The
well-traveled Edwards is a free agent who is recovering from a
broken hand. &QL;

OLYMPICS WILL REFORM, U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sandra Baldwin of Phoenix, who could be president of
the U.S. Olympic Committee during the 2002 Winter Olympics, said
the legacy of the Salt Lake City Games will be the painful and
necessary reform of the bidding and selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Olympic Games are a noble endeavor,'' said
Baldwin, a Phoenix Realtor who will be a candidate to replace
William Hybl and become the first female USOC president after the
2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. ``If we need change and reform from
the International Olympic Committee, because that is where the huge
burden falls in my opinion, then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is the U.S. mission chief for the 2000 Olympics, a role
she also held for the 1995 Pan American Games. If a change in the
USOC constitution is not made in April to allow Hybl to run for a
second term, she will be a leading candidate to serve as USOC
president from 2001-04, the quadrennium that includes the Salt Lake
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Frazier, Arizona State senior associate athletic
director, also is a USOC vice president who could one day rise to
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC Executive Board is to hear a report from the inquiry
committee investigating the Salt Lake charges today in Lausanne,
Switzerland. That is expected to result in expulsion of some IOC
members and proposals to overhaul the Olympic bid process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be taken out of a huge process and put in the hands
of a group that can look at a bid on its technical merit, financial
soundness and geographical location,'' Baldwin said.
</P>
<P>
   In her first public comments about the Olympic scandal, the
59-year-old Baldwin praised Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt for his
leadership in uncovering bribes paid to IOC members to advance Salt
Lake's bid and Frank Joklik for resigning as SLOC president.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, upon the resignation of Joklik and SLOC Senior Vice
President Dave Johnson earlier this month, said: ``The corner of
Olympic corruption did not begin in Salt Lake City. But let it end
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Leavitt is doing a magnificent job of saying, `Let's take
a good strong look at it, we feel awful because it's so contrary to
the values of the people of Utah,' '' Baldwin said. ``He is to be
greatly admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a great admirer of Frank Joklik. He did what
he absolutely had to do in resigning, not because of any
indiscretion on his part that I have any knowledge of whatsoever. I
believe he was working in the best interest of Salt Lake. This
happened when he was in charge, and he resigned in an eloquent way
that gave me more admiration for him than I had in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A former USOC treasurer, Baldwin worked closely through the
summer and fall with Joklik and other SLOC officials in
constructing the $1.45 billion budget for the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness we've raised 75 percent of money to date,''
Baldwin said of the USOC-SLOC partnership to finance the Salt Lake
Olympics. ``Our sponsors are being cooperative. I believe they feel
we have to change the way the games are awarded, but they still
believe in the Olympic movement itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe Salt Lake will put on the best Winter Games
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if bribery allegations emerging about the Sydney Olympics
eventually dwarf those leveled at Salt Lake, Baldwin said, ``Sydney
is not in the United States. We are not allowed the indiscretions
that go on all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we in the United States are held to a different
standard than the rest of the world, not only by the rest of the
world but by we ourselves. Because we are a blessed nation, we have
to have higher standards and higher expectations for ourselves.'' &QL;

BRYANT GETS BACK TO BASICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ If only chairs could speak, the world might get
a hint of how much better Kobe Bryant will be this season.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout-protracted offseason sent dozens of NBA players into
college gyms and YMCAs for pickup games the last six months. Not
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is the kid who crafted his deadly one-on-one
skills by playing against his own shadow growing up in Italy. And
besides, as the presumed next Michael Jordan tries to emulate the
original, he has picked up one of MJ's key strategies: Don't let
the league see what you've got until you're ready to spring it on
them.
</P>
<P>
   So Bryant retreated to an unspecified high-school gym for daily
drills, sometimes playing against his personal trainer or his
cousin. Otherwise, it was just Kobe and a bunch of chairs posing as
still-life Pippens and Paytons and Hardaways.
</P>
<P>
   If the chairs could talk, they might reveal that, in solitude,
Kobe Bryant _ the king of one-on-one _ made himself a better team
player. Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go to UCLA to play (pickup games) because I
felt I needed to work on a lot of my fundamentals,'' the Lakers
swingman says. ``I felt that if I went up there my competitive
nature would get me in the habit of just going out there and
playing, without really concentrating on the fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as playing playground basketball, I've got that in my
game, I've been working on that for 15 years, so I really didn't
need that.''
</P>
<P>
   This season will be Bryant's third in the NBA, but he's still
just 20 years old and still learning the lessons Jordan and others
received in college. Bryant's classroom is his own mind, but he
supplemented that this offseason by reading Dean Smith's book and
using those drills in his private workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basic stuff,'' Bryant says, ``that I really never concentrated
on, like coming out on the wing, going to meet the ball, catching
and planting with two feet, back-pivoting, posting up, getting your
position, working your footwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, the mental aspect. I had a chance to get away from the
game, try to think about everything. I watched a lot of film. I
studied a lot of double teams and how to react to double teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new, improved Kobe Bryant did give the world a small
glimpse of what's to come, in (begin ital)the commercial(end ital).
You know, the one where Kobe is frozen in mid-air, hovering near
the hoop for 10 seconds, and you don't know what's more unrealistic
_ the hang time or the fact he passes up the dunk to pass to an
open teammate.
</P>
<P>
   It's more than just a sales job. Bryant's concentration on the
fundamentals has meant learning to use his one-on-one skills to
complement teammates as well, and it's showing. In the third
training camp practice here, Bryant dribbled in from the wing,
straight into a crowd a few feet outside the paint, jumped up...
and dished the ball across the key to a wide-open Derek Harper for
an easy jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches applauded, with verve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took Michael (Jordan) about three years to get to where he
was playing the kind of team game that contributed to (the Bulls')
ultimate success,'' Lakers coach Del Harrris notes. ``(Detroit's)
Joe Dumars said, `When we saw Michael using his ability not only to
score, but to get other people involved, we said it's all over.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we would be looking for, for this to be a
breakthrough year for Kobe to be an all-around offensive player.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be Bryant's goal as well, driven as much by
teamwork concepts as his own desire to be a dominant player. He
knows he needs to diversify, as was evident in last season's
struggles.
</P>
<P>
   He was the league's best sixth man for the first half of the
season, averaging 17.9 points and 45 percent shooting prior to the
All-Star break. But then came the All-Star Game with its NBA-fueled
hype, the media swarm, the constant comparisons to Jordan, and
Bryant was worn down.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams adjusted, attacking Bryant before he could beat them
with his drives to the hoop. His scoring average dropped to 12.7
points per game in the second half of the season and his field-goal
percentage plummeted to 39.6.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bryant is trying to become more judicious with the drives,
has worked diligently on his jump shot and is making the right
decision more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've noticed so far is a more controlled understanding of
the game,'' says teammate Rick Fox. ``He seems to be selective.
He's not going for the jugular at every opportunity.... He'll be a
much better player this year than he was last year, just because of
that ability to be under control and patient with his game and
letting it come to him.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's those top-secret new moves he worked on during
the lockout. Be forewarned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked on a variation of moves, things you may not even
notice,'' says Bryant's cousin, Sharif Butler, his hoops partner
since birth and workout partner in the offseason. ``They definitely
gotta expect some new things with Kobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's just a matter of where Bryant will deliver those moves
_ from the starting lineup or off the bench, at guard or at
forward. He says he's ready to start. Eddie Jones and Derek Fisher
are entrenched in the backcourt, though, and the Lakers have
options at small forward in Fox, Bryant and Robert Horry. But in
this compacted 50-game season, with four to five games a week,
there will be plenty of lineup shuffling to keep bodies fresh.
</P>
<P>
   A starter? ``I better be,'' Bryant says with a laugh, but he's
serious anyway. ``I think it's about time to get me in there and
start building the team for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   A future that will be spent, he says, entirely in Los Angeles. A
free agent at season's end, he's not talking about contract
extensions just yet, but the new labor deal guarantees Bryant more
money to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna be a Laker for life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And a headache for the rest of the league for years to come. The
chairs, if they could speak, would say so.

WOODS' TWO 3-POINTERS CARRY SMU

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ After hitting a 3-point shot to push SMU past Air Force
with three seconds left last night, Stephen Woods quickly
confronted his celebrating teammates in the huddle during a
timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reminded them of Alcorn State,'' said Woods, recalling a
game lost on a shot at the buzzer after a desperate inbounds pass,
just what the Falcons were now hoping they could pull off.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the shot at the buzzer _ by Tyrone Wright of Air
Force _ was emphatically swatted down by Jeryl Sasser, and the
Mustangs escaped with a 73-71 Western Athletic Conference victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been quite a week, and I feel a lot better now than I did
when it started,'' said SMU coach Mike Dement, after watching the
Mustangs (8-10, 2-3) win their second in a row after opening WAC
play with three losses.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bitter loss for the Falcons (8-8, 1-4) who got 26
points from Wright and wiped out a 10-point halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was tough,'' said Sasser, who scored 25 points and
pulled down a career-high 17 rebounds. ``They played tough defense
on us, and we were a little flat, but we came through in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who finished with 21 points, popped in two 3-pointers for
SMU's final six points. The second one wiped out a 71-70 Air Force
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought the ball in with a play designed for Sass, but it
didn't go,'' Woods said. ``They were in a matchup zone and holding
us out, and we were out of timeouts. Willie \RDavis\S got the ball
back out to me, but it dribbled off my leg and I had to chase it
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got it out there, my guy was behind me and there was a
big guy in front of me, in my face, so I had to kind of arch the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect arch, from 25 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he could do it,'' Sasser said. ``The only problem we
had was that Chad \RElsey\S almost tried to call timeout, and we
kept waving him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Force inbounded with a long heave, and retained possession
when the ball went out in front of the Falcons' bench at the other
end. The ensuing inbound pass went to Wright, but Sasser was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to him because he's such a good player and
was hot for them,'' Sasser said. ``I just stayed with him, and I
figured he was going to shoot that little running hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him lean in a little, and then when he shot it, I just
got on top of it.''

UNT'S FREE-THROW WOES LEAD TO DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ North Texas men's basketball coach Vic Trilli
huddled his team at midcourt of the Super Pit last night for an
unscheduled practice, the lights barely dim from the Eagles' Big
West Conference game against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had quickly discarded their white game uniforms for
green practice jerseys. Trilli's instructions were specific _ shoot
free throws, again and again, to make sure UNT's 8-for-17
performance doesn't repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   North Texas (1-15, 1-5) fought its way back from an 11-point
deficit against the Mustangs, tying the game at 80 with 6:17
remaining. But in the end, the Eagles' poor free-throw showing,
compared with Cal Poly's 23-for-28 showing, resulted in a 93-86
Mustangs victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going out there right now and shoot free throws,''
Trilli said after the game. ``That is totally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering all UNT did to get back in the game after Cal Poly
(7-10, 2-4) ran the lead to as many as 13 points, Trilli had reason
to be frustrated with the free-throw differential. North Texas was
outscored by 15 for the game on foul shots, which negated UNT's
late rally.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, UNT had its chances. Thanks to a career-high 20
points in 20 minutes from freshman Dexter Tennell, an 11-point
performance from Brandon Gilbert and 16 points from Calvin
Williams, the Eagles clawed their way out of a double-digit deficit
and into a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we just picked it up more,'' Williams
said. ``We were more aggressive. Coach was really hot at the half _
we were hot, too. We knew we had to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final five minutes, however, it seemed the Eagles ran out
of steam _ possibly a result of their all-out attempt at a
comeback. North Texas' full-court pressure looked nothing like the
one it used in the first half when the Mustangs repeatedly broke it
down and ended up with easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Poly's ability to break UNT's press in the first 20 minutes
allowed the Mustangs to shoot 57.9 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of the game, we just came out flat,'' said senior
Charles Washington. ``We didn't have the intensity we needed to
jump on them and win the ballgame. We let them jump on us.''
</P>
<P>
   While UNT slowed Chris Bjorklund in the second half (he scored
14 of his 15 in the first half), Mike Wozniak scored 16 of his
game-high 24 points in the second half.

SUNSET CRATER CHANGES NEED MORE THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When I came to Arizona in the late 1970s, I was
intrigued by the diversity of the state.
</P>
<P>
   And once I discovered that a volcanic cone could be viewed north
of Flagstaff, my ex-wife and I packed up the kids and went to see
it.
</P>
<P>
   We were fascinated. We climbed through cinder rock at Sunset
Crater Volcano National Monument to the top of the cone and peered
into its interior. We didn't see much, but we knew we'd climbed a
volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was an ice cave. We rented miners' hats with lights
on the front and basically crawled into the cave. As usual, my
older daughter's main concern was that bats might invade her hair _
hat or no hat. Nothing we could say would dissuade her of the bat
peril.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed now. The ice cave caved in. Because of
damage to the cone, the National Park Service closed it to hiking.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 miles north on a U.S. Forest Service road is Wupatki
National Monument, a prehistoric Indian ruin. We visited that, too.
It wasn't nearly as thrilling at the cinder cone.
</P>
<P>
   Both monuments can be reached off U.S. 89, but the Forest
Service road offers a look at both cinders and history.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service and Forest Service have had a good relationship
here. A visitor center and Sunset administrative offices are
located on Forest Service land, and it maintains the road between
the two monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Park Service is contemplating major changes in Sunset.
</P>
<P>
   A new visitor center is contemplated. The Forest Service is
considering expanding Bonito Campground near the monument. More
hiking trails are in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service has come up with a couple of alternatives for
upgrading the monuments.
</P>
<P>
   One would encourage more motorized travel to see Sunset,
including guided access to O'Leary Peak, which would provide the
only available view into the crater. The alternative would allow
24-hour-a-day access to the Forest Service Road that takes a loop
through Sunset and Wupatki.
</P>
<P>
   The second would emphasize a quiet, natural setting. A new road
system would be established to allow visitors to enter Sunset at
only one location. Short roads would replace the drive-through
experience. A new visitor center would be built. The crater could
be experienced through trail and guided activities. Motorized,
guided tours would be allowed to the top of O'Leary Peak.
</P>
<P>
   Either of these plans sound OK, except for one major problem.
Both plans include expanding park boundaries to include all land
between the two monuments.
</P>
<P>
   The possible management plans indicate that views and natural
quiet are substantially impaired by a nearby pumice mining at the
base of the San Francisco Peaks and off-highway vehicle activities
in the Cinder Hills area.
</P>
<P>
   Both alternatives recommend moving the Cinder Hills OHV area.
</P>
<P>
   This red cinder rock area is perhaps the most popular OHV area
in the state during summer months. People come from far and wide to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much there but loose cinder rock, but OHV users love
it. It keeps them happy and also keeps them from using more
environmentally fragile areas.
</P>
<P>
   Relocate the OHV area? How about relocating Sunset Crater? Not
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives also would eliminate a number of other multiple
uses of public land: hunting, wood-cutting, dispersed camping,
grazing and mining among others.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the alternatives probably will be made this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that these monuments have more visitors than there are
OHV enthusiasts in this state. But noise pollution? If people are
going to tour the areas in the cars, what do they care? You can't
make a pristine area out of one that isn't. I'll hike the crater,
noise or not. Besides, it isn't that bad.
</P>
<P>
   These alternatives seem a little exclusive to me. Who said
hikers have more rights than off-highway enthusiasts? The Cinder
Hills are a traditional place for OHV activity. Why the sudden
change?
</P>
<P>
   This deal needs more scrutiny. Why can't multiple use be part of
the plan? &QL;

MCCLOUD MAY BENEFIT FROM MCDYESS DEPARTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; PHOENIX -  &UR; George McCloud left a friend and a circus in Denver.
He'll miss the friend, but not the circus. McCloud has never had
much tolerance for clowns. In a way, that's why he's back in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   McCloud is a tough, plain-spoken pro who takes his business and
friends seriously. He had hoped for another season with  &UR; Antonio
 &UR; McDyess as a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   He went to Denver on Thursday night with  &UR; Rex Chapman and  &UR; Jason
 &UR; Kidd out of concern for McDyess. And, yes, there was with an
outside hope of maybe talking him out of signing with the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen. McDyess returned to the Nuggets and McCloud
re-signed with the Suns. It's back to business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dice situation was really important to everybody,'' said
McCloud, who considered offers from Orlando, Dallas, Miami, San
Antonio and Houston before signing Saturday for $750,000 a year.
``He's a close friend. He was real confused. Heck, we were real
confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to do everything we could until the last minute to
keep him here. But it didn't work out, so we have to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very circuslike atmosphere up there. But it's behind
us. We can't worry about Dice, and he can't worry about us.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an ironic twist to McCloud's role in trying to get
McDyess back with the Suns. The Phoenix acquisition of McDyess on
Oct. 1, 1997 was a factor in McCloud's inconsistent playing time
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was tough,'' said McCloud, a versatile swingman,
streak shooter and sometime starter who was in and out of the
playing rotation throughout last season. ``As a person, a player
and a fan of the game, you had to realize that Coach ( &UR; Danny)
 &UR; Ainge was in a tough spot. For me, he didn't know he was going to
acquire Dice. That took away some of my playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, as a team, we didn't know we were going to be as good as
we were. We came in thinking we'd be rebuilding. Then, we realized
we might be able to really do something. It changed the outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, now, it's time to put all that aside. Last year was last
year. Now, it's time to just play as hard as you can and see what
happens.'' &QL; 
Briefly. . .  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCloud, on Denver's sales job with McDyess: ``It was an A-1
recruiting trip for the Nuggets. They did what they had to. You
want to say tampering, you want to say a lot of different things.
But the lockout lasted so long that it hurt the Suns. He had so
much time to think about everything, and he had a lot different
people pulling him different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamp of approval: On Saturday, center  &UR; Luc Longley was
officially added to the Phoenix roster after the NBA OK'd the
sign-and-trade deal in which the Suns acquired him from Chicago for
 &UR; Mark
 &UR; Bryant,  &UR; Martin Muursepp,  &UR; Bubba Wells and a conditional
first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Still available: Former Suns forward  &UR; Cedric Ceballos. Dallas
decided not to re-sign him after their agreement Friday with
 &UR; Gary Trent, a free-agent forward from Toronto. ``We tried to sign
Ced, but Trent came along, and we just jumped all over it,'' Dallas
Coach
 &UR; Don Nelson said. ``Basically we said goodbye to Ced.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ainge, on whether it is out-of-sight, out-of-mind to ask him
if he has decided on a starting lineup: ``Yes, you're out of your
mind.'' &QL;

$3 MILLION PURSE HELPS OPEN ATTRACT TOUR'S ELITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When the Phoenix Open hiked its purse this year to $3
million, the idea was to stay at the top of the PGA Tour pay scale,
thus luring the best field possible to the Valley for this week's
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they didn't get all the superstars, but the sponsoring
Thunderbirds came pretty darn close. Every tour event only wishes
it could land the likes of the top six money winners of 1998 _ (in
order) David Duval, Vijay Singh, Jim Furyk, Tiger Woods, Hal Sutton
and Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Justin Leonard (No. 8), and seven of the top eight will
participate in the Open, which takes place Thursday through Sunday
at the TPC of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Following Woods' lead Friday, Leonard, Furyk and Sutton brought
the commitment list to 129 players. The final three spots will be
filled Monday during qualifying at Papago and Encanto golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as excited about those three (Leonard, Furyk and Sutton)
as I was about Tiger the day before,'' said tournament Chairman Ray
Artigue, noting that the Open field features 16 of the top 20
money-winners, and 95 of the top 125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had the fourth-strongest field among
regular-season events. But this year, I'll bet we end up ranked at
the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Others of note include Stuart Appleby, Paul Azinger, Mark
Calcavecchia, John Daly, Fred Funk, Bill Glasson, Scott Hoch, Lee
Janzen, Steve Jones, Bruce Lietzke, Andrew Magee, Billy Mayfair,
Frank Nobilo, Payne Stewart, Fuzzy Zoeller and defending champ
Jesper Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing a few of the big names,'' said Artigue,
referring to Greg Norman, Fred Couples, Mark O'Meara, Ernie Els and
Nick Price. ``But a lot of those guys don't come to Phoenix for
whatever reason, or they're in Europe or overseas and don't play
this part of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just never commit, and it's their loss. We can't award a
first prize of $540,000 to someone that's not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Artigue also announced that the Thunderbirds have awarded
exemptions to five players, including Arizona veterans Howard
Twitty and Ronnie Black; Doug Tewell; 1988 Phoenix Open champ Sandy
Lyle, who lost his card last season after finishing 146th on the
money list; and former University of Arizona star Ted Purdy, a
rookie from Scottsdale. &QL;

A LOOK AT BEST (AND WORST) OF NHL'S 1ST HALF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the NHL season having reached the halfway point, marked
today with the 49th annual All-Star Game in Tampa, it's time to
take a look back and briefly analyze the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Who were the winners and losers? Which players emerged as
potential award winners? Which teams climbed up the contender's
ladder toward the Stanley Cup? Who stumbled?
</P>
<P>
   Who got traded? And who's next?
</P>
<P>
   The awards &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the individual awards:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hart Trophy (MVP): According to Coyotes' captain Keith Tkachuk,
it should be Eric Lindros of the Philadelphia Flyers. Agreed. Eric
the Great is off to one of his best seasons ever, perhaps in part
to the public challenge made to his this summer from General
Manager Bobby Clarke. Whatever it was, the Flyers are the No. 1
team in the Eastern Conference, and they owe Lindros for helping
them get there.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Paul Kariya, Anaheim. Alexei Yashin, Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Norris Trophy (best defenseman): Scott Stevens, New Jersey. As
steady as they come, this guy's been passed over way too many
times. That's why we're creating a new award for the best
offensive-minded defenseman (see below) and giving the Norris to
the person who deserves it.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Nicklas Lidstrom, Detroit. Teppo Numminen, Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bobby Orr Trophy: Before long, the NHL will catch on and create
this award for high-scoring blueliners in honor of Orr, perhaps the
game's greatest. Our pick this season? So far, Darryl Sydor of
Dallas, tops in the league with 36 points, is the favorite. But
we're giving it to Al Macinnis of St. Louis (29 points), who owns
the most dangerous shot in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Sydor. Larry Murphy, Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vezina Trophy (best goalie): Dominik Hasek, Buffalo. Simply the
best, better than all the rest. The Dominator could make a case for
also capturing the Hart Trophy for a third straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Eddie Belfour, Dallas. Nikolai Khabibulin, Coyotes.
Curtis Joseph, Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Selke Trophy (best defensive forward): Michael Peca, Buffalo.
He epitomizes the word defense, but he'll be chased hard for this
award by a host of deserving players.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Bob Corkum, Coyotes. Jere Lehtinen, Dallas. Craig
Conroy, St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Calder Trophy (Rookie of the Year): Bill Muckalt, Vancouver.
Bill who? Don't worry, with 14 goals already this season, you'll
get to know this kid center before long.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Chris Drury, Colorado. Brendan Morrison, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Masterton Trophy (inspirational, courageous player): John
Cullen, who made a successful comeback after battling a form of
cancer but reluctantly retired. He now serves as an assistant coach
for his former team, the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Kariya, Arturs Irbe, Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lady Byng (gentlemanly play, sportsmanship): Wayne Gretzky,
Rangers. Only six penalty minutes all season, and he's getting hit
and pushed around now more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Teemu Selanne, Anaheim. Numminen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jack Adams Award (Coach of the Year): Pat Quinn, Toronto. All
things considered, he's done the most with the least. The Maple
Leafs were the NHL's most improved club from this season compared
with last season at this point, going from 13-21-7 to 24-15-2 after
41 games.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Jim Schoenfeld, Coyotes. Paul Maurice, Carolina. &QL; 
Also &QL; 
Let's move on to some other categories.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stanley Cup favorite: Dallas. We said it before the year, and
we'll say it again. The Stars are the easy pick. Depth throughout
the lineup, a great system, and a goalie (Belfour) who's in Hasek's
class.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Philadelphia. New Jersey. Phoenix. Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dark-horse team to watch: Ottawa. Yashin and the Senators
surprised the world last year by knocking New Jersey out of the
playoffs in the first round. They'll make even bigger headlines
this time.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Toronto. Boston. Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Biggest flop: Chicago. It can't get any worse, can it? Half of
the team has been dealt, and now they're bracing for captain Chris
Chelios to be traded to a contender. No wonder All-Star Tony Amonte
was so grim-looking Saturday when he met the media.
</P>
<P>
   Runners ups: Rangers. Washington. Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best trade: Nashville, for taking Cliff Ronning and his
team-leading 35 points in exchange for future considerations (a
middle-round draft pick) from the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst trade: The Islanders getting fooled into taking
out-of-work goalie Felix Potvin for skilled defenseman Bryan
Berard, only two years removed from having won the Calder Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The next trade(s): Among the big names, expect Calgary's Theo
Fleury to be dealt to a contender, possibly Detroit; Chelios
perhaps to wind up in Philadelphia; and Washington's Joe Juneau to
a team out West, but not the Coyotes, who actually could use a
veteran scoring second-line center. Too bad Chicago's Doug Gilmour
costs so much.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best free-agent signing: Curtis Joseph to Toronto. The Leafs
wouldn't be half the team they are if they hadn't made Potvin
expandable this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: John Vanbiesbrouck to Philadelphia. Jyrki Lumme to
Phoenix. Brett Hull to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Unsung heroes: Everybody on the third and fourth lines in
Dallas. Ask Detroit, the two-time champs, about how depth brings
titles. Players such as Mike Keane, Guy Carbonneau, Dave Reid and
Craig Ludwig are the glue.
</P>
<P>
   Runners-up: Shawn McEachern, Ottawa; Corkum; Steve Rucchin,
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best rule change: The two-referee system. Every team will have
had 20 games called by the double team. It works. It's the only way
the league will be able to clamp down on all the obstruction
penalties it keeps yakking about. Sources say plans to use two refs
in the playoffs could get scrubbed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Worst rule change: The constant tinkering with crease
violations. More succinctly, the way those types of controversial
goals are reviewed. Bring the VCRs downstairs to the penalty box
area and let the refs judge for themselves. What type of system
only allows the video-review judge to answer ``yes'' or ``no''
questions from the referee while the play is being discussed over a
telephone? One that needs to be fixed. Again. &QL;

EVEN MISSING MUONEKE, UT WINS WITH POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas may have been missing a large part of its
scoring punch last night against Oklahoma State, but proved far
from punchless.
</P>
<P>
   Playing to its own perceived weakness without suspended power
forward Gabe Muoneke, the Longhorns repeatedly pounded or drove the
ball inside and stunned the No. 23 Cowboys, 73-70, before the Erwin
Center's largest crowd of the season (12,358).
</P>
<P>
   The victory bumped Texas (10-9) into the Big 12 South lead at
6-1, the best start for a Longhorns team since going 8-1 in the
Southwest Conference in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (13-5) fell to 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fantastic win,'' said center Chris Mihm, who got a piece of
two 3-point shot attempts by Oklahoma State guard Joe Adkins in the
waning few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm scored 22 points and pulled down 14 rebounds and lent
strong support to forward Kris Clack, who scored a team-high 25
points on 11-for-17 shooting and helped shut down the Cowboys'
Desmond Mason _ who scored only four points after a 20-point first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mihm and Clack recorded season-high points. Texas scored 48
points in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone counted us out tonight playing without Gabe,
but everyone just stepped up and played to the best of their
ability,'' Clack said. ``Maybe we gained a little respect tonight.
And the crowd was unbelievable. They were like our sixth man out
there and picked us up when Gabe wasn't there to.''
</P>
<P>
   Muoneke, suspended by coach Rick Barnes for unsportsmanlike
conduct against Kansas on Monday, will rejoin the lineup tomorrow
at Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The late sequence unfolded after Ivan Wagner put down two free
throws with 35.4 seconds left to give the 3-point lead to Texas _
which was down 41-35 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Routine,'' Wagner shrugged. ``It was just a matter of doing
what you do every day in practice. But by making both of them, it
put a little more pressure on them to hit the three.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys worked the clock to inside 10 seconds before Doug
Gottlieb passed to Adkins in the right corner. Mihm extended along
the baseline to deflect his first offering. And after a scramble
when Adkins ended up with the ball out front, Mihm got a hand on
the ball shortly after launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew they were going to run a play for one of their
3-point shooters,'' Mihm said. ``\RAdkins\S got a little daylight,
but I got a piece of it. And there was no way I was going to let
that second shot get off.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was one of the more significant ones of Barnes'
young tenure at Texas and gives the Longhorns their second win of
the season over a ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great win for our program,'' Barnes said. ``So many times
you see something like this happen when a team loses a player for
one reason or the other and the other players know they have to
come through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Mihm made two great plays at the end, but really it was
a gutty performance on all the players' part.'' \Ntagtop:Mike
Jones, (817) 390-7760

NEARING RETIREMENT, GRETZKY SAYS HE WILL MISS OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY _  &UR; Wayne Gretzky privately has been eyeing retirement
for the past several weeks, perhaps deciding to play one more
season before finally leaving the game he helped redefine. There
have even been rumors he might bow out early and leave after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   So on Saturday, when the Great One said he might play for Team
Canada in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, it quickly
caught everyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he was only joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely would love to be there,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   After a dramatic long pause, however, he added:
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Olympics, though,'' said Gretzky, who turns 38 this
week. ``When I grew up, I didn't know about it. I grew up dreaming
of playing in the NHL. I didn't know what it would be like to play
for your country in the Olympics. I enjoyed it last year.
Everything from going over (to Nagano, Japan), to being in the
village, to just being part of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the league decides to do it again. I know we've got to
go through a lot to get there because the league has so many
concerns about certain things, but if it works out, I think it
would be tremendous to have the NHL participate in the Olympics
again.'' &QL; 
Boston Common
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick, after his first workout with his
fellow North American All-Stars, was asked if had an idea whom
he'll be skating with in today's 49th annual All-Star Game at the
Ice Palace.
</P>
<P>
   He looked to his left and saw good friend and former teammate
 &UR; Tony
 &UR; Amonte, a right wing for the Chicago Blackhawks. He looked to his
right and saw Coyotes captain  &UR; Keith Tkachuk, a left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty obvious, don't you?'' Roenick said. ``I
think me, Tony and Walt (Tkachuk) would make a perfect line. We're
all from Boston, too. It can't get any better than that. We might
have to try to bribe Shoney (Coyotes Coach  &UR; Jim
 &UR; Schoenfeld, an assistant coach for the North Americans). We might
have to slip him a few bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Amonte said, ``We should do that. I think it'd be worth it.'' &QL; 
Like a rock
</P>
<P>
   With three more games, Detroit's  &UR; Larry Murphy will become the
NHL's leader in career games played among defenseman, surpassing
the record held by Tim Horton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you guys ask me about that, I start feeling sore,''
Murphy said, laughing. ``No, seriously, it's nothing that I ever
strived for or ever believed that I would get to this point. It's
just one of those things where year after year, the numbers add up
and here you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's tough to talk about it because I'm still a few
games away and anything could happen. I'd feel more comfortable
talking about it after the fact.'' &QL; 
Skills competitions
</P>
<P>
   Roenick and Tkachuk and Boston's  &UR; Ray Bourque tied for first in
the accurate-shooter competition Saturday night in the NHL
SuperSkills Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's  &UR; Peter Bondra circled the ice in 14.64 seconds to
beat San Jose's  &UR; Marco Sturm by one-hundredth of a second for
fastest skater.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's  &UR; Dominik Hasek stopped five of six shots on the final
round of the night-closing Breakaway Relay event to enable the
World team to hold off the North American All-Stars, 13-11.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Hasek was the only goalie to score in the Goalies Goal
competition, lifting the puck over a barrier in front his own net
and sending it into the goal at the other end of the ice on the
second of his two attempts. Phoenix's  &UR; Nikolai Khabibulin of
Phoenix hit the post on one of his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis'  &UR; Al MacInnis won the hardest shot event (98.5 mph) to
edge Philadelphia's  &UR; John LeClair.
</P>
<P>
   The world team won the Rapid Fire event, allowing five goals
while scoring seven. &QL;

TKACHUK SHOWS MATURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA - The last time America's finest shared a uniform,
furniture was flying out of windows, fire extinguishers were
spraying sleeping goalies, walls were smashed, rooms were trashed,
and an entire country was shivering at the death of manners on
foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, right. And that was Keith Tkachuk, front and center in
Nagano, a popular name swirling inside the Olympic ring of rumors.
The kid most likely to succumb to his temper, start an
international incident, threaten any snitch within inches of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Guilty by reputation.
</P>
<P>
   And here he is, 11 months later, flying commercial with a
connection to Florida, strolling up and down the aisle with his
13-month old son. Here he is, on a tram to the main terminal,
holding his son in one arm, patiently signing autographs with the
other. Here he is, a black shirt badly stained with child goo,
spooning frozen yogurt into his son's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guy is the best,'' Tkachuk said about Matthew, an oversized
child with a dreamy smile, one who made quite a showing on the way
out.
</P>
<P>
   Seems Matthew decided to play javelin toss with his apple sauce,
redecorating the wardrobe of a gentleman one row ahead in first
class, a gentleman who wasn't the least bit pleased with the
child's aim or accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized to the guy like crazy, and he still was
moaning,'' Tkachuk said. ``Obviously, he's never had kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, here he is, 11 months after the Nagano nightmare and a few
months after turning most of Arizona into personal enemies, basking
in the virtues of fatherhood and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   All the anger Tkachuk has experienced and caused, all the
consternation left in the wake of contract squabbles and playoff
exits, is slowly surrendering to the wonders of maturity. As he
stands among the rest of the All-Stars, no one deserves this
weekend more than he does, a man who has lost the child within,
finally leading his team as a captain should.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm very happy with him,'' Coyotes owner Richard Burke
said. ``He's growing up very nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   As the league gathers for its midseason party, few teams have
been as celebrated as the Coyotes. Teppo Numminen, the overlooked
defenseman, smiled for those who wondered how it felt to finally
get here. Jim Schoenfeld, the coach on a short leash, will take a
spot on the bench. Nikolai Khabibulin conducted interviews next to
Jaromir Jagr. And Jeremy Roenick drew a crowd, retelling his own
remarkable tale of personal growth.
</P>
<P>
   But if you really want to know how the Coyotes have posted an
11-point improvement over the first 41 games of 1997, showing
flashes of a team that might make a run at Dallas and the Stanley
Cup, you must start with the captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith is the main reason,'' Roenick said. ``I don't want to
say he's rededicated himself, but he's really led by example. He's
taken a ribbing for a couple of years that he wasn't a good
captain. He's taken that view and thrown it out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   A bad metaphor, given the Olympic experience, but nonetheless
accurate. Heading into the season, only Jagr and Peter Bondra have
scored more goals since 1993, and Tkachuk continues to do what he's
always done well _ camp in front of the net, take the punishment,
score the goal, show up every night, play like a man, get on the
exercise bike after practice, pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   The change, however, lies in what he's doing different this
season _ biting his lip, opening his house to a rookie, staying out
of the penalty box, accepting the boos and the critics, realizing
that winning is the only thing that matters when you step on the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Tkachuk spent three hours and 48 minutes in the
penalty box. This season, he has 17 goals, 34 points and only 45
penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to keep it under control more than anything,''
Tkachuk said. ``A lot of times in the past, my emotions got the
best of me. But you take too many penalties, and you cost your team
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand Tkachuk is to know his background, a big kid who
came from the mean streets of East Boston. It nearly explains
everything: the hard accent, the hard face, the stubborn streak,
the refusal to acknowledge injury, the code of courage, the
nastiness that lies below the surface and must be smothered, the
disdain for glitter and flash, the belief that talk is cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever see the movie ``Good Will Huntin''g? asked Roenick, who
also grew up in Boston. ``East Boston is a little worse than that.
You don't go out in the streets at night unless you can take care
of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk: ``Yeah, I see a lot of myself in that movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to Roenick: ``Keith doesn't beat around the bush. He tells
you like it is. Hard-headed. Stubborn. You can't tell Keith Tkachuk
he's wrong if he thinks he's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is the same attitude Tkachuk took with his
contract status for two years running. While he got what he wanted
in the end, he paid a price _ pointed words in this space, lusty
jeers from the home crowd. To his credit, he took it all and
performed, winning back the fans with his play.
</P>
<P>
   This season, with Tkachuk in the lineup, the Coyotes are 20-4-6.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, they are 4-7-1.
</P>
<P>
   The type of statistics that warrant MVP chatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm all about money, money, money,'' Tkachuk
said. ``I know people are going to judge you on that stuff, but it
was only a contract squabble. I'm a good person. I know I'm a good
guy, and I love the game. All that was about was a money problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all of that is over. The boos are history, the criticism on
hiatus. His team has 55 points, second-most in the Western
Conference. Now, a weekend when Tkachuk can exhale for a few
moments, skate among the elite, breathe in the changes. There are
flecks of gray in his cropped hair. The look in his eyes is more
contentment, less wilderness. The goo on his shirt a reminder of
new priorities.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, this is a temporary respite. Soon, the second half, the
playoffs, the big hurdle, the next test for the captain who has
proved everything and nothing. &QL;

SPECIAL PER DIEM DEAL LET EX-SPEAKER CASH IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Former House Speaker Don Aldridge collected thousands
of dollars in a daily allowance last year even though he had lost
his leadership position and was no longer eligible for the extra
money.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, even when the Legislature was not in session, a
family member pushed the ailing Aldridge's wheelchair into the
House, where he signed for his $60 in per diem pay, then went home,
House sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Through a ``special dispensation'' from House Speaker Jeff
Groscost, Aldridge was able to collect more money than any other
member of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Although the legal status of the practice is unclear, it
illustrates how loose accounting procedures have allowed what was
supposed to be a daily living allowance for working legislators to
become a supplemental income.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge, who represented Lake Havasu City in the House until
last year, received a $60 stipend for 218 days in 1998, including
86 days when the Legislature was out of session.
</P>
<P>
   Those extra days account for $5,160 of the $13,080 Aldridge
collected in per diem. He also received $6,438 for mileage
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The move raises questions about why Groscost paid the extra
money to Aldridge, and what Aldridge was doing while he took it.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge, through his daughter, declined to be interviewed by
``The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge, a Republican, served as House speaker in 1997, but
stepped down several months later after suffering a debilitating
stroke. Groscost replaced him after a three-way race for the post
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge served the remainder of his two-year House term and did
not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Groscost said he never discussed the per diem
situation with Aldridge before he was elected speaker in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I became speaker, we didn't think he was going to return
as a member. If you want to extend that argument, any thought that
there was any quid pro quo . . . consider the fact that if he
wanted to make me speaker, he would have made me his speaker
pro-tem, which he did with (Rep. Bill) McGibbon.'' &QL; 
`SPECIAL DISPENSATION' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Groscost defeated McGibbon for speaker in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When first asked Thursday why Aldridge had collected so much per
diem, Groscost replied, ``I do not know. I really don't. How's that
for a definitive answer?''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Jimmy Jayne, the director of House
Operations, said Groscost gave Aldridge a ``special dispensation''
to collect per diem payments every day, as if he were still a
member of the leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Groscost said he remembered that Aldridge requested
that he be allowed extra per diem payments because he was not well
enough to return to his district and work with constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge was undergoing rehabilitation in Phoenix after his
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Members of House leadership are entitled to per diem whenever
they work at the Capitol, Jayne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the outgoing speaker,'' Jayne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had one year left on his term. . . . His seniority played a
gigantic role in this. His seniority, leaving the speakership
halfway through _ the speaker (Groscost) just felt a special
dispensation for Mr. Aldridge was appropriate.'' &QL; 
PER DIEM MEMO
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge collected more days of per diem than all members of
House leadership except Groscost and Minority Leader Art Hamilton,
D-southwest Phoenix. He was paid 10 more days than Senate President
Brenda Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Both Groscost and Hamilton received less money than Aldridge
because, as Maricopa County lawmakers, they collect $35 a day;
out-county lawmakers get $60.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne said Aldridge approached the speaker's office shortly
after a May 26 memo was issued, detailing the House policy on per
diem.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, from Groscost, read: ``As in past years, members are
allowed one day of per diem a week between sine die and the
beginning of the next session. Additional per diem is permitted for
any legislative meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayne said Aldridge received special consideration because he
was the most senior member in the GOP caucus, where he had served
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   And Aldridge was legendary for constituent work, Jayne said.
</P>
<P>
   While other members were moved out of their offices for
remodeling during the summer, Aldridge was given a small office for
work. &QL; 
`I DON'T BABY-SIT'
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr Aldridge is famous for his servicing of his district,''
Jayne said. ``He came in very frequently. How long he was here or
how many days a week he came in, I couldn't tell you. I don't
baby-sit members while they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost agreed, pointing out that Aldridge was frequently seen
coming and going from the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually seen him come and go multiple times during the
day, and usually when I talked to him he was going to rehab,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his stroke, Aldridge suffers from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost acknowledged he probably would not do the same thing
again.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he didn't bend any rules for Aldridge. The speaker
sets the policy, he explained. The limitations on per diem were
adopted to limit per diem payments. But he tries to accommodate
members with legitimate requests. &QL; 
`NOT REALLY A RULE'
</P>
<P>
   He cited allowing Rep. Debra Brimhall, R-Snowflake, to collect
mileage for constituent work in her district, which stretches from
Payson to St. Johns. But another member, Rep. John Verkamp,
R-Flagstaff, complained last week that he doesn't receive mileage
payments when he travels his district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really a rule,'' Groscost explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a baby-sitter. I really have no desire to take on the
role. We put the rules out there. When they come up with a good
reason, we tend to try to accommodate the members, realizing they
are elected just like I am.'' &QL;

PER DIEMS CAN DOUBLE A PAYCHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Former Sen. Jim Henderson turned a $15,000-a-year job
into $39,000 simply by showing up for work.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Don Aldridge earned almost as much _ $35,000 _ just
for being a member of the Arizona House.
</P>
<P>
   How did they do it?
</P>
<P>
   Through the Legislature's policy of paying members' ``expenses''
regardless of whether they have actually incurred any out-of-pocket
costs at all.
</P>
<P>
   It's a policy that many voters thought they were changing when
they approved a $9,000 pay raise in November.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot question was designed to boost pay but dramatically
change the so-called per diem expenses, which some lawmakers
concede were used to compensate legislators whose pay had been so
low ($15,000) for so long (19 years).
</P>
<P>
   But then Attorney General Janet Napolitano ruled earlier this
month that lawmakers could keep the old per diem rate, meaning many
lawmakers could have an income from the state of as much as
$50,000, despite a new salary of $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   That outrages supporters of the pay raise such as former
lawmaker Peter Kay, who headed the Commission on Salaries for
Elected State Officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best-kept secret in state government, what
legislators have been raking in for years on presumably
out-of-pocket expenses,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Monica Lewinsky, but it should be corrected. . . .
All money that legislators receive that is not reimbursed for
out-of-pocket expenses is salary.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Internal Revenue Service considers both per diem
and mileage payments to Maricopa County lawmakers as salary.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the lawmakers who drew the largest sums are
conservatives who have called for tight public budgets.
</P>
<P>
   A few, including local lawmakers such as Rep. Marilyn Jarrett,
R-Mesa, and House Speaker Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa, were already
making as much or more than $24,000 before the voters approved that
salary figure in November.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Kay's ire is focused. He says in-county lawmakers
are being paid for expenses they don't have: They live at home and,
when they are not being entertained by lobbyists, eat their meals
at home, too.
</P>
<P>
   And almost no one else, whether in the public or private sector,
gets paid for driving to and from work. State lawmakers do.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Sen. Tom Patterson agrees with Kay that voters
perceive the payments as a perk. It adds to the sense that there's
an elite group that gets special treatment, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't justify it. I was eating lunch and all that before I
was in the Legislature, and I still am now that I'm out; I just
don't get any money for it. I don't even get it bought as often,''
said Patterson, alluding to the dozens of free meals legislators
get at the hands of lobbyists and special-interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson sponsored reform legislation that would have banned
most lobbyists' gifts to lawmakers, including meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't like the idea that legislators get a different,
better break than they do. I think they're OK with them making a
reasonable amount of money, whatever that is, but what really galls
them is the whole special-treatment thing. That's why the free
ballgames and the lobbyist perks and getting paid for going to work
bothers them _ Joe Sixpack doesn't get any of those things,''
Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Some local lawmakers say publicly that no per diem payments at
all should go to Maricopa County lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably not, because per diem is to reimburse you for your
expenses when you're away from home,'' said Rep. Sue Gerard,
R-north-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But she added that when lawmakers increased per diem several
years ago, the intent was to increase compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no other way to do it, because it had been so long
since we were able to get a pay raise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Gerard points out that $15,000 isn't enough to make it
affordable to run for most people. The only people who could afford
to serve were the wealthy, retired, or people who depended on their
spouse for income.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett defends the per diem system for Maricopa County
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it's been done for years, but I wouldn't have
complained if we didn't have it. Like I said, I got a raise,''
Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had anyone in my district who has sent me any
negative thing or positive thing (about per diem). They really
don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jean McGrath, R-Glendale, says Maricopa County lawmakers
should probably get per diem only when they come to the Capitol for
meetings when the Legislature is not in session. At the very least,
McGrath said, the policy should be changed so local lawmakers don't
collect per diem on weekends during the session.
</P>
<P>
   But she argues that out-county lawmakers don't get enough. She's
sponsoring a bill that would increase the benefits for non-Maricopa
legislators, to just under $100 during the peak season (Oct. 1
through May 15) and about $60 the rest of the year, the figure now
in effect.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, Maricopa County lawmakers receive $35 a day
during the 100-day legislative session, while those who live
outside Maricopa County get $60 per day.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 payments were higher than usual because lawmakers were
in session 132 days.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all legislators receive payments for mileage driven
from their homes to the Capitol. And lawmakers qualify for
additional per diem and mileage expenses when they aren't in
session.
</P>
<P>
   The compares to unelected state employees, who get a $106 per
day housing allowance in the peak season and a $72 allowance during
off-peak times when they are staying in Phoenix on business.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said, ``What we've been doing is forcing the
out-of-county legislators to pay for their living expenses out of
their own pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Rep. John Verkamp, R-Flagstaff. He generally rents an
apartment during the session. He has to take a six-month lease,
which means he pays for the apartment for two months after the
Legislature wraps up its 100-day session.
</P>
<P>
   He pays anywhere from $600 to $900 a month. Other lawmakers
avoid renting an apartment or hotel room by staying with relatives
or friends while in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Arizona Democratic Party in January sent an e-mail
trying to find local hosts for its rural members during the
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who can help provide housing for a legislator while
they're working in Phoenix should contact the state party,'' the
missive said. ``Space is needed only through the legislative
session.''
</P>
<P>
   Verkamp received $11,219.52 in 1998 in per diem and mileage
payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't even come close, by the time I pay for my meals and
my rent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I could stay in some fleabag motel somewhere and probably
get by on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Verkamp points out that out-of-town legislators have to pay for
all of their meals while in Phoenix. And they frequently drive back
to their districts on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Members get no mileage payments when they travel within their
districts. Verkamp's district stretches from the Hopi Reservation
to Bullhead City.
</P>
<P>
   That's an eight-hour drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere I go from Flagstaff, I don't get anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He bristles at the suggestion that adding $9,000 to legislators'
salaries and taking away per diem is a raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wash,'' he said. ``If you give people a raise over
here, and take it away over here, it's not a raise.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay doesn't have a problem with reimbursing lawmakers for their
expenses. And he was a strong supporter of the pay raise, which he
argues is crucial to attracting qualified people to the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But the per diem system has to go, Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay them for out-of-pocket expenses. That's what everybody
else gets,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making money on this deal, and the public doesn't know
it.'' &QL;

SPECIAL PER DIEM DEAL LET EX-SPEAKER CASH IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Former House Speaker Don Aldridge collected thousands
of dollars in a daily allowance last year even though he had lost
his leadership position and was no longer eligible for the extra
money.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, even when the Legislature was not in session, a
family member pushed the ailing Aldridge's wheelchair into the
House, where he signed for his $60 in per diem pay, then went home,
House sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Through a ``special dispensation'' from House Speaker Jeff
Groscost, Aldridge was able to collect more money than any other
member of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Although the legal status of the practice is unclear, it
illustrates how loose accounting procedures have allowed what was
supposed to be a daily living allowance for working legislators to
become a supplemental income.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge, who represented Lake Havasu City in the House until
last year, received a $60 stipend for 218 days in 1998, including
86 days when the Legislature was out of session.
</P>
<P>
   Those extra days account for $5,160 of the $13,080 Aldridge
collected in per diem. He also received $6,438 for mileage
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The move raises questions about why Groscost paid the extra
money to Aldridge, and what Aldridge was doing while he took it.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge, through his daughter, declined to be interviewed by
``The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge, a Republican, served as House speaker in 1997, but
stepped down several months later after suffering a debilitating
stroke. Groscost replaced him after a three-way race for the post
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge served the remainder of his two-year House term and did
not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Groscost said he never discussed the per diem
situation with Aldridge before he was elected speaker in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I became speaker, we didn't think he was going to return
as a member. If you want to extend that argument, any thought that
there was any quid pro quo . . . consider the fact that if he
wanted to make me speaker, he would have made me his speaker
pro-tem, which he did with (Rep. Bill) McGibbon.'' &QL; 
`SPECIAL DISPENSATION' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Groscost defeated McGibbon for speaker in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When first asked Thursday why Aldridge had collected so much per
diem, Groscost replied, ``I do not know. I really don't. How's that
for a definitive answer?''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Jimmy Jayne, the director of House
Operations, said Groscost gave Aldridge a ``special dispensation''
to collect per diem payments every day, as if he were still a
member of the leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Groscost said he remembered that Aldridge requested
that he be allowed extra per diem payments because he was not well
enough to return to his district and work with constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge was undergoing rehabilitation in Phoenix after his
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Members of House leadership are entitled to per diem whenever
they work at the Capitol, Jayne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the outgoing speaker,'' Jayne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had one year left on his term. . . . His seniority played a
gigantic role in this. His seniority, leaving the speakership
halfway through _ the speaker (Groscost) just felt a special
dispensation for Mr. Aldridge was appropriate.'' &QL; 
PER DIEM MEMO
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge collected more days of per diem than all members of
House leadership except Groscost and Minority Leader Art Hamilton,
D-southwest Phoenix. He was paid 10 more days than Senate President
Brenda Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Both Groscost and Hamilton received less money than Aldridge
because, as Maricopa County lawmakers, they collect $35 a day;
out-county lawmakers get $60.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne said Aldridge approached the speaker's office shortly
after a May 26 memo was issued, detailing the House policy on per
diem.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, from Groscost, read: ``As in past years, members are
allowed one day of per diem a week between sine die and the
beginning of the next session. Additional per diem is permitted for
any legislative meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayne said Aldridge received special consideration because he
was the most senior member in the GOP caucus, where he had served
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   And Aldridge was legendary for constituent work, Jayne said.
</P>
<P>
   While other members were moved out of their offices for
remodeling during the summer, Aldridge was given a small office for
work. &QL; 
`I DON'T BABY-SIT'
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr Aldridge is famous for his servicing of his district,''
Jayne said. ``He came in very frequently. How long he was here or
how many days a week he came in, I couldn't tell you. I don't
baby-sit members while they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost agreed, pointing out that Aldridge was frequently seen
coming and going from the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually seen him come and go multiple times during the
day, and usually when I talked to him he was going to rehab,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his stroke, Aldridge suffers from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost acknowledged he probably would not do the same thing
again.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he didn't bend any rules for Aldridge. The speaker
sets the policy, he explained. The limitations on per diem were
adopted to limit per diem payments. But he tries to accommodate
members with legitimate requests. &QL; 
`NOT REALLY A RULE'
</P>
<P>
   He cited allowing Rep. Debra Brimhall, R-Snowflake, to collect
mileage for constituent work in her district, which stretches from
Payson to St. Johns. But another member, Rep. John Verkamp,
R-Flagstaff, complained last week that he doesn't receive mileage
payments when he travels his district.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a baby-sitter. I really have no desire to take on the
role. We put the rules out there. When they come up with a good

ALL-STARS PROVE COYOTES RESPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB McManaman  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Respect.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the four players from the Coyotes and their coach
say it means to have five people from the same organization
representing the team in today's NHL All-Star Game at the Ice
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Respect for a 24-11-7 record. Respect for a 14-game unbeaten
streak earlier this season. Respect for a modern-day NHL record for
going 17 straight games without allowing more than two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Respect, after all those years of mediocrity in Winnipeg and two
underachieving seasons in the Valley, for finally being considered
a legitimate contender to win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I definitely still see them as one of the elite teams,
even though they had a bit of a drop-off in the past month,'' said
All-Star Larry Murphy, the veteran defenseman for the Detroit Red
Wings. ``You can't name off a list of the top contenders right now
without including Phoenix. Without a doubt, they have to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   That, perhaps as much as anything, is why left wing Keith
Tkachuk and center Jeremy Roenick are here, skating for the North
American All-Stars. It's why goalie Nikolai Khabibulin and
defenseman Teppo Numminen are here, playing for the World
All-Stars. And it's why Jim Schoenfeld is here, too, where he will
serve as an assistant coach for Tkachuk's and Roenick's squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ``is'' about respect,'' said Tkachuk, who is making his
third straight All-Star appearance. ``And it means a lot. It's a
credit to our whole team. When your team wins, you're going to get
more guys showing up in All-Star Games. The reason we're here is
because of our teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries to Detroit's Steve Yzerman and Uwe Krupp,
the Coyotes and the rival Dallas Stars, whom they are chasing for
first overall in the Western Conference, will have the most players
represented in today's game with four each. The Red Wings, the
two-time defending Cup champions, originally had five.
</P>
<P>
   Respect again. As long as the NHL was handing it out to the
Coyotes, the league topped itself by awarding the long-deserving
Numminen with Krupp's starting spot on the World team. After years
of never getting any, the ``Repo Man'' finally can say he has
something Rodney Dangerfield never gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to everybody, but especially to a guy like Teppo
who never gets any credit, never gets what he deserves,'' Tkachuk,
the Coyotes' captain, said. ``He's probably the person who deserves
the most out of all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Numminen, the first Finnish defenseman to make an All-Star
appearance since the Rangers' Reijo Ruotsalainen in 1986, is just
happy to finally make it here after 11 NHL seasons of steady but
unspectacular play.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then when I found out (Thursday) I was going to be a
starter, it was just icing on the cake,'' said Numminen, who leads
all Phoenix defensemen in scoring with 25 points. ``That just makes
it even more special. I always hoped that someday I'd make it here,
but after being so close for so many years, I didn't really count
on it happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, probably, did Roenick, whose point production had
slipped since 1994, when he made his last All-Star appearance and
became the first Chicago Blackhawks player to ever record three
consecutive 100-point seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But a rededicated and rejuvenated Roenick, who recently turned
29, also has reclaimed respect. With a team-high 42 points, he is
flirting with a 100-point year and easily can be called the
Coyotes' most valuable player to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real special for me, no question,'' Roenick said, as
hordes of reporters closed in on him during Saturday's interview
session. ``I've been through a roller-coaster ride the last couple
of years, and it's real exciting for me to be back in this kind of
atmosphere. It's a great time. I mean, to be among the the best
players in the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``And because of the new format, these are real hard teams to
make nowadays. You've only got 20 North American guys who go, and I
feel very fortunate to be one of them. But to have two guys on this
team, two guys on the World team, plus our coach, that says a lot
for the way our team's performed this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect. Tkachuk, the NHL's prototype power forward, has it.
Otherwise he wouldn't have been named to the All-Star team despite
not being among the top 30 scorers in the league. His 17 goals look
awfully good, however, when considering he's missed 12 games
because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Khabibulin, who in just four NHL seasons is
considered the best Russian-born goalie ever to strap on the pads
at the NHL level. The great Soviet, Tretiak, may have been better,
but he never played in the league. Who knows? In another five
years, when Khabibulin hits his prime _ goalies seem to age well _
maybe the 'Bulin Wall will be among the greatest of his era, not
just among his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Niki's going to have a shutout (today),'' Numminen
boldly predicted. ``He's been playing great for us all year, and
he's going to make it a big win for the World team.''
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin, like each of the other five goalies here, only gets
to play in one period. With Buffalo's Dominik Hasek getting the
start, it's likely that Khabibulin will be asked to close the door
in the final 20 minutes as he did a year ago in an 8-7 victory by
the North Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to make sure Keith and JR don't score on me,''
Khabibulin said. ``I'd never hear the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect? Yeah, to a point. But it almost gets thrown out the
window faster than a fire extinguisher in Nagano when it comes to
the good-natured ribbing between the four Coyotes All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Europeans can't beat us,'' Tkachuk said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Numminen just shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of trash talking going on,'' said Numminen,
who won a bronze medal for Finland at the Winter Olympics last
year. ``But it's going to be the same way it was in Nagano. There
was a lot of talking from those (North Americans) beforehand. But
when the game's over, it's going to be all quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Niki, we're not afraid of Keith and JR. We know them.
We've seen what they can do. Trust me, it's not going to be a tough
game for us. It's going to be an easy win for the World team.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Asked a minute later whom he felt would be named the
game's Most Valuable Player, Numminen replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith Tkachuk.'' &QL;

T'WOLVES BALK; CAMPBELL REMAINS A LAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA _ Elden Campbell, the $49 million reserve center,
is still a Laker this morning, and Tom Gugliotta, the All-Star
power forward, is not.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta signed a six-year, $85 million contract with the
Phoenix Suns on Saturday, ending the Lakers' intense efforts to
unload Campbell and obtain Gugliotta in one transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Timberwolves, Gugliotta's team the last four
years, essentially chose to let him walk away without receiving
compensation rather than take the Lakers' offer of Campbell and
Eddie Jones in a sign-and-trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they had their reasons. Maybe they didn't like
anything we offered,'' Lakers executive Jerry West said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, said Minnesota coach/general manager Flip Saunders.
Saunders said Richard Howell, the agent for both Gugliotta and
Campbell, tried to engineer the sign-and-trade to benefit both his
clients. But Saunders didn't think it benefited the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when the Laker thing was thrown out there, Richard
thought that was a very viable option. That, I think, intrigued
Tommy. But all I think it did was muddy the waters for everybody,''
Saunders said. ``But we were not just going to give something away.
It's January. Christmas is Dec. 25.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, once the Lakers' starting power forward but now simply
an expensive insurance policy on Shaquille O'Neal, has five years
left on a $7 million-a-year contract, with a clause that gives him
an extra 15 percent if he's traded. The Lakers have been eager to
obtain a top-flight forward to complement O'Neal, something
Campbell can't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Howell) wanted to get (Campbell) out of there,''
Saunders said. ``I don't think there was any question. He was
saying (Campbell) was a great fit for us. I told him that is why
he's the agent and I'm the coach and the general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Wolves chose to get nothing for Gugliotta rather than
Campbell and Jones, and the Lakers might have to wait until the
summer to move Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an offer to them that we felt was a fair offer,'' West
said. ``Maybe they didn't like the players.''
</P>
<P>
   West wouldn't confirm Campbell and Jones were the trade bait,
but did say, ``we were interested in making a change that would
have been relatively major on our part,'' seemingly referring to
Jones. ``I don't really know what (the Timberwolves) were doing....
We really didn't hear from them, to be candid with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade deadline is still two months away, and West wouldn't
rule out a deal, though the return package won't likely be as
valuable as Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who said he was ``positive'' he was offered for Gugliotta
and Scottie Pippen, seemed relieved just to have yet another rumor
behind him. But he knows the next one is never far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to even deal with it,'' Jones said. ``Whatever
happens, happens.... I'm a wanted man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Rookie forward Ruben Patterson _ already nicknamed
``Wild Thing II'' by teammates for his aggressive,
borderline-reckless play _ suffered a left thigh bruise in the
Saturday-evening practice when he collided with Corie Blount.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, his knee wrapped, said he was OK and figured to be
back on the court this morning.

Clack, Mihm carry Texas past Oklahoma State
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUSTIN _ Texas entered the season thinking it would rely on its Big
Three.
</P>
<P>
   With forward Nnadubem ``Gabe'' Muoneke sidelined because of a
suspension, the Longhorns entered Saturday night's game against No.
23 Oklahoma State thinking Big Two _ Chris Mihm and Kris Clack, not
to mention Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason and Adrian Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Mason and Peterson totaled 43 points for the Cowboys, but that
was not enough on this night.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm and Clack each had a season-high point total as they
combined for 47 points and 21 rebounds, and Mihm blocked two
potential game-tying 3-points attempts by the Cowboys in the final
10 seconds to preserve a 73-70 Texas win at the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   Texas improved to 6-1 in Big 12 Conference play and moved above
the .500 mark for the second time this season with a 10-9 record.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (13-6, 4-2 in the Big 12) took possession of the
ball with 35.4 seconds left after Ivan Wagner hit two free throws
to give Texas a three-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were patient in working the ball around before
finally getting what appeared to be an open look from Joe Adkins
with about five seconds to play from the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   But the 7-foot Mihm sprang from in the paint to get a piece of
the 6-2 guard's jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins came up with the loose ball, dribbled beyond the 3-point
line and turned to fire. But once again, Mihm was there to swat it
away and give Texas the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was only a couple of seconds left, so I just
jumped as high as I could. I wasn't going to let that last shot get
off,'' Mihm said. ``What can I say? It was a fantastic win. I can't
say enough about the team.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clack (25 points, seven rebounds) and Mihm (22 points, 14
rebounds) leading the way, Texas looked as if it didn't miss its
leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Clack led a Texas charge to the lead early in the second half,
scoring 11 of the Longhorns' points in a 24-10 sprint out of the
dressing room to give Texas its biggest lead of the game, a 59-51
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Texas led 64-59 after William Clay's steal and layup with under
six minutes remaining, but Oklahoma State charged back quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson picked up a three-point play and after Clay missed a
jumper from the right baseline, Adkins dropped in a layup to tie
the score at 64 with five minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   After Wendell Carter was off target on a jumper in the lane,
Peterson drilled a 3-pointer from the left wing to put Oklahoma
State back on top.
</P>
<P>
   Two free throws by Mihm and a power move over Mason by Clack
returned the lead to the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   DeJuan Vazquez hit one of two free throws, and Mason finally got
free for just his second bucket of the half to tie the score at 69.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm scored after an offensive rebound and Adkins managed just
one of two free throws, with the crowd of 12,358 on its feet,
before Wagner's free throws set up the frantic final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in here a lot with Arkansas, and that's the loudest I
have ever heard them,'' Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton said of
the season's largest crowd at the Erwin Center.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State took control of the game in the first half with
an 18-2 run. That allowed the Cowboys to build a 39-28 lead with
1:54 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive dunks by Mihm and Clack got Texas some momentum, and
after a Glendon Alexander inside move for Oklahoma State, Chris
McColpin sent the Longhorns into the locker room with hope with a
3-pointer just before the buzzer to close the gap to six points,
41-35, at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was that we lost an opportunity by not going into
halftime with a bigger lead,'' Sutton said. ``That shot at the
buzzer was huge. And in the second half, it seemed we were always
playing catch-up and couldn't seize the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason was held to just four points in the second half, but
Peterson took up the slack, scoring 13 of his 19 after the break.
</P>
<P>
   But Clack and Mihm were steady throughout, as the Longhorns
bounced back from their first conference loss Monday at Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   And to do it without their leading scorer suspended for throwing
punches during the Kansas game and with just seven players makes it
that much more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people kind of counted us out with the lack of guys we
have and without Gabe,'' Clack said. ``But no matter how many guys
you have or what's the circumstances, you have to go out and play
to the best of your ability.''

TCU STAR EJECTED EARLY IN OVERTIME LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU preseason All-American Lee Nailon's
temper got him ejected 34 seconds into last night's game against
Nevada-Las Vegas and may have gotten him suspended for tomorrow's
game against Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   It also gave his No. 21 Horned Frogs teammates a chance to prove
they could win without him. They almost did it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a Nailon-less TCU team narrowly lost to UNLV, 95-88, in
overtime, despite 41 points from Frogs forward Marquise Gainous.
The loss snapped TCU's 18-game winning streak at Daniel-Meyer
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon was ejected after being whistled for a technical for a
flagrant foul after the referees ruled he struck UNLV guard Mark
Dickel across the face. Dickel said he had attempted to yank the
ball from Nailon's hands after a Horned Frogs turnover when Nailon
turned and struck him.
</P>
<P>
   Replays seemed to indicate that Nailon slapped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he hit me very hard,'' Dickel said. ``It was
just a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Nailon: ``He pushed me, and I lost my temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Nailon had been shoved out of bounds seconds earlier by Rebels
big man Kaspars Kambala, but instead was whistled for stepping out
of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Bill Gracey said that Nailon will be suspended for TCU's
game against Tulsa tomorrow night. ``I am reporting Lee Nailon to
the league because I thought that he threw a punch when there was a
dead ball,'' Gracey told a pool reporter.
</P>
<P>
   When reached at home last night for clarification, Western
Athletic Conference commissioner Karl Benson said: ``If he's
ejected for fighting, he would miss another game. It's an NCAA
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   But Benson said there is a difference between being ejected for
fighting and a flagrant foul, which is what the referees reported
to the scorer's table last night.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said Gracey now will file a game report with WAC
supervisor of officials Bobby Dibler, and a decision on Nailon's
eligibility against Tulsa will be decided on today.
</P>
<P>
   Gracey also said he also plans to mention Horned Frogs coach
Billy Tubbs in his report. He said Tubbs came to the officials
locker room after the game and cursed him.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs declined to comment specifically on Gracey's remarks. He
did comment on Nailon's technical.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had looked at a replay after Nailon's ejection and
said he didn't think Nailon deserved to be ejected much less
suspended. He said Nailon had simply stiff-armed Dickel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been a technical foul, but the guy \RGracey\S that
made nine calls for Vegas and three calls against Vegas saw fit to
kick him out of the ballgame,'' Tubbs said. ``There was no swing.
He didn't swing at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs was unhappy with the officiating all game. There were four
technical fouls called, three against TCU (15-4, 3-2 WAC) and one
against UNLV (11-7, 4-1 WAC). The Frogs went to the free-throw line
25 times compared to 36 times for Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   TCU guards Prince Fowler and Ryan Carroll were in foul trouble
all game. Fowler picked up his fourth with 19:23 remaining in the
game, but he didn't foul out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of our team for fighting against overwhelming
odds, to say the least,'' Tubbs said. ``I thought our guys fought a
gallant fight. We never quit. We never gave up. We were caught a
little shorthanded.''
</P>
<P>
   With Nailon gone and Fowler and Carroll in foul trouble, TCU
trailed 85-75 with 2:34 remaining. The Frogs then went on a
frenetic and fast-paced 10-0 run to close the half and send the
game to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rebels outscored the Frogs 10-3 in overtime to get away
with the victory. ``Yeah, I guess we did,'' Carroll said when asked
if TCU had simply run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   TCU had to rely on players that usually only play limited roles,
like Scott Gradney and Thomas McTyer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite battling flu-like symptoms for almost four weeks,
Gradney played significant minutes in Nailon's spot while Gainous
slipped seamlessly into Nailon's scoring role.
</P>
<P>
   His 41 points surpassed his previous best of 40 and included a
perfect 15-of-15 from the free-throw line. The Rebels were led by
Kambala, who had 29 points without Nailon down low to challenge
him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, TCU almost won behind Gainous and a scrappy effort all
around.
</P>
<P>
   But the order proved to be just a little too tall without
Nailon. Carroll said Nailon didn't have a lot to say after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty quiet,'' Carroll said. ``I think it hit him
being kicked out of the game.''

PEPPERDINE BEATS SAN DIEGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ With everything crumbling _ a 16-point lead, the
momentum of the last two weekends and Pepperdine's standing in the
West Coast Conference _ Tommie Prince stationed at the foul line
wasn't a soothing sight.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he stood there was 1998. Six full games had
lapsed, and most of the seventh, and his new technique remained
untested. Not to mention he's a 43 percent free throw shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Money on the first. Money on the second.
</P>
<P>
   The shots came with 11 seconds left and cushioned the Waves'
two-point lead. Pepperdine went on to win 62-58 over San Diego in
front of 2,322 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I can't even recall the last time I shot free throws,''
Prince said. ``But my motto now is `Don't be afraid to fail.' So I
went up with confidence, and at least gave myself a chance to make
them. And I just changed my stance in practice about three weeks
ago so I can keep my balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's fourth straight win pushed the Waves (14-7, 5-1
WCC) two games ahead of the logjam at third place in the league,
though they remained a game back of first-place Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   However, the next two weeks are pivotal in the Waves' push
toward the top. They host San Diego and St. Mary's next week and
then have a home-and-home with Loyola Marymount.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to win the conference title, you must win on the
road,'' Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar said. ``That's why this was
important.''
</P>
<P>
   While Prince eased his mind about his free throws, the Waves
figured out they could win without point guard Jelani Gardner
playing well. Or even average.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was averaging 19.8 points per game in conference play,
which is why Lamont Smith and Andre Laws were charged with denying
Gardner the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lamont and Andre did a credible job, but the rest of us needed
to play a full game,'' San Diego coach Brad Holland said. ``We did
a good job on him, but we didn't do a good job on the rest of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner labored through a 3 of 10 shooting performance and
finished with seven points, four assists and four turnovers.
Indeed, a frustrating evening.
</P>
<P>
   But it was guard Dana White who got inside Gardner's head,
drawing a technical foul during a stoppage in play when Gardner
pushed him in the face with a forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the key to the game, that they did a good job
against Jelani and we were still able to go to some other people,''
Romar said. ``Any time you can win a game without one of your best
players (playing well), it always gives you a boost, an edge
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   The two players who benefited most from the extra attention paid
Gardner were Prince and Nick Sheppard. Prince scored 10 points
while Sheppard unveiled a strong low post game.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard, a sophomore center who transferred from Louisiana
State, scored 10 of his 11 points in the first half. Six of those
came in succession on a pair of post moves and a jumper which
helped Pepperdine build a 33-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just me coming back and getting in shape since I
was out last year for the whole season,'' Sheppard said. ``It's a
tough transition for me, but it's coming back slowly. It's me being
aggressive. I feel a lot more comfortable in the post.''
</P>
<P>
   In an extension of the first half, Pepperdine scored eight
straight points and pushed its lead to 49-33 with 10:34 to play,
which is when San Diego (12-6, 3-3) finally displayed fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Toreros, whose biggest run in the first half was four
points, answered with 11 straight. San Diego pulled within 60-58
when Brock Jacobsen (13 points) banked in a 3-pointer with 44
seconds left before Prince was sent to the foul line for the first
time since Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was going to knock them down, and I say that because
he can,'' said a smiling Sheppard, speaking with Prince listening
in. ``We shoot them all the time in practice. I knew it.''

 &HT;    Swann a memorable figure in playoffs _ but will Hall of Fame
open doors to him?
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The appropriately named Lynn Swann was often
called a Nureyev in football shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Many consider the former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver the
most graceful player in NFL history. He once studied ballet to help
his footwork on the gridiron, and his soaring, acrobatic catches _
many in the spotlight of the Super Bowl _ will live for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody who bleeds blue and silver will ever forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, Cowboy fans tell me how much they hurt when we
beat them in the Super Bowl,'' said Swann, now 46. ``I just say
thank you. The people don't mean any disrespect. On the contrary,
they are very respectful. They're great fans who just happen to
remember Super Bowls X and XIII.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann lived for the games with the Roman numerals. The big
moment. During his distinguished nine-year career, Swann saved his
biggest days for the biggest stage.
</P>
<P>
   His four-catch, 161-yard afternoon in Super Bowl X _ a 21-17
decision over the Cowboys on Jan. 18, 1976 _ has been judged the
best individual performance in a title game by the Austin
American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, who caught one touchdown pass in Super Bowl X, also is
listed as one of the two best receivers in the Super Bowl, joining
San Francisco's Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For different reasons, every Super Bowl I played in was
special to me,'' said Swann, who played in four. ``For a lot of
people in Pittsburgh, Super Bow IX was the most important because
it was our first, and it marked the beginning of the Steelers'
dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh won its first Lombardi Trophy, 16-6, over luckless
Minnesota, which is 0-4 in the NFL's showcase event. Swann did not
catch a pass in that victory _ he doesn't recall Terry Bradshaw
throwing in his direction _ but that emphasized why the Steelers
were so good between 1975 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers beat teams with a variety of weapons. Bradshaw
threw to Swann and John Stallworth. Franco Harris ran behind a line
that featured center Mike Webster. Pittsburgh earned its Steel
Curtain nickname on defense, where Joe Greene, Jack Lambert and
Jack Ham resided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take our team and match them against anyone who ever
played,'' Swann said.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Swann has not been afforded the ultimate reward for a
pro football player _ induction into the Hall of Fame. The former
Southern California Trojan has been eligible since 1987, but the
votes keep falling short. The class of 1999 will be announced
before next week's Super Bowl, and once again Swann is a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And probably a bridesmaid again.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that Swann's career statistics were not good
enough. Playing on a team that stressed a ground attack, Swann
finished his career with good but not eye-popping numbers _ 336
catches, 5,462 yards, 51 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Jerry Rice has more than 1,000 career catches.
Art Monk had 940. Steve Largent caught 819.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Swann suggests that football records are deceiving. He
played in an era that did not emphasize passing offenses. In recent
years the NFL has relaxed rules for receivers, who no longer can be
bumped when they are 5 yards beyond the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, Swann's career was not defined by numbers.
</P>
<P>
   He was a man of big plays. His sprawling catch at midfield
against Dallas cornerback Mark Washington in Super Bowl X remains
one of the Super Bowl's best highlight moments. He established
himself as a big-game player by scoring touchdowns in Super Bowl X,
XIII and XIV to help the Steelers become an NFL dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame might never invite Swann to be a member, but no
one can take away his place in football history. With 364 yards in
the Super Bowl, he ranks second to Rice's 512. He is one of four
receivers to catch at least three career touchdown passes in the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys just happened to offer the backdrop to
Swann's best moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the think the Cowboys defined who I was,'' Swann
said this week. ``I could have had those games against Minnesota,
the Rams, or another team. People just have a tendency to remember
the Dallas games.''

 &HT;    NFL Experience opens in Miami
 &HT;    (ATTN: Florida editors)
 &HT;    By Dan Mann
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They tell youngsters, 'If you're not
fast enough, big enough or just plain talented enough to make it to
the National Football League, practice long snapping,' because bad
snaps have decided plenty of big games.
</P>
<P>
   At the NFL Experience, you can test your skills at the most
perplexing of football tasks, then watch most of your peers not
only miss the holder's target but miss the life-size cardboard
holder as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Zachery Link, 10, from Plantation, Fla., who normally throws
touchdown passes at will in the games he plays at the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bend over and look back at the guy standing there, and it
doesn't look any harder than throwing a football,'' Link said.
``But I wasn't even close. The other team would have scored a
touchdown on my snap.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Barbara, his mother: ``He was sure cocky before he stepped
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The long snap is only one of the skills areas at NFL Experience,
which started Friday and continues through Sunday at Pro Player
Stadium, then starts again Thursday continuing through Jan. 31, the
day of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The real story of NFL Experience, though, may be behind the
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   For the seventh straight year, NFL Experience will put $1
million toward the building of an NFL/Youth Education Town near the
site of the Super Bowl. NFL/YETs are community facilities designed
to improve the life skills of at-risk kids.
</P>
<P>
   It started at Super Bowl XXVII in Los Angeles with the vision of
Neil Austrian, the president of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   He saw the Super Bowl as an event that used its host city for
what it needed then left. Austrian wanted to change that, building
a legacy for communities that hosted the game.
</P>
<P>
   At Super Bowl XXVII, the $1 million from the NFL Experience plus
proceeds from two Garth Brooks concerts, the United Way of Los
Angeles and other large corporations led to an NFL/YET in Compton,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Next was Atlanta, then, after Super Bowl XXIX in Miami, an
NFL/YET was built in Liberty City. Dade County Parks and Recreation
and the United Way of Miami were major players in establishing the
center.
</P>
<P>
   This year's NFL/YET will be built at what is now the Boys and
Girls Club of Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Janine Robinson, executive director of the NFL/YET in Liberty
City and acting executive director of the South Florida Super Bowl
Foundation, calls the Liberty City YET ``one of the biggest
public/private partnerships around, a model for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty City YET, at Gwen Cherry Park near the James E.
Scott Housing Project, is a 23,000 square-foot facility that
includes a 9,000 square-foot gym, computer labs and a library.
Teachers are always there to help after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the local community to have a sense of ownership,''
Robinson said. ``Studies have shown that the kids at the center
have improved attendance and better grades. They're so well
behaved, such a great group of kids. They're eager to show you what
they're doing. You see a lot of self confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate this expression, but when you go out there, talk about
the warm fuzzies.''
</P>
<P>
   Interactive experience: Other skills to participate in at the
NFL Experience include the quarterback challenge, with
sensor-driven targets; the fair catch, where participants try
catching a ball launched to the height of a punt out of an
automated machine; and training camp, a football-oriented obstacle
course including ropes, a maze of cones and a finish where
participants dive for a touchdown over a line of inflatable
players.
</P>
<P>
   Other attractions include the card show, with 150 exhibits, many
licensed by the NFL, and the throwbacks exhibit, with items on loan
from the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

 &HT;    Wife of former hostage keeps veterans issues, husband's memory
at forefront
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ She remembers thinking, ``I can't let them
know I'm Jewish. I've got to tell my father in Delray Beach, Fla.
to be `not Jewish' too.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been nearly 11 years since Robin Higgins, Florida's
incoming executive director of veterans affairs, learned her
husband, Marine Lt. Col. William R. ``Rich'' Higgins, had been
kidnapped in Lebanon. She was a Marine officer in the Pentagon
press office. He was serving as a U.N. peacekeeper. The Islamic
Hezbollah group snatched him off the street, accusing him of being
a spy for the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   During his 17 months of captivity, she buttoned up her distress
under a uniform. She also hid something else _ her religion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her efforts, and though other hostages _ including
Associated Press reporter Terry Anderson and Anglican Church
emissary Terry Waite _ were eventually released, Rich Higgins' body
was dumped on a Beirut street.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 48, Robin Higgins is preparing for a new mission: to
make sure Florida's 1.7 million veterans get the federal benefits
they deserve. On Tuesday the Cabinet is expected to approve her
nomination by Gov. Jeb Bush as executive director of the Florida
Department of Veterans Affairs at a salary of about $105,000. Part
of her job will take her to Washington to lobby on behalf of the
state's veterans. Florida has the largest concentration of severely
disabled vets in the country. The state agency has a budget of $15
million and 400 employees.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, the memory of her husband is never far away, a
reminder of the risks soldiers, even those wearing blue U.N.
berets, face. On April 24 she will commission a Navy destroyer
named for him in Fort Lauderdale. And she has written a book,
Patriot Dreams, about her experiences to be published March 15 by
Marine Corps Associates, a nonprofit group that provides insurance
and other benefits to Marines.
</P>
<P>
   A petite woman with short hair and a crisp, professional air,
Higgins' voice never quavers as she discusses, in the living room
of her Tallahassee home, some painful moments. Mastery of emotion
is elemental for a Marine.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family say you have to look for subtler clues _ a
certain look in the eye, a way of holding her head _ to know what
she's really feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if closure is the right word,'' she said. ``It's
a different chapter. I began to realize there was not much more I
could do for Rich. I looked for a reason why these things were
happening. And I realized I could reach out to other people and try
to bring some good.''
</P>
<P>
   The book will be sold in military-base bookshops and via the
Internet. Even if it never makes her a dime, she said, the act of
writing it helped her free some long-bottled-up feelings about the
experience _ including her most unguarded criticism to date of the
way her husband's case was handled by the U.S. government and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I was concerned, the U.N. was a major obstacle to
obtaining Rich's release,'' Higgins wrote in a draft of the book.
``They were forever vague, equivocal, and ambivalent about Rich's
status, their responsibility, and how to get him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts to free Rich Higgins included face-to-face meetings
with former President Bush and United Nations Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar, whom she found sympathetic. But the U.S.
government said it was the U.N.'s jurisdiction. U.N. officials
passed a resolution condemning the kidnapping but said they could
not act more forcefully without risking the lives of other
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department also missed chances to bargain for her
husband, she concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my trust in the American government,'' she said in an
interview. ``Maybe I shouldn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said she is sure her husband was no spy, though he had
once served as a high-ranking aide to Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger. But she does question putting American soldiers under
the U.N. banner in so-called peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have peacekeeping if you don't have peace to keep,''
she said. ``If Rich were here participating in this conversation,
he might disagree with me. He believed very passionately in the
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, they were an unlikely match. He was a Vietnam
veteran, recipient of a Bronze Star, a Republican from a Protestant
Kentucky background. She was from a Jewish family, all Democrats,
from Long Island. She joined the Marines when English-teaching jobs
ran short, becoming one of only 11 Jewish female officers at that
time out of more than 17,000 total officers in the corps.
</P>
<P>
   They met stateside and were married in 1977, though postings
occasionally made them live apart.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins learned her husband had been kidnapped on the morning of
Feb. 17, 1988. He had been taken from his U.N. vehicle on the
street. She received the news of his kidnapping at a Pentagon
briefing from an official who did not realize she was the captive's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a problem,'' her Pentagon press office boss, Dan
Howard, said. ``A Marine lieutenant colonel working with the U.N.
was just taken hostage in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was the only one who fit that description.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some form of out-of-body experience,'' she wrote. ``My
consciousness was transported to Lebanon for a moment. I could see
what I was doing and I could hear what I was thinking. A part of me
was shouting, this can't be happening! Another part of me said more
gently, we knew this could happen. It's real. Deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her religion suddenly became a security issue. Down came the
mezuzah the prayer scroll affixed to her door post. In Delray
Beach, her father stopped going to temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragic irony,'' she reflected, ``was that the one thing
besides my husband that meant the most to me, that made me who I am
_ my faith _ could in fact be the single most damaging piece of
information which could fall into the enemy's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it did not matter. Seventeen months later, she would
see the grainy image, shown on TV worldwide, of a man hanging from
a rope.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials could not be entirely sure it was her husband.
But in her heart, she knew. The return months later of his body _
positively identified as his by medical experts _ confirmed the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it: My daughter became the first woman to see her
husband hanging on national TV,'' said her father, Norman Ross, 75.
He is divorced from her mother, who lives out West. ``Robin is a
very private person. Being in the limelight was very difficult for
her. In the book, she actually revealed more of herself than I had
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she talked with Ross Perot about private rescue
efforts, the tape of the hanging was released.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to her trust-the-government approach was the very
public denunciation of U.S. and U.N. inaction by Peggy Say, sister
of hostage Terry Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins found Say ``strident'' at times, but later wondered
whether she was doing the right thing by avoiding the spotlight
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered if my own lack of visibility was hurting Rich's
chances for freedom,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS correspondent David Martin recalled, ``I inadvertently
walked in on Robin as she was being comforted in a fourth floor
office of the Pentagon. She had her head in her hands and was
weeping . . . It was the only time I saw Robin cry . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   At one low moment, Higgins wrote in her diary, ``Rich, if I have
to go on living like this _ I can see myself committing suicide.
Really. What an intense, amazing feeling of sadness and
loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   In moments of despair, she said, she was lifted by letters and
e-mails from men and women in uniform who told her they were
inspired by her.
</P>
<P>
   Now she hopes to return that favor in some measure, by helping
Florida's veterans get their due.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers a prayer from Yom Kippur's Kol Nidre service, and
a time when she was forced to pretend she did not know it: ``Help
us to understand that injustices and hate will not forever afflict
the human race; that righteousness and mercy will triumph in the
end.''

 &HT;    Open spaces to receive added protection, if Congress approves
plan
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 COX News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Flower Garden Banks, a federal marine
sanctuary 110 miles off the Texas coast in the Gulf of Mexico, is
home to the northernmost coral reefs in the United States. Manta
rays and loggerhead turtles cruise the shallow waters.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary is surrounded by oil and natural gas development.
Last summer, a swath was cut through one of the reefs, apparently
by a barge's tow chain. The incident illustrates the fragile nature
of the reefs, which are underwater layers of stony skeletons
secreted by invertebrate animals.
</P>
<P>
   A $1 billion conservation proposal announced by President
Clinton _ and reiterated in his State of the Union speech last week
_ includes $29 million to expand and protect the nation's marine
sanctuaries, more than twice the current budget for the
sanctuaries. That would allow the Commerce Department's National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the Flower
Garden Banks, to restore coral damaged in future shipping accidents
and commission genetic research and other studies by scientists at
Texas A&AMP;M University and the University of Texas. The sanctuary's
current budget is $249,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic,'' Shelley Du Puy, acting manager of the Flower
Garden Banks, said from her office in Bryan, Texas. ``This would
allow us to develop the staff power to do some of the things on our
wish list to protect our sanctuaries.''
</P>
<P>
   If approved by Congress, the president's plan would be the
federal government's largest outlay for acquisition and protection
of public lands in a single year. Current spending is $350 million.
Besides benefiting marine sanctuaries along the nation's coasts,
the program would provide money for federal, state and local
acquisition of river corridors, parks, forests, wildlife refuges,
wetlands and other open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Texas potentially could benefit handsomely, Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt said during a recent visit to Austin. For example,
more money would be available to buy land for two habitat preserves
for endangered songbirds in the Austin area, the Balcones
Canyonlands Preserve and the Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife
Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   In South Texas, the Lower Rio Grande National Wildlife Refuge
and the Padre Island National Seashore would get money for more
land. Greenbelt protection along the Trinity River in Dallas could
be enhanced. Money could be available for revitalizing urban
waterfronts and ports along the Texas Gulf Coast. And much of Big
Bend National Park in West Texas would be designated wilderness,
ruling out road construction and other development.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, land would be set aside to protect New England
forests, Florida's Everglades and the route along the Missouri
River followed by Lewis and Clark.
</P>
<P>
   A related anti-sprawl proposal, announced last week by Vice
President Al Gore, would use $700 million in tax credits to
generate $9.5 billion in bond authority that would allow state and
local governments to preserve green space and water quality in
cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interestingly enough, I'm quite optimistic'' about the
prospects for congressional approval, Babbitt said of the
initiatives. ``The open space issues have really caught fire in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The interior secretary cited Austin as a prime example. City
voters last year approved $65 million in bond money to protect the
Barton Springs watershed, nearly $9 million to protect other
watersheds and $40 million for east-side parks and greenbelts. No
other city in Texas has done so much to protect natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Sansom, executive director of the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department, said he is encouraged by growing support from
Republicans and Democrats in Congress for land conservation.
Bipartisan bills last year would have increased land conservation
spending to $900 million. Similar legislation is expected to be
introduced this year along with Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most important conservation legislation probably of
the decade,'' Sansom said.
</P>
<P>
   Land-protection money would come from a little-known trust
account, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which receives a
share of offshore oil and gas revenues. The fund was established in
1964 under the premise that the government would use proceeds from
the sale of one nonrenewable natural resource, offshore energy
reserves, to buy another, land.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, Congress has never appropriated as much as $900
million a year, the amount originally authorized. The balance has
gone to the Treasury to offset the deficit and to finance other
government programs. Clinton wants to make the $1 billion he has
proposed for the fiscal year beginning in October a guaranteed
annual expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   How would a sizable boost in conservation spending play
politically in Texas? In the capital city, Mayor Kirk Watson is
eager for federal aid to fuel Austin's Smart Growth initiatives,
which are intended to encourage development downtown and to the
east while protecting environmentally sensitive land, especially to
the west.
</P>
<P>
   The state as a whole has traditionally favored private property
ownership and a light regulatory touch on development. About 97
percent of the land in Texas is privately owned. In some rural
counties, opposition to converting private land to public ownership
runs strong, in part because this takes property off tax rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Land conservation and sprawl control have not been top-drawer
issues for Gov. George W. Bush, who is considering a run for
president and whose Democratic opponent might well be Gore. The
governor has been cool to Austin's efforts to shape land use,
having signed several bills that sharply restricted the city's
regulatory powers. On the other hand, Bush sponsored a resolution
at the Western Governors' Association in June 1997calling for
increased appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund
as well as a boost in the states' share of outlays from the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush supports the concept of the federal government
sending funds to Texas to use for parks and conservation,'' said
Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush. ``However, he is leery of
any federal program that may have strings attached. So we're
withholding judgment until we see the details of the proposal.''

 &HT;    Chronology of the Heep battle
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1959: Herman Heep establishes trusts for his descendants worth
$14.7 million in 1959 dollars, plus a 5,000-acre ranch in southern
Travis County.
</P>
<P>
   1960: Herman Heep dies.
</P>
<P>
   1985: Hatsy Heep Shaffer, Heep's granddaughter, sues the
trustees, the Vincent and Elkins law firm and her stepgrandmother,
Minnie Bell Heep, Herman Heep's widow. Shaffer contends they have
mismanaged the trusts.
</P>
<P>
   1986: The original trustees resign and NCNB Texas National
Bank-Austin takes over.
</P>
<P>
   1990: Austin Trust Co. wins from the family the right to
administer the trusts.
</P>
<P>
   1990: Shaffer and her sister,Kathleen Henderson, file for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming legal fees from the fight over the
estate have drained all their assets.
</P>
<P>
   1991: Vincent and Elkins settles the 1985 lawsuit brought by
Shaffer for $14 million, which goes into the trusts.
</P>
<P>
   1991: John and Janet Girardi sue Shaffer, contending she didn't
pay them for a $1.8 million house in Virginia that they say she
signed a contract to buy. The court awards them $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   1992: Kathleen Viesca, the legal guardian of Mary Lou Heep
Henderson, Heep's daughter, files suit on Henderson's behalf
against the trusts and Henderson's three daughters. Viesca contends
that Henderson, who had been declared mentally incompetent, is
entitled to a greater share. Shaffer countersues, alleging that
Viesca wanted a larger distribution for Henderson because Viesca
took a percentage in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   1992: Shaffer sues Austin Trust Co., contending it played
favorites with distributions from the trusts, giving Betsy Urban,
Shaffer's sister, more than Shaffer or her sister Kathleen
Henderson. Her suit also alleges mismanagement of the trusts
through poor investments.
</P>
<P>
   1993: Austin Trust Co. resigns. Travis County Probate Judge Guy
Herman appoints Bank One as trustee but gives it immunity from
lawsuits because the court will make all decisions on disbursements
from the fund. Austin Trust Co. settles the lawsuit for $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   1993: Jerry Frank Jones, the court-appointed attorney for
Shaffer's minor children, files suit against Shaffer, contending
she has not properly set aside money for them. Shaffer later
settles this lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   1995: Shaffer declares bankruptcy again, claiming attorney fees
and the lack of money from the trusts left her destitute.
</P>
<P>
   1998: Mary Lou Heep Henderson dies, and the trusts technically
dissolve. The probate court works to distribute the money and land
to Henderson's three daughters. Probate Judge Herman rules that
Shaffer's share in the Heep ranch can be sold to pay off her debt
to the Girardis.

 &HT;    Family battles over oilman's legacy
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Herman Heep, wisecracking, straight-talking
millionaire oilman, insisted that anyone who came out to his
5,000-acre ranch in southern Travis County call him Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Heep, who could have walked right off the set of ``Giant,'' was
as hospitable as he was quick-witted and sharp-tongued.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why, at the height of his wealth in the early
1950s, the man known for driving through his oil fields in his
shiny new Cadillac convertible had friends that included the lowest
of ranch hands and the most powerful of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   He was what Texans like best: a character who worked hard and
played just as hard.
</P>
<P>
   Heep's strong and willful spirit has reached down through two
generations and is playing itself out in a quintessential Texas
family saga involving his three granddaughters, who have spent the
past 30 years fighting each other over his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The saga could end this year in a Travis County court, where the
family trusts are being dissolved and what's left of the money is
being divided among Heep's heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Before he died in 1960, Heep amassed a fortune worth somewhere
near $50 million in today's dollars from oil, ranching and other
ventures. What's left today is the 5,000 acres of prime undeveloped
land near Onion Creek and $4 million remaining from trust funds
that amounted to $20 million in 1989. Lawyers have received
millions from the funds in legal fees as family members sued each
other, attorneys and business associates. Always at the center of
the fight has been Heep's eldest granddaughter, Hatsy Heep Shaffer,
who, perhaps more than anyone, carries on the blustering spirit of
her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer is now engaged in her toughest battle of all, fighting
in an Austin court to keep her share of Heep Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters in litigation
</P>
<P>
   Hatsy Heep Shaffer, 51, sits at a table in the stone-tiled lobby
of the Four Seasons hotel. It is December 1998, almost four decades
after Herman Heep died of liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer has one cell phone to her ear, another on her lap, a
table stacked high with legal binders and faxes. She has a shock of
short blond hair and amber eyes that flash like those of a lioness
stalking her prey.
</P>
<P>
   Through the cell phone, Shaffer barks commands to the latest
attorney in the army of lawyers she's hired and discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer, who lives in New Orleans, is determined to stave off
attorneys seeking to use her share of the ranch to pay off debts
they say she owes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't seem to understand they don't have 'Heep' in
their name,'' she says of the lawyers seeking to disinherit her.
With the death of their mother in May, the remaining money in the
trusts and the ranch are to be divided among Herman Heep's three
granddaughters _ Shaffer and her two younger half-sisters, Betsy
Urban of Dallas and Kathleen Henderson of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get Shaffer started talking about her half-sisters, who
she says have tried to deprive her of her birthright. They declined
to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for her sisters, however, have questioned in court
Shaffer's mental competence. They say she is unusually litigious,
as evidenced by the number of court cases she's initiated over 30
years _ about a dozen lawsuits, plus bankruptcy and several
divorces.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer has sued two fund trustees, her mother's legal guardian,
her sisters and a Houston law firm. She, in turn, has been sued by
her children, her mother's legal guardian and a Virginia couple
that contends she owes them $1 million for a house she bought but
never paid for. (Shaffer says she never set foot in the house
except to tour it and that her name on the contract is a forgery.)
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer moved to Richmond, Va., to get away from the fighting,
she said. But even there, she found herself at the center of
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   She took on Big Tobacco as a star witness in a 1996 class-action
lawsuit against Phillip Morris, providing research papers
indicating the company knew nicotine was addictive and manipulated
the amount of it in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The short version of the story is that her then-fiance was a
former Phillip Morris executive who filled her basement with boxes
of research papers. When the relationship went sour, she kicked him
out, then marched down to the attorneys' offices and turned over a
truckload of papers.
</P>
<P>
   For her troubles, Shaffer says she was practically run out of
town by Phillip Morris supporters.
</P>
<P>
   She challenges anyone to question her mental competence. She
says two psychiatrists have signed sworn affidavits attesting to
her sanity. She used those affidavits to fight a judge's rulingthat
she was incompetent and couldn't manage her financial or legal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and ask to see the papers. She'll be happy to show you.
</P>
<P>
   Then she'll laugh, shrug and blast her naysayers with language
that can make the most thick-skinned lawyer blush.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer has sent more than one attorney scurrying for cover. One
lawyer is reported to have said after she swept out of his office,
``Lord help us, Herman Heep has come back as a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer takes this as a compliment. The misfit of the family
Drama and controversy have followed Shaffer since her birth. She
was the first daughter of Mary Lou Heep Henderson, Herman Heep's
only child, who was not married at the time. Shaffer's mother later
married John Henderson, the father of her younger half-sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer was the misfit, a tall, fair-haired girl (now 6 feet in
heels) who looked nothing like her darker-haired, shorter
half-sisters. She recalls a close relationship with her mother and
grandfather (Granddaddy, she called him). She left the family ranch
before she reached her teen years to attend boarding school in
France.
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, she blew off a chunk of the ranch-house porch with a
double-barreled shotgun while trying to shoot an armadillo. ``Every
Texas girl who grew up on a ranch knows how to shoot a
double-barreled shotgun,'' she says breezily.
</P>
<P>
   Granddaddy clapped her on the shoulder, laughed and said,
``Don't worry about a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He scooped her up, and they went for a daylong drive in his
Cadillac, top down, that ended with a jaunt along the dirt roads in
his oil fields in Conroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herman Heep was affluent, influential, gregarious. . . . He
was a man's man,'' said William J. Murray Jr., 83.
</P>
<P>
   Murray served on the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates
the oil industry, between 1948 and 1963, the period when Heep was
most prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   Heep was a classic wildcatter, going out with only a drill rig
and a bit of determination. Oil and gas provided his third fortune.
He acquired his first when he married the daughter of a wealthy
rancher from South Texas. His second came from extensive
real-estate investments.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch was originally 870 acres, dating back to the 1820s
when the Heeps came to settle on part of Stephen F. Austin's
original land grant. Today, the ranch house sits vacant, a far cry
from its heyday in the '50s, when Herman Heep would invite Texas'
elite and powerful, including Lyndon B. Johnson, to visit for dove
hunting and socializing. The land surrounding the house is leased
for ranching.
</P>
<P>
   Murray remembers Heep as a generous man but one with a stubborn
streak and the tenacity of a bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   That lingering cantankerous spirit is what family members and
others say has made splitting his fortune such a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Tale told in court files
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best thing that my family could do is go out and
get a damn job,'' says Kevin Shires, 28, Shaffer's second-eldest
son and a lawyer in Birmingham, Ala. ``None of the sisters work.
They have plenty of time to sit around and grumble and moan. If
they had a job, they'd have better things to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   Shires, who has a touch-and-go relationship with his mother,
says his earliest memories are of her ranting about her sisters and
the trusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not healthy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the second floor of the Travis County courthouse and ask
for the file for probate case No. 60,451-A, and the clerk will roll
it out on a cart, 10 files6 inches thick, representing the pastnine
years of bickering over the Heep trusts. The file will tell you
that a dozen attorneys earned millions in fees. You'll find tales
of children suing mothers and sisters suing sisters and lawyers
suing lawyers over money and who has more right to it.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer sued two previous trustees over claims of mismanagement.
One of those lawsuits netted a $14 million settlement for the
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Case file 60,451-A begins with the matriarch of the family, Mary
Lou Heep Henderson, suing her daughters for a larger share of the
trust. She wins the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two of Shaffer's five children sue her, through their
court-appointed attorney, claiming she had spent their share of the
trust. Shaffer settles the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Next, there's a campaign to find Shaffer incompetent, appoint
her a legal guardian, then spin off her share of the trust into a
separate fund so her sisters will be free from the cycle of
litigation. The plan is thwarted by the Internal Revenue Service,
which notified the court that such a move would mean an enormous
increase in taxes that all trust beneficiaries would have to share.
Message in a pin Shaffer is convinced that the attorneys and the
judge conspired to disinherit her, and she has said as much in
court, accusing every attorney in sight of being nothing more than
a ``pig at the trough.'' She wears a gold pig pin on her lapel
whenever she goes to the courthouse, a reminder to everyone who
doesn't remember how much she dislikes lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, of course, contend it's not their fault that the
Heeps have a propensity to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most expensive and damaging way to solve a trust issue is
to litigate it,'' said Frank Ikard, who represented Betsy Urban's
two children when they were minors. ``In the Heep case, you've got
people with an unusual willingness to fight every way possible and
especially willing to litigate. That's what leads to expensive
fees.'' Much of Shaffer's share of the trust has gone to pay for
legal fees approved by Probate Judge Guy Herman. Shaffer,
meanwhile, has declared bankruptcy. She said she was nearly
destitute at one point. That was before she met her current
husband, David Shaffer, a retired businessman who has helped pay
some of her legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   She has been cited by the court for refusing to respond to legal
notices for hearings. Shaffer vehemently denies this, saying court
officials deliberately sent her notices to a disconnected fax
number and then blamed her when she did not receive them.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Shaffer petitioned the court to have the trust pay
for her travel costs to Austin because she could not afford the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   When Judge Herman agreed, Shaffer submitted a $5,500 bill,
including airfare and rooms and meals at the Four Seasons. The bill
was double what her sisters spent.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer is unapologetic; she says her sisters have received $7
million more than she has in trust distributions over the years.
</P>
<P>
   By summer, the Heep trusts should be dissolved, with each sister
taking her share. A court-appointed auditor is figuring out just
how much each sister will be owed, based upon how much each has
already gotten from the trusts.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer and her accountant contend she is at least $7 million
behind her sisters. The court, in preliminary reports, has ruled
that her share of the ranch is worth $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer's half-sisters would like to see the land developed.
Shaffer has withheld her approval on several ventures, including
transforming the 5,000 acres into a subdivision with a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, Shaffer has talked for the first time of
selling her share and walking away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so over these people,'' she says. ``I am so over them.''
</P>
<P>
   She can't say exactly how Granddaddy would take all this
fighting over the estate he believed would take care of the Heep
family for generations. She knows he believed in a work ethic, that
despite the army of servants around the ranch, every granddaughter
learned how to make her own bed in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer says she's only tried to protect the family's interests
from the dozens of lawyers and ``snake-oil Sams'' she says would
suck the trusts dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granddaddy was hell on wheels,'' Shaffer said, shaking her
head, remembering the man who loved his Scotch and would race down
the dirt roads in his Caddy. ``He wouldn't have wanted the courts
to be parceling up his land. He would have something to say about
it. But he's not here, and I am, so I'm the one that has to speak
up.''

 &HT;    Say hello to Super Mario
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Mario Elie recites his credentials as if he
needs to interview for a job he already has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a driver. I can shoot the ball. I play defense. I play
with a lot of heart,'' said Elie, one of five new players likely to
begin the season on the San Antonio Spurs' roster. ``A guy who is
going to bust his butt every night, a guy who is not afraid to
guard a good (player). A guy who's not afraid to hit the big
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs believe that at age 35, Elie, signed as a free agent,
can still provide those skills and attributes to a team that is
working toward becoming a contender for the NBA championship as the
post-Jordan era begins.
</P>
<P>
   Elie, a 6-foot-5-inch, 210-pound small forward and shooting
guard, has always been more valuable than his statistics might
indicate. Though Elie has averaged a modest 9.1 points and 2.7
rebounds during an eight-year NBA career, it was only a few seasons
ago that Houston's Charles Barkley anointed Elie the most valuable
player on the Rockets. Barkley, never given to playing great
defense, was glad that someone on the aging Rockets had the
proclivity for it, happy that someone was still willing to get his
hands dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Elie has usually been one of those players who performs whatever
jobs are necessary for his team to win. During five seasons with
the Rockets he usually was given the tough defensive assignments
against guards and forwards. A 36-percent shooter from three-point
range during his career, Elie made 10 of 19 during the 1994 and '95
NBA Finals that the Rockets won. His 52.6-percent accuracy is
second-highest in finals history. It was Elie's three-pointer with
7.1 seconds left in game seven of the 1995 Western Conference
semifinals that enabled the Rockets to defeat Phoenix 115-114.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Spurs point guard Avery Johnson put the hard sell on
Elie while they worked out together in Houston during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who I believe, in the seventh game or the sixth
game of a series, if he's wide open for a three-pointer, he's gonna
make eight out of 10 of them,'' Johnson said. ``I told him he's
gonna shoot a lot of wide-open threes.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie said he does not expect to have a place in the starting
lineup. He sees himself as a backup to Sean Elliott at small
forward and Jaren Jackson at shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, those positions might not be secured. Elliott missed
more than half the Spurs' games the last two seasons because of
surgery to both knees. Even before Elliott's injury last season, he
was unhappy with his diminished role on offense. Elliott, for
several years the No. 2 option on offense behind David Robinson,
was moved down a rung when rookie Tim Duncan joined the team.
Elliott averaged 9.3 points per game and shot 40.3 percent, both
career-lows.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson started 45 games last season, about 45 more than he
probably expected. The Spurs were his eighth NBA team in as many
years in the league. During most of those seasons he shuttled
between the NBA and the minor leagues, playing on four CBA teams.
Last season, Jackson averaged 8.8 points and led the Spurs with
37.7-percent accuracy on three-point shots. But he missed open
three-pointers with a chance to win two playoff games that the
Spurs lost, the type of shots Elie has made.
</P>
<P>
   Elie has at least one thing in common with Jackson _ a
circuitous route to the NBA. Elie spent six years climbing his way
to the league, arriving at age 27. His road to the big time
included stops in the CBA and two other minor leagues. He played
for teams in Portugal, Argentina and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was the fourth NBA team for whom Elie played. When the
Rockets, the league's oldest team last season, decided to become
younger, Elie no longer fit in their plans. San Antonio seemed like
a good next stop to him. ``It's close to home,'' Elie said.
``There's no state (income) tax. Avery promised me three 7-footers,
(Robinson, Duncan and Will Perdue), a good group of guys and a
point guard (Johnson) who pushes the ball up court. We were mainly
a half-court team in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie thinks the Spurs can increase the tempo by playing more
aggressive defense on the perimeter instead of relying so much on
Robinson and Duncan near the basket. Though the Spurs allowed the
lowest shooting percentage (41.1) and fewest points per game (88.5)
of any team team in the league, their opponents committed the
fewest turnovers (12.7).
</P>
<P>
   Elie figures he knows a guy who can change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job,'' he said. ``I know that I've got two 7-footers
behind me. I can go out and put pressure on the ball.''

 &HT;    Will game draw blitz of bucks?
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Only a Super debate is good enough for a
Super Bowl. And this is it:
</P>
<P>
   Promoters of Super Bowl XXXIII say next Sunday's game between
the Atlanta Falcons and Denver Broncos is stuffing more than $200
million into cash registers in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors say the National Football League championship isn't
much of a bonanza when it's played in warm weather meccas because
it merely displaces other tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So who's right?
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, most likely.
</P>
<P>
   The game is pumping big bucks into the economies of Palm Beach
and Broward counties, and especially, into Miami-Dade County, home
of Super site Pro Player Stadium. But the fortnight leading to the
game also is displacing other tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to the story than the extremes. Tourism
promoters, hoteliers and others in the hospitality trade now doing
Super business hope that first-time visitors will return, that the
event will generate free publicity leading to more tourism and that
many of the leisure and business visitors displaced by the game
merely will delay their arrivals, not skip this year altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, gauging the Super economic impact is not an exact
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you did it in July or August, you could measure it,'' said
Diane Yost, spokeswoman for the Four Season Resort in Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not in the height of (tourist) season,'' said Yost, whose
hotel has booked 100 of its 210 rooms to one Super Bowl group.
</P>
<P>
   Economics Professor Philip Porter of the University of South
Florida in Tampa kicked off this year's Super debate. Porter said
there is no economic impact from Super Bowls played in warm weather
states.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Florida Atlantic University Professor Kathleen
Davis, who studied the economic impact of South Florida's last
Super Bowl, in January 1995, and is studying this year's as well.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, executive director of the Sports Management Research
Institute, says the 1995 game generated $365 million for South
Florida. That total is made up of $204.5 million in initial
spending by visitors pumped up by the so-called multiplier effectno
quote marks around multiplier effect, please _ the local respending
of the visitors' dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is what the facts tell me,'' said Davis, who hasn't
seen Porter's research. ``There's tremendous impact. Common sense
would tell you there's impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter, Davis said, did not do data collection and is not
familiar with South Florida's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Davis, a local member of the South Florida Super Bowl
XXXIII Host Committee, which is promoting the event with $1.3
million from the three South Florida counties, says he has ``a hard
time believing'' Porter's study. Bill Davis, also president of the
Palm Beach County Sports Commission, and Kathleen Davis aren't
related.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Davis says Super Bowl visitors, many on fat corporate
expense accounts, spend more than typical tourists, making Palm
Beach County government's $120,000 contribution to this year's game
a wise investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of heavy hitters will be coming,'' he said. ``They're
bringing their cash and credit cards. That's what we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and other game promoters count on these folks to return
again and again. They also expect to see a bump in business down
the road as the result of stories written by 3,000 journalists
covering the event and from the 800 million people worldwide
expected to watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Munoz, director of the host committee, said he believes
that business groups and leisure travelers displaced by the game
won't wait till next year to visit. They'll show up after the game,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Breakers in Palm Beach doesn't need the Super Bowl to fill
its 572 rooms this time of year. But when the Super Bowl is here,
each of its occupied rooms yields an average 30 percent more
revenue, including spending at Breakers restaurants, shops and the
spa, said David Burke, the resort's vice president of sales and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The Breakers has 325 rooms committed to NFL groups, including
ABC Inc., CBS Corp., Sprint Corp. and Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Said Deb Hurd, spokeswoman at the Ritz-Carlton in Manalapan:
``More money does get spent because of the nature of the groups.
They're here to spend a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 250 of the Ritz's 270 rooms are occupied by Super
visitors, Hurd said.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the Boca Raton Resort &AMP; Club's 963 rooms are
booked with Super guests, including Visa International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who brings a client down, they're going to do it
right,'' said Dave Feder, the Boca resort's vice president. ``We're
booked with prime groups and big spenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the thick-wallet set will be first-time visitors,
Breakers President Paul Leone said. The idea is to impress them so
they'll come back.
</P>
<P>
   Getting them back is the job of the Palm Beach County Convention
&AMP; Visitors Bureau, which promotes tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will market (to) them and try to get them back,'' said Ann
Hersley, the bureau's director of public relations. Studies show
that 90 percent of those who visit Palm Beach County are impressed
enough to plan to return, Hersley said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County hoteliers have committed 1,655 hotel room
nights for this year's game. But they aren't the only businesses
cashing in, said county Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau President W.E.
``Mac'' McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Car rental agencies, limousine services, restaurants, golf
courses, malls, even Everglades tours are getting their share of
Super dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We typically attract group shopping from the hotels when there
are big events,'' said Ann Morgan, marketing director for The
Gardens mallcq in Palm Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hall, owner of Klassy Koach in West Palm Beach, said his
25 limos are all reserved by corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been booked, and everything (was) paid for three or four
months ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall figures he'll make about $20 more an hour than his usual
fee during Super Bowl week. Klassy Koach usually charges a minimum
$50 an hour for a stretch limo.
</P>
<P>
   John Campagnuolo Jr., owner of Park Limousine Service in Palm
Beach, said limo rates double on game day, to $100 an hour from
$50. But limos were reserved long ago, he said, as well as other
vehicles that became hot commodities after the stretch jobs were
taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``After people can't get limos, they'll take vans,'' Campagnuolo
said. ``We rented vans six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   FAU Professor Davis said each dollar spent by visitors is new
money coursing through the local economy. It will be spent over and
over, the so-called multiplier effect at work.
</P>
<P>
   Her example of the multiplier: Laborers who make more during the
Super season ``take that money, go down to Joe's Bar &AMP; Grill, spend
their new monies on beer and nachos. The waitress sees new money in
tips and goes down and buys more Gap jeans, plus picks up a Super
Bowl shirt. All of a sudden everybody's making out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the $204.5 million spent by Super Bowl XXIX visitors in
January 1995, Palm Beach County got 15 percent, or about $30
million, with 45 percent in Miami-Dade and 40 percent in Broward,
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   About 142,000 people descended on South Florida for the game
between the San Diego Chargers and the San Francisco 49ers (won by
the 49ers), including about 17,000 who stayed in Palm Beach County
hotels, according to Davis' study.
</P>
<P>
   Davis surveyed 2,604 of the visitors and found average spending
of $1,241 during a stay of 3.4 days. A third of the total went for
lodging, followed by 22 percent for transportation, 19 percent for
merchandise, 18 percent for food and 8 percent for other things.
</P>
<P>
   The average South Florida tourist last year spent $122 for each
day's stay _ excluding airfare, according to Hersley of the
county's Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. That comes to $415 for 3.4
days.
</P>
<P>
   The game meant $5 million in room revenue for Palm Beach County
in 1995 and $8 million in sales tax, said host committee member
Bill Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' hope for those in town for the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they go (home) with a lot of receipts, gifts and good
memories'' _ and come back real soon.
</P>

   HOSTAGE-WIDOW-HIGGINS _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ She remembers
thinking, ``I can't let them know I'm Jewish. I've got to tell my
father in Delray Beach to be `not Jewish' too.'' It has been nearly
11 years since Robin Higgins, Florida's incoming executive director
of veterans affairs, learned her husband, Marine Lt. Col. William
R. ``Rich'' Higgins, had been kidnapped in Lebanon. She was a
Marine officer in the Pentagon press office. He was serving as a
U.N. peacekeeper. The Islamic Hezbollah group snatched him off the
street, accusing him of being a spy for the United States and
Israel. During his 17 months of captivity, she buttoned up her
distress under a uniform. She also hid something else _ her
religion. Despite her efforts, and though other hostages _
including Associated Press reporter Terry Anderson and Anglican
Church emissary Terry Waite _ were eventually released, Rich
Higgins' body was dumped on a Beirut street. Today, at 48, Robin
Higgins is preparing for a new mission: to make sure Florida's 1.7
million veterans get the federal benefits they deserve. On Tuesday
the Cabinet is expected to approve her nomination by Gov. Jeb Bush
as executive director of the Florida Department of Veterans Affairs
at a salary of about $105,000. (Elmore, Palm Beach Post) MOVED

   BIGBANG _ LOS ANGELES _ Scientists generally agree that the

what was there before the Big Bang? Scientists explore this very

   COUNTIES-GROWTH _ Gwinnett County, the Energizer Bunny of
growth, will be topping the charts well into the next century,
according to new forecasts of population and employment growth for
counties nationwide. Cobb County is also among the top 25. These
comparisons aren't percentage increases, where small counties
usually come out on top, but a comparison of raw numbers. That
makes it all the more startling. How do counties that have been
growing like crazy for so long and are often seen as becoming much
more urban continue to absorb people? Do they have the room for
this growth? We talk to the usual and not-so-usual suspects. (Soto,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TEX-ENVIRON-SANCTUARY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Flower Garden Banks,
a federal marine sanctuary 110 miles off the Texas coast in the
Gulf of Mexico, is home to the northernmost coral reefs in the
United States. Manta rays and loggerhead turtles cruise the shallow
waters. The sanctuary is surrounded by oil and natural gas
development. Last summer, a swath was cut through one of the reefs,
apparently by a barge's tow chain. The incident illustrates the
fragile nature of the reefs, which are underwater layers of stony
skeletons secreted by invertebrate animals. A $1 billion
conservation proposal announced by President Clinton _ and
reiterated in his State of the Union speech last week _ includes
$29 million to expand and protect the nation's marine sanctuaries,
more than twice the current budget for the sanctuaries. That would
allow the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, which oversees the Flower Garden Banks, to restore
coral damaged in future shipping accidents and commission genetic
research and other studies by scientists at Texas A&AMP;M University
and the University of Texas. ATTN: Texas editors. (Haurwitz, Austin

</P>
<P>
   TEX-OILMAN-LEGACY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Herman Heep, wisecracking,
straight-talking millionaire oilman, insisted that anyone who came
out to his 5,000-acre ranch in southern Travis County call him
Herman. Heep, who could have walked right off the set of ``Giant,''
was as hospitable as he was quick-witted and sharp-tongued. Maybe
that's why, at the height of his wealth in the early 1950s, the man
known for driving through his oil fields in his shiny new Cadillac
convertible had friends that included the lowest of ranch hands and
the most powerful of politicians. He was what Texans like best: a
character who worked hard and played just as hard. Heep's strong
and willful spirit has reached down through two generations and is
playing itself out in a quintessential Texas family saga involving
his three granddaughters, who have spent the past 30 years fighting
each other over his legacy. The saga could end this year in a
Travis County court, where the family trusts are being dissolved
and what's left of the money is being divided among Heep's heirs.
Before he died in 1960, Heep amassed a fortune worth somewhere near
$50 million in today's dollars from oil, ranching and other
ventures. What's left today is the 5,000 acres of prime undeveloped
land and $4 million remaining from trust funds that amounted to $20
million in 1989. Lawyers have received millions from the funds in
legal fees as family members sued each other, attorneys and
business associates. Always at the center of the fight has been
Heep's eldest granddaughter, Hatsy Heep Shaffer, who, perhaps more
than anyone, carries on the blustering spirit of her grandfather.

<P>
   TV-GUYS-LIKE (New York ) _ Companies will pay amazingly high
sums to advertise on a show watched by men between the ages of 18
and 34. So programmers are madly scrambling to create series that
appeal to young men. Not long ago I watched a variety of shows _
including wrestling and ``World's Wildest Police Videos'' _ that
have particularly high numbers of young male viewers. I expected
crotch and flatulence jokes. Instead I found voice-overs shouted
with feigned amazement and a lot of ads for motor oil. A critic's
notebook. By Anita Gates.
</P>
<P>
   TV-RATINGS-RESCUE (Hollywood) _ Bruce Nash, one of the many
people trying to rescue network television from its steep ratings
slide, has an idea. Actually, he has a lot of ideas: 19 pages of
single-line thoughts, each for a different show that he believes
just might reverse the flight of viewers to cable channels, the
Internet and other forms of entertainment. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   ART-MONEY-MORALS (New York) _ Art and money. The two are forever
linked, but it is still unfortunate when they become virtually
synonymous. Lincoln Center has received offers of more than $15
million for a painting which has hung in the complex since 1964,
and the center's board has initially endorsed the sale. The
proposal to sell the work, a Jasper Johns painting, has stirred up
opposition and raises moral and legal issues concerning Lincoln
Center's obligation to the art on its premises, the artists who
made it and the nature of trusteeship in public institutions.
</P>
<P>
   MARY-BOOK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Dennis Smith is the author of
best-selling books about firefighting. But you wouldn't know this
from reading his atmospheric new book, ``A Song for Mary: An
Irish-American Memoir. By Christopher Lehmann-Haupt.
</P>
<P>
   TV-DILBERT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The comicstrip ``Dilbert'' is now
an animated television series, which the sinking UPN desperately
hopes will be a hit. By Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   TV-FITNESS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Exercise, a chore or bore to many,
a passion for some, receives quizzical attention on the History
Channel. ``Quest for Fitness,'' a two-hour look at physical
exertions through the ages, gives a lot of credit or blame to the
Greeks, but mainly the focus is on the United States of the past
couple of centuries. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   MARTINS-DANCE-REVIEW (New York) _ ``Walton Cello Concerto,'' the
new work Peter Martins has choreographed for the New York City
Ballet and more or less named after its music, is one of the best
of its genre. It is a pure-dance response to 20th-century music. By
Anna Kisselgoff.

<P>
   AT&AMP;T-SMARTALK-MERGER (Undated) _ Why did it take four months for
AT&AMP;T to put together last week's $192.5-million agreement to
acquire most of Smartalk Teleservices Inc., a small, distressed
seller of long-distance calling cards? The answer illuminates the
world of mergers, the power of AT&AMP;T and the crushing difficulty of
being a small communications company richer in concepts than in
capital. By Seth Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-EXEC-PROFILE (Undated) _ Paul Maritz, who takes the
witness stand this week as the highest-ranking Microsoft official
scheduled to testify in the company's antitrust trial, is known for
a cool, sometimes prescient, analytic style. He is also the
executive who oversaw the development of some of the main products
at issue in the trial. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-INVEST-PROBLEMS (Undated) _ Many small investors are
becoming frustrated with stock trading over the Internet. Among the
problems plaguing many online brokerage firms: Web pages that are
slow to load, servers that conk out and some trades that fail to be
executed. Investors and some industry officials worry that a big
market tumble could completely freeze out online traders. By
Richard A. Oppel Jr.
</P>
<P>
   PROZAC-GENERIC-DRUG (Undated) _ A legal battle that could
ultimately decide when Americans can pay a lower price for the
popular antidepressant Prozac is set to begin Monday in
Indianapolis. By David J. Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-DREAM-DEAL (Undated) _ It is the stuff Web dreams are
made of. A recent start-up operating out of a makeshift office
strikes a deal with a media giant. Suddenly, it's the hottest of
properties, a celebrity start-up. Fortunecity.com, a New York City
developer of community-based Web sites, finds itself in that
enviable position after signing a deal with Warner Brothers Online
to collaborate on a community site for fans of Warner properties.
By Janet Stites.
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLING-AD-COLUMN (Undated) The World Wrestling Federation is
joining the ranks of first-time Super Bowl advertisers with an
over-the-top spot that delivers a sassy retort to critics who
complain about the pervasive violence and vulgar sexual imagery in
wrestling. By Stuart Elliott.

   MEDIA-BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   (Coding varies.)
</P>
<P>
   BRILLS-CONTENT-MEDIA (Undated) _ Are 600,000 Americans really
interested in a magazine about journalists? ``This magazine is
either a really stupid idea, or a really great idea,'' said Steve
Brill, the founder of Brill's Content, the magazine that levels its
gaze at the media community. By Alex Kuczynski. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   OVITZ-HOLLYWOOD-MEDIA (Hollywood) _ Michael Ovitz, the man who
was once Hollywood's most powerful agent, has returned as a talent
manager. And after his first few weeks back, one thing is clear: no
star or big-name director is off limits, not even the clients of
his old agency. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-PUBLICITY-MEDIA (Undated) _ Pairings of corporate odd
couples are an intensifying trend in the publishing industry, which
is searching for new ways to grow by reaching readers through
unconventional outlets or through publicity they couldn't afford
without alliances. You might find a book excerpt for the new Elmore
Leonard novel in a 12-pack of Diet Coke or discounts on ``Chicken
Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul'' with a purchase of Iams premium dog
food. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   TABLOID-TURNCOATS-MEDIA (London) _ The hugely popular tabloid
press can often play a sinister role in Britain. Often seen as
saviors, protectors, and tickets to fame and fortune by members of
the public, the tabloids can viciously turn against the subjects of
sensational stories. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   TV-SPORTS-WAR-MEDIA (Undated) _ Fox Sports News is making an
aggressive attempt to compete with ESPN, which for nearly 20 years
has ruled the sports-news franchise. CNN covered sports and had its
nightly sportscast but ESPN ruled _ and still does. But the
landscape has expanded. By Richard Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   NEWSPAPER-EMPIRE-MEDIA (Los Angeles) _ In a little more than two
years, William Dean Singleton has become the No. 2 newspaper
publisher in Southern California, buying up a string of small
dailies in a pincerlike move around the dominant paper, The Los
Angeles Times. By Andrea Adelson. With photo.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was it mere coincidence that Harry Smith and Paula Zahn both
left CBS News last week to join cable networks? Both are veteran,
well-respected journalists; and both missed the cut when four
correspondents were chosen for ``60 Minutes II,'' the network's new
Wednesday night magazine program.
</P>
<P>
   Smith left after 13 years at CBS News to become the primary host
of the A&AMP;E Television Network's most popular series, ``Biography,''
and to make documentaries for A&AMP;E and its corporate cousin, the
History Channel. Ms. Zahn left after nine years at CBS to join Fox
News Channel, a unit of News Corp., where she will anchor one
daytime hour and the main evening news broadcast at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Both confer instant prestige, credibility and a touch of glamor
on their new networks. The reverse is not true. So why did they
jump ship?
</P>
<P>
   Inside CBS, where rumor-mongering is a popular but often
crudely-practiced art, word was that Smith had annoyed the brass
and hurt his career by publicly saying he was a leading candidate
for one of the ``60 Minutes II'' slots. But Andrew Heyward,
president of CBS News, called that theory ``completely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith acknowledged that a job on ``60 Minutes II'' would have
made him stay at CBS. But he had been talking to A&AMP;E about
``Biography'' off and on for almost two years, he said, while
serving as a substitute anchor and reporting pieces for CBS
``Sunday Morning,'' for ``48 Hours'' and for his own feature on the
Friday ``Evening News with Dan Rather,'' called ``Travels with
Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was following in the footsteps of Charles Kuralt, wandering
the country, and I had gigantic editorial latitude, in terms of how
serious or frivolous I could be,'' he said Friday. ``I was not
unhappy or dissatisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Zahn, being part of the daily rhythms of mainstream news
will make life more interesting, or so she told her new boss, Roger
Ailes, head of the Fox News. (She could not be reached for comment
Thursday or Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unlike what Britt Hume said when I hired him,'' Ailes
said of Fox's Washington bureau chief, who was a White House
correspondent for ABC News when Fox hired him in late 1996. The
major networks, he paraphrased Hume saying, ``are fine if you don't
mind having a piece on the news every once in awhile, but if you're
really interested in what's going on every day in the news, you
want more action than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, Mike Boettcher of NBC News joined CNN, a unit of
Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   _ LAWRIE MIFFLIN &QR;
</P>
<P>
   The Rewards of Optimism
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kramer has stopped at most of journalism's stations of the
cross: high school editor, college editor, college stringer (Time
Magazine), metropolitan editor of a big-city daily (The Washington
Post), editor of a respected state publication (The Trenton, N.J.,
Times), and a noted regional newspaper (The San Francisco
Examiner).
</P>
<P>
   Then the ink-stained wretch went digital. Persuading Data
Broadcasting Corp. that news was a good investment, he began in
1995 to create Marketwatch.com, an online financial news service.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, he got rich. Marketwatch.com sold shares to a
dot-com-crazed public, which bid them up to $130 before cooling
off. At Friday's close of $80.50, Kramer's 200,000 shares are worth
$16 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who had been around the journalistic block,
making good and bad decisions. (He opted to give up David Remnick's
services 16 years ago, telling colleagues that local news was not
the promising young feature writer's forte. Remnick, who is now the
New Yorker's editor, moved to The Post's sports department.)
</P>
<P>
   There was one constant: Whatever Kramer did, he retained his
infectious optimism. Four years ago, he persuaded DBC to provide
him with a stake. Then he cadged journalists from rivals like
Bloomberg News Service, luring them with his vision of a quality
news service for small investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's self-delusional,'' said Thom Callandra, the editor of
Marketwatch. ``He actually believes everything he says. Three years
ago there were three of us in some podunk building in San Mateo,
and he's telling me, `You're going to be on the evening news.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now Marketwatch.com (cbs.marketwatch.com) is based in San
Francisco, listed on the Nasdaq and described by CBS News president
Andrew Heyward as a ``journalistic partner.'' In October 1997, CBS
bought a 50 percent stake from DBC (both now have 38.5 percent).
Last year, CBS News began using some of Marketwatch's 30-plus
journalists _ including Callandra _ as on-air consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like running the college paper, when everyone read you
to find out if class was canceled,'' Kramer said. ``It's been a
long time since I've found readers so enmeshed in everything that
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   But a price must be paid. Kramer, once edited by Ben Bradlee, is
now edited by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The day that
Marketwatch.com's offering was big news, company lawyers feared
that even the driest wire-service article could be used as evidence
in lawsuits by disgruntled investors, who could claim that
Marketwatch was painting an unduly rosy picture of its own stock.
</P>
<P>
   So Marketwatch carried barely a word about its own big news.
</P>
<P>
   _ FELICITY BARRINGER &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Can't See the Screen for the Graphics
</P>
<P>
   In a recent skit on ``Saturday Night Live,'' the weekly NBC
comedy show, it looked as if some crazed collage artist had gone
berserk and taken control of the television screens. Instead, it
was a case of the show's writers and cast members satirizing one of
the hottest trends in television journalism: the use of multiple
pictures, graphics, logos and ticker tapes in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The two-minute-and-forty-second segment featured the guest host,
Bill Paxton, and a cast member, Tim Meadows, as MSNBC newsmen and
included the cast members Cheri Oteri and Will Ferrell as expert
analysts. Each time an additional news item was introduced, a
graphic or word would pop up on the screen. By the end of the
piece, the screen was filled with images that had obscured the
actors faces, and they were leaning left and right in desperate
attempts to be seen at all.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the images had no meaning, as when Meadows called for
a picture of the Terminator robot from two Arnold Schwarzenegger
movies and greeted its appearance with the comment, ``That's
cool.'' Or when he introduced a chart by saying, ``Now, more stuff
to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Carlock, the 26-year-old writer of the skit, said the
piece was about ``good and bad information'' in television
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making observations as a consumer of the medium,'' he
said. ``There doesn't seem to be much editing. Decisions about what
is important are being made less and less.''

   Mary Lou Quinlan, chief executive at N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners in New
York since 1995, is taking a new position at the company's parent,
MacManus Group. Mary Beth Casey, president at Ayer, will succeed
her, effective on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinlan, 45, who joined Ayer in 1994 from the DDB Needham
New York unit of Omnicom Group, becomes a vice chairwoman at
MacManus.
</P>
<P>
   She will form a company, as yet unnamed, offering strategic
advice to clients and developing marketing ideas for MacManus like
a project she created for Ayer; it staged focus-group interviews
with consumers in talk-show formats under the title ``Just Ask a
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already come up with projects for clients that are
different from what I would have come up with for them as a CEO,''
Ms. Quinlan said, adding that in her new position she would
continue to work closely with Ayer and MacManus clients like Avon
Products Inc. and Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Casey, 43, joined Ayer in June 1997, also from DDB Needham
New York. She was named president, and designated as Ms. Quinlan's
eventual successor, last May.

<P>
   Allied Domecq Spirits USA has placed in review the Sauza
tequilas brand account, which has been handled for five years by
Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners in New York, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi
PLC. Billings for the tequilas, which include the Sauza
Conmemorativo, Hornitos, Silver and Gold varieties, were estimated
at $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman will participate in the review, said Jim Swords, a
spokesman for Allied Domecq in Old Greenwich, Conn. The others
taking part have not been determined, he added, but among them will
be agencies both on and off the Allied Domecq roster. Other Allied
Domecq roster shops include BBDO Chicago, part of Omnicom Group,
which handles Beefeater gin and Kahlua liqueur, and Weiss Stagliano
Partners in New York, which handles Courvoisier cognac.

<P>
   PMK, the Hollywood, Calif., public relations agency known for
its powerful publicist, Pat Kingsley, is in talks to be acquired by
the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of
Cos. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Irwin, a spokeswoman for McCann, confirmed a report of the
discussions that appeared on Friday in Daily Variety. She described
the negotiations as preliminary, adding: ``At this point, it is
talk. We've been talking to a lot of companies.'' While McCann owns
no entertainment publicity agencies, Interpublic owns one, Rogers &AMP;
Cowan, through its Shandwick unit.
</P>
<P>
   PMK, which also has an office in New York, has 44 employees and
estimated annual revenue of $5 million. Among PMK clients are Woody
Allen, Candice Bergen and Tom Cruise.

   Omnicom to Acquire a Design Company
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom Group in New York is making another acquisition by
agreeing to buy the Designory Inc. in Long Beach, Calif., a design
company with clients that include Mercedes-Benz and Nissan. The
Designory, which owns the Miami-based design company Pinkhaus, will
continue as an autonomous company under its own name as part of the
Diversified Agency Services division of Omnicom. Steve Horman,
president at the Designory, continues in that role, reporting to
Thomas Harrison, chairman at Diversified Agency Services.

</P>
<P>
   The NFL Quarterback Club has named a humorous commercial
featuring Jerry Rice and Steve Young of the San Francisco 49ers as
the best football-themed commercial of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The spot was created for Visa USA by BBDO New York, a unit of

`QUEST FOR FITNESS': WATCHING PEOPLE EXERCISE THROUGH THE AGES
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
(DW) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Exercise, a chore or bore to many, a passion for
some, receives quizzical attention Monday night on the History
Channel. ``Quest for Fitness,'' a two-hour look at physical
exertions through the ages, gives a lot of credit or blame to the
Greeks, but mainly the focus is on the United States of the past
couple of centuries. Although the narration and interviews are
unlikely to set many cardiovascular systems racing, the old
pictures of pioneers of health and fitness regimens confirm their
place as national curiosities.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent in the early 19th century was Catharine Beecher,
sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe. A devotee of Swedish gymnastics,
she viewed the laws of health as the law of God and used barbells
as part of her worship. In similar spirit, inspired by ``Tom
Brown's School Days,'' the nation's YMCA's made much of the
mind-body spirit in their pursuit of ``muscular Christianity.'' The
1800s also gave rise to something called ``the new gymnastics,''
promoted by a guru by the name of Dr. Diocletian Lewis, who went in
for alternative medicines concocted mostly of alcohol, that
ever-popular remedy.
</P>
<P>
   We are also reminded in the first hour, ``Quest for Fitness,''
of the years when Battle Creek, Mich., field of rivalry between
Kellogg and C .W. Post cereals, was an elite watering place,
featuring vegetarianism, incessant chewing, water cures and lots of
enemas. Who can forget Bernarr McFadden's glorification of the
body, especially his own, in his magazine, Physical Culture? You
can see the agile octogenarian doing some sky diving. Onward and
possibly upward to Jack LaLanne and Jane Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   The second, somewhat repetitious hour, ``Quest for Muscle,''
concentrates on bodybuilding, with pecs and other adornments on
rippling display. Analysis of this phenomenon is lacking, and the
preenings at Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, Calif., may strike you
as more freakish than esthetic. Those chesty swaggerers do nothing
to advance the claim of ``mens sana in corpore sano.''

EXPLOITING THE SUPERIOR COLLICULUS 
DOUBLE-DECKER HIGHWAYS 
FROM COW UDDERS TO BALD HEADS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Can understanding how a cat pounces on a mouse help an
air-traffic controller spot incoming planes? Or make a difference
in the way a military pilot locates a ground target? Or improve a
weather forecaster's ability to identify lightning strikes?
 &HT;    Yes, according to Alianna Maren, a senior scientist at Accurate
Automation Corp. in Chattanooga, Tenn.
 &HT;    Dr. Maren has patented a technology that she says enables radar
to become more precise by integrating different types of
``returns'' in much the way that a person, or a cat, integrates the
perception of different senses.
 &HT;    ``A cat who is hunting, let's say, will use both its auditory
and visual senses to be able to detect the mouse,'' Maren said.
``In every mammalian brain, there's a special portion of neural
tissue called the superior colliculus. What that portion of the
brain does is take in auditory, visual and tactile information and
fuse that information together. We have taken some basic principles
of how the brain works for sensory fusion and then put that into
the computer, mimicking the same action.''
 &HT;    For example, Maren said, her system could integrate information
emitted from an airplane transponder with radar images of the plane
taken at an air traffic control center.
 &HT;    ``The transponder gives the identification of what the aircraft
is but gives a less specific location for the aircraft,'' she said.
``The radar gives a more accurate location for a target but
wouldn't be able to say what the aircraft is.''
 &HT;    By putting those two sets of information together, she said, she
can eliminate the background ``noise'' created by buildings or
ocean waves or weather disturbances and thus get an accurate
picture of the plane and its location.
 &HT;    Currently, according to Robert Pap, president of Accurate
Automation, beyond about 35 to 40 miles a plane may not be exactly
where its picture on the radar screen shows it to be.
 &HT;    He said statistical models had been used to predict the real
location of far-off objects identified by radar. ``But those
methods require a priori knowledge of conditional probability
distribution,'' Pap said. ``That means you have to know the
likelihood of what's out there. But because the situation is
changing all the time, you couldn't use those methods with any
reliability.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have been working to develop similar,
animal-inspired approaches to this type of technology, known as
``sensor fusion.'' But this may be the most comprehensive approach,
the company contended.
 &HT;    The U.S. Navy, which sponsored the research with a grant, has
licensed the technology, the company said. Patent 5,850,625 was
granted to Maren and colleagues at Accurate Automation.

   A Novel Notion for Highways
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McKeown, a writer, has an unusual muse: the highway.
McKeown says he has dictated seven screenplays and a book into a
tape recorder while on the road.
</P>
<P>
   All that driving gave him the idea for an invention as well:
double-decker highways. McKeown has patented a modular H-shaped
concrete structure. It resembles two gigantic Jersey barriers _
those prefabricated concrete barriers familiar alongside roads and
highways _ which would be connected in the middle with a slab of
reinforced concrete.
</P>
<P>
   McKeown said the prefabricated structures could be laid, for
example, on top of the Washington Beltway, adding one new lane of
traffic on top of the existing roadway.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that his idea still had a couple of kinks to be
worked out. One is how cars would merge onto and exit the
structure. Another is how best to cart off vehicles that have
broken down.
</P>
<P>
   McKeown received patent 5,846,020.

   Court Rules in Favor of Baldness Remedy
</P>
<P>
   The Patent Office has granted about 100 patents for baldness
remedies, which include preparations made from deep-sea mud, potato
peelings and emu oil, as well as devices that zap the head with an
electrical current.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency had denied a patent to Joyce Cortright, who was
seeking to protect the use of her invention as a baldness
treatment. Ms. Cortright's treatment is currently commercially
available, under the trademark name of Bag Balm, for a completely
different use: the softening of cow udders.
</P>
<P>
   The Patent Office denied the patent application on the grounds
that Ms. Cortright had not explained how it could restore hair
growth, although the application cited studies in which users
stated that it had.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
in Washington ruled that Ms. Cortright should be granted the
patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statements that a physiological phenomenon was observed are
not inherently suspect simply because the underlying basis for the
observation cannot be predicted or explained,'' the court said in
its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the court said, baldness experts would not take Ms.
Cortright's claim that the treatment would ``restore hair growth''
to mean that it would return a user's hair to its original state.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the contrary,'' the court said in its opinion, ``consistent
with Cortright's disclosure and that of other references, one of
ordinary skill would construe this phrase as meaning that the
claimed method increases the amount of hair grown on the scalp but
does not necessarily produce a full head of hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

COOL AWARDS, CHILLY AUDIENCE 
`WINDOW REFUNDS DAY' 
RETURN OF THE SPAM KING

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's no business like show business, unless of
course you count the stock market in the age of the Internet: one
part Fellini film, one part trapeze act. It was in the spirit of
infusing the Web with a bit of literal high-flying that the Cool
Site of the Year Awards were held in New York on Thursday at
Webster Hall in the East Village. The crowd of 700 was mesmerized
by a French acrobat but less receptive to the celebrity host, Robin
Leach, late of the television program ``Lifestyles of the Rich and
Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please be quiet,'' he demanded, trying to start the show and
becoming increasingly frustrated. ``Please shut up!'' Indeed, few
in the crowd seemed concerned with following the winners and more
interested in talking among themselves while imbibing the
complimentary spirits poured by one sponsor, Wine.com. (After all,
one might get famous by claiming an award, but not necessarily
rich, and rich appears to be far more important to those in
business on the Web.)
</P>
<P>
   Not that those nominated weren't hoping to take home a trophy,
for which Web surfers cast online ballots to determine the best in
15 categories. Mark Walling, for instance, trekked from Redmond,
Wash., at the expense of his employer, Bill Gates. He genially
masked his ambition to win Best Reference Site for Terraserver, the
Microsoft geography site he was representing. ``I don't expect
we'll win,'' he said, smiling. ``Everyone hates the `evil
empire.'''
</P>
<P>
   Leach, after admonishing one award recipient for his sloppy
dress and unsuccessfully rallying the crowd to move the event
``uptown to Lincoln Center next year,'' announced the winner in
Walling's category. Sure enough, Terraserver lost to How Stuff
Works, a home-grown noncommercial site created by Marshall Brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met him in the elevator at the hotel,'' Walling's wife,
Tammy, said of Brain. Like her husband, she had not visited New
York before, and was mystified by touches like a lithe man in black
platform shoes who donned a blue bunny suit and handed out the
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Walling returned from the wings, just in case, and this time he
was masking his feelings a bit less transparently. But when,
moments later, Brain's was named Cool Site of the Year, he beamed
with pride on behalf of his new friend. ``We'll all have to go
out,'' he said to his wife. After all, as Leach would be the first
to say, everyone loves a celebrity.

   Linux Users Going Straight to Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the Linux software operating system would rather
not have Microsoft Windows on their personal computers _ and would
most definitely rather not pay for Windows, which is standard issue
on most PCs. Now, with a militancy that seems to be part of the
movement, a band of Linux users plans to demand its Windows money
back.
</P>
<P>
   The users are hoping to use a loophole that they say they have
found in the end user licensing agreement for Windows, which says,
in effect: If you do not agree with the stated terms and
conditions, do not use the software. Those who do not agree to the
terms, the agreement states, should ``promptly contact manufacturer
for instructions on return of the unused product(s) for a refund.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Linux aficionados has started the Windows Refund
Center (www.linuxmall.com/refund), taking inspiration from Geoffrey
Bennett, an Australian PC customer who got back $110 (Australian)
last year after refusing to accept the terms of the Windows
licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In Bennett's case, the refund came from Toshiba, the maker of
his PC. But the folks behind the Windows Refund Center would like
to simplify things by having Microsoft supply the refunds. So on
Feb. 15, which they have declared ``Windows Refund Day,'' they are
going to present their case to Microsoft, en masse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to quietly walk up to the Microsoft office and
people are going to turn in their disks, manuals and
certificates,'' said Don Marti, a leader in the Bay Area Windows
Refund campaign. ``And they're going to get a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is not so sure about that. Tom Pilla, a spokesman,
said the Windows end user licensing agreement is intended only to
insure that people use Windows properly and do not make illegal
copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``PC manufacturers are free to ship any software applications
and operating systems they want,'' Pilla said. ``By the time
they're reading the end user agreement, they've already purchased
Windows, presumably consciously.'' And besides, he said, so far
``we've gotten no requests for refunds.''

   Repentant King of Spam Serves Humbler Kind of Fare
</P>
<P>
   Until his disappearance from the online world early last year,
Sanford Wallace was easily the most reviled man in cyberspace.
Wallace, the self-professed ``king of spam,'' infuriated millions
of Internet users daily with his mass e-mailing campaigns and then
reveled in his right to do so. In its heyday, his company sent out
30 million pieces of electronic junk mail a day.
</P>
<P>
   That was until last February, when a judge ordered Wallace's
company, Cyber Promotions, to pay $2 million in damages to
Earthlink, an Internet service provider whose members were the
mostly unwilling recipients of Cyber Promotions' junk mail. The
judge then promised to impose a $1 million personal penalty were
Wallace ever to spam Earthlink subscribers again. And that was only
the most expensive of 13 lawsuits filed against Cyber Promotions
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The ignominy was enough to send Wallace into virtual seclusion
from the online world. And then he saw the light. Today, Wallace
says he is repentant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a healing process that had to take place,'' he said.
``There were so many people who hated what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has started a new online business: Smartbot.net, a free
service for corporations looking to automate the e-mail replies
they send in response to customer inquiries. With 46,000 clients
since Smartbot.net started operations in September, the service is
a hit.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. To sign up for the service, companies have
to agree to add their names to Wallace's bulk e-mail lists, to
receive the advertising he sells to support his service. If this
bulk-mail proviso makes it sound a lot like the spam king's
previous business, there's a difference: Once they've signed up for
the service, they can opt out of the bulk-mail obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof is in the pudding,'' Wallace said. ``I haven't been
kicked off the Internet since I've been back. I couldn't have done
that for 20 minutes before.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said his low start-up costs made Smartbot.net a money
maker almost immediately. ``Without legal fees to pay,'' he said,
``it's amazing how much easier it is to make a profit.''

TRIAL IS GETTING UNDER WAY IN PROZAC PATENT LAWSUIT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., SWITZERLAND)   By DAVID J. MORROW   
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A legal battle that could ultimately decide when Americans can
pay a lower price for the popular antidepressant Prozac is set to
begin Monday in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., the drug's manufacturer, sued Barr Laboratories
in 1996 and Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Novartis A.G., a year
later for infringing its Prozac patents after the two companies
filed applications with the Food and Drug Administration to make
generic versions of the drug. The two suits eventually were
combined.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been angst within Lilly's Indianapolis
headquarters and anticipation within the drug community over when
the Prozac compound, fluoxetine hydrochloride, could be marketed as
a generic. Lilly has one patent on the Prozac compound that expires
in February 2001; a second patent on the way the drug works is set
to expire in December 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, in its application with the food and drug agency that was
filed in 1995, claimed that Lilly's patent was invalid in part
because the company did not disclose all relevant information about
the drug, thus launching a heated legal battle that has lasted more
than three years.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high. Prozac's worldwide sales last year are
expected to be about $2.8 billion, almost one-third of Lilly's 1998
revenue. Once a drug becomes a generic, the brand's sales sometimes
plunge 75 percent in a single year, which could sink any drug
company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   For Barr Laboratories, a company less than one eighty-eighth the
size of Lilly , selling a generic brand of Prozac would add $420
million in revenues during the first year, analysts estimate. Barr
Laboratories' 1998 sales for the year that ended in June totaled
$377.3 million, a record for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers, too, have a stake in what happens inside Chief Judge
Sarah Evans Barker's courtroom in the Southern District of Indiana.
While Prozac will one day be sold as a generic, the results of the
trial will determine when it will become available. Analysts
estimate that a generic Prozac may cost 30 percent less than the
patented brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is really serious for everybody involved,'' said
David Saks, a managing director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``But what is
really interesting is that this is a trial. Anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Barker tossed out two of Barr's claims, a
setback that Bruce L. Downey, Barr Laboratories' chief executive
officer, called ``disappointing.'' One issue that remains is
whether Lilly deliberately withheld information in its patent
application, a claim analysts believe may be difficult to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect to win this case or else I would not have come
to court,'' said Downey, who spent 20 years as a trial lawyer.
``With a suit like this, it's a roller-coaster ride with things
going your way and things not. But I don't expect anything to be
decided until the court of appeals.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long expected Lilly to pay Barr Laboratories about
$200 million to settle the case, an outcome that appears to benefit
both companies. With a $200 million check, an amount Lilly can
easily afford, the company could preserve Prozac's revenue until
the patents expired, while Barr could increase revenue by 53
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Downey said last week that he was open to a $200 million payment
or a similar settlement, provided that he was guaranteed that his
company would be the first seller of a generic Prozac.
Unfortunately, a settlement has not set well with Lilly executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paying out such a settlement would not be responsible to our
shareholders, especially for a suit we expect to win,'' said Mitch
Daniels, senior vice president for corporate strategy and policy at
Eli Lilly. ``Why should we pay money for something that we already
have? We'd only incite other companies to get money.''

DISCOVERING THE DARK SIDE OF BRITAIN'S POPULAR TABLOIDS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass., U.K.)   By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The story was as irresistible as catnip to the
sensation-greedy British news media. A pair of foster parents,
devastated when they were told they would not be allowed to adopt
the two little girls they thought of as their own, vanished from
sight, taking the children with them. After living in secret for
four months in a remote corner of Ireland, they wrote a letter to
several tabloid newspapers, pleading to be allowed to keep the
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will someone help us to be legally their mummy and daddy
forever, making the hopes and dreams of these two wonderful
daughters come true?'' said the couple, Jeff and Jennifer Bramley,
in a handwritten note that was widely reprinted earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Bramleys emerged from hiding last week with the two girls,
5-year-old Jade and 5-year-old Hannah, after a carefully-negotiated
deal with the authorities that included the assurance that their
adoption application would be formally considered in court. But
what happened to them along the way illustrates the often sinister
role the popular tabloid press can play in Britain. Often seen as
saviors, protectors, and tickets to fame and fortune by members of
the public, the tabloids can viciously turn against the subjects of
sensational stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cutthroat journalism,'' said Sue Quinn, who has been
covering the story for the Guardian newspaper, describing the
``posses'' of tabloid reporters, from papers like The Express, The
Sun and Daily Mail, that converged on the trailer in Ireland where
the Bramleys had spent part of their time in hiding. ``The
newspapers reach a phenomenal number of people, and it's a pretty
good forum to try to win public sympathy. But it's tough to get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   When they fled from their house in Ramsey, England, in
September, taking $8,000 in savings but leaving their car, the
Bramleys got plenty of media coverage. As time passed and the
pressure for them to return built up, the couple was running out of
money and growing desperate.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Max Clifford, Britain's highest-profile public
relations executive and a man who has often been associated with
stories that skirt the line of sleazy exploitation, got into the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford was contacted, as he often is, by someone calling
himself ``a close friend'' _ in this case, of the Bramleys _ who
asked him what the couple should do. ``I said that the obvious
thing is to get the public to be sympathetic, to get the media
supporting you,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered what turned out to be a crucial bit of advice.
``I said, `You mustn't sell your story yet, because you'll alienate
people,' '' Clifford said. ``Talk to the media, yes, but when
you're ready and in your own time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the newspapers, checkbooks in hand, were desperate to
secure exclusive access to the Bramleys, a deal that Clifford
estimates would have earned the couple about $160,000. Several
tabloids used their news pages to plead directly with the Bramleys.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal can be a devil's bargain. Once they become the
exclusive property of one tabloid, people in the news often find
that the other tabloids turn against them, printing negative
``spoilers'' that are designed to blur the impact of their rival's
scoop.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened in the case of Louise Woodward, the
British au pair convicted last year of shaking a Boston baby to
death. Her parents' financial deal with the Daily Mail so enraged
the Mail's rivals that they set out, successfully, to turn the tide
of public opinion against her.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened to Deborah Parry and Lucille McLauchlan,
two British nurses convicted of murdering a colleague in Saudi
Arabia, who were later sent home. Each did a deal with a tabloid,
leaving themselves open to the criticism that they were exploiting
a tragedy for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's total hypocrisy when this happens,'' Clifford
said, ``because I have the letters in front of me from all the
editors begging me for the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bramleys were lucky: their heart-rending story, the public's
natural suspicion of the adoption authorities, and their decision
not to single out any paper for special access meant that they were
treated with a fair amount of respect, at least initially. There
were signs of a small wave gathering against them, however, with
reports circulating in the papers about the authorities' criticism
of their parenting skills, including the charge that they urged the
girls to call them ``mummy'' and ``daddy'' too early in the
foster-parent relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But before the backlash got too strong, the judge in the
adoption case slapped an injunction on the media, barring them from
reporting on the girls' or the parents' background.
</P>
<P>
   For now, then, the Bramleys are safe from the fickle whims of
the news media. ``The most productive thing for them to do would be
to wait until they've got custody of the kids,'' Clifford said.
``Then they can do the book and tell the whole story of being on
the run, and make a fortune. They can sell the serialization and
make another fortune. And everybody's happy.'' &QL;

GET IT? NOW DO YOU GET IT?   YOU WILL GET WRESTLING AT THE
SUPERBOWL 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla.)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wrestling punches its way to the Super Bowl in an
in-your-face ad.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear an announcer proclaim in the style of those
Walt Disney World commercials: ``World Wrestling Federation, your
television shows are drawing larger audiences, higher ratings and
more mainstream marketers. And one of your former `bad guy'
performers, Jesse Ventura, has just been elected Governor of
Minnesota. What are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The federation, a unit of Titan Sports &UR;  &LR; Inc. that stages
extravagant theatrical-style ring productions, is celebrating with
a trip to Florida, but the destination is Pro Player Stadium in
Miami, not the Magic Kingdom in Orlando. The company, known as the
WWF, is joining the ranks of first-time Super Bowl advertisers with
an over-the-top spot that delivers a sassy retort to critics who
complain about the pervasive violence and vulgar sexual imagery in
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial, created in-house, is scheduled to run during the
third quarter of Super Bowl XXXIII, which the Fox Broadcasting Co.,
a unit of News Corp. &UR; ,  &LR; will show on Sunday. Sponsors are paying a
record average of $1.6 million for each 30 seconds of commercial
time during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers that buy around the Super Bowl think they're very
clever,'' said Vince McMahon, chairman at the WWF in Stamford,
Conn., referring to those purchasing spots during national pre- or
post-game coverage or on local stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for us, anything other than being in the Super Bowl
wouldn't work,'' McMahon said. ``It's the impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the commercial will have a bit of a shock value because
most people won't be expecting it,'' he added. ``We're buying the
`What the hell was that?' factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the WWF among Super Sunday peddlers is emblematic
of the increasing importance of so-called sports entertainment in
the American commercial and popular cultures. Examples besides
wrestling include extreme sports, drag racing and roller derby.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling, in particular, is challenging traditional sports, as
demonstrated this past season when ratings for ``Monday Night
Football'' on ABC fell in part because some viewers switched to
programs on cable networks from the WWF and World Championship
Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Several marketers that are buying commercials on Super Bowl
XXXIII also advertise on WWF programs. Among them: AT&AMP;T Corp.,
American Honda Motor Co., Mars Inc., the Warner Brothers unit of
Time Warner Inc. and the Universal Pictures division of Seagram
Co..
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of those on Madison Avenue get it,'' McMahon said. ``We
have a tremendous list of advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But a few don't get it,'' he added, ``so we're starting a
campaign for image enhancement, to better educate them and the
media detractors.'' The multimillion-dollar campaign will include
print and radio as well as television spots.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the campaign is the fast-paced Super Bowl
commercial, titled ``A Day at the Office,'' which combines stunt
performers, special effects and WWF wrestlers in featured and cameo
roles to offer a fanciful tour of Titan Tower, the headquarters in
Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have the wrong impression about the WWF,'' says
the wrestler known as Stone Cold Steve Austin, striding down a
hallway. ``We're a nonviolent form of entertainment.'' He then hits
a passerby with a chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never use sex to enhance our image,'' says Sable, a female
wrestler, as she walks past a couple locked in a lascivious
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   As other wrestlers named the Rock, the Undertaker and Mankind
speak about the value of ``being positive role models'' and ``good,
wholesome family entertainment,'' the over-exaggerated antics
around them escalate: people are tossed through office partitions,
fires erupt, brawls break out and the lobby is engulfed in a melee.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial concludes with a mock explosion that propels a
man through a high window of Titan Tower. As an announcer intones
the WWF slogan, ``Attitude,'' McMahon turns to the camera, smiles
and delivers the campaign theme: ``Get it?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Byrne, senior vice president for marketing at WWF, termed
the spot ``our way of saying: `Now do you get it? We're really
about entertainment.'''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon is as seasoned a performer as his wrestlers. He appears
regularly on WWF shows in a role described in a recent New York
magazine cover article as that of ``a conniving, manipulative,
thoroughly evil CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On television, I play this demagogue who's so powerful,''
McMahon said, laughing. ``Some people say I'm one and the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do is outlandish, outrageous, making fun of
ourselves, winking at the public,'' he added. ``The take-away is
`This is a hoot.' And our fans totally understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Will others unfamiliar with or dismissive of the wrestling mania
for broad characterizations and cartoon-style mayhem understand?
After an executive at a corporate identity company gave an
interview to USA Today in November, suggesting that other Super
Bowl advertisers would shy from the WWF spot, there has been
speculation that it has caused problems for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any pundit to be critical is hypocritical,'' said Vince
Wladika, a spokesman for Fox Sports in New York, ``because the same
tongue-in-cheek humor and scripted action `violence' is put forth
on other TV shows and commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   Other advertisers did not shun the WWF commercial, he added, nor
did the company ``pay a `poison premium,'' _ a higher price charged
for spots deemed to contain sensitive content.
</P>
<P>
   Other first-time Super Bowl advertisers on Sunday will include
Just For Feet Inc.; Monster.com, a job-search Internet company
owned by TMP Worldwide, and Philips Electronics North America, a
unit of Royal Philips Electronics N.V., promoting high-definition
TV sets.

   FBN-LYNNSWANN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The appropriately named Lynn
Swann was often called a Nureyev in football shoes. Many consider
the former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver the most graceful
player in NFL history. He once studied ballet to help his footwork
on the gridiron, and his soaring, acrobatic catches _ many in the
spotlight of the Super Bowl _ will live for the ages. But nobody
who bleeds blue and silver will ever forgive him. ``To this day,
Cowboy fans tell me how much they hurt when we beat them in the
Super Bowl,'' said Swann, now 46. ``I just say thank you. The
people don't mean any disrespect. On the contrary, they are very
respectful. They're great fans who just happen to remember Super

 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The best publicity a publisher couldn't buy is airing
reliably on the nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   This month, it was a warm feature on NBC News about a World War
II veteran and prisoner of war, a profile drawn from the pages of
the NBC anchor Tom Brokaw's best-selling book ``The Greatest
Generation.'' Then there is the story of a pioneering female
military pilot, a profile in the same book and available for
reading on MSNBC's Web site, which provides helpful links to the
book's publisher, Random House.
</P>
<P>
   On a competing network, the ABC News anchor Peter Jennings is
broadcasting weekly segments about the century, a theme familiar to
readers of his lavishly illustrated best seller, ``The Century,''
which also has a computer link between the ABC Web site and Random
House, the parent of the book's publisher, Doubleday. Still to
come: a 12-part ABC Century documentary and a 15-hour History
Channel series.
</P>
<P>
   The bonanza of publicity is enough to make any publisher dizzy
with high expectations and Random House is so elated with the
results _ Brokaw's book ranks No. 1 on The New York Times'
best-seller list while Jennings' is No. 3 _ that executives already
have planned promotions for sales of Jennings' book next Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has truly been the happiest alliance of two behemoths,''
said Stephen Rubin, the president and publisher of Doubleday, which
contracted directly with ABC to publish ``The Century,'' a title
that grew out of the eight-year television project.
</P>
<P>
   Such pairings of corporate odd couples are an intensifying trend
in the publishing industry, which by necessity is searching for new
ways to grow by reaching readers through unconventional outlets or
through publicity that they could not afford without alliances.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting Felix and Oscar matches mean that you might find a
free book excerpt for the new Elmore Leonard novel, ``Be Cool,'' in
a 12-pack of Diet Coke or discounts on Health Communications'
``Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul'' with a 20-pound purchase
of Iams premium dog food
</P>
<P>
   It means that post offices will be hawking copies of Time Life's
own $29 century books packaged with 15 stamps for every decade or
the Modern Woman fashion stores are selling quick meal cookbooks
along with size 16 dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is tough, and we've got to come up with new ways of
looking at the business,'' said Cathy Hemming, the publisher of
HarperCollins' adult trade group, which has formed alliances with
the Mattel toy company to promote its popular author, John Gray,
with a special excerpt of his writings in a board game tied to the
book, ``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, more titles are being sold outside traditional
bookstores such as the large chains and independent stores, which
accounted for less than 42 percent of all books purchased by
consumers in 1997, according to research from the Book Industry
Study Group and the American Booksellers Association. So the logic
of looking for new partners and forms of distribution is not
particularly threatening to publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The books that are sold in such a fashion can even become
stealth best sellers, titles that may never climb the ranks of a
best-seller list because sales in untraditional outlets are not
measured by any of the lists. But they can be profitable because
the unsold copies are not returned to publishers, the custom in
traditional bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Time Life books, for instance, has never climbed a best-seller
list with its Williams-Sonoma cookbooks, but it has sold more than
7.5 million copies of books in the series, with a large percentage
sold through the gourmet cookware store's outlets, according to
Terry Newell, publisher of Time Life's custom publishing, which
actively seeks out corporate alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is doing it right now,'' said Newell, who added,
``The margins in publishing are tight and the returns are affecting
everybody's business. Everyone is looking for alternative ways to
increase their revenues and decrease their risk. That's why we're
all doing this.''

<P>
   Perhaps the oddest corporate match is the Coca-Cola Co.'s
February campaign to give away book excerpts of six novels in 45
million packages of the soda. Diet Coke is subsidizing the costs of
this campaign, which will also include supermarket displays and a
writing competition that asks Diet Coke drinkers to expound for 500
words on the topic of ``Living Life to the Fullest.'' (First prize:
a VIP tour of the publishing house, HarperCollins, a unit of News
Corp., an editorial critique, and dinner with one of the featured
authors at a New York ``literary hot spot.'')
</P>
<P>
   The campaign actually grew out of detailed focus group research
conducted by Diet Coke, which determined that its average thirtyish
drinker loves to read. That pattern held true for men and also for
women, who make up about 60 percent of the customer base, said
Diana Garza, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the first things out of their mouths,'' she
said. ``We're all looking at each other and thinking how do we do
this because Diet Coke is not a publishing house and we don't
pretend to know how to tie it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Coca-Cola's executives met with a number of
publishers, settling on a mix of books that had some appeal to men
and women. They picked some well known authors such as Elmore
Leonard and Barbara Taylor Bradford, but also picked the work of an
up-and-coming legal thriller writer, Lisa Scottoline, and the
essays of ``Chicken Soup for the Couple's Soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the publishers of the books actually designed the
excerpts, Coca-Cola printed up the palm-sized booklets and
organized the promotions that also include giant supermarket
displays of open books _ advertising that no publisher could
afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't necessarily need to do it,'' Ms. Garza said. ``If
Diet Coke is going to protect the franchise we can't just do it
with advertising. But here is a marketing initiative that is trying
to do things that are relevant to the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rybarski is a former publishing executive at Houghton
Mifflin and now a marketing executive with Age Wave Impact, who
cautions that such corporate alliances can work, but only if there
is sense of ``authenticity'' to the matches.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his company's research on consumers in the baby
boom wave from 37 to 53 years indicates that customers are much
more sophisticated and resistant to hard sell techniques. ``There's
this whole cynicism that says I don't want to be sold,'' Rybarski
said. ``The alternative is that some of these people are looking
for solutions to problems. And I think some of these incentives _
to the extent that they solve problems _ may work. I'm a pet lover
and you're giving me a book. You're not selling me. You're helping
me. I'm in a relationship with them. I keep buying their product.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From the perspective of the publishers, that is one reason why
the news exposure for the books by the television anchors, Jennings
and Brokaw, is so much more valuable than formal advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   The sales of Jennings' book, for instance, have slowed down in
velocity since the peak book-buying Christmas season, but they are
continuing at a steady rate and the book's publisher, Rubin, gives
credit to such factors as the quality of the title and continuing
exposure of its themes on special weekly segments of ABC's news
program.
</P>
<P>
   In the week that Brokaw explored the themes of his own book in a
documentary on ``Dateline'' and a profile on the NBC Nightly News,
his publisher went back to press for 100,000 more copies, bringing
the total in print to 1.48 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he can take the power of his station, his place
in the national consciousness and bring that to the subject,'' said
Ann Godoff, president and editor in chief of Random House, which
has a contract with Brokaw and not with NBC. ``And I think that
he's able to go out and talk about this and not have any feeling of
being self-aggrandizing. It's real and it comes through.''
</P>
<P>
   Does such exposure raise ethical questions about news shows
being used by networks or news anchors to promote their own books?
</P>
<P>
   Thomas B. Rosenstiel, a former media critic for The Los Angeles
Times and director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a
media watchdog group, scoffs at such a notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're able to communicate things of substance to people,''
he said, `` and that dribbles into `Dateline' instead of the newest
celebrity book on one-liners or `How I Got to Be a Sitcom Star,'
then I think the culture is better off.''

KANSAS CITY POLICE PITCHING IN TO HELP WITH POPE'S VISIT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A Catholic seminary will be home to 35 Kansas City police
officers while they are in St. Louis this week to provide an escort
for Pope John Paul II. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A seminary's kind of appropriate, don't you think?'' said Sgt.
Jay Atkinson of the department's traffic unit. ``We're very
excited. The mere fact that the pope's not here that often makes it
historic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope arrives Tuesday afternoon in St. Louis and leaves
Wednesday night. The Archdiocese of St. Louis expects thousands of
visitors to converge on the city. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With that many people, said Kansas City Police Officer Douglas
Ousley, ``this will be the Super Bowl, the Mount Everest of
escorts.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ousley will be riding one of 29 motorcycles the department is
sending to St. Louis along with three squad cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some heads-up riding. This is the largest
crowd we've dealt with,'' Ousley said. ``Personally, I'm looking
forward to it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City officers, who were selected from the
department's traffic unit, will be part of the pope's motorcade.
They will also assist with traffic and crowd control. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the pope's visit, the officers have been
staging mock motorcades at Arrowhead Stadium since November. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two squads, or about 20 traffic officers, will stay behind
covering Kansas City streets. That is more than enough, police
said, to nab motorists who think they can take advantage of the
temporarily downsized unit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The officers who left Saturday morning will return Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have done it without Kansas City,'' said St. Louis
Police Chief Ron Henderson. Kansas City Police Chief Floyd Bartch
``basically said, `Tell us what you need.' &UR; '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 police officers from Missouri cities will provide
support for the 700 St. Louis officers assigned to the papal
detail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The participating cities will pay for their officers, but St.
Louis will provide housing and food. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few departments in Missouri that do motorcycle
escorts,'' Atkinson said. ``We've done several recently with the
president and vice president. We've worked a lot with the Secret
Service. Once a month we practice by going through the city as if
we're conducting a motorcade.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The papal motorcade will include about 100 officers. A 17-mile
route will take the pope from Lambert-St. Louis International
Airport to Archbishop Justin Rigali's residence, where he will be
staying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City officers will have just three days to learn the ins
and outs of St. Louis streets before the pope's arrival. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know all the routes,'' Atkinson said. ``He's going
to be making several trips from his residence to downtown and back
again. Then he has to be taken to the airport. You have to know
hospital routes, too, in case something happens.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A full schedule of events awaits the pontiff, and through it all
police will focus on security. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have dignitaries, you worry about safety,'' said
Kansas City Officer Jeff Goede. ``You always watch the crowd,
pedestrians and other vehicles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you reach a particular destination, it doesn't end. You
hang tight. Things change. You have to go with the flow.'' &QL;

BAILOUT IS JUST SO MUCH NEW MATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is something to keep in mind as the president seeks to
reserve 60 percent of the federal budget surpluses to help ``save''
Social Security. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is an exercise in double-counting the same money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The budget surpluses are the result of Social Security taxes
generating more revenue than is needed to fund current benefits.
Therefore, the Social Security surplus (begin ital )is(end ital)
the budget surplus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The actual excess Social Security money, however, is spent on
general budget outlays. The Social Security trust fund is credited
in return with a nonmarketable Treasury security, which is a claim
against the government, like an IOU. The process simultaneously
creates an asset for Social Security and a liability for the
Treasury, which makes the deal a wash because the money eventually
comes from the same pocket _ i.e., the taxpayer's. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president says reserving budget surpluses for Social
Security will strengthen its finances, but this ignores the fact
that his scheme would count the same money twice. Last year's
budget surplus was $70 billion, and Social Security's excess
revenue amounted to about $100 billion. Similar outcomes are
expected for this fiscal year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So when people propose reserving budget surpluses for Social
Security, they essentially are talking about the Social Security
surpluses that already have been counted once as budget surpluses
and then spent. Only in Washington would anyone take such an
arrangement seriously. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another big conceptual problem here is that there's no legal
mechanism allowing the federal government to ``save'' such money.
You can look all over Washington, for instance, and you won't find
any part of last year's surplus in a mattress, canvas bag or
government account labeled ``leftover 1998 budget money being saved
to help Social Security's finances.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The accounting sleight of hand proposed to ``save'' Social
Security is possible because too many Americans seem willing to be
duped by relatively painless solutions. It's as though they think
any challenge to the duplicity of the proposals will somehow
endanger their current or future Social Security payoff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The IOUs in the trust fund may be backed by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. government, but what gives such a pledge
credibility? The historical willingness of the American body
politic to make good on such promises. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, here's more math, in case you're interested. The
president's double-counting of Social Security surpluses wouldn't
work any miracles even if it weren't an accounting sham. It's
estimated to generate $2.7 trillion over 15 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The current unfunded liability of the Social Security has been
estimated at three to six times that number. By one estimate, it
would cost $9 trillion just to honor all commitments to current
participants if government decided to start phasing out the program
tomorrow. This is almost twice the national debt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Social Security's future depends not on today's
devious political promises but on the willingness of a decreasing
pool of future workers to be taxed at levels high enough to sustain
current benefits for increasing numbers of future beneficiaries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Double-counting the same pot of tax money won't get it done. &QL;

RETURN OF CIVIL WAR IN ANGOLA THREATENS CITY'S REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola _ Dominating the lobby of the Hotel Continental
here is a mural of the city's beach esplanade by a local artist,
Mario Ribeira.
</P>
<P>
   It was painted in 1994, the year of the peace accord that was
supposed to end Angola's civil war. As is so often the mission of
art, it pursues an ideal rather than reality. In it, the Central
Bank, a plump study in pink, smiles gravely down on a promenade of
tall palms lapped by blue waves.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, where Ribeira's earlier watercolors hang, the true
Luanda lifts its skirts over the mud to reveal scabby ankles. In
his portraits of elegant old manses, plaster flakes off faded walls
and pools of stagnant water intrude at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   These paintings do not tell half the story. Impoverished Luanda
has many horrifying scenes: the skinny street children who live in
the sewers and emerge through stinking drains at dawn; the hundreds
of young men who live on the city dump and pound on arriving trucks
with steel hooks, impatient for the disgorging of the trash, so
they can claw through it for aluminum or for food that is only
half-rotten.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, the reality has veered a bit toward Ribeiro's
ideal. Luanda is a pit, but a pit with a touch of the phoenix.
Since 1994, it has actually defied the downward spiral of many
African cities and perked up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sadly, with the return of war this year and the unraveling
of the peace accord, all that is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Square, for example, used to have as its central
monument a Soviet tank crushing a South African one, a memorial to
the 1980s wars that pitted the government's Cuban allies against
the rebels' South African ones. Five years ago, the tanks were
removed, as part of efforts to demilitarize the city.
</P>
<P>
   The stone pedestal sat in the middle of a dustbowl. Recently,
the provincial governor's campaign to beautify Luanda reached the
square, and turned it into a greensward with sunflowers and lilies,
a startling oasis in a withered, potholed, shot-up city.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ribeiro's mural feels prophetic: The Central Bank is now
spotless pink, as is the refurbished Presidential Palace up the
hill. The esplanade was repaved last year. Empty sidewalk holes got
new palm saplings.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Palacio de Dona Joaquina, from whose porch Lady
Joaquina sold slaves and, according to legend, defied Portugal's
ban on the trade by building a secret tunnel to the wharf, has been
wrested away from the squatters who vandalized it. If fix-up money
can be found, it might even join Goree Island, off Senegal, as
another of Africa's ``slave tourism'' sites and draw American
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The historic Portuguese fort of Sao Miguel that dominates the
harbor is once again a military museum, not a Special Forces base.
</P>
<P>
   And, going well beyond the cosmetic, Luanda has signed a
$700,000-a-month contract with a private company, Urbana 2000, to
take over its garbage collection, street-sweeping and maintenance
of its fetid, decrepit sewers.
</P>
<P>
   Urbana collects 1,100 tons of trash a day and has drained so
many of the scummy pools in the slums that the city's malaria rate
is going down, said its director-general, Victor Diogo.
</P>
<P>
   On a company video he showed, delighted local administrators
watch its bulldozers ram the mountains of steaming, fermenting
garbage that accrete behind the city's open-air markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of this trash has lain here for 15 years,'' said Domingos
Victor, mayor of the Maianga district. ``Things are getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a long way to go. Even when the company's trucks
suck up knee-deep ponds of sewage, the best they can do is pump it
into a pipe that carries it less than a mile out to sea. And people
still drop trash next to bins, while the hordes of street children
here overturn them for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are from the rural areas, and don't have the social
education to use garbage containers,'' said Baltazar De Olivera,
29, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans a campaign, but the renewal of war has thrown
cleanup efforts in doubt. Angola has great oil wealth, which helped
it buy Urbana's 200 new trucks and dozers. But corruption siphons
much of it off, and an expanding military budget will suck up
what's left.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Luanda is a city of war refugees. Vast tracts that were
desert 15 years ago are now filled with shacks that have no power
or toilets and get their water from trucks. By some estimates, half
of the country's 11 million people will soon live here, and
services will be even more overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If war really stops in Angola, the country will be back on the
rails in 10 or 12 years,'' said Diogo.
</P>
<P>
   If not, said Bonifacer Cassoma, the foreman at the city dump,
pointing to mud brick houses rising nearby in a field that was
empty only six months ago, ``there will be millions of people here
soon, relocating from the countryside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's more problems for us,'' he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One refugee from the war seems to be Osvaldo Mingo, 13, who
lives in a Luanda sewer.
</P>
<P>
   Osvaldo's father was a soldier killed in the city of Huambo, he
says, although a child-care worker warns that some Luanda street
children lie about their past. If they have fled abusive homes,
they get no sympathy, while war orphans do.
</P>
<P>
   He sleeps on a ledge beneath a sidewalk with nine friends and
their dog.
</P>
<P>
   Startled drivers swerve when the boys pull themselves out of the
storm gutter at dawn, their heads popping out of the street, to
start another day of washing parked cars, checking trash bins for
food and begging. By the end of the day, they hope to have enough
cash for a pack of cigarettes and some gasoline to sniff _ or, if
they're lucky, something less nauseating.
</P>
<P>
   He chose the reeking sewer because it is safer, he said. At a
campsite up the street, bigger children beat smaller ones for their
car-washing earnings. Only very young or thin children can slip
into his home _ the drain holes in the gutter are less than a foot
wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it rains, the sewer floods,'' he said. ``We take our
cardboard and sleep under the buildings there.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived here on a Red Cross helicopter flight from the war
zone, he said, but doesn't remember when. He ran away from the
airport and lived on a traffic circle for a while.
</P>
<P>
   His last home was a government center. ``They gave us tunics to
go to school in,'' he said. ``I was eating cashew nuts, and I
messed mine up, and they took it away. So I ran off.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys scoop brown water out of the sidewalk that seems to
seep up from a broken pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, it's good to drink, it's good for cooking,'' Docas
Adao assured a horrified visitor. Like Osvaldo, he looks 10 but
says he is 13.
</P>
<P>
   If they get sick, they go to the Red Cross. Two of their group
have died, one hit by a car as he was emerging from the gutter,
another bitten by a rabid dog.
</P>
<P>
   Bento Manuel Lino, a security guard at the apartment building
above the sewer, has some sympathy for the boys. He has stopped
bullies from beating them, he said. ``They steal from us sometimes
_ but it's because they have nothing, and they're hungry,'' he
shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Mimosa Darseu, 10, who lives in a house around the corner, says
he isn't afraid of the boys, ``but if you have good clothes on,
they may try to take them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Angola, there are government homes for street children,
said Ricardo Jose Bernardo, 26, who runs a children's project for
the charity Action for Life. ``But we interview them, and we only
take the ones who want to go,'' he said. ``Kids like their
liberty.''

   Pete and Bear, the bird dog brothers, gulp down their breakfasts
and then stand looking in at the back door, noses pressed against
the glass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is the man moving quickly and with purpose? Has he perhaps
dressed himself in rough clothes and opened the door of the hall
closet to get out his boots and the canvas coat? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Promising signs, all of those would be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, no, he's still in his bathrobe, sitting with cup and
newspaper at the breakfast table. He gives no indication of going
anywhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed, the dogs leave the step and take up their places
by the far fence, prepared to occupy another day with keeping the
yard cleansed of squirrels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hunting season is drawing toward its end, and only a decent
season it has been. Decent, but not grand. Strange weather early,
with summer days in November. And birds still fewer than they used
to be. Fewer, and far between. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, too, in spite of his solemn promises to the pups and to
himself, the man's work and other affairs often got in the way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still there were fine outings with other dogs, known dogs and
their men, sometimes to remembered places, sometimes to grand
reaches of country never seen before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were moments, especially after frost burned back the rank
greenness and the air clarified, when the scent of bird came to
them with a force to halt them in midstride. One of the best of
those days was just a week ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now it's almost over, and they seem to sense it. One more
morning afield they'll have, with luck. Then comes the long wait
for another November. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Already the man is thinking ahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On land of his, three or possibly four resident coveys of quail
passed through this season unmolested. But if their numbers are to
increase, more must be done _ (begin ital) will (end ital) be done
_ to improve their chances against the weather and predators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That country neighborhood was famous in an earlier time for the
generous population of birds it supported. There's no reason it
shouldn't be again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But then there's the problem of work's interference with the
more important business of autumn. One way or other, that, too, has
to be resolved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pete and Bear, though their man still speaks of them as pups,
are pups no longer. They're coming 5 years old this spring, in the
prime of their lives, with middle age looming just a little way
ahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 10 or 12 their muzzles will be graying. Their eagerness for
rides through the darkness toward frosty morning fields will be
just as great. But they'll devour the distances less easily. And
there'll be soreness afterward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The autumns between now and then are too important to be
wasted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say one needs to be morbidly preoccupied with the
time and its fleetness. But in planning how to dispose of the years
remaining, for man or dogs, that needs to be taken into account. &QL;

   PITTSBURG, Kan. _ The rhetoric here the last few weeks, to say
the least, has been remarkable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Help. Murder. Police'' was how Pittsburg State University
alumna Christine Scott started a letter to the local paper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to die in this ditch,'' said John Darling,
president of the university. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's going on? Well, it's all about a set of stairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the stairs at the main entrance of Russ Hall, once
the sole building of what was called the Manual Training Normal
School but now the linchpin of this bustling 125-acre campus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The stairs, 23 steps in all, are 12 feet wide and rise about 15
feet to Russ' second floor. Beautifully finished, they are made of
luminous white marble. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The stairs are special. For years the phrase ``Meet me at the
stairs'' has required no explanation here. Students and faculty
knew where that was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next month contracts will be awarded for a $9 million renovation
of Russ. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the stairs, which have been in place since 1914,
to be torn out. In their place will be two sets of new stairs that
will ascend to the second story along the north and south walls of
a large entrance foyer _ once two rest rooms are demolished. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where the stairs are now is slated to become a large open space,
possibly featuring an information desk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which all sounds pretty straightforward _ big money for
renovation, roughly $70,000 for the new stairs, the building
brought up to current-day codes and made accessible to the
disabled, new heating and cooling, and refurbished offices and
classrooms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The stairway part of the project, minor compared with the rest
of the work, is scheduled to take about a month to complete in May
and June. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, petitions opposing the project are flying around
Pittsburg and Crawford County like paper airplanes. Display ads
saying, ``Help Us Save Part of Pittsburg's History,'' are appearing
in the Pittsburg /{Morning Sun/}. State Sen. Jim Barone, a
Frontenac Democrat, is being inundated with calls at his Topeka
office. And now there is a Save Our Stairs (S.O.S.) committee to
thwart what some see as desecration of a landmark. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barone says that in this era when most people yawn as the
national media breathlessly report impeachment, scandal, and all
the rest, people still have a visceral reaction when an issue hits
close to home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All politics are local,'' said Barone, using the oft-quoted
phrase of former U.S. House Speaker Tip O'Neill Jr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walk around Pittsburg these days and likely as not an S.O.S.
committee petition will be proffered for signatures. More than 500
people have signed the forms, which are being sent to the Kansas
Board of Regents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just sick about what they're planning to do,'' said
Scott, now in her 80s and still active in alumni affairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She began kindergarten in Russ Hall in 1920, her parents paying
the $9-per-semester tuition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then people would pay extra so their children could be
taught by the teachers who taught the teachers,'' said Scott, who
went through the elementary grades, high school and college in
Russ. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Those stairs are part of me. Believe it or not, we used to
slide down the banisters. Oh, it was scary. But wonderful. Or we'd
meet under them. They are `our' stairs. They are just so
beautiful.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lyerla, a store owner in Pittsburg, said the stairs were a
constant from his boyhood because his father, Walter Lyerla, worked
at the college 39 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I see all these renovations at the state capitols or in
Washington,'' said Bob Lyerla. ``What I don't see is them ripping
out steps leading up to Congress or tearing other stuff down that
has history behind it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, this just isn't going to happen. Those stairs
mean too much to too many people.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Carter, director of public affairs for the university,
said she thought that the fur hit the fan because the faculty and
students just recently began the move out of Russ to make way for
construction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people realized there were going to be changes,'' she
said, adding that plans, drawings and a scale model of what the new
entryway and foyer would look like had been around since the fall
of 1997. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have done a better job of telling people what was
coming,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scale model of the new stairways currently is in the back of
a second-floor office of the ROTC building here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Darling, the university president, said that contrary to some
statements, the stairs were not original to the building. Russ was
constructed in 1907-1908. The stairs were added in 1914 after a
fire all but gutted the structure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But the main problem is that they aren't safe,'' said Darling.
``I've fallen on them. I won't walk down the middle of them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Darling said the university's administration was in a pickle.
The minute the first dollar is spent on restoration, Russ falls
under all sorts of federal and state regulations, including the
Americans with Disabilities Act and building codes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To keep the stairs as they are, Darling said, the university
would have to forgo redoing Russ and give back the $9 million
dollars, something he said was not going to happen; block off the
stairs and leave them as a historic exhibit; or add a Rube Goldberg
assortment of handrails, guardrails and landings, which would
effectively ruin the stairs aesthetically. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Better, said Darling, to build new stairs, using some of the old
marble. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the emotion of this,'' he said, ``and I'm not
going to die in this ditch. If enough people want to talk to the
state architect (who has control over waivers to regulations), then
I'm all for it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Barone said that he had been in contact with the state architect
and that his conversations had led him to believe a way would be
found to save the stairs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Those stairs are important,'' said Barone. ``What people
forget is that after the fire in 1914 the people of Crawford County
paid to have Russ Hall rebuilt. It was that important to them to
keep the school where it was. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Now eventually the state paid back most of that money. But
those stairs are a symbol of what happened and how much people
cared.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plus, said Barone, people should remember those who built the
stairs _ the immigrant European artisans who flooded into southeast
Kansas at the turn of the century and who left an indelible mark. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the stairs,'' said Barone. ``It's the labor and
love that went into them. It's all the students who have walked up
and down them over the years. That's what has to be remembered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a treasure that has to be saved.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Mexican devout rush to see pope, who seeks Catholic reconquest
of Americas

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Using careful, coded language to urge better
treatment of Indians and the poor in this hemisphere, Pope John
Paul II continued his reconquest of Mexico on Sunday by celebrating
mass here before a throng of more than a million people.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of others jammed the area outside the
Brothers Rodriguez Racetrack, where the pope spoke. People intent
on trying to see the Catholic leader braved chilly morning
temperatures and clouds of dust choking the dry winter air, as they
tried to rush through gates to enter the arena.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's message Sunday was mainly spiritual, as he exhorted
eager Catholics in the multitude to become ``fishermen of the
people'' and recruit new souls in the Americas for the church's
third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He also condemned abortion _ without using the word _ by
appealing to Mexicans, who represent the second biggest Catholic
country in the world and a growing influence in the Catholic church
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let no Mexican dare to finish with the precious and sacred
gift of life in a mother's womb,'' said the pope, who will speak
publicly several more times in Mexico before flying to St. Louis,
Mo., on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican legislators have been debating legalizing abortion,
which is practiced secretly here. Other forms of birth control are
available in Mexico and their use is encouraged by the government.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening, during a meeting with Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo and diplomats stationed in Mexico, the pontiff's
remarks were more in a political vein.
</P>
<P>
   Using diplomatic language, he drew from a new papal document on
the challenges for the church in the Americas that warns of the
hazards of free-market reforms, including a widening gap between
rich and poor, materialism, corruption and the abuse of Indians and
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon of corruption deplorably invades wide segments
of the social fabric of some peoples, and those who suffer the
consequences do not always have the possibility to demand justice
and responsibility,'' the pope told Zedillo, a proponent of
free-market reforms who has struggled with corruption among Mexican
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The papal document on the Americas, which was released in Mexico
on Saturday, explicitly outlines the pope's guarded view of
free-market reforms sweeping Mexico and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The global economy, the pope said, has ``positive consequences''
because it unifies nations and can provide better services to
people. But, he said, ``the poor are becoming ever more numerous,
victims of specific policies that are often unjust.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope also attacked the media for pushing messages that are
``often materialistic, in the face of which it is difficult to
maintain a lively commitment to the values of the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the pope's visit to Mexico _ his fourth _ prompted
an unprecedented outpouring of commercials, billboards and products
by ``official sponsors'' designed to sell the visit.
</P>
<P>
   The pope chose Mexico to unveil his plan for the church in the
Americas because it is so fervently Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   In all three public appearances that the popular leader has made
so far, he has mentioned Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe _ proposing,
in fact, that she serve as a symbol for rejuvenating Catholic faith
throughout the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has also mentioned his affection for Indians
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The references are significant because one of Mexico's thorniest
ongoing crises is the conflict between the government and armed
Indian rebels in the state of Chiapas. The rebels allege the
government's policies are worsening poverty and violence in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, as expected, has not commented on Chiapas directly.
But it's clear that the conflict, which has pit clergy in Chiapas
against the government, is on the pope's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I greet the Mexican Indians of different areas of the
country,'' the pope said Sunday during his mass. ``The pope feels
very close to all of you, admiring the values of your cultures, and
encouraging you to overcome, with hope, the hard situations you
live today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Build the future for you and your sons with responsibility,''
the pontiff added. ``That is the reason I'm asking all lay faithful
of this country to promise to help and promote the poorest of the
community. It is mandatory that each and every Mexican receive an
income that allows him to live with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Dolores Villagomez, theologian with Mexico City's Center
for Ecumenical Studies, said the pope has been reserved in his
public speeches and has touched mostly on traditional themes _ the
family, faith, messages against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But the document charting the church's future, she said, is
important because it gives license to Catholics to get involved in
political action against economic inequality and racial and class
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows people to show social commitment,'' Villagomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans from around the country who attended the Sunday
mass or lined up to catch a glimpse of the pope came hoping that
the pope would help them overcome an illness, deliver a healthy
baby _ or find a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the he brings us stability and more strength to
work harder. We suffer in this world because there is no work,''
said Amada Gordillo Terreros, 58, who was among a crowd shouting at
a guard to open a closed gate to the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Some complained that wealthy people had received preferential
treatment and obtained tickets to the event more easily than those
of humble origins.
</P>
<P>
   Lilia Griselda Bautista, who had traveled from Michoacan state,
had brought her daughter _ who suffers from lupus _ to receive the
pope's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The girl had a ticket to sit near the pope, but she and her
mother were turned back by guards, Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariana Ferro, eight months into a troubled pregnancy, had
arrived at 3 a.m. Sunday to make sure she got into the mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have faith that with the pope's blessing my pregnancy will
turn out well,'' said Ferro, who was exhausted and covered in dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``To receive,'' she added, ``you must give and give with faith.
I am willing to do that and educate my child in the new evangelism
that will be the light of the third millennium, just as the pope
said.''

COUNSELORS WHO KNEW SLAIN CHILDREN STRUGGLE WITH EMOTIONS AS THEY

<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. _ The memories recur often for Lori Davis and
Albert Rauch, after-school counselors at the Salvation Army. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Biographical sketches of three of their young charges _ siblings
Darlene Vanderhoef, 8, Chris Franklin, 10, and Jimmy Vanderhoef,
11. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Darlene hugging her baby dolls. Chris quietly making a paper
airplane. Jimmy portraying a brash TV reporter in a video. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final memories, though, are unbearable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The three children lying dead in their home. Strangled last
week, along with their nine-months-pregnant mother, Erin
Vanderhoef, 36. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As police investigate Springfield's worst crime in decades and
reporters discuss the investigation, those who knew this poor yet
giving family simply replay the images of the good times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to believe that these children are in a place where
they will be taken care of and where their life will be good now,''
said Carol Plumley, their principal at York Elementary School.
``But it doesn't take away the sorrow.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who shepherds at-risk children at the Salvation Army
complex a mile from the Vanderhoef house, plays over and over in
her head the last time she saw Darlene. It was the Thursday before
the family was slain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I had given her some new clothes, a long-sleeved,
black-and-white shirt with Mickey Mouse on it. She was leaving, and
I called out, `Remember, we're open all day Monday,' '' Davis said.
``And she called back, `All right. I'll see you next week,' and she
came and hugged me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood residents have become closer through memories of
the children they knew and loved. Classmates and parents at York
Elementary have placed flowers and messages of love on the
children's desks. They have begun collecting money for a memorial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People from throughout Springfield attended a candlelight vigil
outside the Vanderhoef house Saturday night. Many more are expected
at today's visitation at Thieme Funeral Home, which has donated its
services, and at Monday's funeral at the Central Assembly of God
church.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two buses have been lent for the day to York Elementary so
pupils and parents can get to the funeral. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin would have been so pleased to see how much people cared
and what they've done to remember her family,'' said Plumley, who
was Darlene's mentor this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With red-rimmed eyes, Plumley said she had tried to be strong
for the schoolchildren. But the grief is still there, ready to
engulf her when she goes home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Memories and thoughts spurred by everyday happenings are a
constant reminder. Children shout at recess, but the Vanderhoef
children's voices will never again be among them. A little girl
walks in with a present for Plumley and gets a Starburst candy from
the principal's apple-shaped basket. The week before she died,
Darlene had been thrilled to get a perfect score on a spelling test
and came to Plumley's office, where she got two Starburst candies
as reward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rauch said he had to keep his emotions in check so he could help
the children's friends at the Salvation Army after-school program
work through their own sadness and confusion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But when he is by himself, the memories pop up again. Chris and
Jimmy working on the computers or helping set up their tent on a
camping trip. Darlene smiling that shy smile of hers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These children were soft-hearted. Who could ever do this to
them?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Vanderhoef children had not had an easy life. Erin
Vanderhoef was homeless when the two boys were young and she was
pregnant with Darlene. Then she got help from the Salvation Army's
New Start housing program, which helped her find a rental house and
pay the rent and utilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The children often would walk alone to and from school, the
Salvation Army or friends' houses. Their mother struggled to
support them, so friends and neighbors and charities sometimes
helped the family with Christmas presents, food or clothes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vanderhoef changed jobs often, going from grocery to grocery and
most recently to a McDonald's restaurant. She had no family nearby
to help care for the children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her yard was strewn with junk. Inside, the house was a shambles.
Vanderhoef's best friend, Cathy Israel, said the house was so dirty
that when she recently tried to help Vanderhoef keep house better,
she had to wear a mask when she went inside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vanderhoef was on probation for endangering the children by
raising them in unsanitary conditions. And she had boyfriends
living in the house from time to time, boyfriends who sometimes
used drugs, abused her and got in trouble with the law. The house
she had rented since 1994 was on a street locals call ``meth
alley'' for the common use of the illegal drug methamphetamine
there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But adults who spent a lot of time with the children say
Darlene, Chris and Jimmy loved their mother and did not talk much
about what went on at home. Instead, they talked with their friends
and played and tried to do better in school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just like plenty of other children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Davis and Rauch worry about what might be happening with
their other young charges at the Salvation Army, where children
play ball in the gym, or get tutoring help, or make art projects
for several hours every day after school until their parents can
pick them up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This has made me want to be more sensitive,'' Rauch said.
``I'm learning to really appreciate these kids. You know sometimes
they can be sort of hyper. But now I know I want to show them more
love.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davis said she would dole out even more hugs to the children she
worked with. Darlene always hugged her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask yourself if you did enough, if you said enough,'' she
said. ``This makes me want to line them up before they leave and
hug them and say, `We care about you.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She paused. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in case.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 10 members of the focus group _ a gathering of
college-educated Chicago citizens seated around a nondescript table
piled with cookies and soda cans _ were intently discussing the
first three issues of Brill's Content, the magazine founded by
Steven Brill that levels its gaze at the media industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is they take themselves too seriously,'' one man
said. ``You know. Get a life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Long articles about a relatively narrow subject, which it
shouldn't be but it is to most people, are not the kind of thing
that supports a big magazine,'' said another panelist.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' opined another, the magazine's founder is ``as
self-righteous as all the other journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the 10 panelists, who are subscribers to Brill's
Content but not members of the media _ ``civilians,'' in Brill's
parlance _ bluntly stated the same complaints that many people in
the magazine, newspaper, book, television and technology businesses
have been making since the magazine hit newsstands last July: The
articles are too long. The writing can be airless. The readership
seems elusive. And advertisers _ always ready to champion magazines
that cultivate exquisitely hewn and effectively targeted audiences
_ remain ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   And Brill _ who is so intent on demonstrating his objectivity
about the magazine's health that he happily handed over the
videotapes of his focus groups _ concedes that his latest venture
is far from perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This magazine is either a really stupid idea, or a really
great idea,'' he said in an interview in his spartan Fifth Avenue
offices last week. ``It's starting a new category, or it's
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill's first issue in August _ the cover story was titled
``Pressgate'' _ kicked up a tsunami of publicity by revealing that
Kenneth Starr was responsible for leaks to the press. Now, six
months later, the buzz has faded. The spasms of Sunday morning
talk-show soundbites have subsided, leaving Brill in his offices
with the fluorescent lights and the shabby blue carpet to
contemplate this lingering question: Are 600,000 Americans really
interested in a magazine about journalists?
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to find that audience, Brill has softened the
blunt edges of Brill's Content. On the wane: legalistic writing
heavy with drowsy detail and profiles that run on for so long that
even the articles' subjects themselves have said they could not
wade through them.
</P>
<P>
   On the rise: advertiser-ready articles about technology and the
Internet. Sweetheart columns with titles like ``Stuff We Like.''
And _ hold on to your hats _ there is some serious beefcake on the
March cover. (A hint: It's not Sam Donaldson in a Speedo.)
</P>
<P>
   Even Brill's good friend and softball buddy, Walter Isaacson,
the managing editor of Time magazine, offers a carefully worded
appraisal when asked for his opinion of the magazine. ``It has felt
a bit like homework and heavy going, so I often find I have trouble
leaping into it,'' Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brill has built his career on creating businesses that are
first dismissed and then embraced. By 1975, Brill, a Yale Law
School graduate who had never practiced law, was already
cultivating a reputation as a pit bull and a spontaneous source of
temper tantrums as co-founder of The American Lawyer, a monthly
magazine about the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than providing the diligent transactional coverage that
legal periodicals had favored in the past, The American Lawyer
revealed inflated salaries and scrutinized the business ethics of
major law firms. The circulation of The American Lawyer grew to a
healthy 20,000 during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Brill turned his eye toward television, introducing
Court TV and transforming potentially dull court proceedings into
television theater.
</P>
<P>
   In Brill's vision of the ideal world, Brill's Content will be
more than a monitor of the stumbling media; he sees the magazine as
the flagship and brand name for a variety of products ranging from
World Wide Web sites to television programs.
</P>
<P>
   The road, however, is long, and not without bumps. In the first
six months of publication, the editorial staff has lost more than a
half-dozen writers and editors, which Brill ascribed to the normal
movement associated with the Sturm und Drang of a new publication.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, publishing a consumer magazine is much easier than
anything else he has done, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I say is tempered by the experience I had with The
American Lawyer, which was real hostility,'' Brill explained, his
general counsel (his wife of 22 years, Cynthia Brill) sitting by
his side, and a whirring miniature tape recorder (his own) on the
coffee table. ``This is nothing. I mean, I had partners at the
biggest law firms in the city saying, `We are going to do
everything we can to run you out of business.' `This is garbage.'
This is like a daily celebration compared to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Brill will be celebrating much longer remains to be
seen. In the months since the Pressgate story, the critical pace
seems to have picked up. A January editorial in The New York
Observer called the magazine ``dull, humorless, self-important,''
and said, ``It must have taken real brainstorming to create a
magazine about journalists that journalists don't even read.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon magazine wrote: ``By churning out one soporific doorstop
after another, it is effectively telling editors that if you follow
Dr. Brill's Patented System for Quality Journalism, you will
produce a boring magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   And as was to be expected, the subjects of his stories _ among
them ABC News' Donaldson _ do not seem overly fond of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think his motive or what he's about is to help all of
us in daily journalism be better reporters,'' Donaldson said,
comparing the chance to comment on Brill's Content to the guilty
pleasure of eating a bowl of ice cream. ``I think his motive is to
simply zero in on something to complain about, and sell that. Some
of it, I think, is off the wall, because he's trying to sell his
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brill does not want to sell his magazine to the Sam
Donaldsons and Walter Isaacsons of the world. ``They're not my
audience,'' he said. ``My audience is their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   And judging from the Brill's Content subscribers in the focus
groups, there are plenty of media buffs out there, suspicious of
the press yet fascinated by how it works and the conspiracies it
may hide. Brill hopes such nonjournalists will form the bulk of a
broad reader base.
</P>
<P>
   To lure them, he has lightened up the magazine. He has also
shifted his focus toward more generous coverage of technology and
the Internet.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought of this magazine as akin to Rolling
Stone,'' he said. ``That was about a certain revolution in the late
'60s and '70s. This is about the information revolution.'' A
recurrent theme, he notes, is the dramatic impact of new technology
on the traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-friendly approach could lead to healthier ad
revenue, advertising media directors say. ``They're ahead of their
business, and they're doing particularly well with technology
advertisers,'' said Paula Brooks, the director of media services at
Margeotes/Fertitta &AMP; Partners. But others say they are unsure who
reads the magazine, a factor that is a continuing problem for
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear who their audience is, but it is clear that
they are a very expensive ad buy, so we're not using them for any
of our clients,'' said Gene DeWitt, the president of DeWitt Media.
</P>
<P>
   Brill insists the magazine has a well-defined audience. ``There
are magazines for the ski enthusiast. There are magazines for
travel enthusiasts. This is a magazine for media enthusiasts. And
that's a big group of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people care,'' he continued. ``There are 225,000 of
them, and they care. And then there are going to be 400,000 of
them. And then 600,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's circulation, now 225,000, is climbing, Brill
said. While there are no audited circulation figures available for
a magazine that has been published for only six months, The Millard
Group, a list broker that sells the Brill's Content subscriber list
to marketers, reports 200,000 subscribers. Most were signed up
during a heavy direct-mail campaign last summer. Subscriptions have
since flattened out, with 17,515 recorded in September, 5,854 in
October and 3,416 in November, a Millard spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Capell, a circulation specialist and the editor of
Capell's Circulation Report Inc., said that judging from the volume
and quality of his direct-mail campaign, Brill may have spent
several million dollars on soliciting subscribers. Brill, who said
the amount was about $2.5 million, said that he had sent out a
total of 6 million direct-mail pieces, with the response rates
ranging from 3 percent to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a very healthy return, I would say,'' said
Capell.
</P>
<P>
   And in terms of his financial backing, Brill said he was secure.
</P>
<P>
   He initially planned to start the magazine with $28 million put
together from his own resources and three investors who are all
close friends: Lester Pollack, a partner at the investment firm
Lazard Freres; Barry Diller, the chairman of USA Networks; and
Howard Milstein, the real-estate entrepreneur and a new owner of
the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've managed to start it with a few million less,'' Brill
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 4 memorandum to his patners, Brill did reveal his
disappointment with the less-than-vibrant newsstand sales. Brill
said that his worst-selling cover featured Matt Drudge; the
best-selling was his Pressgate issue. Newsstand sales have hovered
between 30,000 and 70,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Felker, one of Brill's first mentors and now the director
of the Magazine Center at the Graduate School of Journalism at the
University of California at Berkeley, sees a kind of puritan ethic
in Brill's enterprise. ``He wants things to be right,'' Felker
said. ``And he's not afraid to make big bets, in terms of personal
energy and integrity, and now with money and reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   And is it possible that the tough-guy manner that marked his
days at Court TV and The American Lawyer has been usurped by a
hopeful bluster that aims to please, not steamroll? Remarks that 10
years ago might have elicited an apoplectic tirade from Brill _
like Isaacson's carefully critical jibe _ now leave him smarting
wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you do me a favor?'' Brill asked a reporter last week.
``Can you call Walter back and ask him if he's seen the new
issue?''

TRIP TO MISSOURI WILL ADD TO POPE JOHN PAUL'S GLOBETROTTING
LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ He has survived an assassin's bullet, a hip
replacement, a pre-cancerous tumor and what may be Parkinson's
disease. He will be too frail to kiss the runway when his plane
lands Tuesday in St. Louis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at age 78, Pope John Paul II is expected to put his moral
and spiritual strength on display once again this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In what might be the final American trip of his papacy, the
pontiff will reach out to his adoring, and often restless, U.S.
flock. Up to 1 million spectators, including several thousand from
Kansas City, are expected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways his two-day itinerary will mirror the themes that
made him a towering figure on the world stage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where do you start? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His stance on Catholic doctrine is as immovable as the rock of
St. Peter, his spiritual forefather, especially on the subjects of
women in the priesthood and reproductive choice. Yet he is a
progressive social advocate, championing the disenfranchised from
the Baltics to Bolivia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't some sweet old guy who is treated nice because he
is a clergyman dressed in white,'' said the Rev. Robert Mahoney,
chairman of the sociology department at Rockhurst College. ``He has
moved things, and he continues to move things. He has moved
societies; he has moved nations. But there will always be people
who disagree with him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope's latest American odyssey will begin when his chartered
airliner arrives at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport at 1
p.m. Tuesday. He will meet with President Clinton and make opening
remarks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the pope as head of state, as traveler. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He loves to call himself the ``pilgrim pope.'' The St. Louis
visit will be part of his 85th overseas trip, and he has visited
more than 120 countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His major themes for St. Louis are unknown. Some observers
speculate that he will address abortion or human rights. He might
ask Clinton to alter U.S. policy in Iraq or call for new
initiatives in the Middle East. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many expect him to stress humane policies in immigration and
economic reform, major themes of his visit to Mexico, which ends
Tuesday. Or a wild card: The pope might criticize America's use of
the death penalty. An execution scheduled in Missouri for this week
already has been postponed until after the pope's visit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure: He will not hesitate to speak his mind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Sicily he broke with centuries of papal inattention by
condemning the powerful Mafia. ``God once said, `Don't kill!' &UR; '' he
pleaded, voice trembling. ``Man, any man, any group of men, the
Mafia can't change and trample this most basic law of God!'' In
Nicaragua he quieted a hostile crowd of Sandinista hecklers with
one word: /{Silencio!/} &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also has been a master diplomat. Many credit his subtle
bridge building in Poland with helping end decades of Communist
rule. He has mediated in countless conflicts from the Falklands War
to the Gulf War. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America poses its own challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he speaks in Poland or in Cuba, where human dignity is
under attack in a particular way, the message will sound different
than it will in St. Louis,'' said Gregory Beabout, a St. Louis
University professor who edited a book on the pope. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In a country like ours, we face unique ways that our faith is
threatened,'' Beabout said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II came of age in a Poland stifled by Nazi aggression.
Most of his life was spent under the Soviet yoke, which he actively
opposed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope, however, is no cheerleader of the West. Once the
Soviet empire crumbled, the pope turned his attention to ``savage
capitalism,'' a rampant pursuit of wealth without a sense of
compassion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Archbishop Justin Rigali, a longtime friend and former
aide, said the pope had an uncanny understanding of forces at work
in the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a global pope,'' Rigali said. ``Today he's occupied with
the United States. This afternoon he's speaking about Cuba or
China. Later it might be Mongolia or Kazakhstan. And on and on it
goes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:The youth connection &QL; 
 &LR; tx:From the airport, the pope's next major stop will be Tuesday
night at Kiel Center, where he will be greeted by more than 20,000
cheering youths. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and critics stand in awe of how the pope inspires
such devotion from young people. The pope, after all, came up with
the concept of World Youth Day in 1986. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Raymond Boland of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph
helped plan the pope's first American visit, to Washington in 1979.
He recalls college students' waiting all night just to get a
glimpse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boland also recalled the incessant chant at World Youth Day in
Denver in 1993: ``John Paul II, we love you!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly do not understand it,'' Boland said. ``Here you
have a man who is stooped over, has to use a stick and is suffering
from debilitating ailments. He looks up, smiles and starts speaking
and they go crazy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pope believes that the morality of a society begins with the
family. His emphasis on the dignity of life includes frequent
mentions of the responsibilities of parents and children alike. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The family,'' he wrote in a 1998 message for World Day of
Peace, ``is the first school of living.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With his health failing, the pope is visibly re-energized around
young people. But the pope is just as pained by what he sees as
threats to the family and to life. That includes family-planning
policies that endorse abortion and contraception. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the pope waged war against a U.N. draft document that
seemed to label abortion a permissible form of family planning. In
homilies and speeches he blasted the document, his face often
turning red with anger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Biographer Tad Szulc called the offensive ``perhaps the most
important (event) of the entire pontificatefully engaging his
personal prestige and that of the papacy.'' &QL;

OVITZ SHAKES HOLLYWOOD WITH NEW COUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Michael Ovitz, the man who was once Hollywood's most
powerful agent, has returned as a talent manager. And after his
first few weeks back, one thing is clear: No star or big-name
director is off limits, not even the clients of his old agency.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Ovitz had lured some veteran directors and old friends,
like Barry Levinson, Martin Scorsese and Sydney Pollack, to his new
company. But Hollywood had been waiting for the former agent to
sign up his first marquee actor. And last week he did so, plucking
one of the stars from the firmament of his former agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz lured Robin Williams away from, of all places, the
Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz was a founder of the agency, helped
hire and train many of the top agents there and has been paid tens
of millions of dollars by the agency as part of his departure
package. ``Isn't this a Greek play _ a father turning on his
sons?'' said one of Hollywood's top lawyers, speaking on condition
of anonymity, who knows the entire cast of characters.
</P>
<P>
   The defection last week of Williams, who earns nearly $20
million a film, came after Ovitz hired Michael Menchel, who has
represented the comedian for years at Creative Artists.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised rival agents and some top Hollywood lawyers is
that Ovitz was starting his still fledgling management company by
swooping into Creative Artists and taking off with one of its top
money-making stars. Because Williams sometimes makes two films a
year and is one of the most popular box office stars, he was
considered one of Creative Artists' prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Several Hollywood lawyers, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
as well as talent agents said that Ovitz was actively pursuing
other Creative Artists clients even though his ties to the agency's
current partners had once been familial. In recent years, those
ties have become frayed. Richard Lovett, the president of the
agency, once a loyal friend of Ovitz's, said only, ``Robin Williams
is a tremendous talent and a wonderful person.'' Referring to
Williams and his wife, Lovett added, ``Robin and Marcia have been
great friends to the agency. We hope to continue working with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Creative Artists officials were far blunter, and,
privately at least, expressed outrage and, as one put it,
``disbelief'' that their former boss and mentor was seeking to raid
his own former agency. Ovitz did not respond to phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Ovitz may be coming along at a fortuitous time in
the management business. The talent agency business, which ruled
Hollywood in the 1980s and early 1990s, partly because of the
ascendancy of Creative Artists, has been in turmoil. Large agencies
like International Creative Management Inc. and William Morris
Agency, as well as Creative Artists, have sought to cut costs and
shrink their number of agents _ through dismissals, attrition and
defections _ partly because of the cutback in studio film
production. On the other hand, management companies have
proliferated.
</P>
<P>
   Managers and agents play two contrasting, but sometimes
overlapping, roles. Agents are licensed by the state and earn their
money finding work for clients and negotiating contracts for them.
Talent agents are not allowed to earn more than 10 percent
commissions. Managers, on the other hand, are unregulated, and have
traditionally charged 15 percent of clients' fees. Managers also
are able to create projects and take potentially lucrative film and
television production fees. By law, managers are only supposed to
advise and cannot secure employment for their clients. In practice,
the line is sometimes blurred about the roles of managers and
agents.
</P>
<P>
   According to agents, Ovitz's appeal to Williams was heavily
focused on the comedian's wife, Marcia, who now serves as a
producer on some of his films. Ovitz apparently views the new
management company as moving into film production, with stars and
directors playing important roles overseeing their projects. By all
accounts, Williams will be represented by two management companies
now, Ovitz's as well as his longtime managers, Morra, Brezner,
Steinberg &AMP; Tenenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for Ovitz, though, is that his relationships with
two of the biggest studios _ Walt Disney and Universal, a unit of
Seagram Co. _ are frayed for personal reasons. He does not speak to
Michael Eisner, the Disney chairman who fired him. At Universal,
Ron Meyer, president and chief operating officer of Universal
Studios and Ovitz's former partner at Creative Artists, and once
his closest friend, barely speaks to him now.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As an agent, Ovitz helped start Creative Artists in the 1970s
and turned it into a powerhouse representing top stars and
directors. Since leaving the agency in 1995 _ his settlement
agreement may have run higher than $50 million _Ovitz's career has
been marked by uncertainty. Ovitz worked for 15 months as president
of Disney until he was dismissed by Eisner, the chairman. At the
time, Ovitz walked away with a settlement package of cash and stock
that may have been worth $100 million. Since then, Ovitz's $20
million investment in Livent Inc., the theater company, has turned
to shreds amid accusations that the company's founder, Garth
Drabinsky, and others engaged in financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Ovitz started the new company, Artists Management
Group, which seeks to manage film stars, directors and writers. He
began his agency as majority owner and hired Rick Yorn, an
aggressive and ambitious 30-year-old manager, whose star client is
Leonardo di Caprio. Ovitz also hired Yorn's sister-in-law, Julie
Silverman Yorn, also a manager. The two represent such performers
as Cameron Diaz, Samuel L. Jackson, Matt Dillon and Geena Davis.
The departure of the Yorns seriously damaged their former
management company, Industry Entertainment, which is owned by
Interpublic Group of Cos., whose partners are furious with Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz is also believed to have spoken in recent weeks to agents
at Creative Artists, International Creative Management and William
Morris in order to lure them to the management company. One agent,
Michael Gruber, a former agent at William Morris whose clients
include George Clooney and Cindy Crawford, is believed to be in
talks with Ovitz.

   Ovitz has told friends that he wants to emulate Brillstein-Grey,
the largest and most successful management company. It was founded
by Bernie Brillstein, a veteran manager whose clients included many
top comedians, and is now run by Brad Grey. Both men are highly
respected in the entertainment business. The company's clients
range from Brad Pitt, Sylvester Stallone and Adam Sandler to the
writers, Elmore Leonard and Larry McMurtry.
</P>
<P>
   Its financial success, though, is largely based on its
television production. Brillstein-Grey has financed such current
shows as the Home Box Office hit series ``The Sopranos,'' NBC's
``News Radio'' and ABC's ``Politically Incorrect.'' Brillstein, who
has tangled with Ovitz, seemed to sum up the feeling now about him.
``This guy has a knack of putting fear into people in this town,''
Brillstein said.

`DILBERT': MADE FOR PEOPLE WHO HATE THEIR JOBS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When you stop to think about it (and you're surely not meant
to), there is something sad about the huge popularity of
``Dilbert,'' the comic strip that assumes everyone hates his or her
job. Confined to their cubicles in a company run by idiot bosses,
Dilbert and his white-collar colleagues make the dronelike world of
Kafka seem congenial. But never mind. Whether its message is
pathetic or true or both, the comic strip has obviously hit a
middle-class nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dilbert'' is now an animated television series, which the
sinking UPN desperately hopes will be a hit. Though the first
episode veers from easy-target jokes to clever lines to truly comic
invention, it is promising enough to make that possible.
</P>
<P>
   Dilbert will never be Oscar Wilde in the workplace, but the show
has enough of an edge to set it apart from other series that call
for a banal ``That's so true!'' response. Though the show begins as
a reflection of reality, its comic appeal is that it swiftly moves
into the realm of lunacy and catharsis, with the characters saying
and doing what all put-upon workers wish they could.
</P>
<P>
   As in the comic strip, Dilbert is a geeky engineer in a
short-sleeved white shirt. (Why anyone would want to identify with
him is another question better left unasked.) With the voice of
Daniel Stern (better known as the voice of the adult Kevin on ``The
Wonder Years'') he is the worried everyman who will never change
his life.
</P>
<P>
   His faithless companion is the spectacle-wearing Dogbert, who
comes from a long cartoon tradition of dogs who are smarter than
their owners.
</P>
<P>
   With the sarcastic voice of Chris Elliott, Dogbert gets the best
lines. In the first episode, Dilbert's company creates a product
bound for failure: the anthrax lozenge. Dogbert is hired as a
consultant to help find a nonlethal way to market it. He begins a
staff meeting with an irrefutable statement, ``Remember, the first
rule of brainstorming is to openly mock the opinions of others.''
</P>
<P>
   At its most humdrum the series goes for the predictable. Dilbert
picks up his voice mail and hears, ``You have 937 messages, all of
which are marked urgent.'' There are also sparks of cleverness.
When the big boss arrives intentionally late for a meeting and
asks, ``Am I late now?'' Dilbert answers, ``Yes, but it's not
because you're an inconsiderate dolt. It's because you're more
important than us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the show's true comic energy is displayed only when it
leaves reality and lands in the realm of absurdism. Budget cuts in
this company lead to rioting, looting and fires in the office.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters include the Pointy-Haired Boss, a moron with
authority and tufts of hair sticking up from his head to resemble
devil's horns. As in the strip, once you've gotten such obvious
visual jokes, the rest depends on punch lines kicking in, so the
future of ``Dilbert'' will depend on its writing. (Scott Adams, the
comic strip's creator, has a heavy involvement in the series as a
writer and an executive producer.)
</P>
<P>
   With its built-in audience and an endless supply of stupid-boss
jokes, ``Dilbert'' may become for UPN what his company calls the
anthrax lozenge: its ``flagship product.''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Art and money, money and art. The two are forever
linked, but it is still unfortunate when they become virtually
synonymous. Right now the Jasper Johns painting ``Numbers, 1964,''
which has hung quietly in a raised area at one end of the lobby of
the New York State Theater since it opened in 1964, seems to look
like little more than cold cash to some people. But the Johns is a
living work of art, a claim that can't be made for all the
sculptures and murals in the buildings and around the plaza at
Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The center has received offers of more than $15 million for the
Johns painting, and the Lincoln Center board has initially endorsed
the idea of a sale. A meeting is scheduled for Monday to discuss
the disposition of the work.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for the sale of the painting, most of whose
proceeds would go to repairing Lincoln Center's aging buildings,
has stirred up heavy opposition. Aside from the moral and legal
issues the prospect has raised, it also prompts some historic and
esthetic questions.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are how all the art at the New York State Theater
came to be where it is, its relationship to the center, its meaning
and quality as art (as opposed to merchandise or public decoration)
and the entwined histories of the theater's principal tenants, the
New York City Ballet, which opposes the sale, and the New York City
Opera, which endorses it.
</P>
<P>
   Most works of contemporary public art are eminently forgettable.
The Johns painting's current predicament suggests that if a work of
public art should turn out to be of lasting historical importance
and its owner is facing financial need, it is vulnerable to sale.
By this rule, the only public artworks that stay put are either
mediocre or such highly visible symbols of communal pride that
selling them would be unthinkable. This is why, for example, Italy
does not start selling off bits of the Roman Forum whenever it has
a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Johns is particularly vulnerable to sale among the works of
art at Lincoln Center. It is one of the most historically important
and most portable, and it is not strongly associated in the
public's mind with Lincoln Center, unlike the enormous Chagall
murals at the Metropolitan Opera House or the Henry Moore sculpture
that occupies the reflecting pool in front of the Vivian Beaumont
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Johns is an unusual kind of public art: it dominates through
reticence and self-containment, inviting private contemplation.
While it was being made, Philip Johnson, the chief architect of the
New York State Theater, described it as ``the subtlest monument of
our time.'' It is the only public commission of an artist famous
for turning public signs _ targets, flags, the alphabet, numbers 0
through 9 _ into a private language.
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat out of character for Johns to accept a public
commission in the first place. (He has never done another, although
he says he has never been asked.) His willingness to do it
undoubtedly reflects his friendship with Johnson, who purchased
works for his own collection and for the Museum of Modern Art from
Johns' legendary first one-man show, at the Leo Castelli Gallery in
1958.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring 9 by 7 feet, ``Numbers, 1964'' is a broad vertical
rectangle calculated to hold the low wide wall it hangs on. Its
glowing metallic surface makes its presence felt a long way off.
This is because the numbers, the grid and the brush strokes are all
considerably larger than in any other of Johns' gridded number
paintings, creating an expanded version of his characteristically
intimate, elegantly worked surface.
</P>
<P>
   The work is not without some typically subversive Johnsian
secrets. The artist used the length of the foot of his friend Merce
Cunningham to determine the unit size of the grid, insinuating a
symbol for a younger, less-established, more radical choreographer
into the grand new house of Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   Barely visible in the work's lower left corner is the phrase
``Cut-Rate,'' one of the collaged bits of newsprint typical of
Johns' paintings. (Some people familiar with the work maintain that
the phrase is actually part of an Andy Warhol silk screen that
Johns incorporated into the surface.) This may have been a comment
on the fact that the artist received only $12,000 for `Numbers,
1964,'' a work that some experts feel would have brought $50,000 on
the open market. Johns recently said that he had intended for the
painting to have a metal frame but could not afford it; he made do
with the rather flimsy wood frame that the work still has.
</P>
<P>
   But the painting is site specific in larger, more historical and
accessible ways, too, if one takes the trouble to look carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the buildings at Lincoln Center, the New York State
Theater is the only one where the art still conveys any of the
artistic vitality of the moment that the building came into being,
and the core of this vitality is the Johns. The painting is where
it is because despite differences in taste the two men primarily
responsible for selecting the art _ Lincoln Kirstein, a founder of
the New York City Ballet, and Johnson _ were as deeply involved
with art as they were, respectively, with dance or architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the other art at Lincoln Center seems to have been
pretty moribund from the start and is certainly irrelevant now.
Walk across the plaza and see what graces the lobby of Avery Fisher
Hall: large bronze sculptures by Dmitri Hadzi and Seymour Lipton,
neither of whom was very significant even at the time they were
selected. (They were donated by and Mrs. David Rockefeller.)
Overhead at Avery Fisher, the handsome kinetic spangles of Richard
Lippold have not held up too well either.
</P>
<P>
   The Chagalls at the Met are lovable and cheerful but only faint
echoes of a great talent that was at its height in the 1910s and
'20s.
</P>
<P>
   The art that Kirstein and Johnson chose, while not all of equal
quality, forms an illuminating time capsule, reflecting their
different sensibilities and sampling the waxing and waning artistic
reputations of a significant transitional period in New York art.
In addition to the work by Johns, who was quite prominent by 1964,
Johnson commissioned works by Lee Bontecou, a widely admired
sculptor of the time whose work has recently enjoyed a strong
revival, and a black-and-white sculpture by Edward Higgins, then an
emerging artist who has gone on to make small, subtly shaped blocks
of stone, earning a small but loyal art world following.
</P>
<P>
   The Higgins work, suggesting two horses back to back, adds an
appropriate motif of movement and grace to the inner lobby of the
theater. But the Bontecou, an elongated work made of gray and cream
canvas sewn to a steel armature, is as specifically scaled to its
site as the Johns, answering back to it from the opposite side of
the lobby, albeit more aggressively. Resembling a car's ornate
front fender, it bristles with mysterious openings suggestive of
eyes, mouths or guns.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These three artworks (the Johns included) were commissioned
through the Leo Castelli Gallery and represent an ascendant
generation that would soon be divided into Pop and Minimalism. But
artists and movements whose stars were fading or temporarily in
eclipse are also represented, completing the time capsule and
giving it a fascinating memento mori cast.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of Abstract Expressionism is palpable in the
fluttering forms of Reuben Nakian's bronze sculpture ``Voyage to
Crete'' and the lacerated surfaces of a sculpture by the now
forgotten Francesco Somaini. Jacques Lipchitz's ``Birth of the
Muses'' conjures European modernism with a certain period-look
vitality.
</P>
<P>
   The other two works here are closely tied to Kirstein, who was
an advocate of new art in his youth but was belligerently out of
step with contemporary art by the early 60s and also loved to play
favorites. Thus it was that one of his proteges, Yasuhide Kobashi,
was invited to make the large, gold broochlike sculptures for the
stairway landings at either end of the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Kirstein also saw to it that the building contained a work
adapted from an artist he felt passionately about: the strange
polystylist Elie Nadelman, whose big, buoyant sculptures of pairs
of curvaceous circus women, carved in white marble, dominate the
promenade above the lobby. They were enlarged from smaller works
owned by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, to the consternation of many
Nadelman admirers since the artist was dead and had never made
anything so large.
</P>
<P>
   But these demure towering kewpies create one of the most
commanding indoor sculptural spectacles in New York City.
Nadelman's reputation has, like Bontecou's, risen dramatically in
the last 20 years, confirming the foresight that Kirstein always,
imperiously, seemed to claim for himself.
</P>
<P>
   This bit of esthetic history underscores an interesting fact:
The New York State Theater was built for the New York City Ballet.
While it was expected that the City Opera would also become a
tenant, it did not arrive until 1966 and played no part in the
selection of the artworks. This may explain why the board of the
opera company favors the sale, and the ballet's board does not.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, when Johns accepted the State Theater commission, he
was 33. A few months earlier Newsweek had described him as
``probably the most influential young painter in the world.''
Instead of being eminently forgettable, the work that he produced
for the theater is merely eminent, one of the best works of
20th-century public art in the country.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the centerpiece of a whole greater than the sum of
its parts, a rich slice of New York cultural history fraught with
talent, hubris and varying fortunes that has, miraculously,
remained intact. Given the winds of philistinism that regularly
blow through this town, the very existence of this ensemble is a
bit of New York City dumb luck.

 &HT;    MEXICAN DEVOUT RUSH TO SEE POPE, WHO SEEKS CATHOLIC RECONQUEST
OF AMERICAS
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Using careful, coded language to urge better
treatment of Indians and the poor in this hemisphere, Pope John
Paul II continued his reconquest of Mexico Sunday by celebrating
mass here before a throng of more than a million people.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of others jammed the area outside the
Brothers Rodriguez Racetrack, where the pope spoke. People intent
on trying to see the Catholic leader braved chilly morning
temperatures and clouds of dust choking the dry winter air, as they
tried to rush through gates to enter the arena.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's message on Sunday was mainly spiritual, as he
exhorted eager Catholics in the multitude to become ``fishermen of
the people'' and recruit new souls in the Americas for the church's
third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He also condemned abortion -- without using the word -- by
appealing especially to Mexicans. Mexico represents the second
biggest Catholic country in the world and a growing influence in
the Catholic church in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let no Mexican dare to finish with the precious and sacred
gift of life in a mother's womb,'' said the pope, who will speak
publicly several more times in Mexico before flying to St. Louis,
Mo. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican legislators have been debating legalizing abortion,
which is practiced secretly here. Other forms of birth control are
available in Mexico and their use is encouraged by the government.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening -- during a meeting with Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo and diplomats stationed in Mexico -- the pontiff's
remarks were more in a political vein.
</P>
<P>
   Using diplomatic language, he drew from a new papal document on
the challenges for the church in the Americas that warns of the
hazards of free-market reforms, including a widening gap between
rich and poor, materialism, corruption and the abuse of Indians and
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon of corruption deplorably invades wide segments
of the social fabric of some peoples, and those who suffer the
consequences do not always have the possibility to demand justice
and responsibility,'' the pope told Zedillo, a proponent of
free-market reforms who has struggled with corruption among Mexican
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   The papal document on the Americas, which was released in Mexico
Saturday, explicitly outlines the pope's guarded view of
free-market reforms sweeping Mexico and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The global economy, the pope said, has ``positive consequences''
because it unifies nations and can provide better services to
people. But, he said, ``the poor are becoming ever more numerous,
victims of specific policies that are often unjust.''
</P>
<P>
   In the papal document, the pope also attacks the media for
pushing messages that are ``often materialistic, in the face of
which it is difficult to maintain a lively commitment to the values
of the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the pope's visit to Mexico -- his fourth -- prompted
an unprecedented outpouring of commercials, billboards and products
by ``official sponsors'' designed to sell the visit.
</P>
<P>
   The pope chose Mexico to unveil his plan for the church in the
Americas because it is so fervently Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   In all three public appearances the popular leader has made so
far he has mentioned Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe -- proposing, in
fact, that she serve as a symbol for rejuvenating Catholic faith
throughout the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has also mentioned his affection for Indians
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The references are significant because one of Mexico's thorniest
ongoing crises is the conflict between the government and armed
Indian rebels in the state of Chiapas. The rebels allege the
government's policies are worsening poverty and violence in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, as expected, has not commented on Chiapas directly.
But it's clear that the conflict, which has pit clergy in Chiapas
against the government, is on the pope's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I greet the Mexican Indians of different areas of the
country,'' the pope said Sunday during his mass. ``The pope feels
very close to all of you, admiring the values of your cultures, and
encouraging you to overcome, with hope, the hard situations you
live today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Build the future for you and your sons with responsibility,''
the pontiff added. ``That is the reason I'm asking all lay faithful
of this country to promise to help and promote the poorest of the
community. It is mandatory that each and every Mexican receive an
income that allows him to live with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Dolores Villagomez, theologian with Mexico City's Center
for Ecumenical Studies, said the pope has been reserved in his
public speeches and has touched mostly on traditional themes -- the
family, faith, messages against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But the document charting the church's future, she said, is
important because it gives license to Catholics to get involved in
political action against economic inequality, and racial and class
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows people to show social commitment,'' Villagomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans from around the country who attended the Sunday
mass or lined up to catch a glimpse of the pope came hoping that
the pope would help them overcome an illness, deliver a healthy
baby -- or find a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the he brings us stability and more strength to
work harder. We suffer in this world because there is no work,''
said Amada Gordillo Terreros, 58, who was among a crowd shouting at
a guard to open a closed gate to the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Some complained that wealthy people had received preferential
treatment and obtained tickets to the event more easily than those
of humble origins.
</P>
<P>
   Lilia Griselda Bautista, who had traveled from Michoacan state,
had brought her daughter -- who suffers from lupus -- to receive
the pope's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The girl had a ticket to sit near the pope, but she and her
mother were turned back by guards, Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariana Ferro, eight months into a troubled pregnancy, had
arrived at 3 a.m. (local time) Sunday to make sure she got into the
mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have faith that with the pope's blessing my pregnancy will
turn out well,'' said Ferro, who was exhausted and covered in dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``To receive,'' she added, ``you must give and give with faith.
I am willing to do that and educate my child in the new evangelism
that will be the light of the third millennium, just as the pope
said.''

PINT-SIZED DEAL GIVES AT&AMP;T A BARREL'S WORTH OF CHALLENGES

<P>
   When it comes to big deals, AT&AMP;T Corp. can move fast. It's the
small ones that can take time.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after AT&AMP;T announced last June that it would acquire
Tele-Communications Inc. for $31.8 billion in one of the most
complicated communications takeovers in history, for example,
AT&AMP;T's chairman proudly pointed out that the pact had come together
in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So why did it take four months for AT&AMP;T to put together last
week's $192.5 million agreement to acquire most of Smartalk
Teleservices Inc., a small, distressed seller of long-distance
calling cards?
</P>
<P>
   The answer illuminates the world of mergers, the power of AT&AMP;T
and the crushing difficulty of being a small communications company
richer in concepts than in capital.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Smartalk issued one of the telecommunications
industry's stranger news releases. Smartalk had agreed to sell its
assets to AT&AMP;T for an amount that was barely more than one day's
revenue for the long-distance giant.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the odd part. ``Separately today,'' the release
continued, Smartalk had filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing separate about the two events _ AT&AMP;T's
buying a company even as it was filing for bankruptcy. Although
AT&AMP;T and Smartalk declined to comment on their deal, court
documents and executives close to the transaction indicated that it
was the merger negotiations with AT&AMP;T that prompted Smartalk to
file for bankruptcy, thereby allowing AT&AMP;T to acquire Smartalk's
assets while avoiding its liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a case of a giant stomping a flea. Smartalk was
on its last financial leg, and it had largely crippled itself.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by Robert Lorsch, a former marketing executive, in Los
Angeles in 1995, Smartalk was one of the first companies to mine
the market for prepaid calling cards. The concept was simple: Sell
cards enabling people to make long-distance calls from pay phones,
for a flat per-minute fee. Smartalk bought the long-distance
minutes in bulk from MCI and other carriers and then sold them to
consumers for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The business took off, Smartalk went public the following year,
and by 1997 Lorsch was boasting in an article in Los Angeles
Business Journal: ``I put $5,000 in the bank in October 1994 and
now have a company with almost a quarter-of-a-billion-dollar market
cap. That is a growth story.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether from confidence or hubris, Smartalk went on to acquire
nine other companies in little more than a year, giving it a 25
percent share of the prepaid calling card market.
</P>
<P>
   But Lorsch was no Bernard Ebbers, the communications takeover
wizard who built deal upon deal and is now chief executive of MCI
Worldcom Inc. Smartalk was consumed by its acquisitions, failing to
integrate its various financial systems successfully, according to
executives close to the company. And since the company did not own
its own long-distance network, it had difficulty controlling costs.
</P>
<P>
   Then came perhaps the worst embarrassment a public company can
face: the need to restate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the company said it would have to restate its
financial results for all of 1997, after revealing that
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting giant, had uncovered
potential problems in the way the company accounted for its
acquisitions. That disclosure damaged Smartalk's credibility and
essentially destroyed the company's ability to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   So in September Smartalk entered negotiations to be acquired by
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The more AT&AMP;T looked into Smartalk's books, though, the more
problems it uncovered, according to executives close to the deal.
Some of those executives even questioned whether AT&AMP;T would have
been willing to begin talks with Smartalk if it had realized what
it was getting into.
</P>
<P>
   Then Smartalk discovered that its financial reporting problems
were not over. On Jan. 9, the company announced that accounting
issues would cause it to restate its earnings for the third quarter
to reflect lower revenue and higher expenses than it had previously
reported. This additional bit of bad news clinched AT&AMP;T's decision
that it would not acquire the company unless Smartalk filed for
bankruptcy, according to executives close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   With Smartalk filing for Chapter 11, AT&AMP;T could acquire the good
things about the company _ its retail distribution arrangements
with prestigious clients like American Express and the U.S. Postal
Service _ while letting the bankruptcy court decide what to do with
the more than $200 million in debts.
</P>
<P>
   As in most bankruptcies, the creditors will probably suffer.
Executives at one of the long-distance companies to which Smartalk
is indebted say they are not expecting to get more than about 70
percent of their money. Those holding Smartalk's $150 million in
bonds may get less than that.
</P>
<P>
   Smartalk's stockholders are already essentially wiped out. After
trading as high as $36.50 last March, the company's stock has
consistently traded below $3 this month. On Tuesday, the last day
the shares traded, they closed below $2.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives close to the agreement said that as recently as
last summer Smartalk might have fetched as much as $750 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is possible that another company could yet trump
AT&AMP;T's offer. Now that Smartalk has filed for Chapter 11, a
bankruptcy court is expected to hold an open auction for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Any additional bids would start somewhere north of $192.5
million.

SPORTS COLUMN: IN MIAMI, THE WORDS ARE ALWAYS SUPER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two days before Super Bowl II, the first in Miami, Vince
Lombardi looked around at his Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the last time we'll be together,'' the legendary
coach said, his voice breaking. ``So ... uh ....''
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi turned away, Packer guard Jerry Kramer wrote in his
book ``Instant Replay,'' and slid into a chair next to a film
projector. Emotionally, he had indicated to his players that this
would be his last game as the Packers' coach. And it was.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the Packers routed the Oakland Raiders, 33-14,
for their record third straight National Football League
championship and fifth in seven seasons, Lombardi resigned as coach
to concentrate on his duties as the Packer general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Without realizing it, Vince Lombardi had established a Super
Bowl tradition in Miami where the words have often been more
memorable than the games.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year after Lombardi's goodbye, Joe Namath, with a
napkin-wrapped glass of Johnny Walker Red in his right hand, stood
behind a microphone at the Miami Springs Villas banquet room to
accept an award as 1968's Pro Football Player of the Year from the
Miami Touchdown Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win Sunday,'' the Jets' quarterback told 600
listeners. ``I guarantee you.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets fulfilled that guarantee with a 16-7 upset of the
Baltimore Colts at the Orange Bowl, Namath's words were chiseled
into pro football history. Two years later, Duane Thomas, a
sometimes silent running back for the Dallas Cowboys, chiseled
another phrase as he sat on the grass before practice at nearby
Fort Lauderdale Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the Super Bowl,'' he was asked by an inquiring reporter,
``the ultimate game?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's the ultimate game,'' he said, ``why are they playing
it again next year?''
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out to be the ultimate game for the Baltimore
Colts, who won the Super Bowl for the only time in franchise
history, 16-13, over the Cowboys on Jim O'Brien's 32-yard field
goal with 5 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this dream last week, this long field goal going through
to end it all,'' O'Brien said later. ``But I didn't know I'd be the
kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Lynn Swann, the Pittsburgh Steelers' acrobatic
wide receiver, didn't know where he was after suffering a
concussion in the American Football Conference championship game
with the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   But in Super Bowl X, Swann caught 4 passes from Terry Bradshaw
for 164 yards, a 41-yard average that included a 64-yard touchdown
and a 53-yard aerial act, as the Steelers held on to defeat the
Cowboys, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there hadn't been a two-week break,'' Swann said, ``I
couldn't have played in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Super Bowl XIII, Thomas (Hollywood) Henderson, a Cowboy
linebacker, wisecracked, ``Bradshaw couldn't spell `cat' if you
spotted him the `c' and the `a.''' Bradshaw's answer was to throw
four touchdown passes as the Steelers won, 35-31, their fourth
Super Bowl victory in six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the Super Bowl finally returned to Miami, this
time in new Joe Robbie Stadium: the San Francisco 49ers against the
Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters arrived in the press box, an NFL release
contained the most stunning words in Super Bowl history: ``Stanley
Wilson of the Bengals will be ineligible to play in Super Bowl
XXIII due to a violation of the the NFL's substance-abuse policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Wilson, a fullback who had been suspended for
the 1987 season for cocaine use but professed to be at the Super
Bowl ``on business,'' had escaped from the Bengals' hotel after
being found alone in his hotel room with evidence of cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers won, 20-16, when Joe Montant found John Taylor in the
end zone with a 10-yard pass with 34 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the 49ers remember the start of that final drive at their
8-yard line with 3 minutes 20 seconds left. Despite the Bengals'
16-13 lead, Montana calmly glanced beyond the huddle into the
stands and recognized a movie actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, look, there's John Candy,'' Montana said.
</P>
<P>
   With those words in that situation, no wonder Montana's
teammates knew him as Joe Cool. But by Super Bowl XXIX, Steve
Young, now the 49er quarterback, finally shook the Montana monkey
off his back when he threw six touchdown passes in the 49ers' 49-26
stomping of the San Diego Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To throw six touchdown passes, to play what you believe is
your best game ever,'' Young said, ``you couldn't ask for more.''
</P>
<P>
   And judging by the Miami tradition, whether the Denver Broncos
or the Atlanta Falcons win Sunday in Super Bowl XXXIII in Pro
Player Stadium, somebody's words might well be more memorable than
the game.

RESEARCHER SURVIVES DEADLY BITE OF SNAKE TO RETURN TO RAIN FOREST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Art available on NYT database) 
 
By CINDY HORSWELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Sweeping her flashlight from side to side, Maura Maple
walked down a path into the lush rain forest of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   The light illuminated small areas in the darkness, but it was
not enough to show Maple that a fer-de-lance _ one of the world's
deadliest snakes _ lay in her path.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old doctoral student from Baytown, Texas, had gone
to Costa Rica to conduct research on a type of frog. It was a
6-foot-long snake, however, that changed her plans with a painful
bite that threatened to claim her leg, and even her life.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Maple has immersed herself in her research during
monthslong trips into the rain forest surrounding the La Selva
Biological Station, about a two-hour drive from San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found it hard to believe that anyone would pay me to sit
in the middle of a rain forest, enjoying the solitude, and
observe,'' she said of the grant money she receives.
</P>
<P>
   Maple is gathering information for her biology thesis on the
parenting habits of the Strawberry Poison Arrow Frog. The inchlong
frog, a protected species with a bright-red body and blue legs,
secretes a poison from its skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natives used to rub arrows on the frog's skin and then shoot
their prey with it,'' she said, ``but it isn't really that toxic
unless you eat (the frog). One researcher ate some pretzels after
handling them and his mouth went numb like he'd been to the
dentist.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, her parents _ Jim Maple, a retired Exxon engineer and
former Baytown school board member, and Betty Maple, a retired
education testing consultant _ were concerned when their daughter
talked of studying poisonous frogs.
</P>
<P>
   She managed to allay those fears, but her parents grew concerned
again after visiting the biological station and catching a glimpse
of another poisonous resident, the fer-de-lance.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, they stopped at a Whole Earth Provision store in
Houston to buy their daughter a ``snake stick'' as a Christmas
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guide in Costa Rica had told us that he wouldn't go into the
rain forest without one,'' Maple's father said. ``You can use it to
stick into bushes to ward off anything dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   They bought the stick Dec. 4, 1997 _ the day their daughter was
bitten.
</P>
<P>
   That day, she was beginning a week at the biology station as a
research assistant for her college adviser, collecting frogs for a
breeding colony.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, Maple and other researchers decided to gather at
the gazebo in a clearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, I wear the recommended rubber boots, which protect
against snakebites,'' she said. ``But this happened at the end of
the day when everyone was relaxing. I just had on sandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the group with her flashlight, she said, she scanned the
path carefully but missed the fer-de-lance _ whose velvetlike skin
has ``x'' patterns in browns, grays and yellows that make effective
camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   The fer-de-lance _ whose name is French for ``iron of lance''
because its triangular head resembles a spearhead _ often stations
itself along trails to wait for its quarry. The snake, which needs
only about five small mammals per year, strikes its prey and then
waits about five minutes for its venom to take effect, said Dr.
David L. Hardy Sr.
</P>
<P>
   A retired anesthesiologist from Tucson, Ariz., Hardy has been to
the biology station to insert transmitters on fer-de-lances to
study their behavior in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Western Hemisphere, this snake is one of the most
deadly around,'' he said. ``It's right up there at the top with the
bushmaster, jararaca and eastern and western diamondback
rattlesnakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The viper probably sensed the heat from Maple's exposed foot and
mistook it for a small mammal, Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Maple didn't know the snake was there until she felt the fangs
sink into the top of her left foot. She shook her leg and the snake
retreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, all I could think about was how gorgeous it was _ a
textbook example of a fer-de-lance. Then the pain began to set
in,'' she said. ``It felt like a nail had been driven through my
foot. One fang had gone completely through to the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew she had to stay calm because she had only
about four hours to get treatment. Maple hobbled about 50 yards
with the help of friends but then let them carry her because each
step felt like a knife in her foot, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At the lab, they applied an extractor to suck venom from the
bite. The venom streamed from one fang hole at first and then
trickled out for several more minutes. However, by the time the
device was applied to the second hole, nothing came out, Maple
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she was carried to a car for a long trip through the
mountains to the hospital at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the ride there, I couldn't help thinking about the film
that they'd shown us at orientation about people bitten by this
viper and other poisonous snakes. It was a horror show about people
dying or losing limbs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived about two hours after being bitten. Hospital workers
quickly injected her with 17 vials of antivenin, nearly twice the
amount usually used.
</P>
<P>
   Maple said her leg swelled until her knee was the size of a
volleyball. She begged doctors to operate to reduce the swelling,
but they had to wait until the next day for the anti-coagulant from
the venom to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they peeled back the skin on her leg with a 1
1/2-inch-deep incision, removing the connective tissue between the
muscles in a procedure called a fasciotomy. This released the
pressure on the leg and allowed for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The incision is left open so it can be cleaned regularly to
avoid infection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they would give me something to knock me out when
they scrubbed it, and sometimes they wouldn't,'' she said,
recalling that she would hold onto the bed posts and scream during
the two-hour procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, doctors closed the wound to a few inches above her
ankle. It left a serpentine scar from her knee to her ankle and an
open incision across her foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor was not sure if he could save my foot,'' Maple said.
``He kept removing dead tissue and was unable to stop the
infection.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 days, her doctors decided she was stable enough to be
flown to Methodist Hospital in Houston on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   At Methodist, Dr. David Netscher, a plastic surgeon, discovered
some tendons, cartilage and other flesh that had to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were thrilled that they could save Maple's foot,
although the top half had been removed. Doctors later rebuilt the
top of her foot with grafts of muscle from her abdomen and skin
from her thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they removed the bandage to show me my new foot, the
doctors thought it was gorgeous,'' Maple said. ``All I saw was a
swollen thing with holes in it like Swiss cheese that was purple,
pink and red. It didn't look like a foot at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Discharged after 40 days of hospitalization, she began months of
physical rehabilitation. Her toes, pointed like a ballerina's,
would not move at first.
</P>
<P>
   Maple slowly progressed from her wheelchair to crutches, then to
a cane. Now she can walk again, although she tires easily.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she doesn't complain about the ordeal that left her with
a battered, numb and arthritic foot. In fact, she already has made
two trips back to the rain forest _ one to thank the nurses who
tended her, and another to tell her story for the TV program
``National Geographic Explorer.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN DEVOUT RUSH TO SEE POPE, WHO SEEKS CATHOLIC RECONQUEST
OF AMERICAS
 &HT;    EDs: With optional trim.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Using careful, coded language to urge better
treatment of Indians and the poor in this hemisphere, Pope John
Paul II continued his reconquest of Mexico Sunday by celebrating
mass here before a throng of more than a million people.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of others jammed the area outside the
Brothers Rodriguez Racetrack, where the pope spoke. People intent
on trying to see the Catholic leader braved chilly morning
temperatures and clouds of dust choking the dry winter air, as they
tried to rush through gates to enter the arena.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's message on Sunday was mainly spiritual, as he
exhorted eager Catholics in the multitude to become ``fishermen of
the people'' and recruit new souls in the Americas for the church's
third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He also condemned abortion -- without using the word -- by
appealing especially to Mexicans. Mexico represents the second
biggest Catholic country in the world and a growing influence in
the Catholic church in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let no Mexican dare to finish with the precious and sacred
gift of life in a mother's womb,'' said the pope, who will speak
publicly several more times in Mexico before flying to St. Louis,
Mo. on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican legislators have been debating legalizing abortion,
which is practiced secretly here. Other forms of birth control are
available in Mexico and their use is encouraged by the government.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening -- during a meeting with Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo and diplomats stationed in Mexico -- the pontiff's
remarks were more in a political vein.
</P>
<P>
   Using diplomatic language, he drew from a new papal document on
the challenges for the church in the Americas that warns of the
hazards of free-market reforms, including a widening gap between
rich and poor, materialism, corruption and the abuse of Indians and
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon of corruption deplorably invades wide segments
of the social fabric of some peoples, and those who suffer the
consequences do not always have the possibility to demand justice
and responsibility,'' the pope told Zedillo, a proponent of
free-market reforms who has struggled with corruption among Mexican
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   The papal document on the Americas, which was released in Mexico
Saturday, explicitly outlines the pope's guarded view of
free-market reforms sweeping Mexico and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The global economy, the pope said, has ``positive consequences''
because it unifies nations and can provide better services to
people. But, he said, ``the poor are becoming ever more numerous,
victims of specific policies that are often unjust.''
</P>
<P>
   In the papal document, the pope also attacks the media for
pushing messages that are ``often materialistic, in the face of
which it is difficult to maintain a lively commitment to the values
of the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the pope's visit to Mexico -- his fourth -- prompted
an unprecedented outpouring of commercials, billboards and products
by ``official sponsors'' designed to sell the visit.
</P>
<P>
   The pope chose Mexico to unveil his plan for the church in the
Americas because it is so fervently Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   In all three public appearances the popular leader has made so
far he has mentioned Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe -- proposing, in
fact, that she serve as a symbol for rejuvenating Catholic faith
throughout the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has also mentioned his affection for Indians
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The references are significant because one of Mexico's thorniest
ongoing crises is the conflict between the government and armed
Indian rebels in the state of Chiapas. The rebels allege the
government's policies are worsening poverty and violence in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, as expected, has not commented on Chiapas directly.
But it's clear that the conflict, which has pit clergy in Chiapas
against the government, is on the pope's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I greet the Mexican Indians of different areas of the
country,'' the pope said Sunday during his mass. ``The pope feels
very close to all of you, admiring the values of your cultures, and
encouraging you to overcome, with hope, the hard situations you
live today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Build the future for you and your sons with responsibility,''
the pontiff added. ``That is the reason I'm asking all lay faithful
of this country to promise to help and promote the poorest of the
community. It is mandatory that each and every Mexican receive an
income that allows him to live with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Dolores Villagomez, theologian with Mexico City's Center
for Ecumenical Studies, said the pope has been reserved in his
public speeches and has touched mostly on traditional themes -- the
family, faith, messages against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But the document charting the church's future, she said, is
important because it gives license to Catholics to get involved in
political action against economic inequality, and racial and class
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows people to show social commitment,'' Villagomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans from around the country who attended the Sunday
mass or lined up to catch a glimpse of the pope came hoping that
the pope would help them overcome an illness, deliver a healthy
baby -- or find a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the he brings us stability and more strength to
work harder. We suffer in this world because there is no work,''
said Amada Gordillo Terreros, 58, who was among a crowd shouting at
a guard to open a closed gate to the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Some complained that wealthy people had received preferential
treatment and obtained tickets to the event more easily than those
of humble origins.
</P>
<P>
   Lilia Griselda Bautista, who had traveled from Michoacan state,
had brought her daughter -- who suffers from lupus -- to receive
the pope's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   The girl had a ticket to sit near the pope, but she and her
mother were turned back by guards, Bautista said.
</P>
<P>
   Mariana Ferro, eight months into a troubled pregnancy, had
arrived at 3 a.m. (local time) Sunday to make sure she got into the
mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have faith that with the pope's blessing my pregnancy will
turn out well,'' said Ferro, who was exhausted and covered in dust.
</P>

   ``To receive,'' she added, ``you must give and give with faith.
I am willing to do that and educate my child in the new evangelism
that will be the light of the third millennium, just as the pope
said.''

CERTIFICATES OF AUTHENTICITY AIMED AT LIMITING MUSIC PIRACY ON THE
INTERNET 
 (DW) 

</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move designed to cut down piracy of music on the Internet,
three dozen software and hardware companies and online retailers
plan Monday to endorse the use of a so-called certificates of
authentication that would accompany songs and albums distributed
digitally.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies and other authorized sellers of licensed music
would be able to include the certificates, which would appear on a
computer monitor when users open a music file, said Gerry Kearby,
chief executive of Liquid Audio. His company makes online audio
software and is a leader of the new group, the Genuine Music
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Various factions in the record industry, including musicians and
executives, are pondering ways to cope with what they say is
rampant proliferation of pirated music files on the Internet.
Kearby said the certificate will not prevent illegal copying, but
is meant to help publicize the names of licensed dealers, provide
links to their World Wide Web sites, and perhaps deter users from
making unlicensed copies of music.

SPORTS COLUMN: OLYMPIC SCANDAL NOT CLEANSED BY SACRIFICING SMALL
FRY
</HEADLINE>

 By GEORGE VECSEY

</P>
<P>
   There is a morbid law school joke that goes: ``What do you call
500 lawyers at the bottom of the ocean?'' Answer: ``A good
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee made a minimal effort to
purge itself Sunday when a special committee voted to expel six
delegates who had most blatantly taken gifts during the bidding
process. Three other IOC delegates have resigned and another has
been chastised.
</P>
<P>
   Nine departures out of 114 delegates are a start, a token, a
gesture, a bit of ballast tossed overboard to keep the IOC's cushy
little balloon afloat. But lightening the load by less than 10
percent is not going to help because the selection of all recent
Olympic host cities is permanently tainted.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic motto _ ``Swifter, Higher, Stronger'' _ is now
understood to be an auctioneer's chant in a corrupt bidding system
that has allowed wealthy cities like Sydney, Australia, (and
Nagano, Japan, and Salt Lake City) to grease delegates with lavish
presents. I would call them bribes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the real sports in this Olympic scandal have been the
Chinese. They have not yet made an international uproar about the
very real prospect that Beijing was cheated out of being host to
the 2000 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC president, insisted Sunday in
Lausanne, Switzerland, that he will remain in office, and he
scoffed at the suggestion that he had some responsibility for this
scandal, which took place right under his aristocratic nose. Where
are Henry Hyde and Bob Barr when we really need them?
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's meeting, the IOC announced it would implement new
rules for the selection of the 2006 Winter Games, meaning that
delegates will not be allowed to visit bidding cities and payoffs
will not be permitted. It's a little late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not accusing any member of corruption or bribery, or
suggesting that there was criminal conduct,'' said Richard Pound,
the IOC vice president from Montreal who led the inquiry into the
current Salt Lake scandal, and is one of the more forthright people
in the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``These members are guilty of breaking the oath they took and
bringing the reputation of the IOC into disrepute,'' Pound added.
</P>
<P>
   Right. But there is more than a handful of delegates being
caught with their hands in the caviar jar. The IOC insults our
intelligence and morality.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake scandal is at least mollified by everybody's
agreeing it was the best candidate for 2002. And nobody is ever
going to find written proof why the 1998 Winter Games were awarded
to a backwater Japanese town in a soupy climate, the closest to the
equator that Winter Games have ever been held. Officials in Nagano
burned their records. Charming.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is the real loser. Cultured and beautiful and prosperous
and gracious, Sydney won the 2000 Summer Games. At the time, it was
cheap and easy for the IOC to posture that the developed city in
the democratic nation had paid its dues, and that Beijing should
improve its economy and its air quality and its human-rights
protection, and wait its turn.
</P>
<P>
   Now it turns out the vote may have been bought. In what I find
to be an astonishing mixture of candor and gall, the Australian
Olympic Committee president, John Coates, has admitted giving
$35,000 each to two African IOC delegates in 1993 for their
national sports programs, the night before Sydney defeated Beijing,
45-43.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to create a sense of them having some obligation to
you when they go into that room,'' Coates said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   What is worse is that the IOC vice president, Kevan Gosper, one
of the more cosmopolitan voices in the squalor of the 1996 Atlanta
Summer Games, is pushing for a quick vote of confidence for Sydney.
Did I mention that Gosper is Australian?
</P>
<P>
   Gosper said he saw nothing ``sinister'' in the $70,000 in
payments, adding. ``I think there is a good case for reviewing
regulations and process.'' Coates, the payer of the $70,000 gifts,
said the system ``should be changed,'' adding that ``it is a
process that we went into with our eyes wide open.'' He admitted,
``We didn't win it on the beauty of the city and the sporting
facilities we had to offer, and we were never going to.'' What a
cynical sentiment from a man running an Olympic organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sydney wants a vote of confidence from the IOC
because the international corporate sponsors are itchy about their
sugar water and their gas-guzzlers being tainted with a lingering
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, Samaranch and Gosper and Coates hold on to their
positions. They are going to try to paint themselves as reformers.
They need a visit from a posse of Olympic sponsors, who are not
planning to write any more checks until this thing is cleaned up.
Samaranch might not want to see a delegation from Beijing on his
doorstep either. With any luck at all, the Beijing sports officials
are boning up on that most delightful of Western concepts, the
lawsuit. &QL;

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: VYING FOR GUYS' REMOTE-CONTROL FINGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TV-RATINGS-RESCUE) 
(lb) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am beginning to feel sorry for males ages 18 to 34. They have
nothing to watch on television. Yes, they watch ``E.R.'' and
``Friends,'' as the women in their lives do, but when they're left
alone in a room with a remote, channels change.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, in their desperate search for macho stimulation,
young men are reduced to tuning in to wrestling shows in which the
fighters hit their opponents with metal folding chairs (this sort
of thing is done much more convincingly on ``The Jerry Springer
Show'') and lowbrow documentary programming like ``World's Wildest
Police Videos'' on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent episode, there was, judging by the number of
sirens, more action going on outside my living-room window than on
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Because advertisers are dying to get young men's attention,
companies will pay amazingly high sums for commercials on shows
that they watch. That's largely because young men don't devote much
time to television overall and, like all young consumers, they have
money to spend before they've developed firm brand loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a group they watch less television than any other age
segment other than teens and kids,'' said Steve Sternberg, a senior
partner of TN Media, a company that advises advertisers on buying
commercial time on television. ``There are a lot of advertising
categories, such as soft drinks, movie companies, sneakers, beer
companies _ there's a lot of clients that are trying to reach that
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the cost of 30 seconds on ``The Simpsons'' ($230,000),
a favorite among young male viewers, with the same 30 seconds on
``Cosby'' ($115,000), whose audience is older and includes more
women.
</P>
<P>
   So programmers are madly scrambling to create series that appeal
to young men. This is why, I had been told, there are so few women
over 28 seen on the networks these days. This is why terrible shows
like ``Men Behaving Badly'' (NBC, 1996-97), best known for the
bachelor character who used his underwear as a coffee filter, were
born. This is why the people at NBC are still crying about the loss
of ``Seinfeld,'' a series that performed the miracle of attracting
huge numbers of both men and women.
</P>
<P>
   So not long ago I watched a variety of shows that have
particularly high numbers of young male viewers. The network
programming was chosen from Nielsen Media Research's list of the 25
most popular shows among 18-to-34-year-old males, with an emphasis
on series that rated much higher with men than with women.
Wrestling is included because it represents three of the 10 most
popular shows on cable in that demographic group.
</P>
<P>
   I expected crotch and flatulence jokes on all these shows. (But
then I like ``South Park.'') I found some of those, but I also
found voice-overs shouting with feigned amazement, as if the
announcers were broadcasting the crash of the Hindenburg live. And
a lot of commercials for motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   `GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS: PRIME TIME' (Fox, Tuesdays). The
description of the episode in the listings was enough to hook me:
``Kaptain Robbie Knievel; man snorts milk to squirt it out his
eyes.'' Knievel (Evel's son) appeared in a motorcycle jump that set
no new record, and a young graphics designer from Vancouver did the
milk trick, which was presented with close-ups of his eyes, instant
replays and a quick nature film about the horned toad, which does a
similar trick with blood.
</P>
<P>
   The show also included a man setting a record for the number of
basketballs he could keep spinning atop ballpoint pens, and a visit
with a baby who weighed 68 pounds at 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of the hour, however, was the man who called
himself ``the human toolbox.'' He hammered a nail and an ice pick
into his face, bragging all the while about how close he was coming
to his brain stem. Don't even ask about the variable-speed drill.
If the point of the show was to make the girls squirm and cover
their eyes, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   `WORLD'S WILDEST POLICE VIDEOS' (Fox, Thursdays). ``Real cops,
real crooks, real cases!'' the announcer promises at the beginning
of the show. What you see ``may shock you,'' he warns, but ``we
bring it to you for one reason: because knowledge is power.'' Uh,
OK. Then I am now more powerful, having seen suspects drive in the
wrong direction on a freeway and watched a pizzeria thief lock
himself in at the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the distinction of this show, a series of segments in which
police officers triumph over foolish criminals, is the ``you
shouldn't have messed with us'' voice-overs. The tone is a cross
between Eliot Ness and a Mickey Spillane novel.
</P>
<P>
   Of a team of police officers in Dooly County, Ga.: ``The Dooly
deputies take them down quick and hard.'' Of a rapper caught after
a car chase: ``The only record people are talking about is his
criminal record.'' Of a drunken driver: ``But he has no leg to
stand on, not with a belly full of tequila.'' Of drug dealers
arrested after a car chase: ``What they got was a bumpy ride to
hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have been a slow car-chase week because the hour
included some old film of ``crazed British soccer fans'' and a look
at Pinky, an 8-pound cat that went nuts and bit a policeman's inner
thigh.
</P>
<P>
   `WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY?' (ABC, Wednesdays). The British
version of this show, in which comedians improvise sketches, was
actually sort of verbal. The American version, with Drew Carey,
prime time's regular-guy sitcom hero, as host, tends to get more
physical.
</P>
<P>
   In the premiere episode, which was rerun recently, one comedian
stuck his head between the legs of another, supposedly to convey
the idea of a foal being born. A segment in which the panel of
comedians put on funny hats and were called on to come up with a
funny line about each one elicited the words ``horny'' (Viking
headgear), ``booty'' (in the hip-hop sexual sense) and a slang term
for male genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `W.C.W. SATURDAY NIGHT' (TBS). TBS happened to be doing a World
Championship Wrestling show dedicated to the career of someone
named Goldberg, a 300-pound-plus wrestler with stringy hair,
wearing a one-piece Spandex ensemble in an orange-and-black print.
</P>
<P>
   The announcers used the same everything-is-an-exclamation voice
as the guy on the police show. ``The one undeniable factor of
Goldberg is the power!'' ``The pain is registering, but it has no
effect on Goldberg!'' ``He's so strong! He's so focused! He's a
hunter!''
</P>
<P>
   Hulk Hogan, who seems to have changed his name to Hollywood
Hogan, disagreed. ``Goldberg ain't nobody,'' he took the microphone
to announce to the crowd. ``He's not in the same league as
Hollywood.'' This was right before Goldberg defeated him in the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Hollywood took off his huge belt and hit Goldberg
with it like a whip. Then he picked up a metal folding chair and
attacked his opponent with it. When Goldberg won, the victor roared
at the camera. In ``Mythologies'' Roland Barthes called wrestling
``the great spectacle of suffering, defeat and justice.'' If you
say so.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTBALL: MIAMI DOLPHINS VS. ATLANTA FALCONS (CBS). Compared
with wrestling, televised football seems like ``Great
Performances.'' Still, the announcers for this post-Christmas game
(when else was I going to sacrifice an afternoon for this sort of
thing?), which I watched in the company of a reasonably sane,
gainfully employed 34-year-old male, did shout their every thought.
``He finds the open man just short of the 45-yard line!'' ``What a
grab by O.J. McDuffie!'' (There was also an O.J. Santiago.)
</P>
<P>
   And it astounds me that a game supposedly consisting of four
15-minute periods lasts three hours when it's televised.
</P>
<P>
   My viewing companion was disappointed that we'd missed the
pregame coverage, because it would have gone into how unimportant
this game was, since Atlanta had already won the National Football
Conference West title.
</P>
<P>
   I was ready to gripe about how meaningless it was to discuss
Jamal Anderson's rushing yardage vs. Bernie Parmalee's, but I
stopped. I wanted to be fair. Was it really so different from
comparing the merits of Susan Sarandon's and Meryl Streep's
portrayals of dying mothers in 1998? Plus, even I get a thrill out
of an interception at the 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIMPSONS' (Fox, Sundays). Seeing shows that are among my
favorites near the top of the Nielsen list of series watched by the
greatest number of young men frightens me a little, so I analyzed
several recent reruns of this animated hit.
</P>
<P>
   I have concluded that while I am laughing at the clever
references (often only a few seconds long) to old Broadway musicals
and to films like ``Citizen Kane,'' ``Gone With the Wind,'' ``2001:
A Space Odyssey'' and ``The Shining'' (it was so cute when Maggie's
alphabet blocks spelled out ``redrum''), the young men are laughing
at Homer Simpson's threat to paint a funny face on his rear end.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't noticed how often Homer takes his pants off and moons
other characters. I was too busy looking at signs like the one from
the Homer-becomes-an-astronaut episode (``Cape Canaveral, formerly
Cape Kennedy, formerly Cape Arbuckle'').
</P>
<P>
   ``THE X-FILES'' (Fox, Sundays). This must be another show that
works on a lot of different levels. Or are 18-to-34-year-old men
really as entranced as I am about the fabulous unresolved sexual
tension between Mulder and Scully? Were they as thrilled as I was
when Mulder (David Duchovny) finally kissed Scully (Gillian
Anderson) and told her his feelings? OK, this took place in a
Bermuda Triangle time warp, and Scully wasn't really herself, but
it happened.
</P>
<P>
   The show, a drama about two good-looking but lonely FBI agents
who investigate the paranormal (one with more fervor than his job
requires), does have lots of anti-government paranoia, which could
appeal to young viewers of both sexes, and its share of
otherworldly goop and scary monsters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I have to admit that young men do watch some decent
television. Amid the milk-squirting champions and the overexcited
sports announcers, there are signs of humor and playfully smart
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   But there are clouds on the horizon. Comedy Central is planning
``The Man Show,'' a series due in June, created specifically to
lure the young male audience. The show's pilot includes shapely
bikini-clad female studio assistants, flatulent monkeys and two
segments that may become regular features: Girls on Trampolines and
Blowing Things Up.

INVESTOR BROTHERS SHARE WISDOM ON ONLINE STOCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Brothers Fool have done it again.
</P>
<P>
   David and Tom Gardner have gone against conventional wisdom to
argue why some Internet companies with out-of-this-world valuations
are actually good buys.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardners, founders of the online investment forum Motley
Fool, find gold in the leading Internet stocks that Wall Street
gurus have long dismissed as being grossly overvalued. It's a case
of fool's gold being the real thing, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Consider money-losing online bookseller Amazon.com: It's worth
15 times more on Wall Street than Barnes &AMP; Noble, even though
Barnes &AMP; Noble has actual storefronts and makes a profit (two
things Amazon.com doesn't have going for it). Amazon's market value
is twice that of Nike and more than three times greater than that
of the New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable? Yes. Incorrectly valued? No.
</P>
<P>
   In their new book, ``Rule Breakers, Rule Makers,'' the Gardner
brothers attempt to explain why companies such as Amazon.com are
such hits. These are companies they call Rule Breakers.
</P>
<P>
   They say the trick in finding these potential gold mines is not
to focus so much on traditional gauges like price-to-earnings
ratios or profits but on sales growth and visionary leadership,
among other less quantitative factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind that even when the market bids up an unprofitable
company, it is doing so with the expectation that future earnings
streams will develop and will be significant,'' said David Gardner,
who was given half of the book to explain the Fools' logic of Rule
Breakers. ``The same was true of Wal-Mart throughout the '70s,
which always looked overvalued, or Cisco and Amgen since the late
'80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on the numbers, such as whether the company
beat Wall Street estimates or brokerage ratings, they argue that
young Rule Breaker companies busting out of the gate should be
judged on broader factors since they are ``nearly impossible to
analyze using traditional valuation criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's more helpful to look at a company qualitatively
-- such as its brand name and leadership -- than at its earnings or
P/E multiple. More critical are strong sales growth and past stock
performance, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But such thinking disturbs Robert Gardiner, portfolio manager of
the Wasatch Micro-Cap Fund, which was ranked first in its category
by Lipper Analytical with a three-year annual return of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he's not quite ready to discount a company's
earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every study we've ever done, (stock) price has followed
earnings,'' said Gardiner, whose fund focuses on growth in earnings
and P/E.
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner said he has missed out on some quick profits because he
did not join the Internet stock frenzy, but he prefers to stick to
a proven strategy that he believes will pan out in the long run.
After all, Internet stocks also can go down astronomically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks there's a new rule to make money, (but) . . .
a lot of stocks are going to crater,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his colleague Karey Barker said, when the biotechnology
industry was hot in the late 1980s, the stock prices of companies
going public ``got pretty crazy.'' The same thing could be said of
Internet companies, but at a greater level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the company's profitability or any economic value
driving the stock up. It's more of who's a greater fool,'' said
Barker, the portfolio manager of the Wasatch Mid-Cap Fund.
``There's something going on here that can't be sustained. . . .
It's completely momentum.''

   Barker cites the '80s bullishness of Japan's leading stock
market index, the Nikkei, which had traded at a higher P/E multiple
than the Dow Jones industrial average. The length of its run led to
several books explaining why it's justified. But the bull ran out
of steam this decade, and now the 225-company average remains in
the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Barker also parallels today's Internet frenzy with the
biotechnology craze, during which several books were written
justifying the stock price momentum. History shows the books were
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because (the ascent of Internet stocks) worked for a
couple of years doesn't mean it's rational . . . (especially) if
it's not based on real earnings,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Rule Breakers can be risky, the brothers admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rule Breaking investors will sometimes be dramatically wrong,
just as venture capitalists are. The idea is that you only have to
be right a few times,'' David Gardner said. ``If you buy and hold
as a Rule Breaker investor, you expect to beat the market handily,
largely through the profits you make by being right a few times --
which will way outdistance what you lose in being wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Brothers Fool make a convincing case. They've
identified important characteristics a Rule Breaker should possess,
and they're pretty picky.
</P>
<P>
   First, the company must be the top dog and first mover in an
important and emerging industry. Top dog, first banana, the big
cheese, whatever. The idea is that this company is the undisputed
numero uno firm in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   One clue: It's got the highest market capitalization in its
industry even if its sales approximate those of its biggest rival.
For example, the Gardners point out that Dell is worth $25 billion
more than Compaq, even if its sales are $12 billion less.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Fools believe the market prices companies at their
true worth, Dell is seen as much more valuable than Compaq -- a
real top dog.
</P>
<P>
   As a first mover, the Rule Breaker must have been the first to
do something. Amazon.com was the first major online bookseller. As
such, it enjoys a big head start on its competitors. Barnes &AMP; Noble
still is playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   A Rule Breaker also should be in an important industry, which
the Fools roughly define as one that everyone would miss if it
disappeared tomorrow. It's also preferable if that industry is
still in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   A Rule Breaker should carry sustainable advantage through
business momentum, patent protection, visionary leadership or inept
competitors. That means these breakthrough businesses should have
strong sales growth (the Fools single out the early Wal-Mart as an
example), legal protection for their creations (Amgen), and possess
strong leadership or bungling rivals (Microsoft).
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the company's stock price should have appreciated
greatly in the past -- it must have outperformed 90 percent or more
of its peers.
</P>
<P>
   A Rule Breaker company achieves its status through smart
management and good backing. Smart management is hard to quantify,
the brothers admit, but you'd know it if you see it. Simply, it's
doing something right. Obviously, if the company is a top dog in
the industry, management can't be slackers.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of a budding Rule Breaker is its backers. A smart
backer is a company such as Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers,
venture capitalists from Menlo Park in the Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   They've invested in the early Netscape, America Online, Compaq,
Amazon.com, Excite, Sun Microsystems, Intuit and AtHome.
</P>
<P>
   The Brothers Fool also believe Rule Breakers sell a product that
appeals strongly to consumers. They singled out Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if a company's shares are called overvalued by the
financial media, there's a good chance it's a Rule Breaker's stock,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardners say the company is doing ``many things right'' to
have an upward effect on the stock. So ignore cries of high
valuations, they advise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rule Breakers, Rule Makers'' is the fourth book from Motley
Fool. To date, the brothers' books have sold more than 875,500
copies in both hardcover and paperback form. Their newest book will
be in wide distribution by Feb. 2.

   FRUSTRATION LEVEL RISING FOR ONLINE STOCK TRADERS
</P>
<P>
   Even as small investors continue to pour money into online
brokerage firms, they are becoming increasingly frustrated with
problems such as Web pages that are slow to load, servers that conk
out and some trades that fail to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Causing further delays, some market makers have quit trading the
most popular stocks of online investors or shut their automatic
trading systems, delaying orders by up to 20 minutes. Investors and
some industry officials worry that a big market tumble could
completely freeze out online traders.

   For the people who work at Internet companies, where the average

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ In an expansion of its bidding scandal
investigation, the International Olympic Committee said Sunday it
will seek evidence of wrongdoing in the bid for the 1996 Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is sending a letter to the U.S. Olympic Committee asking
for any proof that IOC members received inappropriate gifts,
favors, compensation or other assistance from Atlanta's bidding
committee, said Dick Pound, the chairman of the committee's special
commission investigating allegations related to the Salt Lake City
bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking for evidence of improper behavior,'' said Pound,
who added that the IOC would vigorously pursue any substantiated
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials here have said that they have no evidence of
improper behavior by its members in previous bids, even though
rumors and allegations have abounded for years of excessive gift
giving and outright bribery in the campaign for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Schultz, the president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said
he was unaware of any evidence of improprieties with the Atlanta
bid. ``We'll give them all the information we have and all that we
can gather,'' Schultz said. The special commission investigating
the Salt Lake scandal headed by former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell
will review the Atlanta bid and provide information to the USOC,
which it will pass on to the IOC, Schultz said. ``There have been
questions posed of Atlanta about its bid already.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC said that candidate cities have been asked before about
allegations of misconduct but have failed to supply any proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``No adequate evidence of inappropriate conduct upon which we
could act was provided by candidate cities in response to the IOC
inquiries,'' said the special commission's 31-page report released
Sunday. ``In light of our investigation and recent public
disclosure about bids for other Olympic Games, however, it is felt
that a further opportunity should be afforded to such candidate
cities to come forward at this time with specific facts.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch said the examination of
previous Games is a necessary part of the IOC effort to purge
itself of misconduct by its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do all that is necessary to preserve the integrity and
ideals of the Olympic Games to restore the confidence of the public
in the Olympic movement,'' he said. ``This is the beginning, not
the end of our work.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic officials have denied that they broke any rules
in winning the Games. In addition to Atlanta, five cities bid for
the 1996 Games: Athens; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Manchester, England;
Melbourne, Australia; and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Pound said one of the challenges is that many of the losing
bidding committees have been disbanded. Consequently, the IOC will
direct its inquiry to national Olympic Committees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 1996 campaign, the IOC also will seek
information from bidding committees for the 1998, 2000, 2004 and
2006 Games.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Allegations surfaced over the weekend that an Australian Olympic
official offered $70,000 in inducements to two African IOC members
the night before Sydney won the 2000 Games by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   John Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee,
said that he offered $35,000 each to the National Olympic
Committees of Kenya and Uganda through their respective IOC
members, Charles Mukora and Francis Nyangweso. Australian officials
have denied that there was anything wrong with the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC said it will send two officials to Sydney to gather the
facts related to the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   In its report on the Salt Lake investigation, the special
commission recommended that Samaranch write the national Olympic
committees of the bidding cities seeking evidence of the following:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Any request on behalf of an IOC member for assistance or
intervention of any nature.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Any acceptance by an IOC member of money, goods or services
unrelated
</P>
<P>
   to the candidacy, non-emergency medical services and gifts that
were ``patently out of range of customary exchanges.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Any acceptance of material benefits for relatives of an IOC
member, including scholarships, educational expenses, living
expenses, medical services or employment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Any acceptance or direction of benefits to third parties by
IOC members or their relatives
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Any acceptance of excessive hospitality, in particular
multiple visits or bringing more than one person, by IOC members or
their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC is determined to demonstrate that whenever specific
allegations are made, it is prepared to act,'' the commission
report said. ``There is no place in the IOC for members who are not
prepared to adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct,
particularly with respect to the selection of host cities of the
Olympic Games.''

   NEW YORK _ Longtime friends and fellow performers, the actress
Claire Bloom and the flutist Eugenia Zukerman will join with the
likes of Ovid, Wallace Stevens and Shakespeare in an evening of
music and recitation at 8 p.m. Saturday at the 92nd Street Y.
</P>
<P>
   With Brian Zeger at the piano and music by Debussy, Ned Rorem
and Henry Mancini, among others, they will take part in the first
program of a three-concert series, Words and Music, merging the
spoken word with music in a format popular in the 19th century.
Information: (212) 996-1100.
</P>
<P>
   Good Looks
</P>
<P>
   For those attracted to the great, the brilliant, the crafty and
the vain, the place to be beginning on Wednesday is the National
Gallery in London. There, some of the 19th century's greatest, most
brilliant, craftiest and vainest figures will come to life in
``Portraits by Ingres.''
</P>
<P>
   This exhibition, through April 25, is billed as the first
outside France to assemble the painted and drawn portraits of
Jean-August-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867), perhaps the most
accomplished portraitist of his time.
</P>
<P>
   Among some 40 painted portraits and 50 of the artist's finest
portrait drawings are many of his best-known works, drawn from
museums and private collections in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The show will travel to the National Gallery of Art in
Washington and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
Information: 011-44-171-747-2885.
</P>
<P>
   More to Tell
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Grand Opera, known for staging the great works of
American musical theater, will open a new production of ``A Little
Night Music'' on Friday, featuring the soprano Evelyn Lear and the
mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade.
</P>
<P>
   With the blessing of its composer, Stephen Sondheim, this
production, directed by Michael Leeds, will involve changes that
give Ms. von Stade and the British baritone Thomas Allen an
opportunity to tell more of their characters' own stories in this
tale about three mismatched couples that was suggested by Ingmar
Bergman's film ``Smiles of a Summer Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Performed with the orchestra onstage, the eight-performance run
ends on Feb. 14. Information: (713) 546-0200.
</P>
<P>
   Beginnings
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Once upon a time at Harvard, two students competed to
compose incidental music for a Harvard Classical Club production of
Aristophanes' ``Birds.'' One was Leroy Anderson, the other Leonard
Bernstein. Bernstein won.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. Thursday in a concert titled ``Bernstein: The Harvard
Years (1935-39),'' the Eos Orchestra, led by Jonathan Sheffer, will
give the first performance of that music since 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the program at the Ethical Culture Auditorium, 2 West
64th St., are the New York premieres of Bernstein's ``Prelude,
Fugue and Riffs'' and his Clarinet Sonata, featuring Richard
Stoltzman, as well as a Sinfonietta by Bernstein's teacher at
Harvard, Burlingame Hill.

FRUSTRATION IN ONLINE TRADING CUTS BOTH WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mass.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many small investors are becoming frustrated with the
limitations of stock trading over the Internet, even as they
continue to pour money into the online brokerage firms that now
account for one of every four retail stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   But the same trading frenzy that is causing headaches for them
is also causing trouble for market makers _ the professional
trading firms that match buyers with sellers or take the other side
of trades themselves _ forcing them to change their procedures to
keep up. Some have quit trading the most popular stocks of online
investors or shut their automatic trading systems, delaying orders
by up to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile online brokerage firms are continuing to have problems
like Web pages that are slow to load, servers that conk out and
some trades that fail to be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to cope with the turmoil, some brokerage firms like
Waterhouse Securities Inc. are requiring online investors to make
trades in the most volatile stocks by talking to a broker instead
of using a computer. Many firms, including Charles Schwab Corp.,
the online trading leader, have limited or eliminated the ability
of customers to own some of their stock through margin loans. And
others are scaling back the aggressive advertising that industry
analysts say has contributed to the Internet logjam.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors and some industry officials worry that a big
market tumble could completely freeze out online traders.

   ``If on normal days this doesn't work at all, that's a bad
enough problem, but whenever there is a big downdraft on the
market, a lot of people are going to be shut out,'' said Steve
Salgo, a computer programmer in Plano, Texas, who trades stock
options from his home. He said he has changed online brokers eight
times in hopes of improving performance, but things only got worse
during the last few weeks. ``Most of the time there is a slow
response. And then sometimes there is no response.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bernard Madoff, whose firm Bernard Madoff Investment
Securities is one of the largest market makers, said, ``This thing
is not going to stop until people start losing money. I've never
seen this type of mania, people trading 100 and 200 shares without
any regard to fundamentals.'' Attempting to address the extreme
volatility in some stocks and initial public offerings, a special
Nasdaq committee of market makers, brokerage firms and other
industry officials will meet again Monday to discuss whether to
recommend any trading-rule changes to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the group has suggested extending the time market
makers have to post prices before an initial public offering begins
trading, but the SEC has not acted on the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Other ideas under discussion include allowing Nasdaq officials
to temporarily halt trading in extremely volatile stocks and
requiring retail customers buying shares immediately following an
initial public offering to place limit orders that guarantee they
will not be filled at a price far higher than they expected to pay,
according to a person involved in the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict investors will see more Internet delays this
week, even though popular high-flying stocks with online traders
like Amazon.com Inc. and Yahoo Inc. have now fallen more than 30
percent from their highs two weeks ago. But some industry officials
say the stunning rise in online trading volume this year has begun
to level off.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``I think it's going to take a slowdown in the market in
combination with more infrastructure spending to turn this around;
that will take months,'' said John Robb, co-founder of Gomez
Advisors Inc., an Internet consulting firm in Concord, Mass. He
said online brokerage firms' failure rates _ the number of times
Web pages failed to load _ rose 63 percent in the first week of
January, compared with the average rate during the third quarter of
1998, and he said the situation has not improved since.

   At Waterhouse, Web trading went down for about 35 minutes on
Tuesday and another few minutes Wednesday, said John Chapel, the
company's president. For the time being, the firm has cut back
advertising and prohibited trading in 10 stocks through its Web
site, including Amazon.com and Yahoo. The firm has eliminated
margin borrowing for the same 10 stocks, meaning customers who call
Waterhouse to place a trade in those stocks must cover the entire
price of their purchase with money in their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary measures will be reversed when ``the frothiness
lifts,'' Chapel said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of online trades has held steady at Discover
Brokerage Direct after jumping more than 20 percent at the
beginning of the year, said Tom O'Connell, executive vice
president. ``We are looking at this as our new level,'' he said.
The firm, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., has
eliminated all margin lending on 16 stocks, up from just two issues
six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The problems have spilled over to Nasdaq market makers, and at
one point at least 16 had stopped trading Amazon.com, Madoff said.
Many that continue to trade the most volatile stocks have removed
them from their automated trade systems and are executing them by
hand, causing trades that normally take two to 20 seconds to take
up to 20 minutes, he said. His firm has temporarily stopped trading
Yahoo, Amazon.com and Infoseek Corp., though it is still averaging
about 125,000 trades a day in other issues.
</P>
<P>
   While the most extreme volatility may have abated somewhat,
industry analysts expect online trading growth to continue to surge
throughout the year. Online trades now account for 25 percent to 30
percent of all retail stock trades, double their market share a
year ago, according to Gomez Advisors. The firm expects the number
of online brokerage accounts to top 10 million by the end of the
year, up from 6.8 million at the end of 1998.

SUN MICROSYSTEMS ANNOUNCES 35 LICENSES FOR ITS JINI NETWORK
SOFTWARE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN MARKOFF     
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hoping to herald the post-PC era, Sun
Microsystems Inc. plans to announce on Monday a group of nearly
three-dozen licensees for its Jini software _ a technology that is
meant to allow for networks of devices as diverse as computers,
cellular phones and kitchen appliances.
</P>
<P>
   With 35 consumer electronics and appliance companies,
telecommunications manufacturers and computer makers endorsing the
Jini software standard _ including America Online, IBM and Sony _
Sun executives plan to draw a picture of a new style of computing
that will not be dependent on the desktop personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jini is an extension of Sun's Java programming language, which
permits any kind of digital electronic devices to exchange
information and work together via wired or wireless networks. In a
related move last week, Sun, Sony and Royal Philips Electronics
announced a home computing alliance that will permit consumers to
interconnect their stereo and audio-visual gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now build networks of computing devices that simply
plug together and work,'' said Edward J. Zander, Sun's chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that intend to license Jini include makers of
Internet routing and switching gear, like Cisco Systems and 3Com
Communications. Those planning to demonstrate early prototypes of
Jini-enabled devices on Monday include Xerox, Epson, Motorola,
Nokia, Phillips, Sharp, Siemens, Sony and Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   Sun executives contend that Jini now has a demonstrable industry
lead over a similar network software initiative, known as Universal
Plug and Play, which Microsoft announced earlier this year. Unlike
Jini, which will work with a variety of software operating systems,
the Microsoft approach will run only on Microsoft operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The first Jini-enabled products will come to market at the end
of 1999, according to Mike Clary, general manager of Sun's Jini
business.
</P>
<P>
   While it is granting licenses for its Jini software, Sun is also
hoping that Jini will bring revenue from increased sale of the
company's network-server computers and microprocessor chips, Zander
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Sun is counting on the emergence of new
Jini-related service businesses.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: VYING FOR GUYS' REMOTE-CONTROL FINGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TV-RATINGS-RESCUE) 
(lb) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am beginning to feel sorry for males ages 18 to 34. They have
nothing to watch on television. Yes, they watch ``E.R.'' and
``Friends,'' as the women in their lives do, but when they're left
alone in a room with a remote, channels change.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, in their desperate search for macho stimulation,
young men are reduced to tuning in to wrestling shows in which the
fighters hit their opponents with metal folding chairs (this sort
of thing is done much more convincingly on ``The Jerry Springer
Show'') and lowbrow documentary programming like ``World's Wildest
Police Videos'' on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent episode, there was, judging by the number of
sirens, more action going on outside my living-room window than on
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Because advertisers are dying to get young men's attention,
companies will pay amazingly high sums for commercials on shows
that they watch. That's largely because young men don't devote much
time to television overall and, like all young consumers, they have
money to spend before they've developed firm brand loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a group they watch less television than any other age
segment other than teens and kids,'' said Steve Sternberg, a senior
partner of TN Media, a company that advises advertisers on buying
commercial time on television. ``There are a lot of advertising
categories, such as soft drinks, movie companies, sneakers, beer
companies _ there's a lot of clients that are trying to reach that
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the cost of 30 seconds on ``The Simpsons'' ($230,000),
a favorite among young male viewers, with the same 30 seconds on
``Cosby'' ($115,000), whose audience is older and includes more
women.
</P>
<P>
   So programmers are madly scrambling to create series that appeal
to young men. This is why, I had been told, there are so few women
over 28 seen on the networks these days. This is why terrible shows
like ``Men Behaving Badly'' (NBC, 1996-97), best known for the
bachelor character who used his underwear as a coffee filter, were
born. This is why the people at NBC are still crying about the loss
of ``Seinfeld,'' a series that performed the miracle of attracting
huge numbers of both men and women.
</P>
<P>
   So not long ago I watched a variety of shows that have
particularly high numbers of young male viewers. The network
programming was chosen from Nielsen Media Research's list of the 25
most popular shows among 18-to-34-year-old males, with an emphasis
on series that rated much higher with men than with women.
Wrestling is included because it represents three of the 10 most
popular shows on cable in that demographic group.
</P>
<P>
   I expected crotch and flatulence jokes on all these shows. (But
then I like ``South Park.'') I found some of those, but I also
found voice-overs shouting with feigned amazement, as if the
announcers were broadcasting the crash of the Hindenburg live. And
a lot of commercials for motor oil.
</P>
<P>
   `GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS: PRIME TIME' (Fox, Tuesdays). The
description of the episode in the listings was enough to hook me:
``Kaptain Robbie Knievel; man snorts milk to squirt it out his
eyes.'' Knievel (Evel's son) appeared in a motorcycle jump that set
no new record, and a young graphics designer from Vancouver did the
milk trick, which was presented with close-ups of his eyes, instant
replays and a quick nature film about the horned toad, which does a
similar trick with blood.
</P>
<P>
   The show also included a man setting a record for the number of
basketballs he could keep spinning atop ballpoint pens, and a visit
with a baby who weighed 68 pounds at 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of the hour, however, was the man who called
himself ``the human toolbox.'' He hammered a nail and an ice pick
into his face, bragging all the while about how close he was coming
to his brain stem. Don't even ask about the variable-speed drill.
If the point of the show was to make the girls squirm and cover
their eyes, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   `WORLD'S WILDEST POLICE VIDEOS' (Fox, Thursdays). ``Real cops,
real crooks, real cases!'' the announcer promises at the beginning
of the show. What you see ``may shock you,'' he warns, but ``we
bring it to you for one reason: because knowledge is power.'' Uh,
OK. Then I am now more powerful, having seen suspects drive in the
wrong direction on a freeway and watched a pizzeria thief lock
himself in at the scene of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the distinction of this show, a series of segments in which
police officers triumph over foolish criminals, is the ``you
shouldn't have messed with us'' voice-overs. The tone is a cross
between Eliot Ness and a Mickey Spillane novel.
</P>
<P>
   Of a team of police officers in Dooly County, Ga.: ``The Dooly
deputies take them down quick and hard.'' Of a rapper caught after
a car chase: ``The only record people are talking about is his
criminal record.'' Of a drunken driver: ``But he has no leg to
stand on, not with a belly full of tequila.'' Of drug dealers
arrested after a car chase: ``What they got was a bumpy ride to
hard times.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have been a slow car-chase week because the hour
included some old film of ``crazed British soccer fans'' and a look
at Pinky, an 8-pound cat that went nuts and bit a policeman's inner
thigh.
</P>
<P>
   `WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY?' (ABC, Wednesdays). The British
version of this show, in which comedians improvise sketches, was
actually sort of verbal. The American version, with Drew Carey,
prime time's regular-guy sitcom hero, as host, tends to get more
physical.
</P>
<P>
   In the premiere episode, which was rerun recently, one comedian
stuck his head between the legs of another, supposedly to convey
the idea of a foal being born. A segment in which the panel of
comedians put on funny hats and were called on to come up with a
funny line about each one elicited the words ``horny'' (Viking
headgear), ``booty'' (in the hip-hop sexual sense) and a slang term
for male genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `W.C.W. SATURDAY NIGHT' (TBS). TBS happened to be doing a World
Championship Wrestling show dedicated to the career of someone
named Goldberg, a 300-pound-plus wrestler with stringy hair,
wearing a one-piece Spandex ensemble in an orange-and-black print.
</P>
<P>
   The announcers used the same everything-is-an-exclamation voice
as the guy on the police show. ``The one undeniable factor of
Goldberg is the power!'' ``The pain is registering, but it has no
effect on Goldberg!'' ``He's so strong! He's so focused! He's a
hunter!''
</P>
<P>
   Hulk Hogan, who seems to have changed his name to Hollywood
Hogan, disagreed. ``Goldberg ain't nobody,'' he took the microphone
to announce to the crowd. ``He's not in the same league as
Hollywood.'' This was right before Goldberg defeated him in the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Hollywood took off his huge belt and hit Goldberg
with it like a whip. Then he picked up a metal folding chair and
attacked his opponent with it. When Goldberg won, the victor roared
at the camera. In ``Mythologies'' Roland Barthes called wrestling
``the great spectacle of suffering, defeat and justice.'' If you
say so.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTBALL: MIAMI DOLPHINS VS. ATLANTA FALCONS (CBS). Compared
with wrestling, televised football seems like ``Great
Performances.'' Still, the announcers for this post-Christmas game
(when else was I going to sacrifice an afternoon for this sort of
thing?), which I watched in the company of a reasonably sane,
gainfully employed 34-year-old male, did shout their every thought.
``He finds the open man just short of the 45-yard line!'' ``What a
grab by O.J. McDuffie!'' (There was also an O.J. Santiago.)
</P>
<P>
   And it astounds me that a game supposedly consisting of four
15-minute periods lasts three hours when it's televised.
</P>
<P>
   My viewing companion was disappointed that we'd missed the
pregame coverage, because it would have gone into how unimportant
this game was, since Atlanta had already won the National Football
Conference West title.
</P>
<P>
   I was ready to gripe about how meaningless it was to discuss
Jamal Anderson's rushing yardage vs. Bernie Parmalee's, but I
stopped. I wanted to be fair. Was it really so different from
comparing the merits of Susan Sarandon's and Meryl Streep's
portrayals of dying mothers in 1998? Plus, even I get a thrill out
of an interception at the 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIMPSONS' (Fox, Sundays). Seeing shows that are among my
favorites near the top of the Nielsen list of series watched by the
greatest number of young men frightens me a little, so I analyzed
several recent reruns of this animated hit.
</P>
<P>
   I have concluded that while I am laughing at the clever
references (often only a few seconds long) to old Broadway musicals
and to films like ``Citizen Kane,'' ``Gone With the Wind,'' ``2001:
A Space Odyssey'' and ``The Shining'' (it was so cute when Maggie's
alphabet blocks spelled out ``redrum''), the young men are laughing
at Homer Simpson's threat to paint a funny face on his rear end.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't noticed how often Homer takes his pants off and moons
other characters. I was too busy looking at signs like the one from
the Homer-becomes-an-astronaut episode (``Cape Canaveral, formerly
Cape Kennedy, formerly Cape Arbuckle'').
</P>
<P>
   ``THE X-FILES'' (Fox, Sundays). This must be another show that
works on a lot of different levels. Or are 18-to-34-year-old men
really as entranced as I am about the fabulous unresolved sexual
tension between Mulder and Scully? Were they as thrilled as I was
when Mulder (David Duchovny) finally kissed Scully (Gillian
Anderson) and told her his feelings? OK, this took place in a
Bermuda Triangle time warp, and Scully wasn't really herself, but
it happened.
</P>
<P>
   The show, a drama about two good-looking but lonely FBI agents
who investigate the paranormal (one with more fervor than his job
requires), does have lots of anti-government paranoia, which could
appeal to young viewers of both sexes, and its share of
otherworldly goop and scary monsters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I have to admit that young men do watch some decent
television. Amid the milk-squirting champions and the overexcited
sports announcers, there are signs of humor and playfully smart
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   But there are clouds on the horizon. Comedy Central is planning
``The Man Show,'' a series due in June, created specifically to
lure the young male audience. The show's pilot includes shapely
bikini-clad female studio assistants, flatulent monkeys and two
segments that may become regular features: Girls on Trampolines and
Blowing Things Up.

STATE GOVERNORS REVOLTING AGAINST BRAZIL'S FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ As the Brazilian government struggles to
restore the stability of an economy under siege, the most
intractable critics have emerged not abroad, but here at home,
where the resistance to reform by a group of powerful state
governors has created a dangerous impasse.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis that has shaken world stock markets, led to a
draining of Brazil's foreign reserves and forced a 35 percent
devaluation of its currency was touched off on Jan. 6. That was
when Itamar Franco, the newly inaugurated governor of Brazil's
second-most-populous state, Minas Gerais, announced a unilateral
90-day moratorium on repayment of his state's estimated $13.5
billion debt to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   None of Brazil's 26 other states has yet made the same threat
explicitly. But six other opposition party governors joined Franco
last week in Belo Horizonte, his state capital, for a strategy
session.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a mutual declaration condemning the
belt-tightening policies of the federal government in Brasilia as
``cruel and unjust'' and calling on President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso to open talks with them by Feb. 5 to renegotiate their
outstanding debt.
</P>
<P>
   The group included not only Franco but the governors of the
country's third and fourth most-economically-important states,
Anthony Garotinho of Rio de Janeiro and Olivio Dutra of Rio Grande
do Sul. Unless Cardoso agrees to their demands, their statement
warned, it will immediately become ``absolutely impossible to pay
the refinancing allotments of the states.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cardoso took office four years ago this month, the total
internal debt owed by federal, state and municipal governments was
equivalent to 29 percent of Brazil's gross domestic product, or
just over $120 billion at the exchange rate that prevailed at the
time. By the start of this year, that figure had risen to 41
percent of gross domestic product, or $320 billion, nearly
one-third of which is owed by states.
</P>
<P>
   The debt figure has soared because states and cities largely
finance their deficits by borrowing from federal banks and, through
constant lobbying and political horse-trading, they have been able
to roll over most of their loans on favorable terms. But as
interest rates in Brazil have skyrocketed to nearly 50 percent in
recent months as part of an effort to prevent a run on the national
currency, those debts have reached unmanageable levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to choose between paying civil servants and paying
the federal government, I'm going to pay the civil servants,''
Garotinho warned last week. He added that by March his state, which
owes $14.5 billion and includes the city of Rio de Janeiro, will
not have enough money on hand to meet all of its obligations.
``Rio's situation is dramatic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate between Cardoso and the defiant governors has
reverberated throughout Latin America, where any challenge to
centralized power is always viewed nervously. Without mentioning
Franco by name, President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico warned two
weeks ago that the stability of the entire region has been put at
risk because of the irresponsible actions of a single politician
with discredited populist notions.
</P>
<P>
   Franco's response did nothing to solidify relations between
Latin America's two most populous countries. He huffily described
the Mexican government as corrupt and said that Zedillo would be
better off devoting his attention to the long-running rebellion in
the state of Chiapas and more thoroughly investigating the scandals
surrounding the administration of his predecessor, Carlos Salinas
de Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   A former president himself, Franco had become a national
laughingstock by the time he left office four years ago. Political
commentators and comedians alike have continually poked fun at the
wigs he wears, his irascibility, his jealousy of Cardoso, a former
protege who served as his Finance and Foreign Minister, and his
penchant for quixotic romantic pursuits of much younger women.
</P>
<P>
   But with the opposition rudderless after Cardoso, in October,
became the first Brazilian president to be elected to a second
consecutive term, Franco sensed a vacuum, news commentators and
other political analysts said, and he moved to fill it. His
ultimate object, they maintain, is to position himself for a run at
another term as president in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply by issuing this threat, Itamar has showed the
president's weakness, brought the government to its knees and given
the opposition a program,'' said Alexandre Barros, a political
consultant here. ``It's an arm-wrestling match, and in the end, the
federal government is going to have to cede and negotiate less
onerous terms for the states on their debts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Cardoso has numerous tools he can use to force Franco
and other rebellious governors to meet their financial obligations.
The federal government has already begun withholding Minas Gerais'
portion of federal revenue-sharing funds and can also retain the
state's share of money raised from sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Franco has raised the stakes in the dispute by threatening
to default on a payment of some $108 million in Eurobonds due early
in February unless the federal government unfreezes the funds it is
holding back. Not meeting that obligation would be disastrous to
Brazil's international image and credit rating, and the federal
government has been forced to announce that it will pay the bill
for Minas Gerais.
</P>
<P>
   Franco has also obtained a ruling from a sympathetic state court
forbidding the federal government from garnisheeing any of his
state's bank accounts. The decision is being appealed to higher
courts, which are expected to rule soon in favor of the federal
government, but Franco is also threatening to challenge the
constitutionality of the government's recent actions, which could
be a far more prolonged process.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the president's actions as ``a flagrant violation of
the federative pact that was consecrated in the constitution of
1988,'' Dutra of Rio Grande do Sul has taken an equally challenging
but less confrontational approach. He has deposited the money his
state owes for this month in an escrow account while he too takes
his case to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the federal government said Sunday it will no
longer serve as guarantor for any loans the Minais Gerais and Rio
Grande do Sul seek from international institutions. That will make
it virtually impossible for them to obtain any external credits and
could also lead to cancellation of loans that are already in the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's history since the collapse of its monarchy 110 years
ago has been filled with struggles between states and the central
government. Under the military dictatorship that ruled the country
from 1964 to 1985, however, most authority was concentrated in
Federal institutions, leaving both state governors and legislatures
at all levels as mere appendages.
</P>
<P>
   But the constitution that went into effect 11 years ago
dramatically reversed that tendency, returning much autonomy to
governors and local officials as part of a larger trend toward
democratization. To a large extent, the federal government collects
taxes and passes them on to governors, who have considerable leeway
in deciding where and how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Those enhanced powers have given state officials marked
influence over their states' congressional delegations. In fact,
Franco's deputy has threatened to withdraw the support of 15
legislators he says are loyal to him from the president's fiscal
reform measures unless the federal government ``stops treating us
so coldly.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Cardoso took a hard line against the defiance of the
states, warning that, ``I will not allow the law to be ignored.''
Last week he softened his language somewhat, saying that he has an
``open door'' for the opposition, so long as ``they present me with
sensible solutions within the prevailing rules.''
</P>
<P>
   That throws the ball back into Franco's court, and he gives no
indication of yielding. ``The position of Minas is clearly
defined,'' he said last week. ``We are in a moratorium.''

 &HT;    Forecasts for Cobb and Gwinnett counties: More growth coming
 &HT;    By Lucy Soto
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For two decades, Cobb and Gwinnett counties have
produced record growth for metro Atlanta's north side, as sewers
and highways stretched into empty land, causing houses and
businesses to multiply like weeds. Now forecasts show the boom will
continue, putting the two counties among the hottest in the nation
well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett will add 526,550 people by the year 2025, according to
Washington, D.C.-based NPA Data Services. That ranks it 19th among
all U.S. counties in projected population increase. That would put
Gwinnett at 1.02 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   NPA, a private company which compiles economic statistics and
forecasts for academics and businesses, predicts Cobb will add just
more than half a million people in the next two and a half decades.
That gives it a spot at No. 21 and a potential population of more
than 1.5 million. Most other counties topping the growth chart were
in Arizona, California and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Job growth on the Northside also could be hot. NPA ranks
Gwinnett 19th, with the creation of 467,240 jobs by 2025, and Cobb
is projected to add 453,200 jobs. That ranks it 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking to see when you put it down on paper, but based
on what's happened here in the past 25 years, it certainly doesn't
seem unrealistic,'' said Richard Tucker, Gwinnett Chamber of
Commerce president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole picture has changed,'' says Don Beaver, in charge of
economic development for Cobb's chamber. ``Cobb County 15 years ago
was a bedroom community, and now it's a destination point.''
</P>
<P>
   But to motorists who jam I-75 every rush hour and commuters
crawling along I-85, the first question must be: where in the world
will it all go? How can counties in the middle of a debate about
the region's sprawling development and air quality, a debate that
has reached the Legislature this year, be able to accommodate all
this new growth?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they won't have to. Many business people and
environmentalists in both counties, who often are on opposite sides
of the growth debate, say the predictions probably won't happen.
Too many hurdles are in the way, including a ban on federal money
for road building and increasing resistance to sprawl from both
residents and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, are more optimistic, pointing to the immense
growth that has occurred in the two counties during the past few
decades. Once-rural places and crossroads now have malls and strip
shopping centers, tangles of subdivisions and busy streets. The
entire Northside has been booming, including most areas of north
Fulton.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett's population has nearly tripled since 1980. During that
decade it was named the fastest growing county in the country.
Cobb's has nearly doubled since then. A few decades ago, Gwinnett
had a job base for only 20 percent of its residents, meaning most
everybody else drove downtown or to other areas to work. Today,
about 60 percent of the county's work force also lives there.
</P>
<P>
   So, rural became suburban. And now, suburban is evolving into
urban.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are turning into a city,'' said Gwinnett Chairman Wayne
Hill. ``We'll always be a part of the Atlanta region, but Gwinnett
County is going to become a major player in the state. I don't see
any reason it won't, and that means it will keep growing. ... As
long as we maintain good schools and good environment, people will
want to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, therein lies the problem as well as the promise.
If Cobb and Gwinnett cannot retain the qualities that attract
newcomers, it might cause all the growth forecasts to fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, they hit limits,'' says Donald Ratajczak, chief
economic forecaster at Georgia State University. He believes none
of the suburban counties are planning well enough to accommodate
all the predicted growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeKalb ran out of residential space, and it will happen
probably to Cobb before Gwinnett,'' he said. ``I'm not saying
things are dire for them, I'm just saying that the past 20 years
can't be replicated in the next 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Dorfman has seen his product distribution company,
Innotrac, grow from one employee to 750 during his 15 years in
Gwinnett. Although he plans to leave his corporate headquarters
there, he's already thinking about finding another place to move
his company's call center in the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting difficult to compete,'' he said. ``The concern is
can we continue to attract people. There's less and less skilled
labor. Gwinnett is going to be a tough labor market for a lot of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cobb, Jim Carlson has seen the growth mushroom around
Heidelberg, the printing equipment service company where he's a
senior vice president. In 1994, Heidelberg moved from Queens, N.Y.,
to 28 acres in a fairly empty industrial park in Kennesaw. Now,
just four and a half years later, multistory buildings are going up
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The draw? Good schools, less bureaucracy for development, the
climate, the tax rate. But the same things have drawn thousands of
other people. And even Carlson, who gushes with praise for Cobb,
sees potential troubles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously around (metro) Atlanta there is still a lot of open
land with a potential for building, but if you can't access it
because the roads are clogged, or you can't build because the sewer
lines aren't there or you have a water quality problem _ you can't
do anything with that land.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb Commissioner Bill Cooper believes population there will max
out at 700,000 to 750,000 people in about 10 to 15 years, not the
more than one million people that forecasts show. The price of land
has climbed so high that developers are moving farther out to build
new subdivisions, he said. It's not as easy to build subdivisions
in the $150,000 to $200,000 range _ which draw in the new families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already seen the growth start to go toward Paulding and
Bartow counties,'' he said. ``It's an economic issue. ... As things
go up (in price), people move out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessarily good news to Bryan Hager, regional
coordinator for the Sierra Club's Challenge to Sprawl campaign,
which is trying to curb the pace of development on the far-flung
edges of metro areas nationwide. And Hager believes traffic
congestion will stall much of Cobb and Gwinnett's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attempts to attract business and people are going to continue
to exacerbate the problems of sprawl,'' said Hager, a critic of
many of the growth decisions in those counties. ``The last 20
years, they've not been able to handle all the growth they now
have, in infrastructure and in creating a quality of life.''

STARR RETURNS TO CENTER STAGE OF CLINTON-LEWINSKY SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LEWINSKY, IMPEACH-ASSESS,
IMPEACH-LOTT, IMPEACH-JUDGE) 
(mk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Monica Lewinsky signed her immunity agreement
last July with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, she never
imagined that Starr would use the fine print of the deal to force
her to cooperate with House prosecutors seeking the removal of
President Clinton from office, several friends and associates of
Ms. Lewinsky said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But last summer, Starr and his prosecutors knew that Congress
might need her. At the time they negotiated the agreement with Ms.
Lewinsky, Starr had already received permission from a federal
three-judge panel here to send an impeachment referral to the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Office of the Independent Counsel did not share
that information with Ms. Lewinsky _ nor with the public _ at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Starr included language in Ms. Lewinsky's immunity agreement
that required her to answer questions truthfully before grand
juries ``and in any other executive, military, judicial or
congressional proceedings.'' He also required the former White
House intern to provide information to ``representatives of any
other institutions as the OIC may require.'' If she refused,
prosecutors could revoke the immunity agreement and file perjury
charges against her.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, nearly four weeks before Ms. Lewinsky agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors, Starr quietly filed a motion with a
three-judge panel here seeking permission to send secret grand jury
material to the House as part of a referral that would accuse the
president of committing impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the motion was entitled ``In re: Madison Guaranty
Savings &AMP; Loan Association,'' the Arkansas bank related to the
Clintons' failed Whitewater land deal, Starr's request was related
to his inquiry into Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
allegations that he tried to cover it up. And on July 7, the
three-judge panel granted Starr's office the authority to send the
grand jury material to the House.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it clear that Starr was preparing to deliver an
impeachment referral to the Congress weeks before the grand jury
heard testimony from either Ms. Lewinsky or Clinton, both of whom
testified in August.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Charles Bakaly III, the spokesman for
Starr, acknowledged that Ms. Lewinsky's congressional testimony was
``specifically contemplated'' at the time. But he said the decision
to send an impeachment referral was not made until after the
president testified before the grand jury on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were laying the groundwork for a referral,'' he said, ``but
no final decision had been made in July.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been relatively quiet since his testimony before
the House Judiciary Committee in November, Starr has hardly been a
mere observer as the House voted to impeach the president on two
articles of impeachment on Dec. 19, and as the historic Senate
trial of Clinton has unfolded this month.
</P>
<P>
   His prosecutors have watched the proceedings in both houses very
carefully and his office has reacted to what it has perceived to be
mischaracterizations of the evidence by White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In December, for example, Starr challenged several assertions in
the White House's 184-page defense brief, complaining that the
rebuttal contained ``a series of misrepresentations regarding this
office's referral.'' The statements from Starr were unusual because
they were made public at a critical moment in the impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Those statements paled to the magnitude of Starr's actions on
Friday and this weekend when he returned to center stage to secure
an emergency court order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to submit to
questioning by House managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were duty-bound to assist the House managers,'' Starr said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, the spokesman for Starr, added, ``We have a continuing
duty under the independent counsel law to provide the House with
information relating to the impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers and some Democratic senators continued
Sunday to criticize the decision of the independent counsel's
office to intervene, saying Starr's actions clearly demonstrate his
support for the case against the president being presented by the
House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not acting as their agent,'' Bakaly said. ``There is
nothing political about this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr's office certainly made it easier for the House managers
to interview Ms. Lewinsky. In Starr's court papers, prosecutors
acknowledged that Ms. Lewinsky ``has the right'' to have
prosecutors preside over the interview with House managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The OIC, of course, is fully willing to conduct these
debriefings, if Ms. Lewinsky so desires,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several months, White House lawyers and allies have
attempted to raise questions about Starr's actions and fairness by
portraying him as an excessive, overzealous prosecutor bent on
destroying the president.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr testified for 12 hours on Nov. 19 before the House
Judiciary Committee, he sounded at times like an impassioned
advocate. A day after his marathon testimony, Starr's ethics
adviser, Samuel Dash, the 73-year-old Georgetown University law
professor, resigned to protest the independent counsel's decision
to testify as ``an aggressive advocate'' for the impeachment of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While answering a senator's question in the well of the Senate
on Saturday, White House counsel Charles Ruff challenged the
propriety of the House managers' decision to enlist Starr's
prosecutors in their bid to sit down with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said the idea that the House managers just wanted to have a
routine meeting with Ms. Lewinsky was ``sheer nonsense.'' He said
the meeting was hardly routine because the independent counsel can
``use the authority that he has under the immunity agreement to
threaten Ms. Lewinsky with jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said that prosecutors acted as observers in the meeting
Sunday with Ms. Lewinsky. ``This is not our interview,'' he said.
``The substance of the questions are not ours.''
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted that the office would have preferred it if its
prosecutors had not been asked to intervene by Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the lead House manager. ``We were not eager to get involved
in this,'' Bakaly said. ``We certainly did not seek it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said he was flabbergasted that his office's role in the
dispute between Ms. Lewinsky and the House managers had become such
a flashpoint of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't understand what all the fuss is about,'' he
said. ``This is purely an effort to interject politics in the legal
process, which we have encountered throughout this investigation.''

   HOSTAGE-WIDOW-HIGGINS _ TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ She remembers
thinking, ``I can't let them know I'm Jewish. I've got to tell my
father in Delray Beach to be `not Jewish' too.'' It has been nearly
11 years since Robin Higgins, Florida's incoming executive director
of veterans affairs, learned her husband, Marine Lt. Col. William
R. ``Rich'' Higgins, had been kidnapped in Lebanon. She was a
Marine officer in the Pentagon press office. He was serving as a
U.N. peacekeeper. The Islamic Hezbollah group snatched him off the
street, accusing him of being a spy for the United States and
Israel. During his 17 months of captivity, she buttoned up her
distress under a uniform. She also hid something else _ her
religion. Despite her efforts, and though other hostages _
including Associated Press reporter Terry Anderson and Anglican
Church emissary Terry Waite _ were eventually released, Rich
Higgins' body was dumped on a Beirut street. Today, at 48, Robin
Higgins is preparing for a new mission: to make sure Florida's 1.7
million veterans get the federal benefits they deserve. On Tuesday
the Cabinet is expected to approve her nomination by Gov. Jeb Bush
as executive director of the Florida Department of Veterans Affairs
at a salary of about $105,000. (Elmore, Palm Beach Post) MOVED

   COUNTIES-GROWTH _ Gwinnett County, the Energizer Bunny of
growth, will be topping the charts well into the next century,
according to new forecasts of population and employment growth for
counties nationwide. Cobb County is also among the top 25. These
comparisons aren't percentage increases, where small counties
usually come out on top, but a comparison of raw numbers. That
makes it all the more startling. How do counties that have been
growing like crazy for so long and are often seen as becoming much
more urban continue to absorb people? Do they have the room for
this growth? We talk to the usual and not-so-usual suspects. (Soto,

   TEX-ENVIRON-SANCTUARY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Flower Garden Banks,
a federal marine sanctuary 110 miles off the Texas coast in the
Gulf of Mexico, is home to the northernmost coral reefs in the
United States. Manta rays and loggerhead turtles cruise the shallow
waters. The sanctuary is surrounded by oil and natural gas
development. Last summer, a swath was cut through one of the reefs,
apparently by a barge's tow chain. The incident illustrates the
fragile nature of the reefs, which are underwater layers of stony
skeletons secreted by invertebrate animals. A $1 billion
conservation proposal announced by President Clinton _ and
reiterated in his State of the Union speech last week _ includes
$29 million to expand and protect the nation's marine sanctuaries,
more than twice the current budget for the sanctuaries. That would
allow the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, which oversees the Flower Garden Banks, to restore
coral damaged in future shipping accidents and commission genetic
research and other studies by scientists at Texas A&AMP;M University
and the University of Texas. ATTN: Texas editors. (Haurwitz, Austin

   TEX-OILMAN-LEGACY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Herman Heep, wisecracking,
straight-talking millionaire oilman, insisted that anyone who came
out to his 5,000-acre ranch in southern Travis County call him
Herman. Heep, who could have walked right off the set of ``Giant,''
was as hospitable as he was quick-witted and sharp-tongued. Maybe
that's why, at the height of his wealth in the early 1950s, the man
known for driving through his oil fields in his shiny new Cadillac
convertible had friends that included the lowest of ranch hands and
the most powerful of politicians. He was what Texans like best: a
character who worked hard and played just as hard. Heep's strong
and willful spirit has reached down through two generations and is
playing itself out in a quintessential Texas family saga involving
his three granddaughters, who have spent the past 30 years fighting
each other over his legacy. The saga could end this year in a
Travis County court, where the family trusts are being dissolved
and what's left of the money is being divided among Heep's heirs.
Before he died in 1960, Heep amassed a fortune worth somewhere near
$50 million in today's dollars from oil, ranching and other
ventures. What's left today is the 5,000 acres of prime undeveloped
land and $4 million remaining from trust funds that amounted to $20
million in 1989. Lawyers have received millions from the funds in
legal fees as family members sued each other, attorneys and
business associates. Always at the center of the fight has been
Heep's eldest granddaughter, Hatsy Heep Shaffer, who, perhaps more
than anyone, carries on the blustering spirit of her grandfather.

UPSTART WEB DEVELOPERS BOOSTED BY ALLIANCE WITH WARNER BROTHERS
ONLINE

</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   By JANET STITES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is the stuff Web dreams are made of. A recent
start-up operating out of a makeshift office in a loft strikes a
deal with an entertainment or media giant. The news media takes
note. The bankers call. Suddenly, it's the hottest of properties, a
celebrity start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunecity.com, a New York City developer of community-based
Web sites, finds itself in that enviable position after signing a
deal with Warner Brothers Online to collaborate on a community site
for fans of Warner properties.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Warner Brothers Online, based in Burbank, Calif.,
has created a virtual housing development for fans of everything
from Road Runner and Daffy Duck to Rosie O'Donnell, La Femme Nikita
and the rock group Depeche Mode.
</P>
<P>
   But more than just a place to visit, Acmecity.com, as the
development is known, makes strategic use of Fortunecity's
experience building online communities to both protect and profit
from Warner's intellectual properties. Instead of seeking out and
suing fans who post images of their favorite characters _ the
typical approach of giant media companies _ Warner Brothers gives
fans a 20-megabyte plot of cyberspace in Acmecity for their own
home pages and encourages them to use pictures, video and sound
clips of their favorite Warner stars, real or animated.
</P>
<P>
   Fans already have built more than 75,000 pages in Acmecity,
which officially opened on Jan. 13, and that has attracted
big-ticket advertisers that include Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Oldsmobile,
and Levi's.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, and the ensuing publicity, have come at an opportune
time for Fortunecity. Two pioneers in the development of
community-based Web sites, Geocities and Theglobe.com, both
recently had successful public offerings, and the alliance with
Warner helps to distinguish Fortunecity from the myriad other
community-type start-ups that rushed in for a piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be promoting two separate brands _ Acmecity.com and
Fortunecity.com,'' said Peter Macnee, the vibrant Canadian who was
named president and chief executive of Fortunecity in November.
``But we'll be driving traffic back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that traffic may prove to be one-way. Macnee points out,
for example, a case in which Fortunecity is now only two clicks
away from America Online and its 15 million members: America
Online's Rosie O'Donnell site links to Acmecity.com, which will
link to Fortunecity.com.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunecity was launched in 1996 by two British entrepreneurs,
Richard Jones and Dan Metcalfe, with private financial backing. The
original site was an online narrative-based interactive detective
story. The goal was to build a virtual city in the vein of Simcity.
It employs a city metaphor for its structure, with 19
``neighborhoods'' built around special interests like arts and
culture, family issues, football, humor, the paranormal and trivia.
Residents' home pages are virtual buildings connected by virtual
streets. It evolved from a small site to a real business, and in
October the company relocated to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The site's 1 million residents maintain their own home pages,
vote and enforce laws, sometimes ``jailing'' members who break
community rules by spamming or posting pornography. Jail inmates
cannot work on their site, or visit anywhere in the community. If
the crime is particularly egregious, they can be banned for good.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Media Metrix, an Internet traffic measurement firm,
ranked Fortunecity.com as the 13th fastest growing Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Acmecity is designed in a similar fashion but with broader
objectives. For Warner Brothers Online, which operates its own
successful Web site, Acmecity serves to leverage its properties as
a merchandising platform and promotional tool. It also lets Warner,
a unit of Time Warner, identify narrow demographic groups to lure
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other community sites and search engines are capitalizing on
our properties,'' said Jim Moloshok, president of Warner Brothers
Online. ``We didn't want to lose control of our properties. We
wanted to give fans a place where they could use material from the
properties, interact with the talent or the producers.'' He added
that the company had no intention of taking legal action to shut
down existing fan sites.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of widespread support throughout the company,
Moloshok said Warner Brothers producers would be judging fan-site
contests and that celebrities would be participating in chats.
Contestants compete for prizes like a walk-on roll on their
favorite TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies say the deal was a natural fit. ``We've been
looking at doing something like this for two years,'' Moloshok
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fortunecity recognizes that the model is transferable,
Macnee said, ``We won't launch anything competitive to
Acmecity.com, but we might do something in sports or finance.''
</P>
<P>
   For Moloshok, Fortunecity's British roots are also of value.
``We want to expand our online brand overseas,'' he said.
``Fortunecity.com already has a presence there.'' In turn, Warner
Brothers will promote Acmecity.com on its television programs,
movie trailers, print ads and the like, expanding Fortunecity's
reach exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   At Acmecity.com, fans are busy staking claims.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Cooke, who has had a Looney Tunes page since 1996, has moved
in with his Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies content _ including
his ``censored cartoon'' page, a guide to cuts and edits of classic
cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Friends'' area, fans have opened the Phoebophilliac's
Happy Place just down the street from the Brazilian Friends Page.
On Slayer Street in the ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' neighborhood,
a resident named Angelista has posted her favorite quote from the
series: ``If every vampire who said he was at the crucifixion was
actually there, it would have been like Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the physical world, specifically in the SoHo district of
Manhattan, Fortunecity employees look forward to moving into new
offices and keep hoping that Rosie O'Donnell will mention Acmecity
on her talk show. In the real world as well as in virtual
communities, a most valuable asset is the company you keep.

<P>
   NEW DELHI _ Indian police on Sunday arrested 47 members of a
militant Hindu youth group and charged them with setting a fire
early Saturday morning that killed an Australian missionary and his
two young sons as they slept inside a van in a remote tribal
village.
</P>
<P>
   The missionary, Graham Staines, 58, and his boys, Philip, 10,
and Timothy, 6, burned to death as horrified villagers watched a
mob of 50 to 100 people circling the van in the east Indian state
of Orissa, police officials said. Staines had worked in the area
for more than 30 years and was generally liked, police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the Evangelical Missionary Society in the
district Staines ran a hospital and clinics for lepers.
</P>
<P>
   This escalation in the attacks on Christians and their schools
and places of worship, more numerous in the past year than at any
other time since India gained its Independence in 1947, prompted
official condemnations from the president and the prime minister on
down.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said the people they had charged with the
attack were associated with the Bajrang Dal, a youth group that is
part of the same family of Hindu nationalist organizations as the
Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the national coalition
government. Police said the mob that attacked Staines shouted,
``Long live Hanuman,'' referring to the popular Hindu monkey god.
</P>
<P>
   Surendra Kumar Jain, president of the Bajrang Dal, was traveling
Sunday, and his wife said he could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the attacks on Christians have occurred in tribal areas
where Hindu militants contend that Christians are forcibly
converting the indigenous people to Christianity, a charge the
Christians say is false. In the western state of Gujurat, there
have been more than 30 attacks on Christians and their schools and
churches. No one has taken responsibility for them.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who heads the Bharatiya
Janata Party, on Saturday called the killings ``a shameful act''
and said that if members of the Bajrang Dal were behind the attack
they would be punished. Home Minister L. K. Advani, another
Bharatiya Janata leader, said a delegation from the party had gone
to the district to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   B. B. Panda, the director general of police in Orissa, said he
had gone on Saturday to the village of Manoharpur, in the
northeastern part of the state, and talked to witnesses to the
attack. He said that they told him they had been too frightened to
rescue Staines and his sons but that they willingly named the
people who had committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Panda said 47 people had been arrested so far. The police have
offered a $600 reward for information leading to the arrest of
Ravinder Kumar Pal, commonly known as Dara Singh, who police
believe organized the attack. Pal, who is from the state of Uttar
Pradesh, has been working for 10 years in the area where Staines
was killed to organize an arm of the Bajrang Dal, Panda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking all precautions now,'' said Panda.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Staines had come to the village for an annual meeting at a local
church that he had attended every year for two decades. On Friday,
he and his sons went to sleep in their van, as usual, planning to
leave the village the next day for the five-hour drive home to the
town of Baripada and to his wife, Gladys, and their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   A consular officer representing the top Australian diplomat in
India went to Baripada Sunday morning to meet with Mrs. Staines and
to make sure that she and her daughter were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Staines was the director of a missionary society that is based
in Brisbane, Australia. He has been in India since 1965, said Susan
Grace, a spokeswoman for the Australian diplomatic mission, the
Australian High Commission. Ms. Grace estimated that there were 50
to 100 Australian missionaries in India.

   &UR; A POLITICAL WIFE GETS EVEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike &UR; Hillary Clinton, Margaret Cook &LR; , ex-wife of British
Foreign Secretary  &UR; John Cook &LR; , is no stand-by-your-man kind of
woman. Cook recently left his wife, married his secretary after
confessing an affair with her, and held onto his job.
</P>
<P>
   Now the ex-Mrs. Cook, urged on by a close friend who happens to
be one of her husband's former political rivals, is out with her
autobiography, ``A Slight and Delicate Creature.'' In this loving
memoir, she portrays Cook as a ``heavy-drinking, moody, heartless
womanizer who had a string of affairs,'' says the Sunday Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   Cook was often drunk, says his ex-wife, and once she found him
passed out on the dining room floor with a brandy bottle in his
hand. She said he had told her of affairs with five women. Perhaps
worst of all, says the Telegraph, ``he once broke news that he was
having an affair with a woman just hours after Mrs. Cook's horse,
Bruni, was put down.'' (Anglophiles will note here that the horse
bore the same name of one of  &UR; Mick Jagger &LR; 's alleged girlfriends.)
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Mrs. Cook, who also reveals that her husband ``had been
having sexual difficulties,'' says, ``I am really not motivated by
revenge of any description. ... There were worse things I could
have put in.'' Oh, and one more thing: She feels sorry for him.
``He's looking so old and wrinkled and unhappy these days. But he's
brought it on himself.''

selling very well, reports the New York Observer, and now the
designer _ previously known for being  &UR; Jerry Seinfeld &LR; 's girlfriend
and for being big-breasted _ wants some respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than `Shoshanna,' '' said Lonstein about her press
coverage, ``it's always `shapely Shoshanna.' To have it being a
sexual part of your body is very difficult. It's different if it's
long legs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's basing her entire career on that she has huge hooters,
and now she's complaining?'' protested the New York Post's  &UR; Richard
Johnson &LR; . ``She didn't complain to me the last time I saw her ...
She was wearing one of those bustiers and it was just amazing. ...
You could have lost a bagel down there.''

POSSESSIONS OF MISSING ATHEIST LEADER ARE SOLD AT AUCTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (ms) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLUGERVILLE, Texas _ Jimmy Nassour wasn't sure why he kept
raising his hand when the bidding passed the $500 limit he'd set
for himself. ``I guess I got caught up in the moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The auctioneer, Bob Sheehan, held aloft the small, white Bible:
A gift from students at Winnitka Heights Baptist Church in Tulsa,
Okla., on Dec. 15, 1968, to Madalyn Murray O'Hair, the atheist
leader who once described herself as ``the most hated woman in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The bidding shot past $500, then $1,000 and Nassour hung in
there. Finally, the bidders fell away and he found himself the
owner of Ms. Murray-O'Hair's Bible for $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also bought one of her briefcases, but this is what I came
for,'' said Nassour. ``I just think it's a museum piece and that's
where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   All around the dimly lit, white-metal barn on the northeast
fringe of the Austin suburbs were garbage bags full of clothes and
cardboard boxes and bric-a-brac and dusty pieces of furniture, the
biggest garage sale you ever saw. Chinese dolls. Bronze cowboys.
Stacks of videotapes. Souvenirs from world travels. Pots and pans,
highball glasses, decanters, collectible whisky bottles. And dozens
of boxes of books.
</P>
<P>
   This was all that remained of the worldly possessions of Mrs.
O'Hair, who disappeared from her Austin office in September 1995
with her granddaughter, Robin Murray-O'Hair, and one of her sons,
Jon Garth Murray, leaving behind the family's three dogs, Mrs.
O'Hair's medications and a 1985 Porsche 944 parked at the Austin
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were able to trace them, from cell phone calls and
bank records, as far as San Antonio, where $500,000 was withdrawn
from one of the bank accounts of American Atheists Inc., the
movement Mrs. O'Hair founded after becoming a national figure with
a 1963 lawsuit that effectively removed prayer from public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, nothing. Not a hint.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say they have no idea where the trio are. Some
people believe they were robbed and murdered, others think they may
still be alive, fleeing creditors, perhaps in New Zealand, where
they were said to have bank accounts. If so, Mrs. O'Hair would be
79, her son 44 and her granddaughter 33.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government had confiscated the contents of her home
to pay some of the $250,000 she owed in back taxes and to other
creditors, an auction that was postponed two years ago when
attorneys for the three missing people filed for bankruptcy but was
finally held Saturday in a crowd of bargain hunters and curiosity
seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Hair's private papers _ her military discharge, birth
certificate, marriage licenses and years worth of meticulously kept
diaries _ were not part of Saturday's auction. They sit in a
safe &UR; - &LR; deposit box in a downtown Austin bank a block away from the
office of Ronald Ingalls, the attorney who is handling their
separate sale.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries are a sad chronicle of a yearning, unhappy life.
Mrs. O'Hair, bitter that her dreams of political influence never
blossomed, had harsh judgments of almost everyone around her, often
singling out Jews and gays and blacks. She dreamed, pitifully, page
after page, for such things as a ``luxury apartment,'' a mink coat
and a Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ends 33 years of my life,'' she wrote in April of 1953.
``This living is the pattern of it. Work, hope  &UR; _ &LR;  dream, realizing
there is not much hope the dreams will become realization. Yet
always the future invites, promises.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 5, 1959: ``The whole idiotic hopelessness of human
relations descends upon me. Tonight, I cried and cried, but even
then feeling nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a gap in the diaries, the entire 1960s and parts of the
'80s, the period when she became a national figure and when her
movement had serious financial problems. Yet there are references
to these missing diaries in the portions that remain, so they did
exist. Were they destroyed? Taken with her? No one knows.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, her New Year's resolutions included wishes for a new
headquarters, a fur coat, a luxury car and to ``humiliate Billy
Graham on television, for money.'' She intended to drive herself
and all of those around her, most of whom she considered dull and
lazy. ``This year, we do it!'' But by mid-year, she was despondent
again.
</P>
<P>
   She celebrates her court cases, bemoans her humiliations. Once,
in 1975, she found herself attacked from all sides on a national
talk show, a figure of ridicule. ``Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy,'' she
wrote. ``I get so terribly tired.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, there is more heartache and squabbling than
philosophizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more her personal stuff, her family tribulations,''
said Ingalls. ``This is not the place to come to find the fine
points of her theories or logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Various authorities have valued the diaries at $5,000 to
$100,000. Ingalls is waiting to get a bid he feels is sufficient to
take before a judge, and then everyone else will have 20 days to
better it. ``I can tell you this,'' he said. ``If I got a bid of
$100,000, I'd be on the phone to the judge in an instant.''
</P>
<P>
   The brown Porsche sat in the dirt-caked yard behind the auction
barn in Pflugerville, a couple of rust holes peering like eyes from
its mud-flecked body. An Austin car dealer eventually bought it for
$2,750, more despite the owner's notoriety than because of it. ``It
was just too good a deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people came to the auction, some staying for a few
minutes, others lingering for hours, pouring through the open
boxes. But only 275 people put up the required $250 cash deposit to
actually bid.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan worked up the crowd all day with a string of wisecracks.
He held up some framed needlepoints she had done (``Time for
kindness, and for giving, time for friendship and happy living'').
They are mentioned in her diaries as a way to relieve stress and
fill the empty evenings. ``When she wasn't praying she was
needlepointing,'' Sheehan told the crowd. ``So she had a lot of
time to needlepoint.'' They went for $35.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items fetched little, unless they had some ironic
value, like Nassour's Bible. A box of ``atheist trinkets, including
an atheist drinking glass, though you don't have to be an atheist
to drink out of it'' went for $55. Some $2 bills on which Ms.
Murray-O'Hair had crossed out ``In God We Trust'' with a black pen
went for $10 each. Five highball glasses with her name on them went
for $35 each.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan wouldn't say exactly how much the day's auction drew,
except that it was not far from his earlier estimate of $25,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls said that he thought that when news of the auction got
around, especially of the diaries, it might flush the family out of
hiding, if that's where they are. But there hasn't been a whisper
from them. Ingalls worried, too, about threats from Mrs. O'Hair's
once-multitudinous enemies, but there hasn't been a single crank
call. Apparently the embers went out on that battle a long time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those in the crowd Saturday said they were just regular
auction goers and didn't even know who Madalyn Murray-O'Hair was.
Others said, yes, they had come out of curiosity, to see what the
famous atheist's stuff looked like and maybe take something home.
And a few had even known her.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Florence, 59, shook his head sadly at the auctioneer's
wisecracks and the crowd's laughter. ``I knew them, Robin best of
all,'' he said. ``It's really hard to see their things going like
this.''

 &HT;    Move On takes fight against impeachment online
 &HT;    By Dan Moffet
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In unprecedented numbers, legions of
Internet users are expressing their disgust for impeachment by
going online and pledging millions to defeat members of Congress
who have supported President Clinton's removal.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, about $12.8 million had been promised to the
cause, and close to 500,000 had signed Web site petitions to
``immediately censure President Clinton and move on to the pressing
issues facing the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The political grass-roots movement was launched into cyberspace
last September by two Berkeley, Calif., computer software
entrepreneurs. Fed up with the festering scandal they believe has
burdened the nation, Joan Blades and Wes Boyd began the Move On
campaign from the guest house in their back yard.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it has spread to all states _ friends e-mailing
friends en masse, a cyber chain letter multiplying geometrically
into a pyramid of protest at the MoveOn.org site, which cost all of
$89.50 to set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were blown away by the response we got,'' said Blades.
``The first day we had 300 petitioners. Then 1,500, then 9,000,
then 25,000 by the end of the week. The growth curve was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades, 42, who with husband Boyd founded Berkeley Systems, a
software company best known for its After Dark screen savers and
You Don't Know Jack computer trivia game, made wide inroads in
Florida, where about 7 percent of the connections have originated.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Brown, a Palm Beach Gardens businesswoman, joined Move On
in October and in December she took her protest to U.S. Rep. Mark
Foley's office on PGA Boulevard, dropping off hundreds of e-mail
printouts urging the Republican congressman to vote against
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a child of the '60s and I care about the direction of
this country,'' Brown said. ``The politicians just aren't
listening. This e-mail protest has grown into something they won't
be able to ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Burt Hall worked for the General Accounting Office in Washington
for 35 years and was its assistant director before retiring to Lake
Worth a decade ago. He signed a Move On petition in October because
he believed the Kenneth Starr investigation wasn't objective and
Clinton's private life should not be invaded for political
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, I've been an independent voter,'' Hall said.
``I voted for four Republican presidents and three Democrats. I am
a centrist who is opposed to the politics of personal
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the Dec. 19 impeachment vote by the House,
Move On has gained new momentum, expanding from soliciting
petitions to soliciting pledges for candidates. Blades and Boyd
created the ``We Will Not Forget'' campaign, believing Americans
would use their checkbooks to disprove the assertion of former
Wyoming Republican Sen. Alan K. Simpson that most voters cannot
remember the last movie they saw, let alone the last thing Congress
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the pledge campaign demonstrates that people do
have a good attention span,'' said Boyd, 38, ``and that they will
see to it that there is a consequence for politicians who do not
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to 19,000 Americans now have promised to donate money to
local campaigns, with pledges ranging from $25 to $1,000 and
virtually all of it going to Democrats. Blades said the Web site
acts only as a record-keeper for donations and receives no money
itself. None of the $12.8 million has been paid yet, she said, but
Move On believes the cash will start flowing as the 2000 elections
near.
</P>
<P>
   How much actually will be contributed is a question that will
remain unanswered until then. But the size of the numbers being
touted is already drawing notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably is the largest online petition in the history of
the Web,'' said Jonah Seiger, co-founder of Mindshare Internet
Campaigns in Washington. ``What Move On has done is something very
important. They're showing very clearly what the future of politics
will be about.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans remain skeptical, however, that all the promises
will be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds like a lot of money, but I'd have to know where
it's all going to come from,'' said Mark Pfeifle, spokesman for the
Republican National Committee. ``There are Web sites out there that
are supporting impeachment, too. Who knows if the money will ever
materialize?''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Ratcliff, press secretary for the Democratic National
Committee, said her experience is that people who go online and say
they'll send money usually do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know for sure what the case will be with this group,''
said Ratcliff, ``but generally the pledges we get over the Internet
do come in.''
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious limits to Move On's power. Few Congressmen
have changed their stand on impeachment after receiving the group's
e-mail petitions. Foley and fellow Palm Beach County Republican
Rep. E. Clay Shaw were unmoved, voting against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) received a Move On petition signed
by 6,600 constituents yet voted for impeachment days later. Rep.
Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) received 3,121 Move On e-mails and said
they bolstered her decision not to break ranks with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers saw the Internet petitions as electronic junk
mail and discounted the value of activism that takes only seconds
to transmit and comes via a computer chip. ``It is AstroTurf
lobbying,'' said Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.).
</P>
<P>
   But Blades and Boyd believe they have indeed unleashed the wave
of the future, and that the accessibility of the Internet is a
revolutionary tool for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're allowing people to be five-minute activists,'' Blades
said. ``People from all sorts of backgrounds are able to unite and
get behind this one 16-word statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, the Lake Worth retiree who has become Move On's manager
for Congressional District 19, held by ardent Clinton supporter
Democrat Rep. Robert Wexler, went door-to-door in the Capitol
delivering e-mail petitions to 25 congressmen last month. He
believes Internet activism is here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that a great percentage will follow through on
their pledges,'' Hall said, ``and that conservatives who say we'll
never do it will get a surprise in the election of 2000.''

   MEXICO CITY _ In a country where, according to some estimates,
up to 60 percent of the people are poor, and in a region with the
world's most inequitable distribution of income, Pope John Paul
II's trip to Mexico and Latin America this week will inevitably
sharpen the debate on the role of the Roman Catholic Church in
combating poverty and inequality.
</P>
<P>
   From Fray Bartolome de las Casas's defense of the indigenous
peoples of New Spain in the 16th century through the emergence of
liberation theology in the 1960s and 1970s, the Latin American
coincidence of a powerful church and widespread destitution and
inequity has led to unending acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   If in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union John Paul's
discourse and practice were consistent and unwavering, in Latin
America his stances over the past two decades have been ambivalent.
Like other foreign travelers for centuries, John Paul II has been
dismayed by his encounter with sheer misery, violence and
injustice: Through the Caribbean and Central America, across
northeastern Brazil, in the shantytowns outside Mexico City, he was
appalled by crowded conditions, pervasive corruption, drugs and
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   No sensitive visitor could react otherwise; his attacks on
unfettered global capitalism and ``neo-liberalism'' are to some
extent a consequence of his travels.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the pope has dismantled and dispersed the
scant defenders of Latin America's poor. Whatever one may think of
the ideas and tactics espoused by thousands of priests and lay
church workers _ all lumped together as liberation theologists _
for many years they were a voice for the voiceless where repression
or silence was the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Bishops have been transferred and seminaries shut down;
appointments in Mexico, Brazil, Peru and elsewhere have tended to
restore the Latin American church to what its critics said it had
traditionally been: an institution of the rich, for the rich, by
the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The dismantling of the progressive dioceses in Sao Paulo and
many of its anti-poverty initiatives, as well as the pope's recent
slashing criticism of the bishop in the Mexican state of Chiapas
for his ``indigenist'' theology, are examples of this trend.
</P>
<P>
   So while John Paul II has issued scathing attacks on the
widening gaps between rich and poor, between ethnic groups and men
and women, he has also helped to make any concerted effort to
alleviate these ills far more difficult. Even the one area where he
could have placed himself above the left-right fray and played a
lasting role in diminishing poverty and inequality fell prey to his
innate ecclesiastical conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Population growth in Latin America has been dropping for two
decades, but nowhere near rapidly enough to provide basic services
and social rights to millions of underprivileged people. The fall
in fertility rates is unevenly distributed: Young women in the
poorest rural areas or urban slums have several times more children
than middle-class or affluent women.
</P>
<P>
   While the church under John Paul has ceased opposing family
planning efforts in most nations in the hemisphere, it has
certainly not been a force for change on this crucial problem. In
the 20 years he has been pope, the region's population,
overwhelmingly Catholic, has risen to nearly 500 million from 335
million.
</P>
<P>
   While speaking up against Latin America's ancestral scourges,
Pope John Paul has silenced some of the most eloquent voices of the
very dispossessed he has devoted so much time to. This
contradiction will be part of his legacy.

ANALYSIS: SOME SENATORS HINT THAT TRIAL COULD END THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LEWINSKY, IMPEACH-LOTT,
IMPEACH-STARR, IMPEACH-JUDGE) 
(lb) 
 By ADAM CLYMER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the surface, the impeachment trial appears to be
on the verge of chaos, with Senate Republicans lacking a coherent
plan, House Republicans and Kenneth Starr throwing hail Mary
passes, and Senate Democrats in a state of fuming outrage.
</P>
<P>
   But everything could still end this week, if half a dozen
Republicans vote against witnesses, joining the solid ranks of
Democrats who did not want them to begin with and now feel that
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois and Starr pulled a fast one with their
secret effort to force Monica Lewinsky to audition for a role as a
witness. If that happens, and they join Democrats in rejecting a
call for witnesses, the next step will be to debate and vote on
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   There were hints of such a course on Sunday morning's television
talk shows. Four Republican senators said they saw little or no
need for witnesses, and three more said that they wanted witnesses
themselves but were not sure if a majority of the Senate would.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the most telling suggestion of all came from Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., who said on CNN's ``Late Edition'' that if the
Republicans would supply enough votes to defeat a motion for
witnesses, then, ``I believe we could completely avoid the vote on
dismissal. We would then, if necessary, have a vote on the
witnesses with the assurance that we're not going to have them. And
we could move on Monday or Tuesday to the final deliberation, up or
down. I think Democrats would leap at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, said in an interview Sunday
that there was only an ``outside, outside chance'' that the
dismissal motion would not be offered Monday. But he may be
bargaining over that question in his continual conversations with
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the dismissal motion is perhaps the only gambit
available to the Democrats. Republicans are not worrying about
losing the vote, but about having it at all, because a party-line
vote on that issue would make Senate Republicans seem as partisan
as their House counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   So on paper at least, there could be a quick accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difficulty may be in finding six Republican senators
willing to face the wrath of the right for denying Hyde, who
pleaded again Sunday morning for witnesses chosen by himself and
``my managers, the 13 intrepid colleagues who have marched into the
jaws of death, really, political death.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may also be no small matter to persuade Robert Byrd of
West Virginia, the leading institutional voice in the Senate, to
withhold the dismissal motion that he said Saturday he would offer.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this the only possible way back from a partisan abyss.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, was pushing an argument first advanced
by Joseph Isenbergh of the University of Chicago Law School. In a
recent article he contended that removal from office was the only
punishment for conviction of certain crimes _ ``treason, bribery
and other high crimes and misdemeanors'' _ but not for others, for
which removal is an optional but not a necessary result.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Collins said on CBS News' ``Face the Nation'' that separate
votes on the facts and the seriousness of the offenses ``would give
a lot of senators who are very concerned about the president's
actions, who believe that he did commit obstruction of justice, for
example, the opportunity to distinguish between those offenses and
the question of removal.''
</P>
<P>
   But without some accommodation, it seems likely that the
bitterness that tinged Saturday's Senate session will remain, and
only harden party lines.
</P>
<P>
   And the two parties in the Senate are beginning to show the same
kind of partisan deafness to each other's thinking that
characterized the House debate.
</P>
<P>
   Take the most dramatic development of the weekend, Starr's
successful effort to get a federal judge who holds her hearings in
secret to order Ms. Lewinsky to let the House managers size her up
as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, one of the calmer Senate
Republicans, said Sunday on CNN, ``I have trouble understanding
what all the fuss is about. They want, they possibly want Monica
Lewinsky as a witness. So they talk to her, and ask her, and sound
her out on views that they have and see whether she's going to be
of any help. And it seems to me that's a perfectly logical way to
proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats said they were baffled at the
Republicans' failure to see the obvious ``intimidation,'' as Sen.
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey put it on ABC's ``This Week,'' in
Starr's choosing to get involved and force her to testify.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the House had four months to issue a subpoena and did
not bother to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the big issue is not whether senators want to get this
over. It is the question of whether a few of the Republicans will
choose to buck their party's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the semidefection of Pat Robertson, the head of the
Christian Coalition, who said last week that the case was a loser
and should be dismissed, and then said Sunday, ``I wasn't
suggesting that somehow they ought to just close it all down,'' the
religious conservatives carry great weight in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of Republican senators wishing now that six of
their colleagues will be brave.

ART COLUMN:   NO ESCAPING THE DIFFERENT DRUMMERS OF TWO ARTISTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are certain American artists who don't quite
fit into neatly coded categories. They are peculiar and wonderful
creatures protected by and sometimes driven into their own worlds
where they make art by no rules, rhymes or rhythms but their own.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Hemingway and Stein, Billie Holiday and Thelonious
Monk, of Paul Taylor or, young as he is, Savion Glover. It isn't a
question of high or popular art. Time and taste alter those
categories. It isn't a question of being formally trained or
self-taught. Hemingway and Stein were as self-taught as Holiday and
Monk.
</P>
<P>
   It's that the drive to be themselves is part of their work: its
tension, its beauty, its flaws. You feel their need to transmit
what they see or hear over and over with minute, near-infinite
variations. Sometimes you feel that the code isn't meant to be
totally deciphered, as children will invent their own language to
assert independence but also to secure protection in a world that
does not accept them exactly as they are.
</P>
<P>
   What made me think of all this? Two museum visits, one to the
Whitney Museum of American Art to see the exhibition ``Ray Johnson:
Correspondences'' and another to the Museum of American Folk Art to
see ``The Art of Nellie Mae Rowe: Ninety-Nine and a Half Won't
Do.'' Received wisdom assigns them to immutably separate art
worlds. But I don't.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly they were worlds apart sociologically. Nellie Mae Rowe
was a Southern black woman, born in 1900, who spent her days in
rural and small-town Georgia and was a self-taught or folk or as
people now like to say ``outsider'' artist. Ray Johnson was a
Northern white man, born in 1927, who studied art formally and
found his place in a number of New York City's experimental art
movements.
</P>
<P>
   So much of what links them in my mind is temperamental. Both
have a way of being simultaneously open and secretive, as if they
were saying: ``Here is my way of seeing. Pay attention, but you'll
never understand everything because this is an ecstatic game I play
with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to find two people who spoke more differently:
Rowe was down-home, to say the least, and Johnson was the sort who
could never let a pun or anagram alone. But the blend of delphic
and childlike is unmistakable in both.
</P>
<P>
   Folk or outsider art (emotionally pure, accessible, reassuringly
primal) and high avant-garde art (intellectually pure, rarely
accessible and, if primal, threateningly so): these terms aren't
totally accurate when applied to either.
</P>
<P>
   For Rowe, with her wonderful sense of line and color and her
rich, part-pagan, part-Christian cosmology, was also a fine artist.
Johnson was a kind of folk artist, freely associating all kinds of
objects, symbols and people, turning them into visual and verbal
assemblages.
</P>
<P>
   What is more homemade or spontaneous than the mail art he is
credited with inventing as a serious form, the drawings,
photocopies and illustrated messages mailed to friends, the mock
fragment histories of art that incorporated their lives into his
fantasies? His collages can be sensuously beautiful as well as
clever. (Who would have thought you could see something fresh in
images of Elvis Presley or James Dean?) They let him find room in
his mind for all the stuff he loved: the masterpieces, the
detritus, the passing fancies, the correspondences and
cross-wirings.
</P>
<P>
   You see his eagerness for intimacy in the mail art, with its air
of ``We few, we happy, crazed but chosen few.'' But his isolation
is palpable, too. The piling up of names, numbers and gnomic
phrases starts to feel like compulsive stockpiling, what happens
when someone retires from the world to dream by and with himself.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Mae Rowe was a wife and a domestic who from childhood on
liked to draw and make dolls. When her second husband died, she
decided not to marry again. She turned her home and her yard into a
working museum filled with her drawings, paintings and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Call it uncommissioned environmental art. She must have craved
an audience because she kept inviting people to visit what she
called her playhouse. At first, some were frightened by her work
(call her a regional avant-gardist); they destroyed some of it and
broke her windows. But more and more people liked what they saw.
They signed her guest book and took the tours she offered. Thirty
years separate the death of Rowe's husband from her first one-woman
show. She thoroughly enjoyed the six years of success that followed
before she died of cancer in 1982. (The gospel song ``Ninety-Nine
and a Half Won't Do'' was sung at her funeral.)
</P>
<P>
   Rowe's colored pencils, felt-tip pens and crayons make a world
of total visual abundance. Animals, plants, humans and spirits
consort with one another and turn into one another. A man picking
cotton wears bright blue trousers and white spats; on one side of
him a matching blue hat with white trim hangs in a purple sky, on
the other stands a pale green dog. When expressways appear in her
work, usually with some dog or pig standing at their center, they
seem to be constructed from quilts and braided rugs.
</P>
<P>
   She paints heaven and Harlem (which looks like something out of
the ``Arabian Nights''), her neighbors and herself. Everyone is a
shape shifter; everything is charged with hypersensory life. Where
did the young boy in a pale watermelon-pink play suit and scalloped
cap come from? Those dogs with mighty Egyptian headdresses have a
calm and hieratic power. The mysterious black fish in a bright
yellow sea is frighteningly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson believes in abundance and magic, too, but high and
popular culture make up his world and his religion. He gives us the
forms and faces of artists and celebrities, surrounded by the stuff
of everyday life: newsprint, cigarette logos, flowers and song
lyrics. There are poets (Rimbaud, Dickinson), novelists (Joyce,
Fitzgerald), movie stars. (Check out Shirley Temple in black
leather.) He is an elegist. Here lies Janis Joplin, there lies
Yukio Mishima, each with their birth and death dates, surrounded by
symbols, references and Johnson's private associations. He is a
worshiper, too, offering iconography in the form of two saddle
shoes, one bearing the name ``John,'' one bearing the name
``Cage.'' Certain images pop up constantly, like rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   I mean that literally, and my favorite example is the
``Classical Head With Black Bunny.'' One side of the boy's face is
all antique grace; the other has metamorphosed into Johnson's
version of the irrepressible and ever-insolent Br'er Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's work was in plenty of shows but, friends and
colleagues say, he never got the recognition he wanted from major
institutions or collectors. He was 40 when he moved to Locust
Valley, N.Y., and he did his communicating by mail and telephone
from then on. It was the U. S. Postal Service that allowed him to
stage as many one-man shows as he wanted, until his suicide by
drowning in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   How complicated they both were and how gifted. Yet, what a
strange pull you feel between their desire to communicate with a
larger world and their urge to stay inside a small one, peopled
only by their private thoughts and apparitions.

<P>
   RICHMOND, South Africa _ Two revenge attacks _ including one on
a visiting government delegation in broad daylight in the center of
the town _ shook this small, rural town on Sunday in the wake of
the assassination of a prominent local politician on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The police said afterward that they were stunned at the boldness
of the two attacks, which left 11 people dead and took place while
dozens of armored police and army vehicles were patrolling the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very new tendency to shoot out in broad daylight,''
said South Africa's police chief, George Fivaz, who had been
meeting with the government officials just before they were
attacked. ``We are very concerned about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With South Africa's second post-apartheid election scheduled for
later this year, the political violence in this rural area, about
an hour's drive north of Durban, is being carefully watched for a
measure of what might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the new bloodshed, President Nelson Mandela canceled
a two-day trip to Uganda that he was scheduled to begin Monday.
``In view of the unfortunate events in Richmond over the last few
days, it was thought the president should delay his departure
overseas by a few days,'' said Marco Boni, a spokesman for the
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination of the politician, Sifiso Nkabinde, occurred
early Saturday morning when he was riddled with bullets as he left
a grocery store with his bodyguard and his bodyguard's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Nkabinde was once a member of Mandela's African National
Congress party but was expelled in 1997 for allegedly spying for
the former apartheid government. Since then he had joined the
country's new multiracial party, the United Democratic Movement,
and a bloody struggle for control of the area had followed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Nkabinde was arrested and tried on 16 counts of murder.
But he was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Since his release, Nkabinde had been elected secretary-general
of the United Democratic Movement and had apparently been
successful in opening more than 60 new branches for the party,
which among other things promises to hold a referendum on restoring
capital punishment and would abolish affirmative-action programs.
</P>
<P>
   There were three arrests of suspects in the assassination, but
all were later released. The head of the United Democratic
Movement, Bantu Holomisa, on Sunday renewed his call for peace. But
he dismissed speculation that Nkabinde might have been killed for
anything other than political motives.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few hours after a relative of Nkabinde picked up
his blood-spattered car from the police station that the
retaliation for his murder began.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that four men entered the home of the
Ndabezitha family at about 9 p.m. and opened fire, killing five men
and six women _ including an 82-year-old grandmother _ who were
gathered at the home for a relative's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the family was head of a local woman's chapter of
the ANC, though it was uncertain why they had been targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the family said they had been getting ready to sleep,
most of them on mats on the floor, when the gunmen came in shooting
indiscriminately and shouting: ``Why did you kill our brother?''
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Ndabezitha, whose wife was injured in the attack,
managed to hide in the bushes outside the house and stayed there
for hours, hearing the moans from the house but too scared to go
and help in case the gunmen were still nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just victims of circumstances,'' he said Sunday. ``I
cannot see a way for this to end. Now our side is angry. The young
people are angry and there will be more violence soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning there were several confrontations between
bands of youths supporting the African National Congress and those
who were followers of Nkabinde. At one point, the police had to
fire tear gas to break them up on a stretch of road a few miles
outside this town, where many of the fields are planted with sugar
cane.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the afternoon, a convoy of ANC officials wase ambushed
in the center of town by five men in a pickup trunk. They
maneuvered their vehicle to cut off two of the ANC cars and opened
fire on those inside. More than 50 shell casings littered the
street afterward, though the officials escaped unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the attackers were wounded, however. The police reported
that they had arrested all five men by the end of the day. They
were apparently driving a truck that belonged to Nkabinde.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bheki Cele, an ANC official who was in one of the ambushed cars,
said there had been rumors of an attack before, but he had not
taken them seriously. He said he had difficulty afterward trying to
calm the residents' fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying, `Look, they shoot you in the daylight _ how
about us?''' he said. ``I had thought the situation had
deteriorated, but this is worse than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day tension was high in this small town, where
shop owners say that people are too afraid now to even come to buy
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence has broken out several times in this area
since Nkabinde was ejected from the ANC. More than 30 people have
died as a result. But the massacre Saturday night was the largest
so far.
</P>
<P>
   In the lead-up to the 1994 elections, there was widespread
political violence in South Africa, most of it between the ANC and
the Zulu-based Inkhata Freedom Party. But in recent months the two
parties have been making headway in negotiating a peace treaty, and
many political analysts had been hopeful that this year's vote
would be largely peaceful.

PATIENTS FACING HIGHER COSTS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>

 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patients across the country are facing steep increases in
out-of-pocket charges for prescription drugs, reversing a recent
trend toward more liberal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Standard co-payments are often doubling for drugs that patients
have been using for years. But even bigger increases _ of 300
percent or more _ are appearing for some remedies that are not on
insurers' lists of approved drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs may be omitted, or dropped, from such lists because they
are deemed nonessential, like those for male impotence, baldness or
wrinkles, or to help people quit smoking. But in many cases,
insurers are refusing to endorse more costly new versions of
life-sustaining drugs when cheaper alternatives are available.
</P>
<P>
   This double-barreled increase means that if patients insist on a
certain drug, they might see the cost skyrocket from, say, $10 to
$50.
</P>
<P>
   But will patients always do better with the latest, most costly
drug, or is a flood of advertising making them think they will?
Conversely, is a generic version of a drug, or a cheaper name
brand, equally as good just because federal regulators and health
plans say it is? Those questions are open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers insist that their new drugs are better and have
fewer harmful side effects. By pushing cheaper, older drugs, they
say, health plans ultimately drive up costs for hospital stays,
nursing homes and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Employers and managed-care executives counter that they must
slow the explosive spending for prescription drugs, which rose 15
to 20 percent in each of the last two years as an array of costly
new drugs hit the market. Demand for those drugs, they say, was fed
by thousands of promotional visits to doctors, and $1.3 billion in
consumer advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Asking Congress to address the problem, President Clinton said
in his State of the Union speech last week that ``affordable
prescription drugs'' should be included in a restructured Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the debate's ambiguities can be seen in the case of
Jacqueline Lawrence, 70, of San Carlos, Calif. She used to pay a
total of $16 a month for two drugs, for high blood pressure and
bronchitis. But when she was forced recently to switch her Medicare
health plan to Aetna U.S. Healthcare, she found neither drug on the
list. She tried the alternatives, but ``all kinds of side effects''
forced her back to her original drugs. As a result, her monthly
costs tripled to $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a third drug that I take goes up to that extent, I don't
know how I will manage,'' Ms. Lawrence said. Her 88-year-old
mother, Lucille Warren, has faced similar problems. ``My mother
worries about it,'' she said, ``and that makes her feel worse.''
</P>
<P>
   While the choice used to be between generics and name brands,
there is now a three-tiered system for many drug plans. This month,
many of the biggest plans started charging $50 or more for drugs
not on their lists. In a letter to members in small businesses,
Oxford Health Plans explained the new system, using blood pressure
drugs as an example.
</P>
<P>
   An Oxford member typically used to pay $5 at the store for
captopril, a generic version of Capoten, an old drug made by
Bristol-Myers Squibb, or $10 for most brand-name drugs. Now, the
typical Oxford member's payment for generic Capoten would be $7.
For Accupril, made by Warner-Lambert, or Monopril, also made by
Bristol-Myers _ both on the preferred list _ she would pay $15 or
$20 or the retail price, whichever was less.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford members who work for large employers now typically pay
$20 for all brands, although some big companies still subsidize $10
payments.
</P>
<P>
   But in small businesses in New York, if the patient went off the
list _ for drugs like Merck's Vasotec, or the original Capoten _
she would pay $50 or the retail price. That would be $50 for
Capoten (retail price $94.95 for a month's supply) and $34.99 for
Vasotec, the retail price at the Seventh Avenue Pharmacy in Park
Slope, Brooklyn. (The pharmacy receives only a flat $1.75 fee,
regardless of the brand, said Bert Drachtman, the owner.)
</P>
<P>
   Even small increases hurt. ``To go to $20 from $10 is a big
jump,'' said Max Daniels, community events director of Hospital
Audiences, a small nonprofit agency in New York that is covered by
Oxford. ``My doctor can't prescribe generics for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct advertising by drug companies is feeding consumer
demand,'' said David Hom, executive director of corporate benefits
at Pitney Bowes, which covers 26,000 employees in the United
States. ``We could see people shifting from Mevacor to Lipitor,'' a
heavily promoted new cholesterol-lowering drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nicholas Hanchak, head of pharmacy management for Aetna U.S.
Healthcare, said the drug companies were using advertising and
thousands of visits to doctors to promote ``higher-cost items.''
The newer drugs are often essentially the same as older, cheaper
ones, he said, as determined by federal regulators and the
company's own physician and pharmacist review board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newer is not necessarily better, it's just better marketed,''
said Patricia Wilson, a consultant on managed drug-plans based in
Rosemont, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for drug makers, which are far more profitable than
other health care industries, say consumers get valuable
information from the ads, which they can take to doctors. But
managed-care executives say patients often demand advertised drugs
that are not appropriate or no more effective than cheaper
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   One factor influencing the lists is that HMOs often make deals
with drug makers, negotiating lower prices in return for pushing a
particular drug.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pochtar, a managed-care marketing director at Novartis
Pharmaceuticals Corp., added that charging employees more ``will
give them a greater appreciation for the drug benefit.'' He said,
``Most people with coverage take the drug benefit for granted.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Newcomer, medical director of Unitedhealth Group, one of
the biggest managed-care companies, said United added expensive new
drugs to its preferred list if they produced unique benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs accounted for 12 percent of Pitney Bowes' health costs
last year, a big jump from 7.5 percent six years ago. The company
has just introduced a new payment schedule: Employees now pay 30
percent of the retail cost of brands not on the preferred list, 20
percent for brands on the list, and 10 percent for lower-priced
generics. But there is no charge for drugs at Pitney Bowes' clinics
in Connecticut, where the company has 6,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the higher costs for patients, industry analysts see
little hope of slowing the increases in 1999. ``It's still going to
be double-digit,'' said Mary Sevon, a pharmacy benefit consultant
based in Fairless Hills, Pa. ``We saw 18 percent increases last
year and we are predicting the same level for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   She said some health plans are refusing to help pay for any
drugs except those on their list in ``categories that cost the most
_ cardiovascular, nonsteroidal pain-killers for arthritis, and
antidepressants'' like Prozac. Patients will have to pay the full
cost, which can be $60 a month or more, for these types of drugs if
they are not on the preferred list.
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations on the West Coast often offer a
list called a closed formulary, said Virginia White, vice president
of Integrated Pharmaceutical Services, a division of Foundation
Health Systems. The HMO typically does not pay for drugs that are
not on the list, unless a doctor can persuade the health plan to
make an exception when the preferred medication has not worked.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, for example, recently switched its California
members from Coumadin, a DuPont blood-thinner that protects against
stroke, to warfarin sodium, a generic the Food and Drug
Administration said was biologically equivalent. Dr. David Campen,
a Kaiser pharmaceutical executive, said the change had saved Kaiser
several million dollars in California, where it spends $1 billion a
year on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the FDA ruling, DuPont persuaded regulators in several
states that the generic would cause problems for patients now
taking Coumadin, preventing HMOs from making the switch in North
Carolina, Virginia and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Win some, lose some. Regulators in California and New York
overruled Kaiser when it tried to exclude payments for Viagra,
Pfizer's popular impotence treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Palomba, manager of health care planning and
administration at Timken Co., based in Canton, Ohio, said that
``some HMOs in some locations are being much more aggressive in
introducing closed formularies.'' But Timken still offers most
employees an ``open formulary,'' from which they can get any drug
for a moderate payment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Palomba said Timken's drug costs have been growing 20
percent annually. The company tries to minimize the spending by
reviewing the kinds and amounts of drugs its employees take and
sometimes recommending changes to an employee's doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Some California HMOs are squeezing the closed lists even
further, said Debi Reissman, president of Rxperts, a managed-care
consulting firm in Irvine, Calif. ``Instead of offering three to
six products in every therapeutic class, for example,
antidepressants or blood pressure drugs, they are moving down to
two or three products,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain plans may pay for the generic only and offer zero
coverage for brand-name drugs,'' said Neeraj Kanwal, executive
medical director of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, based in
Indianapolis. He said other plans pay only the relatively low cost
of the generic, say $7, while the patient pays $53 for a $60 brand.
</P>
<P>
   But he said there was ``a backlash against closed formularies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not a popular item for customers,'' Kanwal added.

MILLIONS PACK RACETRACK FOR PAPAL MASS IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pope John Paul II flew down from the skies in a
white helicopter into a racetrack Sunday and celebrated an outdoor
Mass for more than 1 million Mexicans, who chanted his Polish
childhood nickname, Lolek, in greeting.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who had been here three times before, chose Mexico for
his first papal trip after his election 20 years ago, and many
Mexicans feel that they have a special, personal bond with him. He
arrived on Friday to conclude a synod of bishops from all the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Mass, which he celebrated in Spanish, was his first
direct encounter on this visit with ordinary Mexicans, and the
outpouring of affection, hope and excitement was as vibrant as it
was during his first visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith in Christ is an integral part of the Mexican nation,''
the pope said in a homily that included special mention of the
indigenous peoples of Mexico, the poor and others in difficulty.
``Do not let this light of faith be extinguished! Mexico still
needs it in order to build a more just and fraternal society.''
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old pope, who is on a light schedule to protect his
fragile health, moved slowly but spoke in a firm voice.
</P>
<P>
   Believers from all over the country began gathering on the dusty
grounds on Saturday afternoon, sleeping overnight in cars or on the
ground. By midnight, the huge field was filled. And Sunday morning,
thousands of people who had spent the chilly night wrapped in
panchos, waiting to get in, were jammed outside the gates, pleading
_ many in vain _ for a closer glimpse of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``He means everything to us; he is our hope and our faith,''
Isabel Barrera, 46, said as she clung to a closed gate. Mrs.
Barrera, an accountant from Monterey, said she had attended a papal
event every time the pope visited. On Sunday, she said she was
counting on him to help the people of Chiapas, the southern region
where Indians and leftist rebels began an insurrection against
government troops in 1994 _ and where 45 Indians were massacred by
pro-government paramilitary fighters in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has not mentioned Chiapas or the stalled peace talks
there since his arrival in Mexico. But Mrs. Barrera, like others,
said he might have had the troubled region in mind when he spoke
generally about the needs and rights of Mexico's indigenous
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that are being done to those poor people in Chiapas
are terrible,'' she said. ``The pope can help mediate between them
and the government. He is the only one who can.''
</P>
<P>
   The horrors in other parts of the world did intrude into the
pope's message to Mexicans. John Paul ended his Mass with a prayer
for the Roman Catholic nun who was killed on Friday in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily, he asked Mexicans to protect human life and
re-echoed the church's teaching on abortion. ``May no Mexican dare
to wound the precious and sacred gift of life in the mother's
womb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged them to resist the lure of evangelical Protestant
sects, which have made deep inroads in Mexico and throughout Latin
America and are particularly strong in Chiapas. ``Sons and
daughters of Mexico and of the whole of Amerca, do not seek the
truth of life in fallacious and apparently novel ideologies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope made special mention of the sick in his homily and his
schedule included a visit to a hospital for terminal cancer and
AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he went in Mexico, the streets along his routes were
thronged with people, singing, dancing, waving and waiting for a
glimpse of him passing in his popemobile. Even people who described
themselves as nonbelievers said they were fascinated by the appeal
of this pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its amazing to see the people, their unity and fervor,'' said
Alejandro Gonzales, 26, a cafe worker who watched the pope's visit
on television. ``We've adopted this pope as our own. I wonder what
will happen when he goes, what will happen to all this fervor. Will
the next one be received with the same faith and devotion?''

`A SONG FOR MARY': THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE IN THE FIREMAN
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review) 
(DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dennis Smith is the author of those best-selling
books about firefighting like ``Report From Engine Co. 82,''
``Firefighters: Their Lives in Their Own Words,'' ``The Final
Fire'' and ``Glitter and Ash.'' But you wouldn't know this from
reading his atmospheric new book, ``A Song for Mary: An
Irish-American Memory.'' You wouldn't even know from most of it
that he would end up being both a writer and a firefighter. What
you mainly anticipate from reading about Smith's growing up is that
he will wind up breaking his mother's heart and going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Things were tough for him, as he tells the story of his life
from age 7 to 25, covering the years 1948 through 1966. As he makes
clear on every page _ unself-pityingly, but not without a touch of
manipulativeness _ the cards were stacked against him heavily.
</P>
<P>
   From as early as he could remember, his father was away in a
hospital, presumably from falling off a truck and breaking his
legs, although later he was to learn a darker truth. His mother _
the Mary of the title _ depended on welfare, supplemented by
whatever she could earn by taking in laundry and cleaning wealthier
people's apartments. She, the author and his older brother, Billy,
lived crammed together in a tiny tenement walk-up in Manhattan, the
heart of what was then a poor Irish neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Billy, a budding basketball star and a stellar student,
young Dennis seemed ill equipped to overcome his disadvantages.
While grown-ups liked him and kept telling him he could do well if
only he would apply himself, he found it difficult to pay attention
in class and to concentrate on his homework. What interested him
more was the street, where trouble found him in the form of friends
defiant of the law, fights he could not stay out of, beer he could
not resist drinking and drugs that thrilled him to score.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately the passionate attention of his mother (often
through the application of a strap) kept him in touch with his
gentler nature. No matter how far he strayed, he never stopped
wishing he could please her somehow, and this not only allowed him
ultimately to save himself, but also in the telling keeps the
reader's sympathy for him alive.
</P>
<P>
   So when the author explains his title, ``A Song for Mary,'' by
describing with unabashed sentimentality how he used to sing to his
mother the old Irish ballad ``The Rose of Tralee'' (``Oh, no, 'twas
the truth in her eyes ever dawning/That made me love Mary/The Rose
of Tralee''), we do not cringe with embarrassment. When,
three-quarters of the way through his story, he finally gets
himself into a scrape with serious legal consequences and can
extricate himself only by joining the Air Force, we are still
rooting for him.
</P>
<P>
   Smith tells this story in a series of present-tense vignettes
that detail his various experiences from having to eat detested
tripe under the threat of his mother's strap to the train ride
upstate that took him finally to a meeting with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for two photographs, I have never seen my father, and I
don't know what to expect,'' he writes. ``I know about these
places, though, for I've . . . read a lot of the Dickens books, and
nobody described lunatic asylums or poorhouses better.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of Smith's close-up technique is that several
blocks in Manhattan come to seem a ghetto surrounded by walls too
high to scale. For Dennis and his friends romance is not a green
light blinking across the water from East Egg but the neon
Pepsi-Cola sign across the East River; he dreams of taking a girl
down to the water's edge to gaze at it.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of his narrative is that the pace often slows to a
crawl, magnifying trivial emotions and making the course through
them seem sometimes endless. Worse, the unavoidable realization
that this is an adult looking back on his childhood makes you feel
that he is milking certain effects, even whining every so often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have anything new in the house,'' he writes
more than halfway through the book, ``except for the Bible and the
Formica table in the kitchen with the four puffy chairs that she
bought in a deal that took two years to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   How did Smith finally escape his seeming fate and become a
fireman and a successful writer?
</P>
<P>
   From his earliest years, apparently, his mother loved to read
aloud to him, and this instilled a passion for books that no matter
how badly he did in school he kept pursuing. Once when he asked if
he could have a new book, his mother said he would have to read all
the used ones in the library first. Undaunted, he set about trying
to do so. Throughout his troubled youth he never stopped reading.
</P>
<P>
   When he was discharged from the Air Force and began to look for
work, he recalled a happy childhood experience when he was awakened
one sweltering night on his fire escape and found ``a giant in
front of me, like a character in `Puss in Boots,' with big boots
folded over the knees, and he is picking me up as a group of other
firemen are running up the stairs behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't spell it out, his decision to become a
firefighter seems to have fulfilled whatever he was missing in his
youth. In turn this released in him what his mother had nurtured.
He began to write, and in this, his touching tribute to her, he
offers his thanks.

 &HT;    Counting every person in Atlanta census `critical' duty
committee to help complete
 &HT;    By Julie B. Hairston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the next census count just a year away, Atlanta
city officials are joining their counterparts statewide in pulling
out the stops to be sure every resident is counted.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Operating Officer Larry Wallace said getting an accurate
count on Atlanta's population is ``critical.'' For every 20 people
who are not counted, Wallace said, the city loses $400,000 a year
in federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens (during the census), we'll be locked into for
the next 10 years,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   During his State of the City address Jan. 4, Mayor Bill Campbell
said he will announce the formation of a special census committee
whose mission will be to aid the U.S. Bureau of Census in obtaining
an accurate count in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will reach deeply on all the constiuencies that we have
across Atlanta,'' said Wallace, who is working with the mayor and
Planning Commissioner Michael Dobbins to create the committee and
develop its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Complete Count Committee will contain representatives from
business, government, the religious community and various advocacy
groups. Its mandate will be to spread the word about the importance
of responding to the census questionnaire when it comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fear among people in some groups,'' Wallace said,
``that the information given about them will be disadvantageous to
them in some way later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta will not be alone in establishing its committee. So far,
133 local governments have pledged to designate panels to work for
an accurate census, according to Stephanie Staggers-Profit,
partnership coordinator for the census region that includes
Georgia, Florida and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah and Americus already have launched their committees,
and Staggers-Profit said she expects a number of other cities,
including Atlanta, to follow suit soon.
</P>
<P>
   The census committee that Campbell will appoint will receive
technical support from the Census Bureau as well as the U.S.
Conference of Mayors. Wallace said the city will provide funding
for the committee, but the dollar amount has not been determined
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to leave any stone unturned,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   When the preliminary count from the 1990 census was announced,
then-Mayor Maynard Jackson filed suit against the federal
government claiming that Atlanta had been undercounted by at least
20,000 people. The U.S. Court of Appeals eventually ruled that the
count, 394,000, would be allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said that next year the city will redouble its efforts
to count ethnic communities and the homeless population, the groups
most often undercounted in the census. The city's census committee
will ``touch those communities that might not otherwise have been
touched,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for the Census Bureau called
the decennial census ``America's largest mobilization in
peacetime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other time when the federal government tries to
reach out and motivate everyone to participate,'' said David
Hoffman, a census spokesman.

 &HT;    Gov. Barnes' to reveal specifics of transportation improvement
plan
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After weeks of dribbled-out details and a very
generalized sales pitch, Gov. Roy Barnes today gets down to
specifics as he introduces comprehensive legislation for a new
state authority to plan and oversee transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, to be unveiled at a midmorning press conference, will
empower a 15-member authority as the gatekeeper for all
transportation spending in the 13-county metro Atlanta region now
wallowing in traffic gridlock and facing a cutoff of federal
highway funds because of air pollution. Local governments who buck
the agency's decisions would face losing their state revenue
stream.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Urban Transportation Management Authority would also
be empowered to plan and operate a mass transit system, tying
together existing networks like MARTA and Cobb Community Transit
with a new series of intra-city commuter rail lines and a potential
rail link across the northern arc of Interstate 285 for which
Barnes has proposed seed money in next year's state budget.
</P>
<P>
   With the power to issue revenue bonds and to create special
service districts with the approval of the Legislature or local
governments, the new authority is the cornerstone of Barnes'
legislative agenda and may be the first test of his new
administration's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is satisfied with it,'' Barnes said. ``Everybody is
saying it takes too much authority away or it doesn't go far
enough. But I'm satisfied with the checks and balances.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, the new governor, elected in part on his promises to
tackle environmental and transportation issues, has been laying the
groundwork for a transportation fix which would start in metro
Atlanta and take in more areas of the state as traffic and
pollution trigger similar problems there.
</P>
<P>
   He has met with state highway officials and the Department of
Transportation board on the issue. Republican leaders, as well as
Democratic Party leaders that rule the House and Senate, are
included in weekly meetings with the governor in which the state's
transportation problems have been a major topic. And in several
speeches, Barnes has pitched a general concept, without divulging
specifics that might sound alarm bells.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to whetting the appetite of officials anxious for
details, that preparation also has put some otherwise skeptical
officials on record as agreeing with the governor's concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an intellectual starting point that people are in
agreement on,'' said House Minority Leader Bob Irvin (R-Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   But today's unveiling of the details could change all that.
Still, Barnes is well-positioned to push the plan in the
Legislature. In the Senate, where the bill will start, a longtime
Cobb County colleague and former head of the transportation
committee, Sen. Steve Thompson (D-Powder Springs) will spearhead
the push.
</P>
<P>
   While the House, typically a more argumentative body, might
prove more of a challenge, House Speaker Tom Murphy (D-Bremen) has
already given signals of support. Once one of the chief obstacles
to commuter rail, Murphy now says he's changed his mind.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Tranquil conditions will return to much of the East early this
week as the storm that fueled the weekend volley of severe weather
and heavy rain moves into the Canadian Maritimes. Although
excessive precipitation will not occur, the runoff from previous
rain and snow melt will lead to local flooding and river ice jams
across the interior Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Dry, gusty breezes from the northwest will buffet coastal New
England Monday. Farther west, a fast-moving jet stream disturbance
crossing the Great Lakes will cause clouds and light snow showers
to occur from Michigan to northern Pennsylvania. As the system
presses eastward, scattered light afternoon rain showers will fall
near the northern Middle Atlantic coast where temperatures reach
into the 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Subsiding air currents associated with an expansive high
pressure system will promote abundant sunshine and warm conditions
from Texas to the Southeast. Indeed, daytime readings will average
10 to 20 degrees above seasonal levels in many areas. Meanwhile,
partly sunny skies and seasonal conditions will affect the northern
and central Plains.
</P>
<P>
   A potent jet stream disturbance will spark heavy showers across
central and southern California Monday. As exceptionally chilly air
arrives aloft at high altitudes, the atmosphere will become
unstable, increasing the risk for isolated weak tornadoes or
coastal waterspouts. The chilly air will also cause snow levels to
drop to near 3,000 feet. Several inches of snow are expected in the
San Bernardino mountains near Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Arctic Sunrise
</P>
<P>
   At Barrow, Alaska, the relentless darkness of the Arctic night
has ended. The sun rose at 12:51 p.m. Sunday after having been
below the horizon since November 18. It set 98 minutes later. Now,
the amount of possible sunshine will increase by at least nine
minutes each day. Beginning May 10, the nation's northernmost town
will be in constant sunshine until late August. This Arctic sunrise
is the beginning of a slow, steady process that modifies bitter air
masses. As the rest of the United States reaches a midwinter ebb,
the brightening Barrow skies are the first true sign of spring.

RACAK MASSACRE PROVIDES IMPETUS TO NEGOTIATE A SOLUTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   RACAK, Yugoslavia _ The mosque in this Kosovo village still
looks like an abattoir, with thick smears of dried blood on the
plastic sheeting where 45 victims of a massacre, including three
women and a child, were brought from the ditch where they were
found.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days after the killings, filthy blankets, a woman's shoe
and an encrusted woolen cap lie scattered amid the blood, under a
tapestry depicting Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Except for two cows and a braying donkey, Racak is utterly
deserted, a thick icy fog wrapping the empty houses and a looted
shop advertising Wrigley's Spearmint gum.
</P>
<P>
   But the killings at this lonely spot have altered the future of
this southern Serbian province of only 2 million people, fewer than
10 percent of them Serb. Like the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of
thousands of Muslims in Bosnia, which so horrified the world that
it finally moved to end the killing, Racak has become a symbol of
Serb aggression. It has hardened ethnic Albanian resistance to Serb
control.
</P>
<P>
   It has also galvanized a divided and dilatory West toward a
serious effort to solve the Kosovo problem, which has been
festering for nearly a decade and could quickly return to the open
warfare that finally erupted last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while, history tosses up events that order and
galvanize what will follow,'' said a U.S. diplomat who is
struggling to bring the ethnic Albanians' divided leaders together
for credible negotiations with the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic. ``In the West, there is now a strong sense that we can't
continue to be paralyzed by this Godforsaken part of the world, and
that it's time to do something serious to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   As NATO once again threatens air strikes against Belgrade, the
U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill, and the European
Union representative, Wolfgang Petritsch of Austria, who had been
shuttling vainly between the Albanian factions and the Serbs, are
due in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on Monday with a new mandate
from the international community to get a unified Albanian
negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
   For the Imeri family, the West's paralysis has been murderous.
Four miles south of Racak, in the village of Dramnjak, Azemine
Imeri huddles with her daughters in the small house of a
sympathetic Albanian farmer, mourning her murdered son, Hakip, 29,
one of the Racak dead.
</P>
<P>
   The family had spent the early autumn in the mountains, fleeing
the summer's fighting between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians'
increasingly well-equipped Kosovo Liberation Army. But following an
American-engineered cease-fire in October, when NATO threatened air
strikes and unarmed international observers came to Kosovo, the
Imeris came down from the hills to Racak, where ``we thought
everything would be better,'' said Mrs. Imeri, weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Fatime, 24, broke in angrily: ``But after what
happened in the village, after what we saw from the police, we
can't live with the Serbs anymore in Kosovo. Every Albanian feels
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of urgency is felt by Kosovo's Albanian leaders as
well, said Blerim Shala, the well-connected editor of the weekly
political journal Zeri. ``After Racak, Albanian leaders understand
they must come together, and take away from Milosevic the claim
that he is ready for negotiations and the Albanians are not,''
Shala said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West is very tired of this crisis, and they will now try
to put intense pressure on both sides to come to serious political
negotiations,'' Shala said. ``That, I'm sad to say, is the good
side to this massacre. Everyone _ the Americans, the French and
even the Russians _ now understands there is no more time to
waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill will press the Albanians to unify behind a set of
principles endorsed last Friday in London by the Contact Group for
former Yugoslavia: the United States, Britain, Germany, Italy,
France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Those principles include effective self-government for the
Kosovo Albanians _ political, legal, judicial and police structures
parallel to the existing Serb ones. The idea is to provide a form
of political autonomy within the Yugoslav federation _ similar to
that which Milosevic stripped away in 1989 as he whipped up Serbian
nationalism to cement his hold on power _ but without independence.
Kosovo's final status could be decided at least three years later
through some form of referendum, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The intent is to bring the Albanian leaders, from the nonviolent
Ibrahim Rugova to representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army, to
a meeting outside Yugoslavia and finally hammer out an agreed
position.
</P>
<P>
   The Contact Group, whose foreign ministers are likely to meet at
the end of this week in London, envisages a rapid movement toward a
mini-Dayton summit meeting, like the negotiations with Milosevic
that ended the Bosnian war in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While every Albanian now, after Racak, says that only
independence for Kosovo is acceptable, noted Mahmut Bakalli, a
seasoned former Communist boss of Kosovo in days when it had broad
autonomy in the old Yugoslavia, ``What we could mean, and what we
all could accept, is independence from Serbian jurisdiction, and
autonomy within Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are notions that Milosevic, who still insists that Kosovo
is an integral part of Serbia, may also yet accept. He is isolated
abroad, and even his closest international allies, the Russians,
are now criticizing his policies. With more Serbs fleeing Kosovo or
sending their wives and children out of the province, and his army
and special police somewhat restrained by NATO's threats and the
international observers' presence, Milosevic may see Western
intervention as the only way to prevent Kosovo from independence in
the medium term.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Yugoslav leader has proved adept at giving away
Serb-held lands in Croatia and Bosnia he had vowed never to
renounce in exchange for foreign favors. While Kosovo is dear to
Serbs as the site of their oldest and most revered Orthodox
monasteries, and the cradle of their medieval empire, the wily
Milosevic might be able to convince ardent nationalists that it is
expedient, and certainly less expensive, to have the West
effectively police Kosovo, rather than the well-equipped Serbian
security forces, whose operations are draining Milosevic's meager
state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, if he chooses, said Bakalli, could argue that Western
observers or peacekeepers will serve to keep Kosovo within
Yugoslavia, to restrain the Kosovo Liberation Army and to protect
Serbs and their holy places in the province.
</P>
<P>
   For ethnic Albanians like the Imeris and Dr. Sylejman Krasniqi,
who runs a charitable medical clinic named after Mother Teresa in
the southern town of Prizren, Racak will have meaning only if some
form of lasting peace can emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi, 34, says the most common difficulties the clinic tries
to treat are widespread malnutrition among the poor and rampant
cases of stress, especially among the refugees who have fled to the
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost all their possessions, and many have lost family
members, and they are afraid of everything,'' he said. ``The old
people especially who come here, they are in shock. They simply cry
all the time. And I have only mild tranquilizers to give them.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, he was asked to visit a refugee who is living
with a family only 500 yards from this little storefront clinic.
``He was afraid to go outside,'' Krasniqi said. ``He said, `There
are so many police and I don't have any papers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for peace through Western pressure, Krasniqi expects more
conflict. ``After Racak, every Albanian in Kosovo now can see no
chance of remaining under the Serbian government, and no Albanian
politician could accept it,'' he said. ``We would rather risk death
than live like this. These massacres in the middle of Europe are a
shame to the whole world.''

MAN IN THE NEWS :  MICROSOFT'S STAR WITNESS   PAUL MARITZ

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is certain to be the hot seat. But Paul Maritz, who takes the
witness stand this week as the highest-ranking Microsoft official
scheduled to testify in the company's antitrust trial, is an
executive known for a cool, sometimes prescient, analytic style.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, for example, he was placed in charge of the Microsoft
Corp.'s prickly partnership with IBM in developing a new personal
computer operating system, OS/2.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Maritz had made up his mind. ``My judgment,'' he
recalled, ``was that the sooner we blew it up, the better.'' The
companies parted ways in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time in 1997, when two business school
professors approached Microsoft about cooperating on a book about
competition on the frontier of the information economy _ the
Internet software business. The initial response was favorable, but
Maritz, the senior executive in charge of most software development
and marketing at Microsoft, was adamantly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was engaged in a fierce competitive fight with the
Netscape Communications Corp., the early leader in the Internet
browser market. According to one e-mail message from Microsoft,
Maritz was concerned about the ``public relations implications'' of
a book that focused closely on the browser battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maritz foresaw the blowup over Netscape,'' said Michael
Cusumano, a professor the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Sloan School of Management and co-author of ``Competing on Internet
Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Maritz may have foreseen trouble, but certainly not of the
magnitude that Microsoft is now facing as the defendant in a
sweeping federal antitrust case. When he takes the stand early this
week the stakes will be high _ particularly since Maritz was the
executive who oversaw development of some of the main Microsoft
products at issue in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key products in this case were directly under his control,
and Paul Maritz knew exactly what was happening,'' said David
Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School and the other author
of ``Competing on Internet Time,'' which has been cited in evidence
by both the defense and the prosecution in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maritz is the person who executed the Internet strategy,''
Yoffie added. ``He is the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the trial began in October, the Justice Department and 19
states suing the company have portrayed Microsoft as a bullying
monopolist. Industry witnesses from Netscape, Intel, IBM, Intuit,
Apple Computer and America Online have taken the stand to echo the
government's theme that Microsoft illegally used its market muscle
to thwart the challenge posed by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is Microsoft's turn to present its side of a series of
meetings and deals with rivals and partners beginning in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Maritz is the first and most senior of nine
Microsoft executives scheduled to take the stand with a single
corporate objective: shred the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   His adversary in U.S. District Court in Washington will be David
Boies, lead lawyer for the Justice Department and one of the
nation's leading trial litigators.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz is regarded as the No. 3 executive at Microsoft, the
person with the most responsibility after William H. Gates, the
chairman, and Steven Ballmer, the president. As group vice
president for platforms and applications, Maritz manages the making
and marketing of Microsoft's Windows operating systems, its Office
productivity programs (Word, Excel and Powerpoint) and its browsing
software _ the corporate crown jewels and the products at the
center of the government's suit.
</P>
<P>
   His e-mail messages are already in evidence in the case on
matters like tightly integrating Microsoft's browser with its
operating system, blunting the Netscape challenge, and dealing with
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   To Microsoft and its admirers, the company's plans and actions
show a big corporation responding swiftly and successfully as few
do to the rise of a new technology, embracing it and bringing it to
users. To the government and Microsoft's opponents, they are the
anatomy of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   So Maritz, in a sense, is Microsoft's lead character witness.
People who have worked with Maritz describe him as brilliant
technically and in his business instincts. Though an intellectual
peer of Gates and Ballmer, Maritz, they say, has a very different
temperament _ quiet, reserved and deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Bill or Steve, you'll get an opinion within 60 seconds,''
a former Microsoft executive remarked. ``With Paul, it can take a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies in the industry generally welcome dealing with Maritz
as Microsoft's representative. ``Not full of bluff and bluster,''
was how one executive described him. Another noted that ``Maritz is
not on the hothead list, and that's not a short list at
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Maritz has never begun a conversation, as some others at
Microsoft do, by saying we're Microsoft and we're doing to do
whatever we want, said Gordon E. Eubanks Jr., president of the
Symantec Corporation, a software company. ``He is pragmatic,
someone with tremendous gray matter, and I've always found him to
be a man of genuine integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be a great character witness for Microsoft,'' added
Eubanks, who opposes the government's suit.
</P>
<P>
   Maritz has come quite a distance in his rise to become a senior
executive with a personal wealth of more than $300 million. Born in
Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia), he spent his early years on the
family cattle ranch, where, he recalled, they did not have
electricity 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   His family moved to South Africa when he was a teen-ager, and
his first exposure to computing was by happenstance _ an
experimental course in computer science at the University of Natal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got bitten by the bug,'' Maritz recalled last week in an
interview, which he agreed to under the condition that he would not
discuss the court case. ``I found that programming was an activity
that could occupy your whole mind for long periods of time, and
give you great satisfaction at the end of it because you have
produced something.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing college, Maritz went to London to find a job in
the computer industry _ knocking on doors, his possessions in a
backpack and staying at a 5 pound-a-night bed-and-breakfast. He
landed a programming job with Burroughs and later became a
researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. In 1981,
he moved to Silicon Valley after being hired by Intel, where he
worked for five years before joining Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been called an ``irony-free zone,'' but Maritz is
known for a cutting, often self-deprecating sense of humor. Today,
he says he admires the way IBM has remade itself, after its
travails of the early 1990s, but adding, ``Of course, as Dr.
Johnson said, there's nothing like the sight of the gallows to
focus the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Yaffa, a social services counselor, is not yet a
conscript in the PC revolution. ``It is a bit ironic to me that
after all these years, and with six PCs in our house, she refuses
to touch them,'' he remarked.

UNDATED: he remarked.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maritz has cooperated on at least one book on Microsoft _
``Showstopper,'' a flattering 1994 chronicle of Microsoft's
development of Windows NT, the company's operating system mainly
for corporate users. In that book, by G. Pascal Zachary, a reporter
for The Wall Street Journal, Maritz was depicted as ``calm and
sardonic,'' a ``classic field general'' who amazed people with his
grasp of technical details.
</P>
<P>
   But Maritz said in a recent e-mail exchange with a reporter that
he had refused to cooperate with the book written by Cusumano and
Yoffie because of the inevitable tendency of books to
``sensationalize'' events and that he thought it would prove to be
``just another management headache, of which we have a sufficient
supply.''

SPORTS COLUMN: METS ADD PATIENCE TO THEIR BATTING ORDER
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn, the San Diego Padres' all-star who knows something
about hitting, raved last March and again in October about the
patience of the Yankees' hitters, about their ability to identify
the strike zone and ignore those offerings thrown beyond it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just don't swing at bad pitches,'' Gwynn said once. ``The
great thing about that is, even if you're facing somebody really
nasty, you're making him work and eventually he's going throw so
many pitches that he's got to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Elementary. The Yankees forced San Diego's ace, Kevin Brown, to
throw 64 pitches in the first three innings in Game 1 of the World
Series, and after Brown departed early, the Yankees scored seven
runs in the seventh. Andy Ashby threw a staggering 29 pitches in
the first inning of Game 2 and was exhausted by the third inning.
The Yankees hit with extraordinary efficiency and they won 114
regular-season games and a championship.
</P>
<P>
   In this particular aspect of the game _ hitting with patience,
forcing the opposing starting pitchers to work and driving them
from the mound in the middle innings _ the 1999 Mets could be even
better than the Yankees of 1998. ``We should definitely be better
than we were,'' said Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager.
</P>
<P>
   The three additions to the Mets' everyday lineup are all gifted
with patience. The average major league plate appearance lasted
3.71 pitches in 1998; Rickey Henderson, Valentine's new leadoff
hitter, averaged 4.33 pitches per plate appearance, the best in the
big leagues, and he drew 118 walks. Robin Ventura, signed to play
third base, averaged 3.94 pitches and collected 79 bases on balls.
Right fielder Bobby Bonilla, acquired in a trade with Los Angeles,
averaged 3.82 pitches and a goodly number of walks in a season
affected by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Add that threesome to a batting order that already includes
Edgardo Alfonzo (4.11 pitches per plate appearance, third best in
the National League), John Olerud (3.87) and Brian McRae (3.98), as
well as the slugger Mike Piazza. Roughly, the Mets' projected
starting eight position players averaged 3.83 pitches per plate
appearance last season _ far higher than the Chicago Cubs' league
best of 3.75.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' shortstop, Rey Ordonez, is the exception in this
group. He is arguably the finest defensive player in the game and
his offense is undoubtedly the worst among regular players. He
provides no power: his 23 extra-base hits were the fewest of any
player with 540 or more plate appearances last year. He lacks
patience: only three regulars throughout the game drew fewer walks
than his 23. His at-bats are unproductive: he saw 3.04 pitches per
plate appearance last year, fewest in the majors. He does not run:
he stole successfully on 3 of 9 attempts last season. If Ordonez
was born in 1971, as he told reporters in 1997, then he is 28 years
old this year and probably won't improve much offensively _ which
may explain why the Mets vaguely discussed trading him for
Cincinnati's aging star, Barry Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that the Mets will be as good as the
Yankees in 1999, because they have a long list of potential
problems. The Mets are depending on ancients, from Henderson (40)
to Bonilla (36 next month) to the relievers John Franco (38) and
Dennis Cook (36). They have a peculiar clubhouse personality
because of so many short-timers like Piazza. The Mets' starting
pitching is fragile, and if you believe in hangovers, then remember
that the Mets must fight off the memory of the five-loss binge that
cost them a wild-card berth at the end of last season; there's no
telling how a slow start this year might manifest itself in the
Mets' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets should have a deep and talented bullpen, as well as
the best defensive infield in the game _ and with the patient
newcomers, an improved offense that consistently manipulates the
ball-strike count. ``It's something I really like offensively,''
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' approach at the plate helped them throughout last
season, when they scored more runs than any other team in the game.
They drove good pitchers off the mound in the middle innings and
then feasted on second-line relievers, middle relievers generally
being the poorest pitchers in the game. And the Yankees battered
young and raw and unrefined starters, like Chicago's Jim Parque,
who once threw almost 100 pitches in the first three innings. The
Mets of 1999 should have a similar affect.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine provides his own qualifiers: Henderson and Ventura are
both making the transition from the American League this year, and
Bonilla is coming back from injuries. That being said, Valentine
added, ``If all are equal to what they've averaged in their
careers, we should be about half a run better'' per game.
</P>
<P>
   Such an improvement would push the Mets from the bottom third
into the top third in run production in the NL and, in concert with
a healthy pitching staff, earn a playoff invitation. Presumably. &QL;

NEW YORK CITY BALLET: ILLUMINATING A MODERN WORK'S WILES
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Walton Cello Concerto,'' the new work Peter Martins
has choreographed for the New York City Ballet and more or less
named after its music, is one of the best of a genre. It is a
pure-dance response to 20th-century music.
</P>
<P>
   The 1956 score by the English composer William Walton is lyrical
and jagged, always refined and occasionally harsh. Martins
eloquently catches and translates its mix of the poetic and the
formal. Any fear that he would serve up the usual neo-romantic mush
in a dreamlike encounter between one man and two women on stage was
quickly dispelled at the ballet's premiere last Friday night at the
New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   As a plotless neo-classical trio, ``Walton Cello Concerto'' has
an unusually strong dramatic edge. The man onstage is clearly torn
between two different women: their archetypal roots go back to the
Harlot and the Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there is no overt narrative and there are no fully
defined dramatic characters as such. The dynamic difference between
the two women defines them in the abstract and the ballet's
structure defines the emotions that build up in the choreography.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to hear and to see in a ballet, visually enhanced
by fine lighting and bright costumes, that is also sensitively
danced by Damian Woetzel, Miranda Weese and Alexandra Ansanelli.
The cello soloist, Frederick Zlotkin, is the City Ballet's
principal cellist and one understands why the entire performance
was applauded in the pit by the orchestra members. Hugo Fiorato was
at his most splendid as the conductor.
</P>
<P>
   What George Balanchine, the City Ballet's co-founder, would have
thought of Martins' choice of an English composer is another
matter. When I once asked Balanchine why he never choreographed to
English music, he replied: ``What English music? Maybe Handel.''
</P>
<P>
   To each his own. Jan. 22 is Balanchine's birthday and on that
date Martins has been presenting premieres in the last few years
under the rubric, ``New Combinations.'' Balanchine, who died in
1983, would have been 95 years old last Friday, as Martins recalled
onstage at the beginning of the evening. ``We are all paying
tribute to a great man who continually gives us pleasure,'' he said
and invited Mikhail Baryshnikov to join him in a toast and in the
singing of ``Happy Birthday'' throughout the house. It was a
poignant moment. Lincoln Kirstein, the company's other founder, and
Jerome Robbins, who died in July, were no longer present to share
the toast. Guests from the outside are now invited in: It is a
``guys'' thing. Perhaps one day Martins will share the toast with a
(gasp) woman long associated with the company.
</P>
<P>
   As for his new ballet, it initially recalls Robbins' ``Opus
19/The Dreamer,'' set to Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto, which
is musically related to Walton's Cello Concerto, written for Gregor
Piatigorsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Stanley bathes the stage in blue lighting similar to that
of ``Opus 19,'' in which Woetzel also dances the lead. Dressed in a
pale blue leotard, he kneels at the start, curving his body and his
arms to a lush sound. This emphasis on arms is a major feature of
the ballet and when Woetzel folds his arms overhead as he rises, he
recalls Fokine's Specter of the Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weese enters in a short teal costume by Holly Hynes. She is
the lyrical ideal, occasionally angular in shapes that fit
nonetheless smoothly into the contours of her duet with Woetzel. He
often carries her on his side as she faces in a different
direction. The clarity of Zlotkin's cello is heard above the
orchestral sound but no dancer is identified only with the cello.
The cello, rather, propels the action. Woetzel places Ms. Weese's
hand on his heart and she bourrees as he kneels. In a striking
image that is repeated with some nuance, Ms. Weese hangs her head
back on Woetzel's extended arm. They are not so much back to back
as side by side.
</P>
<P>
   The second movement introduces Ms. Ansanelli, in an orange-red
costume that matches her fiery leaps and turns with the zigzags of
the music. The harp and other strings come to the fore here as
Woetzel arrives for a brief solo before beginning a dynamic duet
with his enchanting new partner, who lunges about with disciplined
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet music defines a sad entrance for Ms. Weese, who has lost
her man. Woetzel watches her dance and enfolds her in a strangely
realistic embrace before she folds up on his thigh like a pretzel.
It isn't long before the vivid music brings back Ms. Ansanelli for
a trio that solves the choreography's formal problems with striking
originality. The chain formations and arching silhouettes do not
recapitulate old motifs but invent new images. The women even exit
in different ways. Ms. Weese backs out to the left; Ms. Ansanelli
moves forward to the right as Woetzel kneels, the same but
supposedly different after his experience.
</P>
<P>
   The program opened with the Robbins-Bach ``Two- and Three-Part
Inventions,'' with Deanna McBrearty in a debut, joining a cast
distinguished for its playfulness and clarity. Nancy McDill was the
pianist.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Stulberg, a guest conductor, gave a welcome zip to
Balanchine's ``Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet,'' which remains
nonetheless insufferable. In 1993 the company danced it better than
ever, but the partly new cast now on view cannot clear away the
pomposity of the neo-classical ensembles. Nonetheless, Isabelle
Guerin arched fetchingly and swooned in the arms of a superb
partner, James Fayette in the second section. Jennie Somogyi poured
impressive energy into the ballerina role of the first movement, as
did Monique Meunier and Jock Soto in the Gypsy section.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Bruce Nash, one of the many people trying to rescue
network television from its steep ratings slide, has an idea.
Actually, this boyishly enthusiastic producer of so-called
reality-based shows has about a thousand ideas, and the number
seems to be growing by the minute as he reveals what he believes
will win back audiences: his confidential list of new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It is 19 pages long, not 19 pages of story treatments but 19
pages of single-line thoughts, each for a different show that he
says just might reverse the flight of viewers to cable channels,
the Internet and other forms of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, 52, has made a name for himself as one of the most
prolific producers of the reality-based shows, or shockumentaries.
Among his 50 specials are hits like ``Exposed! Pro Wrestling's
Greatest Secrets,'' ``Breaking the Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest
Secrets Finally Revealed'' and the now classic ``When Good Pets Go
Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Although these shows are sometimes criticized as exploitative
and low grade, at times focusing on car crashes, police chases and
the like, they are appealing to the networks because they are
relatively cheap to make, generally draw good ratings, particularly
among young men, and do well as reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nash is hoping to break from what has long been regarded in
the industry as a profitable but fringe realm into mainstream
network series. He has plans for shows about robots, the police,
dogs, ghosts, sports, dating, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the networks, battling declining audience share,
are responding. Nash is developing five sitcoms for them, and, he
said, more will be on the way shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have all the answers,'' Nash said. ``But I do have
some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sitcom deals, his company, Nash
Entertainment, is continuing to produce shows like the coming
``World's Scariest Videos,'' for NBC, and ``Cheating Spouses:
Caught on Tape,'' for Fox. And while all the new series may not
make it on the air, he has lined up two influential producing
partners, Ted Harbert, the former chairman of ABC Entertainment,
and Warren Littlefield, until recently the president of NBC
Entertainment, to push them through. A movie in development, ``Golf
Guru,'' is based on a true story about a high school golfing coach
who uses Transcendental Meditation, not golf clubs, to train his
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The networks are reluctantly admitting that the old system for
developing shows is failing. In some instances they are turning to
young producers in search of younger audiences and in others to the
people who are developing offbeat but popular fare like the
shockumentaries. Such shows have generally proved to be winners.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Nash's ``Breaking the Magician's Code'' first
ran on Fox in November 1997, it pulled in a Nielsen rating of 15,
edging out its main time-slot competitor, ``Monday Night
Football.'' And ``When Good Pets Go Bad'' pulled in a 10.9 rating
in November, just behind the highly popular network series
``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash followed a far-from-traditional path into the television
business. Before he began producing reality specials he was the
author or co-author of 80 books with titles like ``The Baseball
Hall of Shame'' and ``Amazing but True Elvis Facts.'' His forte has
always been knowing how to titillate a mass audience in large
measure with the volume of curiosities he throws at them.
</P>
<P>
   Nash says his aims are straightforward. ``There's not always a
noble purpose to this,'' he said. ``I'm not looking for a cure for
cancer. I'm trying to tell a story, to entertain. I try and do
something that might just take people's minds off their troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbert, a producer at Dreamworks SKG, said Nash ``just knows
what people like.'' He added: ``He doesn't have his finger on the
pulse of the country, but he has his hand on the right ZIP codes.
He's a populist.''
</P>
<P>
   The troubling issue, at least for some people, is the kind of
programming Nash is developing, and what it may mean for the
networks. Much reality-based programming has been criticized as
exploitative, low-brow entertainment that appeals to the basest
instincts, frequently with displays of graphic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these programs are not far off from Jerry Springer,''
Meryl Marshall, president of the Academy of Television Arts and
Sciences, said of reality-based programs in general. ``But they're
all part of a dialogue the audience is having with itself about
what it really wants to use television for.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics of the genre (not specifically Nash's shows)
complain that the shows trivialize real events at the same time
they sensationalize them, because of the way they are presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``In what sense is it reality programming?'' asked Sandra J.
Ball-Rokeach, a professor at the Annenberg School of Communication
at the University of Southern California who has researched
television violence. ``I've worked with the police a great deal,
and from my point of view those chases and shootouts are very
dangerous and scary. These shows desensitize the audience to the
fear and the emotions. The fictional police dramas are sometimes
more `real' because they give you that context. You get a much more
subtle understanding of character instead of just the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash said he rejected such criticisms and maintained that his
shows focused on much more than lurid images. A segment must be not
just enticing, but must also tell a story, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said, for instance, that his assistants had stumbled onto a
man who appeared actually to possess and to be sharing with some
researchers pieces of Albert Einstein's brain. ``We've checked, and
this is the real brain, I'm sure,'' insisted Nash, who is planning
a segment based on the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why disenfranchise the audience that likes that?'' he asked,
while acknowledging that pursuing such stories has proved highly
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who have worked with Nash describe him as a
producer who relies heavily on his own instincts, rather than on
what seems to be working for other shows on the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to do what he thinks is funny, what he likes, and
he knows what he likes,'' said Sandra Tsing Loh, a humorist who is
writing the pilot for one of his new shows, ``Dates From Hell.''
``It's refreshing, as opposed to all the conventional stuff you
hear sometimes from executives who will go on saying cliches like
`We want winners,' or `We want likability,' without any real sense
of what they mean.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Dates From Hell,'' the other series include
comedies about a pro wrestler, a ghost family, a robot family
trying to fit into suburban life, and a mother-daughter
relationship in which the daughter does the parenting and a sitcom
with talking dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Nash grew up in West Palm Beach, Fla., and received a degree in
criminal justice at Florida State University. He worked for several
years in the North Carolina state prison system as an analyst and
administrator, he said. But his love of trivia, principally about
sports and television, his great passions, led him back to Florida,
where he began writing the novelty books.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that he started thinking about Hollywood and sent
scripts and ideas to producers. In the early 1990's, he flew to Los
Angeles to try and push a project through.
</P>
<P>
   Nash laughed as he recalled driving around naively, dropping off
scripts with receptionists but he added that along with rejections
he had received some good advice: either to follow a single idea
passionately, or to throw up so many ideas that one had to stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose the latter path,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC finally bit at ``America's Best Kept Secrets,'' in 1991.
Next was a show for CBS, ``True Ghost Stories,'' followed by a move
to Los Angeles and further success. Nevertheless, he said, he has
still been regarded as something of an outsider, adding that the
industry's reluctance to accept people like him has been a

   ``This town is in trouble, but it is still full of barriers to

trying to bring them and their ideas in.''

   Indeed, he insisted, if the networks did listen to people like
him more often, there could be benefits. ``My view is, this just
might make you stop and watch TV,'' he said.

FOX SPORTS' KEITH OLBERMANN HAPPILY HAS RETURNED TO HIS FIRST LOVE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you watch Keith Olbermann anchor cable's Fox Sports News, you
are seeing what appears to be a satisfied sportscaster. This state
of mind is somewhat alien to Olbermann, an intense, impatient
one-man psychodrama who left ESPN in a public pique in 1997 to seek
happiness in hosting news shows within MSNBC's smaller cable
universe, then departed in abject frustration with two years left
on his contract when each night's work amounted to discussing the
Tao of Monica S. Lewinsky and Kenneth W. Starr for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Fox Sports News' $1 million-a-year anchor, Olbermann has
gleefully retraced his steps back to what he did for five years at
ESPN's 11 p.m. ``Sports Center''_ delivering sports news like a
rascally Dan Rather. A hockey goal is again ``a biscuit in the
basket.'' A three-point basketball shot again ends with a ``bang!''
Any reference to the hockey player Scott Niedermayer is punctuated
with ``dead!'' _ homage to an ``Animal House'' character.
</P>
<P>
   That Olbermann, 39, deftly made the transition from discussing
Brewers-Royals baseball scores to examining the legal ramifications
of semen-stained dresses carries little weight with him. MSNBC
relieved his brief news fever and psychotherapy made him realize
how much he loved sports, but hated ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a relief to be back in sports,'' Olbermann said last
week during a telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``I don't miss
news in the slightest. It was valuable for me to realize the
difference between focusing on an important story and being
obsessed by it. Now, whenever I see the impeachment, I burst into
laughter. It's so patently absurd to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Olbermann was the most dramatic move in Fox Sports
News' aggressive attempt to compete with ESPN, which for nearly 20
years has owned the sports-news franchise. ``Sports Center'' was
the bellwether, making the three-and-a-half-minute sportscasts
tagged onto the end of local news shows almost obsolete. CNN
covered sports and had its nightly sportscast, ``Sports Tonight,''
but ESPN ruled _ and still does.
</P>
<P>
   But the landscape has expanded. The Walt Disney &UR;  &LR; Co., which owns
80 percent of ESPN, added the 24-hour ESPNews; CNN teamed up with
another Time Warner division, Sports Illustrated, to create the
24-hour CNN/SI. And for the last three years, the Fox Sports Net, a
confederation of 22 regional sports channels seen in about 65
million cable television homes and owned by the Fox/Liberty
Networks and Cablevision Systems, has developed Fox Sports News.
</P>
<P>
   Sports-news programs like ``Sports Center'' and ``Fox Sports
News'' are considered centerpieces for the networks and a way to
brand themselves with viewers. They are relatively inexpensive to
produce, especially when compared with the high costs of big-ticket
sports rights, and can be very profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in Olbermann _ and paying nearly $1 million to buy out
his contract _ solved one of Fox Sports News' problems: a lack of
star power. Fox Sports Net officials needed the marketing jolt it
would get from hiring Olbermann _ one of a small group of
sports-news stars like ESPN's Dan Patrick, Olbermann's former
partner on ``Sports Center'' _ and CNN/SI's Fred Hickman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted credibility in the same way Fox Sports got it by
hiring John Madden,'' said Arthur Smith, the executive vice
president of Fox Sports Net. ``He's got an edge, a great sense of
humor and he looks at things sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in an opening night essay critical of both sides
in the National Basketball Association lockout, he attributed the
impasse to John Foster Dulles, the former Secretary of State, and
the philosophy of mutual assured destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Fox created a campaign valued at $5 million to promote
Olbermann's arrival through newspaper advertisements, television
spots, billboards and wraparound bus signs. But the campaign has
proved perilous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crossing Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica and a bus bore
down on me with a giant version of my head,'' said Olbermann, who
does not drive in a city of automobiles. ``I froze. What an ending
that would have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, said Fox Sports Net officials, Olbermann has more than
repaid the investment in him. About $10 million in new advertising
has come in, from companies like Coors, Yahoo, and Miller Beer,
since Olbermann was signed. Not all of it can be directly tied to
Olbermann, but Anthony Ball, the president of Fox/Liberty Networks,
believes he is the reason for most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to break people of the 11 p.m. ESPN habit,'' he
said. It's no small feat. ESPN is a hugely popular brand with
tremendous loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann is working an odd schedule, one required by the nature
of Fox Sports Net's regional sports networks, which lead in to the
news with live games. To maximize his presence, he co-anchors three
live programs: the 11 p.m. show in the Eastern time zone (seen
locally on Fox Sports New York), which is the 10 p.m. show in the
Central Zone, followed by the 11 p.m. show in the Mountain zone,
the 10 p.m. show in the Western zone, followed by the 11 p.m.
program in the West. He then tapes a 30-minute show for the
mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the venom that characterized his departure from ESPN
has dissipated, Olbermann still likes to lob salvos at his old
employer for being arrogant and being in danger of losing its
near-monopoly on the sports news.
</P>
<P>
   He would love nothing more than to topple ESPN. But first, Fox
Sports News has to deal with CNN/SI, a network seen in 14 million
cable and satellite homes, but whose 11 p.m. report is simulcast to
CNN's 74 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the cable news world, ratings are tiny. Olbermann's first
week showed some growth, but did not make up for the loss of NBA
games, which are stronger lead-ins for the news than National
Hockey League games.
</P>
<P>
   John Walsh, the executive editor of ESPN, seems unafraid. ``Fox
is in year 3, we're approaching 20,'' he said. ``If Keith can show
close to the magic he showed when he was here, Fox has a chance to
close the gap with CNN/SI.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Walton, the managing editor of CNN/SI, said: ``The hiring of
Keith Olbermann doesn't impact our world at all. Keith gives them
credibility, but at the end of the day, it's about content and your
news packages.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take years to declare a winner, with big-moneyed
corporate parents like Disney, Fox and Time Warner battling for
sports news primacy. For Olbermann, it will be a clash filled with
sardonic humor and the lusty taste of revenge. As he put it: ``It's
`kill'em, eat'em competition. ESPN thinks the ball game has been
decided. I think it's the top of the first.''

ST. JOHN'S BUOYANT DESPITE OVERTIME LOSS TO DUKE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All the signals were there Sunday for St. John's, the
signs that the inevitable drubbing by a superpower was at hand. Its
center was out with an injury and its best player was in foul
trouble. The premier player in the nation was dominating the
boards, owning the paint and, after all, this was Duke, a heavy
favorite to continue rolling toward a national championship game in
March.
</P>
<P>
   But St. John's did not heed the signs. In a breathtaking contest
before the first St. John's sellout in Madison Square Garden in
three years, with the injured Tyrone Grant in street clothes and
Ron Artest fidgeting on the bench until it was time for his
heroics, the eighth-ranked Red Storm came back three times from
double-digit deficits and took Duke, the No. 2 team, to overtime
before succumbing, 92-88.
</P>
<P>
   ``This showed us where we're at and where we can be,'' Artest
said. ``We're one of the top teams in the country. And we can be
the top team.''
</P>
<P>
   As far-fetched as that may have seemed before this game, it
seems nearly possible now. St. John's (16-4) has played two teams
ranked No. 2 at the time (Stanford was the other) and lost by a
total of 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   For St. John's, the loss to Duke (19-1) was anything but a
disappointment. Coach Mike Jarvis speculated beforehand that,
because of Grant's wrist injury, it would be hard to tell much
about his team during a stretch that takes it to Syracuse on
Wednesday and back home for top-ranked Connecticut on Saturday. But
Jarvis also insists that the Red Storm can learn from every game.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons of this one were immeasurable. St. John's dealt with
Duke's Elton Brand, who had 16 points, 12 rebounds and 7 blocked
shots before fouling out at the end of regulation. The Red Storm so
befuddled Duke point guard William Avery that he committed seven
turnovers in the first half to help St. John's avert an early
blowout. And the Red Storm had Bootsy Thornton to keep it in the
game with a 40-point barrage, including 8 points in the final 2
minutes 3 seconds of the first half to close a 10-point gap to 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was amazing,'' Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``We have
not had a kid have the success that Thornton had against us in a
few years. We tried everything. We were pushing people out there,
and when we thought we can get a two-possession lead and maybe play
defensive, boom, he hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's showed poise at the end even with three starters and
the sixth man, Lavor Postell, having fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players will leave very disappointed that they didn't win,''
Jarvis said. ``That's how they're supposed to leave. But when they
get to be older like me, they'll probably realize there are many
different ways to win when it's not on the scoreboard. If we get
better because of today, then we win. If not, then it's just a
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing minutes of regulation and the overtime were
frenetic, filled with magnificent defensive plays and stunning
shots.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's cut its deficit to 2 points with 2:35 left in
regulation when Thornton hit one of his seven 3-pointers. A minute
later, Artest _ back from an eight-minute sabbatical because of
foul trouble _ dribbled in front of Brand, a teammate and friend
from their days playing Amateur Athletic Union ball together at
Riverside Church in Manhattan. Artest hesitated, went to his left
past Brand and laid the ball in with his left hand to tie the score
as Brand picked up his fourth foul. The free throw put St. John's
ahead, 76-75, with 1:37 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Duke took a 3-point lead on free throws by Chris Carrawell,
who finished with 17 points, and Trajan Langdon, who had 15 points.
Brand blocked Thornton's shot from 2-point range and Artest missed
a 3-pointer that would have tied the score with 12.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But then Artest intercepted a Carrawell pass and put up a wild
3-point shot, drawing a foul from Brand that sent him to the bench
for good. With a chance to tie the score from the free-throw line,
Artest made just two of the three attempts.
</P>
<P>
   After two free throws by Duke's Nate James, the lead was back to
81-78 with 9.3 seconds left. But Erick Barkley, playing perhaps his
finest game at St. John's with 11 assists, fed Artest on the right
wing and, in traffic, Artest lofted a perfect 3-pointer with 1.1
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about him,'' Jarvis said of Artest, ``is he is
at his best when things are at their worst. Other people want to
run and hide. He wants to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither Artest nor Thornton could salvage the overtime. St.
John's led briefly and was down by a point after Thornton hit
another 3-pointer with 52.7 seconds left. But Duke made 9 of 11
free throws in overtime, including 3 of 4 by Carrawell in the final
18.9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Artest, who had 22 points and 5 steals before
fouling out with 18.7 seconds left, rubbed his eyes as if he had
just seen a two-and-a-half-hour mirage. He had not. The pain of the
loss was fresh enough that he could not talk to Brand afterward,
but the oasis St. John's glimpsed ahead was very real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to play an NCAA championship game in
January,'' Jarvis said. ``Very few people will ever know what that
feels like.''

WHEN DINING IN, PUT POETRY IN MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most puzzling mysteries of English literature remains
unsolved, although there are plenty of clues.
</P>
<P>
   It concerns what is possibly the greatest poem ever written,
which begins:
</P>
<P>
   Carnation milk,
</P>
<P>
   Best in the land,
</P>
<P>
   Comes to you
</P>
<P>
   In a little red can.
</P>
<P>
   No teats to pull,
</P>
<P>
   No hay to pitch;
</P>
<P>
   You just punch a hole
</P>
<P>
   In the sonofa ...
</P>
<P>
   I was taught that poem by my father, who pitched a lot of hay
and pulled a few teats as a lad in Moore, Mont. He did not offer a
solution to the mystery: Who wrote it?
</P>
<P>
   Credit for the above poem is commonly given to ``Anon.'' Was he
a resident of Carnation, Wash.? Do his sons and daughters work for
the dairy today? Are they being denied royalties on the world's
greatest poem?
</P>
<P>
   The second-greatest poem was written by Ogden Nash. And like
most great poems, it also concerns food and _ in this instance _
drink as well.
</P>
<P>
   Candy is dandy,
</P>
<P>
   But liquor is quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your favorite poet is Dixon Merritt. I can understand
that, because his literary output includes this classic.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful bird is the pelican,
</P>
<P>
   His bill will hold more than his belican.
</P>
<P>
   He can take in his beak,
</P>
<P>
   Food enough for a week,
</P>
<P>
   But I'm damned if I see how the helican.
</P>
<P>
   They don't teach poems like that in school any more. We can only
hope that students in home-ec classes are made aware of the poems
of Owen Meredith, who pointed out that:
</P>
<P>
   We may live without poetry, music and art;
</P>
<P>
   We may live without conscience and live without heart;
</P>
<P>
   We may live without friends, we may live without books;
</P>
<P>
   But civilized man cannot live without cooks.
</P>
<P>
   How true, and even beginning cooks can whip up a dish like this
one, which is credited to Carnation Farms. If so, it was probably
Anon's favorite soup.
</P>
<P>
   Bean Soup Anon
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-half cups chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (30 ounces total) small white beans (divided)
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon Italian seasonings
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh sage leaves (or 1 teaspoon powdered)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup low-fat evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a saucepan. Add the onions and garlic and saute
two or three minutes. Add the chicken broth plus 1 and one-half
cans of beans. Simmer 10 minutes, then puree in blender and return
to pot.
</P>
<P>
   Add the rest of the beans, the salt, Italian seasonings and
sage, to taste. Pour in the evaporated milk and heat before
serving. Makes four bowls. If you wish, you can add some slivered
ham to the pot after you have pureed the soup.
</P>
<P>
   You could also use Carnation evaporated milk in a classy main
dish like:
</P>
<P>
   Snoqualmie Valley Pork Chops
</P>
<P>
   4 boneless pork chops, }-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   One-half pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced onion
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   Low-fat evaporated milk or cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons marsala wine
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced rosemary
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper the chops and brown in olive oil in a medium-hot
skillet, four to five minutes on each side. Remove to a warm oven.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the pan the mushrooms and onion, adding a bit more olive
oil if needed. Cook over medium-high heat for two minutes,
stirring.
</P>
<P>
   Add the flour to the pan and stir-cook 30 seconds. Slowly add
the evaporated milk or cream, stirring. Use as much cream as you
need to achieve a fairly thick sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the wine, mustard and rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   Return the chops to the pan, spoon sauce over the top, and when
reheated serve. This should be sufficient for four dainty eaters or
two slobs.
</P>
<P>
   Wives and sweethearts who tend to pig out on pork chops might
heed this warning, also penned by Ogden Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, deck your lower limbs in pants,
</P>
<P>
   Yours are the limbs, my sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   You look divine as you advance _
</P>
<P>
   Have you seen yourself retreating?

DAY AFTER   DISMISSAL, EX-MINISTER BEGINS CAMPAIGN AGAINST
NETANYAHU

<P>
   JERUSALEM &UR;  &LR; _ When a secular Israeli politician whisks out a
skullcap and Bible, visits the Western Wall and seeks a blessing
from a top rabbi, it is clear that the fighting spirit is upon him.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was Sunday with Yitzhak Mordechai, who was dismissed
as defense minister on Saturday and geared up immediately for
political battle against his former boss, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Burly, silver-haired and very popular, Mordechai, 54 and
Iraqi-born, is expected to lead the emerging centrist party as its
candidate for prime minister in the May elections. In a country
dominated by the Ashkenazi, or European, elite, he would be the
first Sephardic immigrant to seek the top job in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The two declared center candidates, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the
former Army chief of staff, and Dan Meridor, the former finance
minister, are reportedly ready to step aside and unite behind
Mordechai, with whom they publicly joined forces on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is less important who wins than that we all win,''
said Shahak, who entered the race just weeks ago as a wild card and
at that time, the favored winner against Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   In his final Cabinet meeting Sunday morning, Mordechai, a
political moderate and ardent advocate of the peace effort with the
Palestinians, donned a yarmulke and used a Bible to thump
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deliver my soul, Oh Lord, from lying lips and a deceitful
tongue,'' Mordechai read from the Book of Psalms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My soul hath dwelt with him who hateth,'' he continued. ``I am
for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, he walked out, resigned from the Likud party, linked
up with the centrist party and visited the Western Wall, where, he
said, he starts ``every new chapter of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli journalists Sunday labeled Netanyahu's blistering
dismissal of his popular defense minister, which he carried out on
live television at the top of the Saturday evening news, as a
political blunder that could easily backfire against the prime
minister. Mordechai was considered the most cautious, pragmatic and
bipartisan member of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister is going to learn that one eats Yitzhak
Mordechai's vengeance off a cold plate, very slowly,'' Sima Kadmon,
a political analyst, wrote in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
</P>
<P>
   One poll Sunday indicated that Mordechai was eating into
Netanyahu's electorate, stealing as many as a third of his voters.
Another poll indicated that, as of now, Mordechai would trounce the
prime minister _ 48 percent to 33 percent _ in a second-round
runoff election. The challenge will be to rise above the Labor
Party candidate, Ehud Barak, to get into the second round. Polls
indicate that Barak is ahead of all center party candidates at this
time for the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   But election results here have often been at odds with the
polls, which failed to predict Netanyahu's victory in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Israel Radio, Netanyahu, who labeled his defense
minister ``immoral'' for consorting with the centrists, said he
considered it no loss and continued his brutal attack on Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not an electoral asset,'' Netanyahu said. ``He's an
opportunistic asset.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the center party leaders, the prime minister said,
``Every one of them is a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts disagreed. Nahum Barnea, a senior
political observer, called Mordechai a ``stereotype-breaking
politician,'' who is at once a former army general, a populist and
an admirer of the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Rabbi Ovadia Yosef (whom
Mordechai visited Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidacy of Mordechai for prime minister makes history,''
Barnea wrote in Maariv. ``For the first time in the history of the
country, a Sephardi is competing, and he is doing so as an equal.''
</P>
<P>
   A decorated war hero, Mordechai quit the army when Shahak, then
the chief of staff, chose Matan Vilnai over Mordechai to be his
deputy. But Mordechai proceeded to leap straight to the political
top when he left the army, joining Likud to serve as defense
minister under Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   After dismissing Mordechai, Netanyahu first asked Ariel Sharon
to fill the post in the months before the elections. Sharon said
Sunday night that he had declined. The prime minister then turned
to another elder statesman, Moshe Arens, a former defense minister,
who came out of retirement to challenge Netanyahu for leadership of
the Likud.
</P>
<P>
   The Likud internal primaries are Monday night, and Arens is
expected to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli political analysts have speculated that even with
Arens as defense minister, there would be a ``security vacuum''
until the elections. Since the campaign began in late December,
Israel's conversations with the Palestinians have essentially
stopped. Mordechai was considered a moderating force within the
Cabinet _ the one to halt impetuous moves and make conciliatory
gestures toward the Palestinians.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ When Pope John Paul II arrives in the United
States on Tuesday for a two-day visit to St. Louis, his first major
speech in that city will be at a rally of Roman Catholic youth, a
group the pope regards as vital to the church's future.
</P>
<P>
   When he first visited this country as pontiff 20 years ago, John
Paul was a relatively vigorous 59, and kept up a grueling schedule
as he swept through cities in the Northeast and Midwest. He returns
as a historic figure, a prophet of the postcommunist world and one
of the longest-reigning pontiffs in history, but also far frailer
physically.
</P>
<P>
   The church he will encounter here has been quieter politically
than it was on his first visit and even in the 1980s, when the
American bishops produced influential pastoral letters on war and
peace and the nation's economy. Controversies among lay people
these days have tended to show up mainly in local parishes, as in
Rochester, N.Y., last September when some Catholics objected to the
removal of an outspokenly liberal priest as their pastor.
</P>
<P>
   But quietly, under the surface, the church is undergoing
important shifts that will affect its future here well into the
21st century. Sociologists are finding that many young people are
increasingly individualistic in their religious views and often
divided from their elders on matters of sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be the next Catholic constituency,'' said Dean
Hoge, a professor of sociology at the Catholic University of
America, who is embarked with other academics on a major study of
young Catholic adults. The study has found evidence of sharp
generational polarization on issues like premarital sex and the
leadership possibilities for women in church and society.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the church is becoming more ethnically diverse
as a result of immigration from Asia and Latin America by Catholics
who bring their own traditions and, in some cases, attitudes about
church issues different from those of many of the American-born
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing the many different kinds of people in our
community that can't be categorized as just liberals and
conservatives,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of America, a
Jesuit magazine. ``We have to preach the Gospel to them and figure
out how to make them one church.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, the American Catholic population has grown through
natural increase and immigration by more than a quarter, to 61.6
million people. The United States is now the world's third-largest
Catholic nation, behind Brazil and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, the number of its priests has declined,
the result of a plunge in seminary enrollments that began 30 years
ago and has not been reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The changes can be readily sensed here in the Archdiocese of New
Orleans, which once encompassed a territory so extensive it
included St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Mass at Ignatius Chapel at Loyola University, a
Jesuit-run school in the city's Uptown neighborhood, 10
undergraduates circle their chairs and lean in to speak avidly
about what being Roman Catholic means to them. One sophomore calls
the church her ``centering point,'' while a freshman says it is her
``foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   But on some hot-button issues, where church teachings meet
social controversies, the young Catholics disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Six declare premarital sex to be always wrong, and six say
homosexual activity is wrong, too, positions in keeping with church
teaching. Asked whether women should be allowed to be priests, a
subject the Vatican has ruled off limits, the majority goes the
other way, six raising their hands to say yes, while the four
others quietly look on.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans also reflects the church's new ethnic diversity.
While the city has long been home to a large African-American
Catholic population, in recent years it has also been absorbing
many immigrants from the Caribbean, Central America and Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In a former marshland remade as a suburban neighborhood sits the
Mary, Queen of Vietnam parish, founded in 1983. During a midmorning
Sunday Mass, the white-walled sanctuary was packed with worshipers,
its pews, built to seat 1,000, so full that ushers had to search
for spots for latecomers. ``It's typically this crowded,'' said Anh
Cao, 31, a law student at Loyola.
</P>
<P>
   Among younger parish members, social issues seem to elicit a
generally conservative response, as when the question of whether
women should be ordained is raised with members of a youth choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never thought of that,'' said Kim Phan, 24, a graduate
student at the University of New Orleans. ``I've never imagined a
woman could be a priest.''
</P>
<P>
   Hieu Hoang, 22, a junior at Louisiana State University who is a
member of a parish women's group, the Daughters of Mary, offered a
similar response.
</P>
<P>
   Cao said Vietnamese Catholics strongly oppose abortion, in
keeping with church teaching. Such attitudes reflect the continuity
of traditional Vietnamese Catholic values, said Joseph Trung, 32, a
choir director and composer. ``It comes from the family, it comes
from the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But among American-born Catholics, sociologists are finding
strong generational divisions on a variety of social issues.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in America magazine by Hoge illustrated the
trend with graphs showing findings from his study of younger
Catholics that showed, among other things, that fewer than half of
Catholics under 30 believed homosexual activity was always or
almost always wrong _ in contrast with a majority of those over 30
(and about three-quarters of those over 50) who thought it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hoge's associates in that study, William Dinges, a
Catholic University associate professor of religion, said the study
has found that 90 percent of young people confirmed in the church
retain their Catholic identity, a far higher proportion than found
in a similar study of young adult Presbyterians.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dinges said, many of the young Catholics in the study
indicated that they regarded the church not as the bearer of
absolute religious truth, but as a denominational ``option,'' one
form of Christianity among many.

 NEW ORLEANS: among many. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   R. Scott Appleby, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of
American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame, said that
within such findings lie evidence of a loss of an ``embedded''
Catholic worldview among the faithful. ``I suppose what's been
called radical individualism in American society is the biggest
challenge to Catholic identity and to the Catholic church,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But on a more positive note for the church, Dinges said the
research also indicates that younger Catholics see the church's
sacramental life and a commitment to ideals of social justice as
vital to their religious identity.
</P>
<P>
   A symbolic element of the pope's visit will be his flight across
the U.S.-Mexican border on a trip on which he will likely emphasize
common concerns among North and Latin American Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Reese said the trip will provide the pope his first opportunity
to respond to Synod of America, a 1997 gathering in Rome of 200
bishops from the Western Hemisphere. Concerns voiced at that
meeting included poverty, the debt burden among developing nations,
the loss of Latin American Catholics to Pentecostal churches, and
issues related to immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of new immigrants in the United States, which is
a north-south issue,'' Reese said, is one the pope will likely
focus on.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million Hispanic immigrants entered the country
in the early and mid-1990s, most of them Catholics. But within the
church, other ethnic groups have grown, too, among them the
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Dominic Luong, pastor of Mary, Queen of Vietnam, said
the parish had about 3,000 members when it began in 1983. But now,
he said, there are 17,000 Vietnamese Catholics in the New Orleans
archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   He said the parish had recently contributed $7,000 to a
collection for Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch, and
that the local Vietnamese population had produced 31 priests and
had 47 young men and women studying to become priests and nuns.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a bright spot in a serious problem for the church.
A growing priest shortage has meant that an ever-larger number of
tasks, from administering parishes to working with immigrants to
teaching youth in Catholic schools, is falling to lay people, said
Appleby. ``That's a structural challenge that the church needs to
take more seriously,'' he said.

 &HT;    OLYMPIC OFFICIALS EXPEL SIX MEMBERS IN SALT LAKE SCANDAL, CHANGE
BIDDING PROCESS
 &HT;    With IOC-US-0125.

<P>
   LUASANNE, Switzerland _ With an apology and the promise of
sweeping reform -- starting with an unprecedented expulsion of six
members -- the International Olympic Committee on Sunday said it
will seek to restore the world's faith in the Games tainted by the
Salt Lake City bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
   IOC President Juan Antonio, struggling to steer the Olympics
through its gravest challenge in 105 years, appeared tired and
heartsick at an evening news conference in the Olympic Museum, the
pride of his 18-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I want to express my deepest apology to the athletes,
the people of Salt Lake City and Utah, the global Olympic family,
and the millions of citizens worldwide who revere the Games and
hold in esteem the high standards the Games represent,'' said the
78-year-old president. ``My apology is for the actions of those IOC
members who violated the bidding process for the 2002 Winter
Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC aimed its reproach at its own members rather than the
Salt Lake bidding committee, which faces four investigations in the
United States, including one by the U.S. Justice Department.
Olympic officials said they would limit their concerns to the
actions of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about whether we should be judging bidding
committees,'' said Dick Pound, the Canadian IOC member and chairman
of the special commission investigating the Salt Lake allegations.
``We concluded that we really should look after our own members.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending a weekend of nearly non-stop closed-door meetings, the
IOC's executive board called for the expulsion of six members for
improperly accepting nearly $800,000 in inappropriate payments from
the bidding committee.
</P>
<P>
   One member, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo received more than
$216,000 in payments, travel expenses and gifts from the organizing
committee, including $70,010 paid by the committee to Ganga's bank
account in Salt Lake City, according
</P>
<P>
   to a 31-page report issued Sunday by the IOC's special
commission investigating the bid. He and his family received more
than $115,000 in travel expenses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the IOC, Ganga said that he transferred
the money placed in his account to the national Olympic committees
of Central Africa, Niger and Congo. He said his frequent trips to
Salt Lake City were for medical care, which was provided free.
</P>
<P>
   The commission didn't buy his story. ``By engaging in such
conduct, Mr. Ganga has been unworthy of and jeopardized the
interests of the IOC in a manner incompatible with the duties and
obligations pertaining to his oath,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member commission also recommended the expulsion of
Agustin Arroyo(CQ) of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of
Sudan, Lamine Keita of Mali, Charles Mukora of Kenya and Sergio
Santander of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will continue investigating allegations against
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast, Kim Un-yong of South
Korea and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, said Francois Carrard, the
IOC's director general.
</P>
<P>
   One member, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands was issued a
warning for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also said Sunday that it would broaden the bidding
scandal investigation to seek evidence of wrongdoing in the bid for
the 1996 Atlanta Games, as wells as the 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2006
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is sending letters to the United States' and other
National Olympic Committees asking for any proof that IOC members
received inappropriate gifts, favors, compensation or other
assistance from Atlanta's bidding committee, said Dick Pound, the
chairman of the committee's special commission investigating
allegations related to the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic officials have denied that they broke any rules
in winning the Games. In addition to Atlanta, five cities bid for
the 1996 Games: Athens; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Manchester, England;
Melbourne, Australia; and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, a third IOC member also resigned in the scandal
Sunday. David Sibandze of Swaziland handed in his resignation to
Samaranch just before the report was released.
</P>
<P>
   Pirjo Haeggman of Finland and Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of
Libya resigned last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Essomba, the IOC member from Cameroon who died last year,
also was identified in the report. His daughter had received a
scholarship from the Salt Lake bidders to attend American
University, the initial revelation that touched off the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the investigation has hit African members
particularly hard, Keba Mbaye, the IOC member from Senegal and a
member of the special commission, said that the inquiry did not
target Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Mbaye acknowledged that IOC members from poor countries may be
more susceptible to temptation, but he said they are not exempt
from the Olympic rules. ``I want to say that the work of this
commission was done with strict impartiality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch expressed a sense of personal hurt. ``I am sincerely
disappointed that IOC members were involved in the events revealed
in this investigation and am deeply saddened by their conduct,''
Samaranch said. ``I am certain that the Olympic movement will
emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take personal responsibility for seeing these reforms
enacted, and the IOC will deal with any member who has not met the
ethical standards set forth in the Olympic Charter.''
</P>
<P>
   The embattled president called upon the six members targeted for
expulsion to resign ``to put an end to the ugliest chapter in the
history of the Olympic
</P>
<P>
   Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The full IOC meets in March to vote on the reforms and
expulsions, and a two-thirds majority is needed for removal. ``The
greatest service to the Olympic movement is for them to accept
their fate,'' Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scandal, Salt Lake City will retain the 2002 Winter
Games, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he has no plans to resign, but he said he will
ask for a vote of confidence from the IOC during the March session
here.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to fundamentally alter the bidding process, the IOC
executive board moved to ban visits by members to the six cities
bidding for the 2006 Winter Games. The selection of the city will
be made by a committee that will not include the executive board,
the single most powerful panel in the IOC. It would include eight
IOC members, three athletes and other officials. The panel would be
headed by Samaranch but the IOC president won't have a vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the process works, the IOC may adopt it for the selection of
future Olympic cities, beginning with the 2008 Summer Games. The
2004 Games will be in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Schultz, the president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said
he was pleased and impressed by the IOC's action. ``The Olympic
rings have been tarnished by all this, but this puts some polish
back on them,'' Schultz said. ``I think it sends a good signal to
our sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what had happened to create an environment that allowed
these abuses, Pound said the IOC had fallen behind the reality of
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of the Games changed so much from how much pain
was a city willing to endure to host them to an economic benefit of
$2 billion,'' he said. ``We just hadn't caught up to that.''

   LUASANNE, Switzerland _ With an apology and the promise of
sweeping reform -- starting with an unprecedented expulsion of six
members -- the International Olympic Committee on Sunday said it
will seek to restore the world's faith in the Games tainted by the
Salt Lake City bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
   IOC President Juan Antonio, struggling to steer the Olympics
through its gravest challenge in 105 years, appeared tired and
heartsick at an evening news conference in the Olympic Museum, the
pride of his 18-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I want to express my deepest apology to the athletes,
the people of Salt Lake City and Utah, the global Olympic family,
and the millions of citizens worldwide who revere the Games and
hold in esteem the high standards the Games represent,'' said the
78-year-old president. ``My apology is for the actions of those IOC
members who violated the bidding process for the 2002 Winter
Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC aimed its reproach at its own members rather than the
Salt Lake bidding committee, which faces four investigations in the
United States, including one by the U.S. Justice Department.
Olympic officials said they would limit their concerns to the
actions of IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about whether we should be judging bidding
committees,'' said Dick Pound, the Canadian IOC member and chairman
of the special commission investigating the Salt Lake allegations.
``We concluded that we really should look after our own members.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending a weekend of nearly non-stop closed-door meetings, the
IOC's executive board called for the expulsion of six members for
improperly accepting nearly $800,000 in inappropriate payments from
the bidding committee.
</P>
<P>
   One member, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo received more than
$216,000 in payments, travel expenses and gifts from the organizing
committee, including $70,010 paid by the committee to Ganga's bank
account in Salt Lake City, according
</P>
<P>
   to a 31-page report issued Sunday by the IOC's special
commission investigating the bid. He and his family received more
than $115,000 in travel expenses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written response to the IOC, Ganga said that he transferred
the money placed in his account to the national Olympic committees
of Central Africa, Niger and Congo. He said his frequent trips to
Salt Lake City were for medical care, which was provided free.
</P>
<P>
   The commission didn't buy his story. ``By engaging in such
conduct, Mr. Ganga has been unworthy of and jeopardized the
interests of the IOC in a manner incompatible with the duties and
obligations pertaining to his oath,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member commission also recommended the expulsion of
Agustin Arroyo(CQ) of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of
Sudan, Lamine Keita of Mali, Charles Mukora of Kenya and Sergio
Santander of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will continue investigating allegations against
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast, Kim Un-yong of South
Korea and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia, said Francois Carrard, the
IOC's director general.
</P>
<P>
   One member, Anton Geesink of the Netherlands was issued a
warning for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also said Sunday that it would broaden the bidding
scandal investigation to seek evidence of wrongdoing in the bid for
the 1996 Atlanta Games, as wells as the 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2006
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is sending letters to the United States' and other
National Olympic Committees asking for any proof that IOC members
received inappropriate gifts, favors, compensation or other
assistance from Atlanta's bidding committee, said Dick Pound, the
chairman of the committee's special commission investigating
allegations related to the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002 Winter
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic officials have denied that they broke any rules
in winning the Games. In addition to Atlanta, five cities bid for
the 1996 Games: Athens; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Manchester, England;
Melbourne, Australia; and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, a third IOC member also resigned in the scandal
Sunday. David Sibandze of Swaziland handed in his resignation to
Samaranch just before the report was released.
</P>
<P>
   Pirjo Haeggman of Finland and Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi of
Libya resigned last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Essomba, the IOC member from Cameroon who died last year,
also was identified in the report. His daughter had received a
scholarship from the Salt Lake bidders to attend American
University, the initial revelation that touched off the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the investigation has hit African members
particularly hard, Keba Mbaye, the IOC member from Senegal and a
member of the special commission, said that the inquiry did not
target Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Mbaye acknowledged that IOC members from poor countries may be
more susceptible to temptation, but he said they are not exempt
from the Olympic rules. ``I want to say that the work of this
commission was done with strict impartiality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch expressed a sense of personal hurt. ``I am sincerely
disappointed that IOC members were involved in the events revealed
in this investigation and am deeply saddened by their conduct,''
Samaranch said. ``I am certain that the Olympic movement will
emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take personal responsibility for seeing these reforms
enacted, and the IOC will deal with any member who has not met the
ethical standards set forth in the Olympic Charter.''
</P>
<P>
   The embattled president called upon the six members targeted for
expulsion to resign ``to put an end to the ugliest chapter in the
history of the Olympic
</P>
<P>
   Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The full IOC meets in March to vote on the reforms and
expulsions, and a two-thirds majority is needed for removal. ``The
greatest service to the Olympic movement is for them to accept
their fate,'' Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scandal, Salt Lake City will retain the 2002 Winter
Games, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he has no plans to resign, but he said he will
ask for a vote of confidence from the IOC during the March session
here.
</P>
<P>
   In a move to fundamentally alter the bidding process, the IOC
executive board moved to ban visits by members to the six cities
bidding for the 2006 Winter Games. The selection of the city will
be made by a committee that will not include the executive board,
the single most powerful panel in the IOC. It would include eight
IOC members, three athletes and other officials. The panel would be
headed by Samaranch but the IOC president won't have a vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the process works, the IOC may adopt it for the selection of
future Olympic cities, beginning with the 2008 Summer Games. The
2004 Games will be in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Schultz, the president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said
he was pleased and impressed by the IOC's action. ``The Olympic
rings have been tarnished by all this, but this puts some polish
back on them,'' Schultz said. ``I think it sends a good signal to
our sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what had happened to create an environment that allowed
these abuses, Pound said the IOC had fallen behind the reality of
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of the Games changed so much from how much pain
was a city willing to endure to host them to an economic benefit of
$2 billion,'' he said. ``We just hadn't caught up to that.''

QUESTIONING OF LEWINSKY CAUSES LEGAL CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Iowa, Pa.)  (See related IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LEWINSKY, IMPEACH-ASSESS,
IMPEACH-LOTT, IMPEACH-STARR) 
(lb) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By recruiting a federal judge and the independent
counsel to force Monica Lewinsky to submit to questioning this
weekend, the House managers provided what legal scholars say was
the first serious constitutional controversy in the Clinton
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   How Ms. Lewinsky came to be questioned brought the issue of
separation of powers among the branches of government before the
chief justice of the United States, who appeared to have
sidestepped the question at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Supreme Court has ruled that the Senate is the sole
trier of impeachments, the House managers did not seek
authorization from the Senate to interview Ms. Lewinsky. Instead,
they asked Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, to file an
emergency motion on their behalf with a federal judge to order her
to talk with them.
</P>
<P>
   Starr argued in court papers that the immunity agreement he
negotiated with Ms. Lewinsky gave him especially broad powers
entitling him to force her to tell her story to just about anyone
he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   After a closed-door hearing, Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled
that Ms. Lewinsky would have to meet with the House managers or
forfeit the immunity from prosecution which she had negotiated last
year with Starr. Judge Johnson did not explain her Friday evening
ruling, offering only a two-sentence order.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the closed-door hearing said that Judge
Johnson brushed aside objections from Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers that
her ruling ran counter to a Supreme Court decision that emphasized
the Senate's exclusive role in setting procedures for impeachment
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Tribe of the Harvard Law School said Sunday that he
believed that Judge Johnson's ruling improperly usurped the
constitutional authority of the Senate to run the impeachment
trial. ``The legality and wisdom of what she did is open to serious
question because of the issue of separation of powers,'' he said.
Her actions were made worse, he said, by doing it quickly and
without public explanation.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the 1993 ruling in which the Supreme Court ruled 9-0
that the Senate has not only the last word but essentially the only
word on how to discharge its constitutional charge to ``try all
impeachments.'' The ruling has been generally interpreted to mean
that the judicial branch has little if any role in impeachment
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, sought unsuccessfully to have the chief
justice block the questioning of Ms. Lewinsky. Harkin drafted a
letter to Rehnquist asking to prohibit the managers from
interviewing Ms. Lewinsky, citing the chief's ruling in the 1993
case involving the impeachment of a federal judge, Walter Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said Sunday that he tried to deliver the letter to
Rehnquist at the end of Saturday's debate, but as he was dashing to
catch up with him, Rehnquist got in a car and sped away. Instead,
Harkin gave the letter to an aide to the chief justice who agreed
to read it to him over the telephone. ``After the aide told me that
he had read it to him on the phone, I asked that a hard copy be
delivered to the chief justice's home,'' Harkin said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear to me that Judge Johnson had no right to make
this ruling,'' he said. ``That's the view Rehnquist has taken in
the past that the Senate is the sole power to set procedures in the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rehnquist apparently did not act on the request. ``I still
haven't heard from him,'' Harkin said Sunday evening. Harkin said
he sent the letter because the Senate rules prohibit motions on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Shane of the University of Pittsburgh said Sunday he
believed that the chief justice was obliged to act on Harkin's
request. ``It would have been within his power as presiding
officer,'' said Shane, an authority on the issue of separation of
powers. ``He could have prohibited the managers from proceeding
with the interview.''
</P>
<P>
   In his brief to Judge Johnson, Starr argued that his authority
to force Ms. Lewinsky to talk to anyone was unlimited. The immunity
agreement provides that she agrees to be debriefed by the Office of
Independent Counsel (OIC) along with ``representatives of any
institutions as the OIC may require.'' The brief interpreted this
clause to mean that Ms. Lewinsky ``has agreed to be debriefed by
representatives of any institution when so required by the OIC.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under that interpretation, Tribe said that Starr could require
Ms. Lewinsky to meet with representatives from the government of
France.
</P>
<P>
   The issue may be moot at least as it concerns Ms. Lewinsky, who
met Sunday afternoon with the House managers and representatives of
the independent counsel after her lawyers chose not to appeal Judge
Johnson's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief Starr also denied that he was acting as an agent of
the House managers. Rather, he said, he had a ``continuing duty to
provide the House with information relating to impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Starr's ethics adviser, Sam Dash of Georgetown
University Law School, resigned saying that Starr had adopted an
approach that improperly made him an advocate of impeachment before
the Congress.

 &HT;    Broncos plan to `fine-tune things a little bit'
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When the Denver Broncos arrived here Sunday, not even
talkative tight end Shannon Sharpe was ready to make a prediction
on the outcome of the matchup with the Atlanta Falcons. Several
veterans suggested, however, that the Broncos already have a slight
edge over the Falcons in terms of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game plan already is in and all we have to do down here is
fine-tune things a little bit,'' wide receiver Rod Smith said. ``It
was good to get it out of the way when we were back at home. We
could work on some things in our own element.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did last year, Denver coach Mike Shanahan and coordinators
Gary Kubiak (offense) and Greg Robinson (defense), installed the
entire game plan during the ``dark'' week after the conference
championship game. While the Falcons worked on their plans during
three sessions in Suwanee last week, head coach Dan Reeves opted to
wait for practices this week to familiarize the players with
detailed strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Because the league permits only one pool reporter at practices,
media distractions are kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you still focus a lot better in your own element,'' said
Denver strong safety Tyrone Braxton. ``We come in here knowing
we've already got a good, solid week of work behind us. Our
practices for the playoffs in general have been excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   They also serve . . .
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row Ralph and Evelyn Elam of Snellville
will sit at home and watch their son try to win a Super Bowl ring.
The parents of Broncos kicker Jason Elam, who starred at Brookwood
High School, will be just as nervous, though, as they'd be sitting
in Pro Player Stadium. ``I'll just be sitting here at home chewing
my nails,'' Evelyn Elam said on Saturday. ``Because it's the
Falcons playing the Broncos, I'm a little torn. I just hope
everyone plays well.'' Jason Elam scored 127 points in 1998,
hitting 23 of 27 field-goal attempts and all 58 of his extra
points.
</P>
<P>
   Red alert
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious security has been beefed up this week at Miami
International Airport, and for that, visitors can thank Denver
linebacker Bill Romanowski. No, it's not that local officials fear
the frenetic Romanowski will spit in someone's face, as he did to
Niners wide receiver J.J. Stokes in 1997. Instead, it's because he
and wife Julie Romanowski had $300,000 in jewelry stolen at the
airport last February, as they returned from a seven-day cruise.
Included was Romanowski's 1989 Super Bowl ring, earned while with
San Francisco. ``This time,'' Julie Romanowski said, ``we're
bringing no jewelry at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Party line
</P>
<P>
   With no curfew in effect yet, the Broncos offensive linemen will
put the $5,500 they collected in kangaroo-court fines this year to
good use tonight. The unit has an 8 p.m. reservation at one of this
city's most renowned restaurants, Joe's Stone Crab, and the group
has ordered stretch limousines for the occasion. The biggest
contributor to the kitty was assistant offensive line coach Barney
Chavous, fined $1,400 during the season. Left guard Mark Schlereth
was the most heavily-fined player, at $1,115. Others at more than
$500: right tackle Harry Swayne ($670), backup tackle Matt Lepsis
($640), offensive line coach Alex Gibbs ($620) and center Tom Nalen
($535).
</P>
<P>
   Party redux
</P>
<P>
   At Super Bowl XXXII last year, the offensive line dined at E
Street Alley in San Diego, where they shot pool and ate sushi. One
player who went hungry was offensive tackle Tony Jones from
Royston. ``That was my first time ever looking at (sushi),'' Jones
recalled, ``and I couldn't eat it. Anything raw, I don't eat it.
Give me some steak or something. None of that raw food, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Relativity
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe is the
younger brother of former Green Bay wide receiver Sterling Sharpe,
an NFL analyst for ESPN. And that rookie quarterback Brian Griese
is the son of former Miami Dolphins star and Hall of Famer Bob
Griese. But there are more Denver players with famous relatives as
well. Jack Elway, father of quarterback John Elway, is a former
Stanford coach and now serves as director of pro scouting for the
Broncos. Wide receiver Ed MaCaffrey is the brother of former Duke
and Vanderbilt basketball player Billy McCaffrey. Strong safety
Tyrone Braxton is the cousin of the late Jim Braxton, who played
eight NFL seasons in Buffalo and Miami. Cornerback Tito Paul is the
cousin of former Chicago and Tampa Bay safety Markus Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Age before beauty
</P>
<P>
   At age 38, John Elway will be the oldest quarterback to start in
a Super Bowl. Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler is 33. Their
combined ages, 71, is the oldest ever in a Super Bowl quarterback
matchup. In only six of the previous 32 Super Bowl games were both
starting quarterbacks 30 or older.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling a draft
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a veteran team, Denver got little production from its
'98 draft picks. Former Tennessee wide receiver Marcus Nash, a
first-rounder, played in only eight games and had four catches for
76 yards. Second-round selection Eric Brown, a strong safety from
Mississippi State, started nine of the first 10 games. But a
strained groin forced him onto the inactive list for six of the
final seven regular-season games and both playoff contests.
Third-rounder Griese played in one game and completed one of three
attempts for 2 yards. A pair of No. 7 choices, tackle Trey Teague
of Tennessee and Mississippi linebacker Nate Wayne, combined to
play in one game.
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the day
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Howard Griffith has started 16 of the 18 games the
Broncos played this year and has just four rushing attempts for 16
yards. Like injured Falcons fullback Bob Christian, the six-year
veteran is regarded as one of the NFL's finest lead-blockers.
Including receptions, Griffith has just 21 ``touches'' this season,
an average of 1.3 per game. He didn't touch the ball at all in four
regular-season games and hasn't had a carry in two postseason
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   At least one league official suggested to Chicago Bears
president Mike McCaskey last week that he interview Denver
defensive coordinator Greg Robinson. But McCaskey felt he couldn't
afford to wait until after the Super Bowl to land a coach. . . .
The Denver travel squad for Super Bowl XXXIII includes an
obstetrician. There are four players whose wives are pregnant but
will make the trip here. . . . Broncos left guard Schlereth has had
22 surgeries during his 10-year NFL career. . . . Free safety Steve
Atwater said again on Sunday that he is considering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Denver owner Pat Bowlen on whether the Broncos can lay claim yet
to being one of the greatest teams in history: ``At this point, I
don't think we approach the great teams of the past. I don't think
you (become) a great team by winning one Super Bowl. . . . The
standard of greatness in my mind is set by organizations like San
Francisco. They won five Super Bowls. They are the measuring
stick.''

 &HT;    Longtime Falcons employees finally get their shot at Super Bowl
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Linebacker Jessie Tuggle is the Falcons' most loyal
player, having spent his entire career _ 12 seasons or 187
regular-season games _ with the futile franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuggle's loyalty can't compare to the devotion of a handful
of longtime Falcons employees, who have endured countless losing
campaigns behind the scenes. For those select few, their allegiance
is finally proving fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 32 years and I always hoped before I retired
that I'd get to go to the Super Bowl,'' said Horace Daniel, the
Falcons' senior equipment director. ``Finally, it's come true. I
never dreamed that I'd make it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Falcons organization has witnessed more games than
Daniel, who joined the team in 1967, the second year of the
franchise. During his tenure, the longest of any Falcons employee,
Daniel has missed only two of 466 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to get to the Super Bowl,'' he said. ``Right now,
you're still in the role of trying to get ready. I really haven't
let it sink in yet. Maybe after the Super Bowl it will sink in.''
</P>
<P>
   There are others who have endured the long, painful road to the
Super Bowl. Tommy Nobis was the ``Original Falcon,'' the team's
first draft choice in 1966 after an All-America career at the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nobis, a five-time Pro-Bowl selection, played 11 seasons for the
Falcons _ all but three losing campaigns. Other than one year he
spent in private business in the early 1980s, he has been a Falcons
employee since. Nobis, currently the vice president for corporate
development, has more than 30 years of loyal service to the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is special, but probably no more so than a fan who's been
following this team the whole way,'' Nobis said. ``We've got some
really hard-core fans out there. If you've been involved with this
franchise, if you've been a follower or supporter of it, you've got
to feel very good about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you're awake, you're reminded of it. You can't pick
up the phone, you can't walk down the hall, you can't go down the
street, you can't turn on the radio, you can't pick up the paper.
You're going to see something that says Falcons. I love it. We
could get used to that very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Breeding, the Falcons' director of community relations,
graduated from Auburn in 1970. She joined the team in 1973 and has
spent the past 26 years working in various capacities for the
Falcons. As the club's main contact with the community, her duties
include charity fund-raising and overseeing the cheerleaders,
mascots and the Falcons Wives Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is overwhelming,'' she said. ``I still pinch myself every
morning when I get ready to come to work. Being so busy in January
is a wonderful feeling. Several of us say we're in the fourth
quarter out here, and let's go ahead and get this thing done. I
have several friends in the league, who came in the league after I
did, who have gotten Super Bowl rings or pendants. You've got to
feel good for them, but it's like, 'I just hope I get one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nobis, as well as the other longtime employees, say there's only
one feeling that can top the euphoria of the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, this is the ultimate opportunity,'' Nobis
said. ``Of course, we're not there yet. We need to go and win the
football game. I think all of us, starting with the players and
coaches, would be disappointed to get this far and not do it.
Anybody that's been on the losing end will tell you it's a low, low
feeling to go that far and not do it.''

 &HT;    Falcons prove top payroll no `Super' guarantee
 &HT;    WITH CHART info at end of file
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Because of the lucrative contract extension that keeps
him with the Atlanta Falcons through the 2002 season, quarterback
Chris Chandler will be the highest-paid player in Super Bowl XXXIII
in 1998 compensation. But if the title were to be determined by
salary instead of the scoreboard at Pro Player Stadium, the Falcons
would be even bigger underdogs to the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Including base salary and signing bonus, Chandler, who agreed to
a four-year extension worth $25 million in ``new money'' on the eve
of the season-opener, will earn about $8.5 million for 1998. But
the Broncos have the higher-paid players at 14 of 22 positions, not
counting the kickers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the payrolls of the conference champions, obtained by the
Journal-Constitution from NFL Players Association salary documents,
strengthens the belief that a franchise cannot buy its way into the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped Denver owner Pat Bowlen from trying.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' payroll of $63.4 million for 1998 is ninth-highest
in the league, and it was inflated by the signing bonuses Denver
annually pays to create breathing room under the salary cap. The
Falcons will go into Sunday's game with the same 16-2 record as the
Broncos, but they spent $51.9 million to earn it.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcing their persona as a blue-collar team that plays hard
and gets the most from its abilities, the Falcons were about 10
percent below the NFL average payroll of $57.5 million for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight teams spent below the '98 salary cap limit of $52.38
million. Of that group, only the Falcons and Miami Dolphins
qualified for postseason play. Conversely, the San Diego Chargers
($70.0 million) and Carolina Panthers ($67.7 million) rated at the
top of the payroll rankings but combined for nine 1998 victories.
Only half of the 12 franchises which spent more than the $57.5
million average made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have 11 starters earning less than $1 million in '98
compensation; the Broncos have nine. Three players from Atlanta and
one from Denver will start in Super Bowl XXXIII despite having
earned the league-minimum salary corresponding to the NFL minimums
for their respective seasons in the NFL. For those young players,
the playoff bonuses mean a chance to enhance '98 compensation by
nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Notable is that the Falcons offensive line includes a pair of
starters, second-year left guard Calvin Collins and rookie right
tackle Ephraim Salaam, earning the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The payrolls of the Falcons and Broncos reflect the philosophies
of the franchises regarding salary cap management.
</P>
<P>
   As he promised when he arrived in Atlanta, general manager
Harold Richardson has done an excellent job of not mortgaging the
future. The club spent lavishly in '97 on cornerback Ray Buchanan
and laid out the money necessary to keep Chandler this year. The
Falcons have not, though, been big players in the veteran free
agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Denver is adept at using signing bonuses to lure free agents and
restructured deals to find wiggle room under the cap. The Broncos
operate in much the same manner as the 49ers, frequently re-doing
contracts to substitute base salary for signing bonuses, extending
the term of a deal and lowering the cap value.
</P>
<P>
   Often the deals negotiated by the Broncos look better on paper
than they actually are. The nine-year, $51.9 million deal of
tailback Terrell Davis in 1998 is heavily backloaded, includes
plenty of escalator clauses and spreads his $11 million signing
bonus through four years. Davis received $1.833 of the bonus this
season.
</P>
<P>
   HOW THEY COMPARE
</P>
<P>
   1998 salary figures for the starting units of the Atlanta
Falcons and Denver Broncos. The compensation listed includes the
base salary and signing bonus but does not account for performance
intentives, such as Jamal Anderson's $850,000 bonus for his rushing
total. The figures were derived from NFL Player Association salary
documents:

 &HT;    Super Bowl pregame hype plentiful on TV
 &HT;    WITH SCHEDULE info at end of file
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you thought the Super Bowl hype was in high gear
last week, watch it shift into overdrive from now until the ball
finally is kicked off at Pro Player Stadium in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking a look at the deluge of national programming
leading up to the Falcons and Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII, give
WXIA (Channel 11) credit for opening the floodgates with its
extensive coverage of the Falcons' send-off on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While Fox affiliate WAGA (Channel 5) and its ABC counterpart WSB
(Channel 2) offered cut-ins, WXIA devoted two hours and 13 minutes
to the send-off, starting at 12:30 p.m. with the crowd gatherings
at Suwanee and Centennial Park and ending with the sight of the
Falcons' charter plane headed to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Under most circumstances, that would be a shameless case of
overkill. But given the level of interest and the public relations
points WXIA scored by offering viewers a chance to call in and talk
about the Falcons, WXIA probably won't take a beating in the
ratings for its decision.
</P>
<P>
   If not, that augurs well for Fox's plans to assault America with
seven hours of pregame programming on Super Bowl Sunday. Before
dismissing this as another case of Fox trying to see how far over
the edge it can go, consider the revenue from those seven hours,
plus the $92.8 million from the game, will place more than $150
million into the network's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Fox will trot out its biggest names for this
extravaganza. For example, the heavily promoted Keith Olbermann
will host ``Fox All-Access'' at noon, which will be a 90-minutes
behind-the-scenes look at the network's preparation, while analyst
John Madden will cover football since the beginning of the century
with his All-Madden Millennium Team.
</P>
<P>
   But viewers don't have to wait for Super Sunday to pig out on
pregame hype.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will bombard the airwaves with almost 80 programs from
Miami between now and kickoff. ESPNews and ESPN2 will have live
coverages of daily press conferences, along with the usual suspects
such as ``NFL Matchup,'' ``Monday NFL Countdown,'' ``NFL 2Night''
and ``Sunday NFL Countdown.''
</P>
<P>
   And though it's no longer an NFL partner, TNT will still air its
eighth straight year of ``Super Bowl TV'' with the 90-minutes
``Friday Night At The Super Bowl'' at10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sunday's send-off coverage, when the buses rolled into
downtown to circle Centennial Park shortly after 1 p.m., WSB blew
the live coverage of coach Dan Reeves' impromptu conference at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves arrived at the plane while the buses were downtown and
talked to reporters, which WXIA and WAGA carried live.
Incidentally, credit the WGNX reporter with being smart to get the
microphone close enough to Reeves' mouth so that the station logo
could be seen. Otherwise, WGNX would have been totally nonexistent
in the live coverage of the send-off.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Thrashers not interested in Keenan
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Before you ask, the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers, who are not expected to begin their coaching
search in earnest until the spring, will not pursue hot-tempered
coach Mike Keenan, who has been fired by the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell said simply, ``No,'' when
asked if Keenan would draw any interest from the expansion team.
Keenan won a Stanley Cup with the New York Rangers in 1994, but he
has flopped at his two coaching jobs since then in St. Louis and
Vancouver. He also was fired from jobs in Chicago and Philadelphia.
Keenan was hurt this year by the prolonged holdout of star forward
Pavel Bure. But he has long had a reputation for alienating his
players and prefers total control over personnel matters, which he
could not get in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a ripple effect of Keenan's exit that affects the
Thrashers. As expected, Canucks general manager Brian Burke hired
former Colorado coach Marc Crawford as Keenan's replacement.
Waddell reiterated that he was interested in talking to Crawford
about the Thrashers job, but he never classified him as a leading
candidate. Crawford played in Vancouver and is friends with
Vancouver general manager Brian Burke
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the opportunity,'' said Crawford, who was
first contacted by Burke on Thursday night. ``I'm real comfortable
with the philosophy and I'm comfortable with my superior.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case in Colorado. Crawford resigned with a year
left on his contract after last season, and the league ruled any
team hiring him this year must compensate the Avalanche with draft
picks and cash (a sliding scale depending on Vancouver's regular
season and playoff finish).
</P>
<P>
   Streakbuster
</P>
<P>
   The North American win allowed Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock to
break out of a 0-11 career slump in All-Star games at the junior,
IHL and NHL level. ``It hit me with about two minutes to go,'' he
said. ``I thought, 'Finally, we can move the conversation in
another direction.'' . . . There was only one penalty called in the
game, a tripping on defenseman Al MacInnis in the third period. . .
. Carolina/World goalie Arturs Irbe was credited with an assist on
a second-period goal by Anaheim's Teemu Selanne. . . . Next year's
NHL All-Star game will be held in Toronto at the new Air Canada
Centre. Atlanta is expected to make a pitch for the game in 2003 or
2004. . . . The three stars of the game were Wayne Gretzky (one
goal, two assists), Mats Sundin (one goal, three assists) and Mike
Modano (one goal, three assists). . . . Gretzky and New Jersey's
Bobby Holik led all players with five shots each.
</P>
<P>
   Sneak peak
</P>
<P>
   What are the chances that any players from Sunday's game will be
in an Atlanta uniform next season? Slim. Irbe is scheduled to
become an unrestricted free agent and earns a budget-friendly
$550,000 this season. But Irbe's surprising season has led the
Panthers to open talks about a contract extension. The Thrashers
also will have a shot at any unrestricted free agents, such as
Montreal forward Mark Recchi, who played for the North American
team Sunday. But Recchi already makes $4.5 million and Waddell has
said the Thrashers would pursue only a goalie if they dip into the
free agent market. If Atlanta spends an expansion draft pick on an
unrestricted free agent like Recchi and doesn't sign him, it will
receive a compensatory pick in the amateur draft from the team that
signs the player. This was one of the methods Nashville used to
stockpile picks last June. . . . Irbe on the possibility that
Carolina would leave him unprotected for the Thrashers in the
expansion draft: ``I'm not really thinking about that. It's out of
my control. For obvious reasons, with the year I am having, I would
to stay with the Hurricanes.''

half of 1998 than during the comparable period a year earlier,
according to a Washington-based group.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to be released Monday, the Center for Responsive
Politics, a not-for-profit research organization that focuses on
the effect of money in politics, found that the airlines and the
Air Transport Association, also based in Washington, spent $8
million in the first six months of 1998, the most recent period in
which records are available, compared with $5.6 million in the
first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The stepped-up lobbying came at a time when the Transportation
Department had proposed competitive guidelines for the industry
aimed at keeping the major airlines from driving low-fare
competitors out of their most profitable hub airports. Following a
fierce battle, Congress put off a final decision by asking for two
studies by the Transportation Department and the Transportation
Research Board before the guidelines are implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very active in participating in the process,'' said
David A. Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association,
whose 22 members include all the major domestic passenger and cargo
airlines. The group more than doubled its spending in the first
half of 1998 to nearly $2 million, from $868,000 a year earlier.
``There was an awful lot going on last year,'' Fuscus added. ``I
think that is normal for any industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition debate is expected to heat up again this year
even before the two studies are completed. In addition, several
bills that died in the last Congress are expected to be
reintroduced affecting a wide range of aviation-related issues,
including takeoff and landing restrictions at key airports.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, a subsidiary of AMR &UR;  &LR; Corp., led the lobbying
by individual carriers, spending $2.4 million, up from $1.7 million
in the first half of 1997. It was followed by Northwest Airlines &UR; ,
 &LR; which spent $1.2 million, up from $1 million the year before.
Delta Air Lines &UR;  &LR; and United Airlines, a unit of UAL &UR;  &LR; Corp., spent
$860,000 and $780,000 in the first half of 1998, while US Airways
and Continental Airlines &UR;  &LR; spent $440,000 and $360,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the subject of an inordinate amount of
congressional attention and we had to respond,'' said Chris
Chiames, a spokesman for American.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying budget of Southwest Airlines, &UR;  &LR; the country's
largest low-fare carrier, plunged to $80,000 in the first half of
1998, from $880,000 a year earlier. In 1997, Southwest
unsuccessfully tried to prevent the major airlines from convincing
Congress to shift the burden of passenger taxes to short-haul
airlines like Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that the airlines gave $3.8 million in
campaign contributions during the 1997-98 election season, 59
percent of which went to Republicans, though the complete tally
will not be available until March. During the last presidential
election campaign in 1993-94, the industry contributed $1.4
million, 56 percent of which went to Democrats.

ANALYSIS: SOME SENATORS HINT THAT TRIAL COULD END THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Changes ``Saturday'' to ``Friday'' in graf that begins ``But
it may.'')  (See related IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LEWINSKY, IMPEACH-LOTT,
IMPEACH-STARR, IMPEACH-JUDGE) 
(lb) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the surface, the impeachment trial appears to be
on the verge of chaos, with Senate Republicans lacking a coherent
plan, House Republicans and Kenneth Starr throwing hail Mary
passes, and Senate Democrats in a state of fuming outrage.
</P>
<P>
   But everything could still end this week, if half a dozen
Republicans vote against witnesses, joining the solid ranks of
Democrats who did not want them to begin with and now feel that
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois and Starr pulled a fast one with their
secret effort to force Monica Lewinsky to audition for a role as a
witness. If that happens, and they join Democrats in rejecting a
call for witnesses, the next step will be to debate and vote on
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   There were hints of such a course on Sunday morning's television
talk shows. Four Republican senators said they saw little or no
need for witnesses, and three more said that they wanted witnesses
themselves but were not sure if a majority of the Senate would.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the most telling suggestion of all came from Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., who said on CNN's ``Late Edition'' that if the
Republicans would supply enough votes to defeat a motion for
witnesses, then, ``I believe we could completely avoid the vote on
dismissal. We would then, if necessary, have a vote on the
witnesses with the assurance that we're not going to have them. And
we could move on Monday or Tuesday to the final deliberation, up or
down. I think Democrats would leap at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, said in an interview Sunday
that there was only an ``outside, outside chance'' that the
dismissal motion would not be offered Monday. But he may be
bargaining over that question in his continual conversations with
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping the dismissal motion is perhaps the only gambit
available to the Democrats. Republicans are not worrying about
losing the vote, but about having it at all, because a party-line
vote on that issue would make Senate Republicans seem as partisan
as their House counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   So on paper at least, there could be a quick accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difficulty may be in finding six Republican senators
willing to face the wrath of the right for denying Hyde, who
pleaded again Sunday morning for witnesses chosen by himself and
``my managers, the 13 intrepid colleagues who have marched into the
jaws of death, really, political death.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may also be no small matter to persuade Robert Byrd of
West Virginia, the leading institutional voice in the Senate, to
withhold the dismissal motion that he said Friday he would offer.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this the only possible way back from a partisan abyss.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, was pushing an argument first advanced
by Joseph Isenbergh of the University of Chicago Law School. In a
recent article he contended that removal from office was the only
punishment for conviction of certain crimes _ ``treason, bribery
and other high crimes and misdemeanors'' _ but not for others, for
which removal is an optional but not a necessary result.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Collins said on CBS News' ``Face the Nation'' that separate
votes on the facts and the seriousness of the offenses ``would give
a lot of senators who are very concerned about the president's
actions, who believe that he did commit obstruction of justice, for
example, the opportunity to distinguish between those offenses and
the question of removal.''
</P>
<P>
   But without some accommodation, it seems likely that the
bitterness that tinged Saturday's Senate session will remain, and
only harden party lines.
</P>
<P>
   And the two parties in the Senate are beginning to show the same
kind of partisan deafness to each other's thinking that
characterized the House debate.
</P>
<P>
   Take the most dramatic development of the weekend, Starr's
successful effort to get a federal judge who holds her hearings in
secret to order Ms. Lewinsky to let the House managers size her up
as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island, one of the calmer Senate
Republicans, said Sunday on CNN, ``I have trouble understanding
what all the fuss is about. They want, they possibly want Monica
Lewinsky as a witness. So they talk to her, and ask her, and sound
her out on views that they have and see whether she's going to be
of any help. And it seems to me that's a perfectly logical way to
proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats said they were baffled at the
Republicans' failure to see the obvious ``intimidation,'' as Sen.
Robert Torricelli of New Jersey put it on ABC's ``This Week,'' in
Starr's choosing to get involved and force her to testify.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the House had four months to issue a subpoena and did
not bother to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the big issue is not whether senators want to get this
over. It is the question of whether a few of the Republicans will
choose to buck their party's right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the semidefection of Pat Robertson, the head of the
Christian Coalition, who said last week that the case was a loser
and should be dismissed, and then said Sunday, ``I wasn't
suggesting that somehow they ought to just close it all down,'' the
religious conservatives carry great weight in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of Republican senators wishing now that six of
their colleagues will be brave.

SPORTS COLUMN: BULLS-PACERS THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ At long last, after more than six months of lockout
languor, the National Basketball Association opened Sunday
afternoon with its first game, for want of a better term.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the only game on the schedule. The Chicago Bulls,
defending champions of the league and with three full practice
sessions under their belts, played host to the Indiana Pacers, who
may very well dethrone them. For that matter, the Clippers, the
Grizzlies, the Raptors, the Kings and the Nuggets may sweep past
them in the won-lost column.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that the Bulls were decimated by the retirement
of one player, which received some notice, as well as a clutch of
trades and free-agent departures.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening when the Bulls' new coach, Tim Floyd,
introduced his players _ most new to the fans, all new to him _
before an open scrimmage at the United Center, he had had just one
day of practice. With microphone in hand at center court, he forgot
to mention Bubba Wells, who had just come over in a trade, and
wasn't sure which one was Martin Muursepp, another new tradee.
``And here's Robert Werdann, another former St. John's player who
is from Canada,'' Floyd said cheerily, linking Werdann with Bill
Wennington, the Bulls center.
</P>
<P>
   When Werdann came out to take a bow, he whispered to Floyd,
``I'm from Queens,'' in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game Sunday, Mark Jackson, the veteran point guard,
who is also not from Canada but from Queens, said that he and his
Pacers did not view this game as ``payback.'' For the last time the
Pacers peered at Bulls jerseys in the United Center, it was last
May 31 in the seventh and deciding game of the Eastern Conference
finals _ the only time in the Bulls' six championship seasons when
they were extended to seven games in any playoff series. And the
Pacers took the Bulls into the last minute of play before the
celebrated retiree took the game in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we felt fortunate to take the Bulls to seven
games in a tough series,'' Jackson said. ``We thought we were a
better team. We were disappointed that we lost. We thought we were
a better team even after we fell behind in the series two games to
none, and a lot of people believed they would sweep us. This Bulls
team is not the same team _ no Jordan, no Pippen, no Rodman, no
lots of guys _ but it's still a team in the NBA and a team we want
to look good against. We don't feel sorry for them. They didn't
feel sorry for us when we were sent home last season.''
</P>
<P>
   Wennington, who was a reserve with the Bulls for the last few
seasons, chose to address the crowd before the game. One wondered
if he felt like a lion tamer trying to soothe the restless and
somewhat famished assemblage surrounding him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season was called the Last Dance,'' said Wennington,
alluding to the name that Phil Jackson, the departed coach, had
given it. ``This is more like the First Dance. There'll be
mistakes, and there might not be the right chemistry right away,
but we're going to work hard. Give us a chance and we'll get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked around at the crowd and concluded, ``All the players
are happy to be back playing basketball and hope you enjoy the
games.'' He seemed relieved to retreat to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers started their familiar starting team from last season
_ Jackson, Reggie Miller, Rik Smits, Dale Davis and Chris Mullin.
The lone starter from last season for the Bulls was Ron Harper;
other starters were Toni Kukoc, the sixth man for the championship
Bulls, along with Wennington, Randy Brown and Dickey Simpkins, all
reserves from the glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers took an early and rather ragged lead and kept it,
though the Bulls came from 18 back with five minutes left in the
game to edge to within 6 points with 45 seconds remaining. All
starters were gone and the Bulls had some people on the court named
Roy Rogers and Bubba Wells and Matt Steigenga and Curtis Staples
and Muursepp. And the crowd was lustily cheering their comeback as
if they were _ well, you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   They wound up losing, 79-71. ``The best thing is that we're
still 0-0,'' said Floyd afterward. ``I think we did OK for a group
still trying to learn each other's names.''
</P>
<P>
   A guy named Kornel David, a 6-foot-9-inch forward from Hungary,
looked unexpectedly strong for the Bulls around the hoop and even
hit some outside shots. As for the Pacers, Al Harrington, the
first-round draft pick who is just out of St. Patrick's High School
in New Jersey, scored 9 points and impressed the Pacers' coach,
Larry Bird. ``He's fearless,'' Bird said of the 6-9 forward, ``he
will take it right to you. The game's a little different for him
right now, but he'll pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   And how did it feel for Mark Jackson to be back playing in an
NBA game after that long, long layoff?
</P>
<P>
   ``Felt great,'' he said. ``We were tired of beating up on each
other for six months.''

CUTS TO STATE COMPANIES HURT CHINA'S DISABLED 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The blind man in a frayed cotton jacket stood on the
sidewalk, hawking cheap plastic shopping bags without much success
to shoppers who scurried past.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Li Bohui, 43, was trying to supplement the $30 he
receives each month for his years of service in a failed
state-owned brush factory.
</P>
<P>
   China's drive to wring out money-losing state industries has
been hard on many workers, but perhaps roughest of all on people
with disabilities, like Li.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, China has employed many disabled people in
subsidized ``welfare factories,'' where they worked at simple tasks
for modest salaries. In a country that rarely provided welfare
payments to anyone, this allowed the disabled to earn a living of
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   But now that system is collapsing because few such companies
have been able to compete in the emerging market economy. As a
result, hundreds of thousands of people with impaired vision or
hearing, paralyzed limbs or other disabilities have lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic problems have hit the disabled much harder than
the general population,'' said Zhou Yongshen, a sociologist with
the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The government's new strategy is to integrate the disabled into
the mainstream work force. But these efforts are running up against
a cultural legacy of discrimination and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Like other laid-off workers, the disabled are supposed to
continue receiving small subsistence payments from the companies
where they worked. Experienced only at welfare factories, their
education usually minimal, the middle-aged disabled have little
prospect of finding new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, it was hard to get any schooling,'' said Li,
explaining why he turned to peddling. ``I think it's much better
for younger people today, if they can get an education and a
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town at the Beijing School for the Blind, 19-year-old
Wang Xiuming is one of those younger people, gaining a skill that
represents the latest push among advocates for the blind.
</P>
<P>
   Along with many of her classmates and hundreds of other young
blind people around the country, she is studying therapeutic
massage _ an ancient tradition in Chinese medicine that is
increasingly being taken over by blind masseurs, trained at special
institutes for work in hospitals, clinics and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands more of China's blind people already work as
masseurs _ most of them illiterate and lacking the advanced
training provided by this Beijing school, perhaps offering their
services in beauty parlors or along roadsides.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing young blind people to become medical masseurs or,
second in popularity, piano tuners, is seen by officials and
students here as a step forward, offering the chance of more
independent careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about many occupations,'' said Ms. Wang, ``and I
decided that this one was suitable for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the channeling of bright blind students into these
``appropriate'' professions also shows how far China remains from
bringing disabled people into the mainstream, a goal sought more
avidly in the United States and other Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the concerns of the disabled began receiving
serious attention here as Deng Pufeng, a son of the late leader
Deng Xiaoping, helped create a national federation that he still
heads. Deng's legs were paralyzed years earlier when, facing
persecution in the Cultural Revolution, he jumped out of a window.
Now Deng, who uses a wheelchair, is a well-connected advocate for
greater opportunity for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Most disabled children in cities now receive the universally
required nine years of schooling, with special help if needed. But
in rural areas, where there are no funds for special schools or
classroom helpers, many still do not get a basic education.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the lack of funds, in part because attitudes
toward them still tend to range from paternalism to disdain,
disabled Chinese have only slowly entered universities and
professions. An anti-discrimination law was enacted in 1991, and
progress has been greatest for those with physical problems such as
paralyzed legs; hundreds of such people have attended university.
</P>
<P>
   But blind people still are kept largely in separate domains and
even today, officials at the Beijing school say, few if any blind
students are attending ordinary university classes anywhere in
China.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that China lacks the money for widespread
introduction of computerized speech synthesizers, which are
increasingly used by the blind in schools and workplaces in the
United States. The Beijing school is experimenting with computer
techniques but is also developing its own college-level course in
medical massage.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare factory system had been developed on a large scale
in the late 1950s, when everyone was expected to help build the new
socialist state. In recent years, tens of thousands of these
factories have employed about 1 million disabled people doing
everything from folding book pages to making matchboxes or toys.
</P>
<P>
   Now the government is pursuing integration by trying to require
all companies and institutions to hire some disabled people. In the
mid-1990s in Beijing and eight other cities, trial efforts began to
require companies to hire at least 1 percent of their workers from
the disabled, with fines for noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent was good, but so far, these policies have not been
very successful,'' said Zhou, the sociologist, who has studied the
program. Over a recent two-year period in Beijing, only about 400
disabled people got jobs through this policy, he said, ``and if
that sounds bad, in Shanghai over three years only 100 people got
work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller firms see the requirement as a hardship, Zhou said,
while larger, successful state enterprises often find it easier to
pay a fine than to comply. Government offices often do not follow
the guidelines, and Beijing's 10 major universities at first
applied to be exempted on the grounds that they had many overseas
guests and scholars and were worried about maintaining their image.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blind people, with their special educational needs such as
Braille, still usually attend separate schools here. The training
programs in massage and piano tuning are opening up new
opportunities, if stereotyped ones.
</P>
<P>
   At the Beijing Massage Hospital, an advanced center for
traditional medical massage that offers treatment for a wide range
of orthopedic ailments and pains as well as some internal diseases,
31 of the 46 massage professors are blind.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Zhou Jianzhong, who is 40 and attended the Beijing
School for the Blind, said many of his old classmates who had
entered welfare factories had been laid off and were now trying to
learn massage along with the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is well suited to blind people,'' he said of
massage. ``It's safe, you don't have to be highly mobile, and they
tend to have a good sense of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese trust blind people in this job,'' he said. But
finding good massage jobs is getting difficult, too, he added.

BASEBALL PREVIEW: EARLY INJURIES TAKE TOLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC baseball coach Mike Gillespie likes what he sees in his
team. The pitching is deep and just about all the positions have
been wonas the Trojans prepare to open defense of their 12th
national championship on Feb. 2 against CS Dominguez Hills.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem. It's a big problem and it's the same
one that plagues several of the other local teams: One injury has
caused a major lineup reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
   In USC's case, it's shortstop Seth Davidson, out until at least
mid-February with a broken jaw he suffered when a thrown ball hit
him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the domino effect: Justin Gemoll, who would have started
at third base, moves to shortstop. Freshman Beau Craig _ who would
be the backup catcher _ moves into the starting lineup at third
base, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gillespie would be shuffling the lineup even without
Davidson's injury. He has numerous options at designated hitter,
including Craig, Dominic Correa, Gemoll, Justin Lehr and Brian
Barre. Correa is the starting second baseman, Lehr is a starting
pitcher and Barre, a freshman, has won the starting left-field spot
for now.
</P>
<P>
   This reshuffling obviously hasn't been noticed by the pollsters.
USC is ranked first in three preseason polls and third in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls are healthy in creating interest,'' Gillespie said. ``We
have a team that by the end of the year is a team that can compete
with everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason: junior catcher Eric Munson, a Baseball America
unanimous preseason All-American and Collegiate Baseball's
preseason Player of the Year. Last year, Munson started 47 games
and batted .392 with 16 homers, 56 RBI, 15 doubles and a .760
slugging percentage, best among regular players.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the other area teams:
</P>
<P>
   __ Pepperdine: One injury has also caused Waves coach Frank
Sanchezto reshuffle his lineup. Senior third baseman G.J. Raymundo,
the team's No. 3 hitter last year with a .345 average and 13 home
runs, broke a bone in his forearm when he was hit by a pitch in a
scrimmage earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez sees three options while Raymundo heals (no word on when
he's expected back).
</P>
<P>
   The coach, in his third season, could move sophomore catcher
Dane Sardinha (.263, 13 HRs) to third base and let senior Mike
Kramer (.309, 5 doubles, 14 RBI) catch.
</P>
<P>
   Or he could move freshman shortstop Tony Garcia to third base,
or he could put Garcia in center field and move Duke Sardinha to
third base. Sanchez also could move junior second baseman Damon
Katz to third, but he hasn't determined who would go to second.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of experimenting, trial and error, to
figure out the lineup,'' Sanchez said. ``In the early going, it
will be game-by-game.''
</P>
<P>
   The first game is Friday at home against Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   __ Loyola Marymount: The Lions won the West Coast Conference
last year and are picked by the WCC coaches to do it again. Coach
Frank Cruz doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball coaches are not the smartest freaking birds,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz actually escaped the one-injury-causing-a-reshuffle
situation but just barely. Pitcher Mike Schultz, from Cleveland
High, got hit in the leg with a ball, but he suffered just a mild
bruise and won't miss a start. The Lions open Feb. 3 at home
against CS Dominguez Hills.

WORRIED ABOUT IKE? NOT OSCAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is supposed to be the fight in which Oscar De La Hoya
finally faces a fighter worthy of his talent, the fight in which he
begins to prove exactly how great he truly is.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Quartey is that type of fighter _ strong, skilled, a
legitimate threat.
</P>
<P>
   So how does De La Hoya's trainer, Robert Alcazar, see the
long-awaited Feb. 13 matchup?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, it'll be easy,'' said Alcazar, not one to play games with
words. ``It'll be the same as (Rafael) Ruelas,'' he added,
referring to De La Hoya's second-round knockout victim in 1995.
``He stands straight up, he has no defense. He's too easy to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, OK, but what about Quartey's unusual strength?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar's working with a middleweight (in sparring) and it's no
problem. I think the sparring partner is better than Quartey,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm, not much respect for a fighter who some knowledgeable
boxing observers believe could actually take De La Hoya's WBC
welterweight championship because of his strength.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, Alcazar's comments weren't mere bluster. He
really believes what he says. Felix Trinidad would pose a serious
problem for De La Hoya, Alcazar said recently. Quartey? No way.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, De La Hoya is just as confident as Alcazar. He
doesn't believe any fighter in his weight class can beat him and
he's probably right. In terms of natural ability, he's in his own
league. He won't boast, though.
</P>
<P>
   He said repeatedly before the night he faced Ruelas that it was
going to be one of the easiest fights of his career (which it was)
and he came off as arrogant. Since then, one of the sport's most
image-conscious personalities is more careful about what he says.
This is particularly so with this fight, which he wants the public
to see as a legitimate challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He calls this ``the toughest challenge of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he couldn't resist serving up an honest critique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got his weaknesses, of course, just like everyone else,''
he said after some prodding. ``. . . He's a strong puncher. He's
fast, but he doesn't have the best head movement. His defense isn't
very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to put all that together and figure out something for
this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Alcazar made clear, he already has this guy figured out: De
La Hoya, the taller of the two by a good four inches, will move
about the ring to avoid Quartey's power and pepper the easy-to-hit
challenger relentlessly in what should be an easy payday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' De La Hoya said, ``tough fights can turn out to
be easier than if you're fighting a Joe Schmo.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Who's next?: If he beats Quartey, De La Hoya could end up in
the ring in September with the winner of next month's Pernell
Whitaker-Felix Trinidad fight.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya wants Trinidad because he believes that's the fight
the public wants to see. Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, would
just as soon see Whitaker win because of the difficulties he
expects to encounter trying to make the Trinidad fight _ Trinidad
is promoted by Don King.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that if Whitaker wins, the fight will be a lot
easier to make because King won't be involved,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . King is going to want so much money for himself that it
doesn't leave a lot for Trinidad. And I feel that could be a major
impediment.''
</P>
<P>
   To the point the fight might not be made?
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Whitaker?: Arum was the one who said after the first De La
Hoya-Whitaker fight last year that no one wanted to see a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances have a way of changing one's mind. Whitaker is 35,
coming off more drug problems and _ if he can somehow beat Trinidad
_ he'll be seen as a legitimate opponent.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who struggled with Whitaker in the first bout,
wouldn't mind a second shot at one of this generation's top
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   __ Song stylist: De La Hoya has talked about a career in acting
after he's through boxing. He now is considering singing.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter recently belted out a folk ballad on the
Spanish-language talk show ``Christina'' and was surprisingly good.
Arum has received offers from record companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not kidding,'' he said. ``We got calls from every major
recording company in the country. We haven't decided which offer
we're going to take, but he's going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Grant back: The fighter many believe will be the next
dominating heavyweight is back in action.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Grant (28-0, with 20 knockouts) faces lightly regarded
Ahmad Abdin (25-1-3, 11 KOs) in Atlantic City on Saturday on HBO.
Grant hasn't fought since May of last year because of food
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Golota, trying to rebuild his career after he was twice
disqualified for low blows against Riddick Bowe and was stopped in
one round by Lennox Lewis, faces Jimmy Thunder on the card.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tyson needs time: Tommy Brooks, Mike Tyson's trainer,
admitted on a conference call Thursday that in his victory over
Francois Botha, Tyson ``was the Mike Tyson that fought Evander
Holyfield, not the Mike Tyson that I had worked with the last
couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks rated Tyson's performance a C-plus and said, ``Tyson
belongs somewhere in the top 10'' among heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   He believes we'll see improvement in Tyson's subsequent fights.
He's scheduled to fight again April 24. Among possible opponents:
Axel Schulz, Vaughn Bean, Shannon Briggs and Lou Savarese.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to re-instill the confidence in himself and his
ability,'' Brooks said. ``I don't think Tyson realizes how hard he
hits. . . . Once he realizes the power he has and re-establishes
the confidence in putting his punches together, you'll see a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: The Tyson-Botha fight drew roughly 750,000
pay-per-view buys, according to Showtime. Organizers were hoping
for a million-plus.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the novelty of his return no longer a factor, what does
Tyson's next fight do? Arum's guess is 300,000 and that's probably
not far off. . . .
</P>
<P>
   George Foreman, mentioned as another possible opponent, is the
perfect choice. The fight would do huge numbers, the fighters would
make big money (certainly much bigger than a Tyson-Schulz matchup)
and Tyson would have almost no chance of losing.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Undefeated IBF lightweight champ Shane Mosley, who lives in
Pomona and trains in L.A., was named 1998 Fighter of the Year by
Boxing Writers Association of America. One of the top three
pound-for-pound fighters, he successfully defended his title five
times last year. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vargas, the IBF junior middleweight champ from Oxnard,
is expected to fight on the undercard of the Holyfield-Lewis fight
on March 13. Journeyman Howard Clarke of England is a possible
opponent. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Jones faces Jaime ``Torito'' Lerma in a 12-round junior
middleweight bout tonight at the Pond, the first Forum-promoted
card of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the WBO's top contender, expects to face newly crowned
champion Harry Simon if he beats Lerma.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the card, Agapito Sanchez faces Jorge Munoz in a
10-round featherweight matchup.

</P>
<P>
   __ So what justifies the excess media attention to the Super

apparently, nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles last week, the NFC and AFC championship games had
ratings and shares of 24.1/51 and 23.6/48 respectively. The
third-most-watched sporting event here was the Indiana-Purdue

he's going to host TWO really bad talk shows. . . .

less-than-spectacular CBA stint before jumping in to fill the void
left by MJ. ``I'll show people that if Shaq can rap, Master P can
play basketball,'' Miller told the Greensboro News and Record.
</P>

GE CAPITAL TO BUY ASSETS OF FAILED JAPANESE LEASER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In one of the largest acquisitions by a foreign company
so far in Japan, GE Capital Services said on Saturday that it was
buying the leasing business of a company that collapsed with
Long-Term Credit Bank last fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal that will meld Western management with Japanese
business practices, GE Capital, based in Stamford, Conn., will
acquire the multibillion-dollar assets of Japan Leasing Corp., but
essentially no bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition comes as Japanese financial companies are trying
to crawl out of the turmoil that has swept aside ailing companies
and brought about mergers or alliances among many others.
</P>
<P>
   Neither GE Capital, the financial-services arm of General
Electric Co., nor Japan Leasing disclosed the financial terms of
the deal. Japanese news reports said that the purchase price was
between 700 billion and 800 billion yen, or roughly $6 billion to
$7 billion. But GE Capital officials have said that the actual
price range is $4 billion to $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under a broad revamping blueprint, Japan has been deregulating
and liberalizing its financial industry, forcing companies to
compete more rigorously. At the same time, recession has depressed
the stock market, making it difficult for weak companies to survive
on their own. Foreign companies are becoming a key source of
capital and management expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's struggling banks are also about to receive an injection
of public money that could reach $90 billion. In potentially the
largest infusion, Fuji Bank, one of the giant, somewhat wobbly
banks, was reported to be considering a request to the government
for nearly $9 billion, partly to finance the purchase of a 50
percent stake in a big trust bank, Yasuda Trust and Banking Co.
</P>
<P>
   For GE Capital, the Japan Leasing deal will help extend its
reach in Asia, where it has traditionally been rather weak. At the
beginning of the year, it was part of a consortium of investors
that bought a large stake in a big South Korean bank, and the
company apparently sees this as a good time to buy cheap assets and
build a corporate presence in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   GE Capital is expected to take on many of Japan Leasing's
employees, including the top management, and it will also get a
good franchise and a wide customer base.
</P>
<P>
   The money that GE Capital pays to Japan Leasing will go toward
paying off a portion of the $20 billion in debts on the company's
books. Japan Leasing has bad debts from real-estate loans that went
sour when the economic bubble burst in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It also was apparently saddled with a significant amount of
Long-Term Credit Bank's bad debts through a deal in which Long-Term
Credit essentially lent Japan Leasing the money to buy its bad
debts.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of the leasing business, mostly equipment leases
for such things as cars and machinery, broadens the Japanese
business of GE Capital, which has $7 billion in assets in this
country. GE Capital has also bought an insurance business and a
Japanese consumer-finance unit, among other businesses.

FRENCH GEARING UP TO HELP DOUSE FLAMES OF KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French military officers say that if diplomacy and
bombing threats fail, it will take 100,000 European and American
troops to impose peace between ethnic Albanian separatists and
Yugoslav forces in the southern Yugoslav province of Kosovo,
according to officials in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Although France is eager to avoid being dragged into fighting in
Kosovo, it has lined up behind the threat of American-led NATO
bombing to force Yugoslavia to make good on promises to withdraw
military and police units from the province and negotiate with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A French military spokesman said the carrier Foch would sail
Monday from the Mediterranean port of Toulon for the Adriatic Sea
with 14 jet fighter-bombers, four reconnaissance planes and
helicopters to be ready to strike next week against Yugoslav
targets if NATO decides to use force.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Alain Richard has said France would also have
about 40 fighter planes in Italy by the end of the week ready to
fly NATO missions if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
continued to defy international pressure to stop attacks against
Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure and outrage have been mounting since the the killing of
45 ethnic Albanians in the village of Racak in southern Kosovo. The
province is part of Yugoslavia but had political autonomy until a
decade ago, when Milosevic, then president of Serbia, rescinded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will share our part of the responsibility at the heart of
Europe and the Alliance,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   France's apparent willingness to go ahead with bombing without a
new explicit mandate for it from the U.N. Security Council, where
Russia is opposed and could veto air strikes, contrasts with the
French refusal to join Britain and the United States in bombing
Iraq last month.
</P>
<P>
   French officials said President Jacques Chirac had ordered a
complete review of French and allied strategy for trying to keep
violence in Kosovo from breaking into open warfare as it did on
Bosnia, where 30,000 American-led NATO peacekeepers now patrol the
uneasy peace Milosevic and other Balkan leaders forged in late 1995
after an allied bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Whether bombing alone would be enough to make Milosevic agree to
negotiate a restoration of autonomy for Kosovo, as the United
States and its allies want, is doubtful in the view of French
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine has also been sharply critical
of the Kosovo Liberation Army, whose troops are fighting not for
autonomy but full independence, a goal no Western country supports.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine told the upper house of the French Parliament last week
that both the Serbs and the Albanians had to change their positions
and that the outside world would have to exercise political and
military political pressure to get them to do it.
</P>
<P>
   No Western country wants to be drawn into fighting on the
ground, French officials said, and some NATO estimates of the size
of the outside force that it would take to stop it are double the
French military calculation that 100,000 would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac has been busy consulting with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and talked with British Prime Minister Tony Blair by
telephone, French officials said. The strong feeling in Paris is
that if troops do have to go in to Kosovo, American soldiers will
have to be involved, they said.
</P>
<P>
   France commands a NATO force of 1,800 European soldiers in
Macedonia that would have the mission of pulling hundreds of
unarmed foreign monitors from Kosovo if they came under threat.

MASSACRE SURVIVOR TELLS OF SERB ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PETROVA, Yugoslavia _ Agim was hiding in a corner in his home in
Racak, frozen in terror, he said, as he heard the Serb soldiers
round up villagers, separate out males 15 and older, and take them
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the police came on foot. Then, on the asphalt, there
were tanks. They surrounded us and they started to shoot,'' said
the bearded middle-aged man.
</P>
<P>
   Women and children were closed off in a courtyard, while the men
were made to lie on the ground. ``I was standing in a corner for
eight hours. I couldn't move. They were beating people with pieces
of wood,'' said Agim, who would not give his full name for fear of
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see what happened. But I heard people screaming,''
he said from a friend's home in Petrova, a nearby haven patrolled
by uniformed ethnic Albanians, members of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the man found that a brother and six of his cousins were
killed in the carnage, which the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe has called a Serb-led massacre of 45,
apparently civilian Albanians. The man said he returned once to his
Racak home to free his farm animals so they could graze, but he is
too frightened to return for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very afraid. They are looking for witnesses,'' he said of
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But the man, like his civilian friends and the KLA fighters,
said he will not leave Kosovo, insisting that Albanians, while
clearly outgunned by the ruling Serbs, will keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are becoming stronger every day,'' said a lanky,
stern-faced local commander of the KLA, guarding his post up a
mountain near Shipolje, a command center less than a mile from the
Serb-controlled town. A teenage boy, balancing a rocket-propelled
grenade launcher on his bony shoulder, walked past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people love us,'' the commander asserted. ``We get more
people every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has gotten bolder, abducting five elderly Serbs on
Friday. The hostages were released Saturday, but the rebels' point
was made. They are willing to go beyond traditional army rules, as
they complain the Serbs have also done.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has a formidable opponent in the small, black-robed
figure of Mother Makarija, who heads the Socolica convent in the
mountains west of Pristina. Bullets fly and the front line changes
dangerously quickly, but the tough-talking Makarija continues to
drive, alone, through KLA territory to another convent to deliver
goods to the sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The nuns at that monastery, Devic, are virtual prisoners of the
Albanian rebels, who have completely surrounded the area around the
Orthodox edifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are terrorists. During the day, they may wear civilian
clothes, but they are terrorists,'' Makarija said. The KLA,
carrying assault weapons, often stop her at the checkpoints, asking
if she has guns. She is not deterred, and has warned her Albanian
village neighbors that they had better not touch her convent or ``a
hair on our heads,'' lest God impose punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, if we lose our lives soon, that is not important
to us. But if that happens, your village will go _ poof!'' Makarija
said defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   The abbess of the Devic convent, Mother Anastasia, said the KLA
had shot in the garden in the summer, and had also killed the
convent's dog. But she said the sisters' commitment to stay was
inexorably tied to their vow to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it is not easy for us,'' said Anastasia. ``But we
have faith in God. And that faith gives us courage.''
</P>
<P>
   From nuns to civilians to soldiers on both sides, the people of
Kosovo are determined to fight it out to the end, refusing to give
up what each side sees as its home. The end is likely to be a long
time coming, Serbs and Albanians said, because politicians have not
had an impact on the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us 48 hours. If we had the permission, we could finish in
48 hours,'' said 20-year-old Nenad Nikolic, who just finished his
mandatory one-year military service in the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   While the KLA is deeply committed, the Serb Army with its air
force and heavy weaponry could easily wipe out its opponent force
if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would only give the
go-ahead, Nikolic said.
</P>
<P>
   He stamped out his cigarette in the 1389 tavern, named for the
year of the famous battle between Serbs and Turks, a fight that
ushered in 500 years of Turkish rule in Serbia, and gazed across
the street to the Gracanica church. Gracanica is held close to
Serbian hearts, since they use it to prove that Serbs have been in
Kosovo since early in the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that,'' Nikolic said, ``I would give up my own head.'' As
he has done before, Milosevic last week brought NATO to the brink
of following through on the threat of an air assault, before making
a concession that eased the possibility. Milosevic backed down
Friday on an order to expel William Walker, head of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Kosovo
verification mission, a settlement that delighted the OSCE.
</P>
<P>
   But realistically, the OSCE cannot do much to keep the situation
under control, ethnic Albanians say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are always welcome here. If they weren't here, the
situation could be a lot worse,'' said another man in Petrova.
``But they have their hands tied,'' he said, since they can only
report on what they see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for NATO,'' a KLA member said wryly, when asked
how long the rebel army could hold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West is soft,'' said a third Petrova resident. ``Clinton
is too soft. He is too busy with his problems with the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians admit victory is unlikely without military action
from the West, something NATO has been reluctant to do.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, others plan to join an estimated 250,000
refugees from Kosovo. A red-haired man who called himself ``Tuki''
said he had to move his family out of their home in Shipolje, where
Serb police came in last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will stay in the home for now,'' Tuki said, carrying a
suitcase down the hill to Mitrovica, where his family would stay
for a while. ``But if something happens, we will all run.''

   Internet users have more than likely discovered that 90 percent
of the information seems to be pretty much the same on all the
large sports sites. So credit CBS SportsLine's publisher with a

<P>
   SportsLine USA has started a points system for users who only
have to do something as simple as clicking onto a story on CBS
SportsLine (http://ww3.sportsline.com/).
</P>
<P>
   After a ``SportsLine Rewards'' member signs up for free, each
page click is worth a point with a max of 50 points a day. The
points are then redeemed for more than 750 prizes (starting at 200
points) for things like private online chats with sports stars,
memorabilia, etc.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a ``SportsLine Rewards Plus'' subscription ($39.95
a year) issues 5,000 points for signing up, double points for page
views and access to all the columns and extra stuff on the site.
</P>
<P>
   SportsLine USA vice president of marketing Lawrence Kruguer
calls it a win-win situation for the site's users and the company
because ``this will allow us to customize our wide array of
products and services to better suit their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a model they think not only others sports sites like
ESPN.com and CNN/SI.com will have to follow, but also news and
entertainment sites where similar content is offered in several
places.
</P>
<P>
   SportsLine has 60,000 subscribers who pay $4.95 per month. Too

 &HT;    Falcons focus a must until game day
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ While there's still time, let me take a moment to issue
a sincere ''I'm sorry'' for what is about to happen. My part in
turning the Falcons Super Bowl experience into a farce is minor _ I
am just a pebble in the avalanche, just another pair of frantic
feet river-dancing all over pro football's championship. But, for
any contribution to the madness, I apologize in advance.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the coping has begun in earnest for the Falcons.
Sunday they left Atlanta as soldiers on a holy quest and arrived in
Miami greeted like foreign dignitaries. This is a huge identity
crisis waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the oddest week of your lives, gentlemen. It will try
your patience and fog your mind. You have just entered a purely
fictional place where MTV personalities school like mackerel and
where the rest of the thousands of ''media'' takes heavy casualties
just trying to find out your favorite dessert. Football has almost
nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening there was time for only a short briefing with Dan
Reeves and a few of his Falcons. And already, just 10 minutes into
an arrival press conference, Danish kicker Morten Andersen had
given one interview in German and informed another questioner that
he was not from Holland.
</P>
<P>
   ''By Thursday, I'll be the Dali Lama from Nepal,'' Andersen
said. At the very least.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler must set his mind on the blueprint
for beating the Denver Broncos. But first, there was pondering this
question asked of him Sunday: ''If your team was a car, what kind
would it be?'' Chandler took a pass on that one.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really going to be the difference in the game, which team
handles the distractions the best,'' defensive end Lester
Archambeau said before the Falcons departure. ''We put ourselves
through some serious tests this year. You look at Coach Reeves'
illness. Guys stayed focused, coaches helped us stay focused.''
We'll see. A heart bypass is one thing. Media Day at the Super Bowl
(Tuesday) is a real test of character.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves and the few Falcons veterans with Super Bowl scars
can try to prepare the rest of the big-game rookies. They can issue
more warnings than the national weather service. Cornelius Bennett
was pointed: ''Some stuff does get to guys. Besides the tickets and
other arrangements, you got people coming in trying to make deals
with guys for endorsements. My thing is _ all that stuff will be
there, and 10 times more, if we win the Super Bowl, so let's go out
and take care of the No. 1 thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing anyone has said this week has been adequate. ''Until
you experience it, you just don't know,'' Reeves said. This is
something the first-time Falcons have to get through themselves,
like the mumps.
</P>
<P>
   No one prepared Oakland's Jim Plunkett for the most insensitive
question ever asked during a media day: ''Jim, is that dead father
and blind mother, or dead mother and blind father?''
</P>
<P>
   No one prepared Washington's Doug Williams for the classic
query, ''Have you always been a black quarterback?''
</P>
<P>
   If we can just make it to Sunday, everything will be all right.

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Friday afternoon, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, was fuming. Moments earlier, Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., had stunned Lott by reversing himself and declaring his
support for dismissing President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face from Byrd, a Senate icon and harsh critic of the
president, gave rise to the real, though unlikely, possibility that
the case could be dropped without a vote on the two articles of
impeachment. And that would have dashed Lott's careful plan to
guide the trial to a graceful end that he could defend as fair to
all.
</P>
<P>
   In a fit of pique, Lott issued a statement early Saturday,
saying he would block debate by the Senate on the dismissal motion.
Democrats howled in protest, and by Saturday night Lott was backing
down, telling reporters, ``We will clarify as we go along.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of the uproar was an unscripted moment at the end of
Saturday's session, when nearly 40 senators huddled around Lott and
the Democratic leader, Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., to negotiate rules
on the fly to limit the Senate's debate on the crucial procedural
motion.
</P>
<P>
   This slice-of-life from the two-week trial begs the question:
Does Lott really have a strategy in mind or is he just winging it,
and winging it badly, bringing the Senate to the brink of the same
partisan abyss that swallowed the House _ only to have providence
bail him out?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of trial and error, but Lott has risen to the
occasion,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Lott insist he has a clear set of principles for
moving the Senate through the painful trial. What obscures that
plan, senators say, is Lott's need to balance the interests of
Senate Democrats, the White House, the House prosecutors and,
perhaps most troublesome, his 54 other Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's picked his way through the minefield very skillfully, and
it seems like there's light at the end of the tunnel,'' said Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who added that the trial could end,
somehow, later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's critics say he has overcome most of his missteps. But his
efforts to accommodate the 13 House Republicans prosecuting Clinton
have dangerously frayed the fragile bipartisanship spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The order on Saturday by a federal judge acting on behalf of the
independent counsel that compelled Monica Lewinsky to meet with the
prosecutors Sunday outraged Democrats, but drew not a peep of
protest from Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lott's done a very good job, but what happened yesterday has
put on a major strain,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``How he
handles this will reflect how history judges him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since December, Lott has reached out to Senate Republicans and
Democrats more than he ever had, to help broker an equitable end to
a trial that was speedy enough to satisfy a scandal-weary nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lott has been talking regularly with Daschle. And he floated a
bipartisan trial balloon to avert a long trial by skipping straight
to a vote on the impeachment articles, only to have it shot down by
his own caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realizes that the stakes are very high for the Senate as an
institution and for his own legacy as a leader,'' said Sen. Susan
Collins, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott is also focused on short-term priorities. He is trying
to balance the demands of many conservative groups for a full
trial, including witnesses, against what is best for the 19 Senate
Republicans up for re-election in 2000, especially the 13 senators
who are from states Clinton carried in 1996.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Conservative senators long wary of Trent Lott, the dealmaker,
say their leader is finally showing some spine. ``Anything short of
a full-blown trial is wimping out, and he's been supportive of
that,'' said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lott's position against dropping the charges altogether
at this stage has hardened since Byrd's surprise announcement. ``It
would be a big mistake if the Senate voted to dismiss,'' Lott told
reporters on Saturday. ``I will argue aggressively, privately and
publicly, with my friends to allow this process to go to its
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that, say Lott's allies, who insist that the
majority leader, a stickler for order and process, is simply hewing
to rules for the early phases of the trial that all 100 senators
approved on Jan. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent keeps saying, `Stay within the framework of the
agreement until we get to the point where we have to decide, and
then we'll decide,''' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Lott's decisions before and after that breakthrough
vote call into question his judgment and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual unanimous accord to proceed almost never happened.
The day before the agreement, Lott announced, then postponed, plans
to push through a Republican proposal for a trial, complete with
witnesses and scores of Democratic objections. Only pleas from
moderates like Snowe killed that idea.
</P>
<P>
   The accord senators signed deferred dealings with witnesses
until the opening arguments were completed. But Lott quietly
appointed three Senate Republicans to secretly coach the House
prosecutors on what criteria to use for determining whether to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats cried foul and refused to join the meetings, and Lott
pulled the plug on the group.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the missteps, one senior Democratic aide said,
``That happens all the time. Lott just says things he can't
necessarily deliver on. Sometimes it's because he wants to float an
idea. Sometimes he'll be on the phone and it will sound good, and
he'll realize h can't sell it in his caucus.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON, _ In a high-stakes battle to continue their
prosecution of President Clinton, House managers interviewed Monica
S. Lewinsky for just under two hours Sunday and said she would be
an impressive witness who would help the Senate ''determine the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time senators stepped up a search for ways to
restore bipartisanship to their chamber and bring the trial to a
swift conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerating chain of events came as the Senate headed into
a decisive week, facing two votes that could either stop the trial
or prolong it. Negotiations were under way to see whether the
Senate could find a way to skip those votes entirely and jump ahead
to a final decision on the two articles of impeachment this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring complaints from Democratic senators, three members of
the House prosecution team _ Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Bill
McCollum of Florida and Ed Bryant of Tennessee _ spent the late
afternoon questioning the young woman described by Rep. Henry J.
Hyde as ``the most important witness in this whole drama.''
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Ms. Lewinsky's said the managers once again
asked about the chain of events surrounding her decision to return
gifts from the president to his secretary, Betty Currie, an act the
Republicans have cited as an element of their obstruction of
justice charge against Clinton. The managers did not ask for
details of her sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly impressed with Miss Lewinsky's intelligence
and poise,'' Hutchinson said as the men emerged from the interview
in the Mayflower Hotel just after 6 p.m. He said she would be a
witness who would help the Senate ``determine the truth.'' McCollum
said, ``We found that she might be a very helpful witness to the
Senate if called.''
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris, one of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, who attended the
session, said, ``She added nothing to the record that is already
sitting before the Senate.'' He urged the House managers not to
call her before the Senate. ``We hope for Monica and her family
that this long nightmare will come to a quick conclusion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In scenes reminiscent of the frenzy ignited a year ago by the
news that the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, was
investigating whether Clinton had conspired to cover up an affair
with Ms. Lewinsky, scores of reporters, photographers and
television cameramen crowded the sidewalk outside the downtown
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky arrived there late Saturday afternoon, compelled by
a federal judge to cooperate with the House impeachment team. Her
surprise return to Washington _ and Hyde's request to the
independent counsel to obtain the court order, convulsed the Senate
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that House Republicans would have to make a persuasive
argument for their witness list, several Senate Republicans
expressed skepticism Sunday on the television talk shows about the
need to hear from the principals in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want the Senate to become a spectacle, a scene,''
said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alal, who said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' that he would support calling only witnesses who ``can add
a lot.'' Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said she had not yet been
convinced that witnesses were needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if we do proceed, we want to make sure that it
doesn't turn out to be `The Jerry Springer Show,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, said he
hoped that the two parties could find a way to skip to the final
arguments and a final vote ``and get to it as promptly as is
consistent with doing the impartial justice we all raised our right
hands and said that we would do.''

SIDEWAYS GLANCE: THIS WEEK IN DODGERS HISTORY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look back as
some important dates this week in Los Angeles sports history:
</P>
<P>
   __ Jan. 28, 1958: Before he ever got a chance to play for the
Los Angeles Dodgers, future Hall of Fame catcher Roy Campanella is
severely injured in a car crash on an icy road in Long Island.
After hitting a telephone pole, he's wedged beneath the car's
dashboard for hours before being rescued. It left him paralyzed
from the waist down at age 36.
</P>
<P>
   __ Jan. 28, 1984: Edmonton's Wayne Gretzky scored a goal or had
an assist in 51 straight games, but the Kings, the team for which
he'd later play, figure a way to stop him. Or, he simply was
unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   __ Jan. 29, 1988: The Dodgers sign free-agent outfielder Kirk
Gibson to a three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   __ Jan. 31, 1919: Jack Roosevelt Robinson is born in Georgia. He
will grow up in Pasadena, Calif..
</P>
<P>
   __ Birthdays: Today: Former Los Angeles Rams receiver and
broadcaster Jack Snow (56). Tuesday: Former Kings star Wayne
Gretzky (38), former Los Angeles Rams linebacker Jack Youngblood
(49) and ``Slapshot'' star Paul Newman (74). Friday: Former Dodgers
second baseman Steve Sax and L.A. Olympics star diver Greg Louganis
(39), original Los Angeles Angels manager Bill Rigney (81).
Saturday: ``Hoosiers'' star Gene Hackman (69) and new Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson (56). Sunday: Former Angels star pitcher
Nolan Ryan (52).

SPORTS COLUMN: ST. JOHN'S AND ITS LITTLE MAN CAN PLAY WITH THE
BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sophisticated big city always loved the judicious
little man, the kind it has not seen much of in the last few years.
Maybe that is why, on the day they shook the cobwebs off big-time
college basketball at Madison Square Garden, Spike Lee took his
customary front-row seat in the jersey of Erick Barkley, No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The building for years had not been sold out and revved up for a
St. John's game, and a trip to New York to play the Red Storm had
become, for a program such as Duke's, a chance to treat the kids to
a ride on the ferry and a Broadway play. ``To compete against a
team like ours, you need pro players,'' Duke's Chris Carrawell said
Sunday after the second-ranked Blue Devils had survived _ no other
way to describe it _ St. John's, in overtime, 92-88. ``They have
two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Ron Artest, hit the tying 3-pointer at the end of
regulation and Bootsy Thornton, No. 2 based on this game, shot the
ball from a zone Rod Serling once wrote from. But the true measure
of St. John's, as its basketball team again became a compelling New
York City event, was in the stoicism and steeliness of its
6-foot-1-inch point guard from Brooklyn, presumably the ``or
three'' in Carrawell's synopsis. In Erick Barkley's game face,
there was little emotion, all expectation. There were no
concessions to reputation, to deficits, to Elton Brand's defensive
dominance of the paint or to a St. John's lineup decimated by
fouls.
</P>
<P>
   There was in Barkley's confident southpaw dribble, by the
standards of the old championship Knicks, the soul of the city
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a freshman _ on the basketball court,'' Barkley said
later, when the subject of his 11 assists in 43 minutes against
William Avery and the rest of Duke's army of athletes was raised.
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Mike Jarvis, explained that this was not cockiness,
just a student following his teacher's instructions. ``I told the
guys after Jan. 1, we have no freshmen,'' Jarvis said. ``So as a
first-year, second-semester student, I thought Erick did what a
great point does.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrawell, a junior, said he had never seen anyone shoot holes
in a Duke defense the way Thornton did. A left-handed junior
transfer out of Tallahassee Community College, Thornton dropped 40
on the Blue Devils, taking his two-guard position to levels Felipe
Lopez never once reached. Lopez couldn't shoot the jumper like
Thornton, and he never had a point guard who could deliver the ball
like Barkley. The position was as much a headache at St. John's as
it remains with the Knicks, who have spent $50 million on Chris
Childs and Charlie Ward and still can't convince people they are
secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates were setting screens on the baseline and I was
open on most of the shots,'' Thornton said. There was more to it
than that, he knew; there was the game-long floor dance with
Barkley, the eye contact, the payoff for the practice hours they
have spent. ``Erick knows where I like the ball,'' Thornton said.
``And he always sees, not only where I am but where the guy
guarding me is. If he's too close, he won't pick up his dribble.''
</P>
<P>
   He will wait for something better, a coach's restraint
programmed into his head and left hand. Thornton is a player and
Artest is a future first-round draft pick, but St. John's will
remain a top-10 team, especially if Jarvis can soon get the injured
Tyrone Grant back, because it no longer handles the ball like a wet
bar of soap.
</P>
<P>
   Duke, the team of scholarly studs, turned the ball over 23
times, St. John's 15. Barkley, with the ball on most possessions,
with his options pretty much limited to Thornton and Artest, gave
it away three times. He outplayed and outlasted Avery, who fouled
out. When St. John's was behind, as it was most of the game,
Barkley played with purpose and patience. That's what Jarvis liked,
how his team, trailing by 39-29 late in the first half, wound up
down a deuce at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he said, the elite teams spurt into the locker room,
and on home from there. ``Most games, that would have been a
20-point lead at halftime,'' Jarvis said. ``At a time when Duke
usually controls the game, we controlled the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In that context, he meant to say that his second-semester player
had not backed down. ``He makes the right pass every time,'' said
Duke's assistant, Johnny Dawkins, the former all-American and pro
who had his own nifty left-handed dribble and a pogo-stick pull-up
jumper to match. ``One word on Barkley _ terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley does not have a complete, pro-ready game, but he is a
pure point, like John Stockton, his television tutor. Barkley did
commit a costly charging foul in overtime, and missed, with Artest
out and Thornton covered, the Red Storm's last shot, a 3-pointer,
at 91-88. Without Avery and Brand in overtime, Duke made the plays,
hit its free throws, did what Duke usually does. But St. John's was
right there, proving it can play with anyone, in a sold-out Garden,
on national television, led by a kid who doesn't say much but knows
how to play the smart game, the game New York loves. &QL;

 &HT;    Time to get down to business
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Given that it took 33 years to get to the Super Bowl,
maybe it should come as no surprise that many of the Atlanta
Falcons were still sky-high after their plane touched down in Miami
on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the delirium didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Falcons coach Dan Reeves spoke of how excited
players and coaches were to see thousands of fans send them off
from Atlanta, the mood turned, and Reeves apologized no fewer than
four times for comments made last week.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who was fired in Denver in 1992, declined to go into
detail about firing assistant Mike Shanahan in 1991 and his
strained relationship with quarterback John Elway. He said enough
has been said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of wounds ... I caused some of them in my
experience in Denver,'' said Reeves, whose Falcons play Denver on
Sunday in Super Bowl XXXIII. ``The only thing I know that cures
wounds is time. I apologize for opening those wounds last week,
because I don't think anything is accomplished by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was doing was answering questions. Sometimes, trying to
cooperate is not the best thing to do. I apologize for it even
coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who coached the Broncos to three Super Bowl losses in
the 1980s, was not asked about his team being a seven-point
underdog. But he defended his decision to allow players' families
to stay with them in the team hotel and discussed his and his
team's health.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said he was shocked at the amazing show of support the
team received in Atlanta, where thousands lined the route taken by
team buses from Suwanee to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people all over the bypasses and along the side of the
road,'' he said. ``We had a great sendoff from Atlanta and now we
want to get ready to play hopefully as well as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler told of how backup quarterback Steve
DeBerg climbed out of the emergency hatch onto the roof of a bus as
they rolled through Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going real slow, and he got up there and was
videotaping everything,'' Chandler said. ``He's 45 going on 12. It
was fun. This is all fun, an unique experience.

 &HT;    Gretzky holding MVP award close
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ He lost count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this makes 16 cars I've won for something,'' Wayne
Gretzky said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or maybe it's 17.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky loses track of cars the way the hockey world loses track
of his records. But let it be said that the latest addition to his
fleet of honors holds a special place for Gretzky. It must because
he's keeping it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never kept one before but I'm keeping this one,'' Gretzky
said after scoring a goal and two assists, winning the Most
Valuable Player award and leading the NHL's North American
All-Stars to an 8-6 victory over the World team at the Ice Palace.
``This one is like a momento to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've ever won I put into my dad's basement (in
Brantford, Ontario) or my restaurant in Toronto. But after 21 years
of pro hockey, this is one thing I want to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gretzky sounded as if he had one foot into retirement just
two days short of his 38th birthday, he wasn't saying. Yes, he had
thoughts during Sunday's game that this might be his final All-Star
appearance, but he reiterated that he had the same thoughts last
season in Vancouver. ``I'm just going to play the rest of the year
and see what happens in June,'' said the New York Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky dazzled the crowd early and late. A perfect cross-ice
feed set up linemate Mark Recchi in the first period, when the
North Americans opened a 4-1 lead. One minute into the second, he
skated down the right side into the faceoff circle and blistered a
shot on the short side past goalie Arturs Irbe. Later in the
period, he led a three-on-two break, drew the defense toward him
and slipped the puck back to the blueline to Rob Blake, who drove
home another goal.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky didn't have a point in the third period, but he may have
been at his best, buzzing around the net, feeding teammates and
twice being stopped from short range by Washington goalie Nikolai
Khabibulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bench was electric that last shift of his,'' said Dallas
and North American coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Hitchcock clutched a hockey stick that Gretzky gave
him as a souvenir. He also spoke of some memorabilia that Gretzky
gave his two children. ``He met them for the first time (Saturday),
and (Sunday) he remembered both of their names,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Wayne leaves this game, there's going to be a big hole.
It's one thing to be a good athlete. It's another thing to be a
part of the fabric of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to compare his 18th NHL All-Star game with his first,
Gretzky said, ``Now when I look over at No. 9, I see Paul Kariya.
Before when I saw No. 9, I saw Gordie Howe. I've gone from a young
guy looking up to old guys to an old guy looking up to young
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   What gives him a greater thrill?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say today,'' he said.

NEW PROGRAM WILL CLOSE GAPS IN IMMIGRANTS' BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.)  
(lb) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Clinton administration is proposing a $1.3
billion, five-year program to close remaining gaps in medical and
food-stamp benefits for legal immigrants that have existed since
the overhaul of the United States' welfare system three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal builds on recent efforts to restore a safety net to
hundreds of thousands of people who lost coverage when Clinton
agreed to eliminate the benefits in 1996, at a saving of $20
billion, as a compromise with the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But that decision set off an immediate storm of protest,
especially from states with large immigrant populations, like New
York, New Jersey and California, where Hispanic residents and
Asians are voting in ever-increasing numbers. As a result, over the
next two years, in 1997 and 1998, the administration and Congress
began restoring some of the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the latest restorations, which will be included in
the budget Clinton will send to Congress on Feb. 1, are scheduled
to be made public on Monday by Vice President Al Gore when he
speaks at a senior center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican Senate aide who works closely on immigrant benefit
issues predicted that Congress would likely approve it. ``I have a
hard time predicting exactly what will happen,'' the aide said,
``but there is a good chance to get them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, Clinton's chief domestic-policy adviser, said the
president has now ``kept both promises he made when he signed the
welfare law, to reform the nation's welfare system and to restore
benefits that never should have been cut in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   While the restored benefits are rather modest in scope,
projected to cover at least 132,000 people over the next five
years, they nonetheless reflect a growing political sensitivity
toward Hispanic citizens, Asians and other ethnic groups that are
playing an increasing role in the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic Americans are the nation's fastest-growing minority
group, and in California, where the Hispanic population has reached
almost 31 percent, demographers predict that within five years the
state will have no majority race.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Munoz, a chief policy adviser for the National Council
of La Raza, a nonprofit civil-rights organization, praised the
corrective measures, saying she already knew of one legal immigrant
whose death she attributed to the loss of Medicaid benefits because
of the welfare overhaul. Last July, a 46-year-old Sudanese man
living in New York, Ahmad Muhammad, died after not being able to
afford the $400,000 he needed for a lung transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a common-sense proposal that has the added benefit of
being very politically wise,'' Ms. Munoz said. ``It's very
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton signed the welfare legislation, he expressed regret
over benefit cuts and vowed to fight to restore them. But that
promise did little to quell outrage from the liberal wing of the
Democratic Party, which felt the president had gone too far to
accommodate the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much anger when the president signed the bill,
because it was paid for on the backs of legal immigrants,'' said
Maria Echaveste, a White House deputy chief of staff. ``There was
real serious anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Bernstein, an official with the National Immigration Law
Center, a nonprofit firm that represents low-income people and
immigrants, said many Hispanic and Asian Americans faulted Congress
more than Clinton for eliminating the benefits and began turning
out in larger numbers for Democrats in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said the cuts, combined with initiatives like
California's Proposition 187, which denied social services to
undocumented aliens and was supported by the former governor, Pete
Wilson, a Republican, left people in many ethnic groups believing
that Republicans were ``anti-immigrant.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the latest effort to restore benefits picks up where
previous changes left off.
</P>
<P>
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 brought back Supplemental
Security Income for the disabled and Medicaid benefits to 420,000
legal immigrants who were in the country before the welfare
legislation was enacted, on Aug. 22, 1996. The proposed legislation
would restore those benefits to legal immigrants who entered the
country after the law was enacted, if they have been in the country
for five years and become disabled after entering.
</P>
<P>
   The Agricultural Research Act of 1998 provided food stamps for
225,000 legal immigrant children, senior citizens and people with
disabilities who came to the United States before the new welfare
law. The new budget would extend those benefits by allowing those
who were legal immigrants in the United States on Aug. 22, 1996, to
be eligible for food stamps when they reach age 65.
</P>
<P>
   A third element would give states the option to provide health
coverage to legal immigrant children who entered the country after
Aug. 22, 1996. Currently, states can only provide benefits to
children who were here before that date.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the administration is proposing to give states the option
to provide Medicaid coverage for prenatal care to legal immigrant
women who entered the country after Aug. 22, 1996. Administration
officials contend that such coverage would help reduce the number
of high-risk pregnancies and would lower costs of emergency births
paid for by Medicaid.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patients across the country are facing steep increases in
out-of-pocket charges for prescription drugs, reversing a recent
trend toward more liberal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Standard co-payments are often doubling for drugs that patients
have been using for years. But even bigger increases _ of 300
percent or more _ are appearing for some remedies that are not on
insurers' lists of approved drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs may be omitted, or dropped, from such lists because they
are deemed nonessential, like those for male impotence, baldness or
wrinkles, or to help people quit smoking. But in many cases,
insurers are refusing to endorse more costly new versions of
life-sustaining drugs when cheaper alternatives are available.
</P>
<P>
   This double-barreled increase means that if patients insist on a
certain drug, they might see the cost skyrocket from, say, $10 to
$50.
</P>
<P>
   But will patients always do better with the latest, most costly
drug, or is a flood of advertising making them think they will?
Conversely, is a generic version of a drug, or a cheaper name
brand, equally as good just because federal regulators and health
plans say it is? Those questions are open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers insist that their new drugs are better and have
fewer harmful side effects. By pushing cheaper, older drugs, they
say, health plans ultimately drive up costs for hospital stays,
nursing homes and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Employers and managed-care executives counter that they must
slow the explosive spending for prescription drugs, which rose 15
to 20 percent in each of the last two years as an array of costly
new drugs hit the market. Demand for those drugs, they say, was fed
by thousands of promotional visits to doctors, and $1.3 billion in
consumer advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Asking Congress to address the problem, President Clinton said
in his State of the Union speech last week that ``affordable
prescription drugs'' should be included in a restructured Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the debate's ambiguities can be seen in the case of
Jacqueline Lawrence, 70, of San Carlos, Calif. She used to pay a
total of $16 a month for two drugs, for high blood pressure and
bronchitis. But when she was forced recently to switch her Medicare
health plan to Aetna U.S. Healthcare, she found neither drug on the
list. She tried the alternatives, but ``all kinds of side effects''
forced her back to her original drugs. As a result, her monthly
costs tripled to $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a third drug that I take goes up to that extent, I don't
know how I will manage,'' Ms. Lawrence said. Her 88-year-old
mother, Lucille Warren, has faced similar problems. ``My mother
worries about it,'' she said, ``and that makes her feel worse.''
</P>
<P>
   While the choice used to be between generics and name brands,
there is now a three-tiered system for many drug plans. This month,
many of the biggest plans started charging $50 or more for drugs
not on their lists. In a letter to members in small businesses,
Oxford Health Plans explained the new system, using blood pressure
drugs as an example.
</P>
<P>
   An Oxford member typically used to pay $5 at the store for
captopril, a generic version of Capoten, an old drug made by
Bristol-Myers Squibb, or $10 for most brand-name drugs. Now, the
typical Oxford member's payment for generic Capoten would be $7.
For Accupril, made by Warner-Lambert, or Monopril, also made by
Bristol-Myers _ both on the preferred list _ she would pay $15 or
$20 or the retail price, whichever was less.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford members who work for large employers now typically pay
$20 for all brands, although some big companies still subsidize $10
payments.
</P>
<P>
   But in small businesses in New York, if the patient went off the
list _ for drugs like Merck's Vasotec, or the original Capoten _
she would pay $50 or the retail price. That would be $50 for
Capoten (retail price $94.95 for a month's supply) and $34.99 for
Vasotec, the retail price at the Seventh Avenue Pharmacy in Park
Slope, Brooklyn. (The pharmacy receives only a flat $1.75 fee,
regardless of the brand, said Bert Drachtman, the owner.)
</P>
<P>
   Even small increases hurt. ``To go to $20 from $10 is a big
jump,'' said Max Daniels, community events director of Hospital
Audiences, a small nonprofit agency in New York that is covered by
Oxford. ``My doctor can't prescribe generics for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct advertising by drug companies is feeding consumer
demand,'' said David Hom, executive director of corporate benefits
at Pitney Bowes, which covers 26,000 employees in the United
States. ``We could see people shifting from Mevacor to Lipitor,'' a
heavily promoted new cholesterol-lowering drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nicholas Hanchak, head of pharmacy management for Aetna U.S.
Healthcare, said the drug companies were using advertising and
thousands of visits to doctors to promote ``higher-cost items.''
The newer drugs are often essentially the same as older, cheaper
ones, he said, as determined by federal regulators and the
company's own physician and pharmacist review board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newer is not necessarily better, it's just better marketed,''
said Patricia Wilson, a consultant on managed drug-plans based in
Rosemont, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for drug makers, which are far more profitable than
other health care industries, say consumers get valuable
information from the ads, which they can take to doctors. But
managed-care executives say patients often demand advertised drugs
that are not appropriate or no more effective than cheaper
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   One factor influencing the lists is that HMOs often make deals
with drug makers, negotiating lower prices in return for pushing a
particular drug.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pochtar, a managed-care marketing director at Novartis
Pharmaceuticals Corp., added that charging employees more ``will
give them a greater appreciation for the drug benefit.'' He said,
``Most people with coverage take the drug benefit for granted.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Newcomer, medical director of Unitedhealth Group, one of
the biggest managed-care companies, said United added expensive new
drugs to its preferred list if they produced unique benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs accounted for 12 percent of Pitney Bowes' health costs
last year, a big jump from 7.5 percent six years ago. The company
has just introduced a new payment schedule: Employees now pay 30
percent of the retail cost of brands not on the preferred list, 20
percent for brands on the list, and 10 percent for lower-priced
generics. But there is no charge for drugs at Pitney Bowes' clinics
in Connecticut, where the company has 6,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the higher costs for patients, industry analysts see
little hope of slowing the increases in 1999. ``It's still going to
be double-digit,'' said Mary Sevon, a pharmacy benefit consultant
based in Fairless Hills, Pa. ``We saw 18 percent increases last
year and we are predicting the same level for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   She said some health plans are refusing to help pay for any
drugs except those on their list in ``categories that cost the most
_ cardiovascular, nonsteroidal pain-killers for arthritis, and
antidepressants'' like Prozac. Patients will have to pay the full
cost, which can be $60 a month or more, for these types of drugs if
they are not on the preferred list.
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations on the West Coast often offer a
list called a closed formulary, said Virginia White, vice president
of Integrated Pharmaceutical Services, a division of Foundation
Health Systems. The HMO typically does not pay for drugs that are
not on the list, unless a doctor can persuade the health plan to
make an exception when the preferred medication has not worked.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, for example, recently switched its California
members from Coumadin, a DuPont blood-thinner that protects against
stroke, to warfarin sodium, a generic the Food and Drug
Administration said was biologically equivalent. Dr. David Campen,
a Kaiser pharmaceutical executive, said the change had saved Kaiser
several million dollars in California, where it spends $1 billion a
year on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the FDA ruling, DuPont persuaded regulators in several
states that the generic would cause problems for patients now
taking Coumadin, preventing HMOs from making the switch in North
Carolina, Virginia and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Win some, lose some. Regulators in California and New York
overruled Kaiser when it tried to exclude payments for Viagra,
Pfizer's popular impotence treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Palomba, manager of health care planning and
administration at Timken Co., based in Canton, Ohio, said that
``some HMOs in some locations are being much more aggressive in
introducing closed formularies.'' But Timken still offers most
employees an ``open formulary,'' from which they can get any drug
for a moderate payment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Palomba said Timken's drug costs have been growing 20
percent annually. The company tries to minimize the spending by
reviewing the kinds and amounts of drugs its employees take and
sometimes recommending changes to an employee's doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Some California HMOs are squeezing the closed lists even
further, said Debi Reissman, president of Rxperts, a managed-care
consulting firm in Irvine, Calif. ``Instead of offering three to
six products in every therapeutic class, for example,
antidepressants or blood pressure drugs, they are moving down to
two or three products,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain plans may pay for the generic only and offer zero
coverage for brand-name drugs,'' said Neeraj Kanwal, executive
medical director of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, based in
Indianapolis. He said other plans pay only the relatively low cost
of the generic, say $7, while the patient pays $53 for a $60 brand.
</P>
<P>
   But he said there was ``a backlash against closed formularies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not a popular item for customers,'' Kanwal added.

AN ESTIMATED 1 MILLION TURN OUT TO HEAR POPE CELEBRATE MASS
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pope John Paul II has always been a draw, but the
sheer size of the crowd that turned out to hear him celebrate Mass
here on Sunday resulted in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's magnificent to see the pope,'' said Maria de Jesus
Ibanez, a Mexico City nanny who accompanied two of her charges to
the Mass site before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this organization is the worst,'' she said. ``We fought
with (security) outside. We fought with them in here. This is
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million people jammed into the Hermanos Rodriguez
racetrack to see the pope. About 800,000 had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   People started pouring into the racetrack late Friday night. By
Saturday night, several hundred thousand were bedded down with
sleeping bags and blankets as temperatures approached freezing.
</P>
<P>
   As dawn broke Sunday, people surged to the site from every
direction. Hundreds of buses clogged the streets surrounding the
track, their exhaust producing a choking layer of smog in the dim
light.
</P>
<P>
   Because few garbage cans could be found, food wrappers, fruit
peels, cans and other trash littered the streets outside the
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of feet shuffling across the bare dirt kicked up thick
clouds of dust that clung to clothing, stuffed nostrils and
scratched throats and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   What appeared to be spotty coordination between church
officials, government security officers and young volunteers who
were supposed to control and direct the crowd seemed to add to the
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   With government security agents letting only a few people pass
through the racetrack's gates at a time, many of the faithful were
stuck in long lines for hours. Many ticket holders were turned
away. Some who were lucky enough to get through the gates were
shunted from spot to spot inside, when ushers changed their minds
about where to put them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a very undisciplined people,'' said Albino Hernandez,
62, a Roman Catholic priest from a parish in southern Tabasco
state. ``We lack the culture for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of a shortage of toilets inside the racetrack, security
agents directed people toward a wooded area near the altar to
relieve themselves.
</P>
<P>
   People were packed shoulder to shoulder inside the giant
facility. When people began pushing one another, whole sections of
the crowd swayed.
</P>
<P>
   Those refused entry to the track pressed against the fences
surrounding it, listening carefully as the pope spoke and the long
Mass progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect to see the pope anyhow,'' said Gabriela
Nieto, 16, a ticket holder who was turned away at the gate with
friends after arriving late Saturday night from the state of
Queretaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at least we can hear him. It's not ideal, but it's OK.''

IOC EXPELS 6 MEMBERS TIED TO SALT LAKE CITY PAYMENTS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Taking unprecedented disciplinary action
and acknowledging widespread wrongdoing, the president of the
International Olympic Committee on Sunday expelled six members for
receiving improper benefits in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A seventh member resigned, one was given a warning and three
remained under investigation in the biggest corruption scandal in
Olympic history, one that involved the reception of cash payments,
tuition aid, medical treatment and lavish gifts totaling an
estimated $800,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the six expelled members, and a fifth who resigned, were
from Africa, but senior IOC officials stressed that the misbehavior
was not geographical, racial or cultural in nature. Europeans,
South Americans and an Asian member have also been linked to this
far-reaching scandal. One of the expelled members received cash and
benefits totaling $216,000 for himself and family members. Another
member under investigation is a member of the IOC's executive board
and is a candidate for president of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the expulsions, the IOC's executive board made
sweeping recommendations to overhaul the extravagant and tainted
system of bidding on the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The board proposed to take away the general membership's most
important duty, voting on which cities receive the Winter and
Summer Games, giving the job to a smaller electoral college
composed of eight IOC members, three athletes and four other sports
officials. The board also proposed an experimental halt on allowing
IOC members to visit bid cities, where they are wined and dined and
treated to lavish benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's actions amounted to an admission that, after finding
that 13 current members, and a 14th who is dead, were involved in
the Salt Lake City scandal, a full 10 percent of the IOC membership
acted inappropriately and that the IOC cannot trust that its
current 106 members will behave properly in choosing which cities
which host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``These members have done great harm to the Olympic ideal,''
Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC, said of the dismissed
members. ``Now their greatest service to the Olympic movement is to
accept their fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing beleaguered but defiant, the 78-year-old Samaranch
apologized for unethical behavior by IOC members but he deflected
personal blame for the scandal and said he had never considered
resigning.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch said he planned to seek a vote of confidence from IOC
members in March to finish the final two years of his term. He is
expected to receive approval overwhelmingly, given that he
appointed 80 percent of the current members. He also distanced
himself from the scandal, saying that more than half of the 14
members involved had joined the IOC before he became president in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   He also reiterated that the 2002 Winter Games would remain in
Salt Lake City, and that the 2000 Summer Games would stay in
Sydney, Australia, which is also immersed in a bidding scandal.
Samaranch did say, however, that the IOC's investigation of the
soiled bidding process would be expanded to include all cities that
sought Winter and Summer Games from 1996 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the decisions we made today will demonstrate our
resolve to never let this happen again,'' Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch and other senior IOC officials said that they believed
those linked to the Salt Lake City scandal made moral but not
criminal mistakes. But they also emphatically stated that Sunday's
disciplinary moves were only a first step in trying to restore
luster to the tarnished Olympic rings and in trying to reassure
nervous corporate sponsors that its besmirched system will be
reformed and outfitted with adequate safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   A quasi-independent ethics commission will be formed to monitor
the business practices of the IOC, Samaranch announced, but the
dishonored organization remains in a precarious and unresolved
position as four investigations continue into the Salt Lake City
scandal, including one by the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   And in expanding its investigation to other bid cities, the IOC
is almost certain to be embarrassed by more revelations of untoward
behavior. Sydney, for instance, has admitted offering payments of
$35,000 apiece to two IOC members from Africa the night before its
secured a two-vote victory over Beijing to host the 2000 Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the scandal could continue to mushroom if the expelled
members do not go quietly, but instead begin leveling accusations
of their own, which could further erode public and corporate
confidence in the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a jab and less than a knockout punch, a heavy
body blow from which we're going to have to fight back,'' said
Richard Pound, an attorney from Montreal and IOC vice president who
headed the investigation of Salt Lake City. ``We're going to have
to demonstrate our good faith and not try to pretend that Salt Lake
was a hermetically sealed incident.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The six members expelled by Samaranch under a special provision
of Swiss law were Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Jean-Claude Ganga of
Congo Republic, Gen. Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of the Sudan,
Lamine Keita of Mali, Charles Mukora of Kenya and Sergio Santander
Fantini of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   David Sibandze of Swaziland resigned, and Kim Un Yong of South
Korea, Vitaly Smirnov of Russia and Louis Guirandou N'Diaye of the
Ivory Coast remain under investigation. Anton Geesink of the
Netherlands received a warning because an Olympic foundation that
bears his name accepted a $5,000 check from the Salt Lake City
Olympic organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two other IOC members, Bashir Attarabulsi of Libya and Pirjo
Haggman of Finland, previously resigned for their actions
concerning the Salt Lake City scandal. Rene Essomba of Cameroon,
whose daughter Sonia, received about $100,000 in tuition assistance
from Salt Lake Olympic officials, died last year.
</P>
<P>
   The expulsions must be ratified by the full IOC assembly at a
meeting on March 17 and 18. But the six ousted members will need a
two-thirds majority, or 64 votes, to gain reinstatement, Pound
said. Samaranch pointedly urged them not to fight Sunday's
dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tender your resignations,'' Samaranch said. ``Do not wait to
be expelled by the session. Put an end to this ugly chapter in the
history of the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The six who were dismissed by Samaranch were accused of
accepting cash and benefits totaling $440,710. Pound said that all
six had solicited these favors from Salt Lake City officials. He
took care not to blame Salt Lake City officials, saying that the
IOC had not acted quickly enough to stop the temptations for
inappropriate behavior that exist now that the Olympics have become
a billion-dollar business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far better to clear up our side of the situation and not
to go around pointing fingers at anyone else,'' Pound said.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, 64, who is also the minister of sport, tourism and
leisure in Congo Republic and one of the organizers of the African
boycott of the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal, received direct
payments of $70,010, which were deposited into his personal account
in a Salt Lake City bank, according to Pound's report. Ganga and
family members also received $17,000 in medical care and $115,000
in travel expenses, while Ganga also received $14,000 in exorbitant
gifts and entertainment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, a relative of Arroyo's _ she has been
identified as a stepdaughter _ received living expenses totaling
$19,000; Gadir and family members received $25,000 in payments;
Keita; one of Keita's sons received $97,000 in tuition and living
expenses and air fare to attend Howard University; Mukora received
cash payments totaling $34,650; and Santander received direct
payments of $20,050.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our opinion, none of the situations regarding the
individuals proposed for expulsion was the result of accidental or
inadvertent conduct,'' Pound said. ``In each case, it was conscious
and knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound also said that the dismissed members were being accused of
violating their Olympic oaths, not of bribery and corruption and
that no accusations were being made of criminal conduct. He said
that six of the members had pleaded their cases in person this
weekend and that some seemed genuinely shocked with presented with
the totality of the money and benefits they had received from Salt
Lake City Olympic officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put us in an impossible position, whether you meant to or
not,'' Pound said they were told.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ganga has said that he will not resign, and Santander
has said that he will take his case to the International Court of
Arbitration for Sport, which settles international sporting
disputes and has in the past acted independently of the IOC.
Santander said that he had no knowledge of one payment of $15,225
made by Salt Lake City officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga told IOC investigators that he distributed the cash
payments from Salt Lake City officials to Olympic committees in the
Central African Republic, Congo and Niger, and that he offered to
pay for medical treatment in Salt Lake City. In an interview with
CNN, he also claimed that his expulsion was politically motivated
by those who did not want him to challenge them for president of
the IOC when Samaranch retires.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who is being investigated for recommending that a Russian
teenager be admitted to an American school at the request of
Smirnov, also complained that politics was at play here in an
attempt to ruin his chances for succeeding Samaranch. He is a
member of the IOC's executive board.
</P>
<P>
   Pound, Francois Carrard of Switzerland and Jacques Rogge of
Belgium, all part of the IOC investigative panel for Salt Lake
City, are considered possible replacements of Samaranch. But Pound
said ``absolutely not'' when asked whether there were any political
motivations for the disciplinary actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unrelated,'' Pound said. ``None of us wanted to be on
a commission like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Because seven of the 14 IOC members linked to the Salt Lake City
scandal were from Africa, the IOC has been subjected to questions
about whether it was attempting to destabilize the power of African
sport. Senior IOC officials denied this, including Keba Mbaye of
Senegal, who was a member of Pound's investigative commission and
who is vice president of the International Court of Justice, as
well as the honorary chief justice of the Supreme Court of the West
African nation of Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are most in need are most open to offers, offers
which sometimes verge on the provocative,'' Mbaye said. But, he
added, Pound's commission ``acted in a strictly objective way. We
in no way tried to decapitate African sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by the IOC's executive board to prohibit travel by
IOC members to bid cities must be ratified by a majority of members
in March. The members must also vote by a majority to eliminate
their ability to vote as a whole on choosing Olympic host cities.
Senior IOC officials said they believed the majority would agree to
a reduced role in the bid process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC will rally together if the institution is under
attack,'' Pound said. ``If not under attack, it is certainly under
question.''

STARR RETURNS TO CENTER STAGE OF CLINTON-LEWINSKY SCANDAL

(mk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Monica Lewinsky signed her immunity agreement
last July with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, she never
imagined that Starr would use the fine print of the deal to force
her to cooperate with House prosecutors seeking the removal of
President Clinton from office, several friends and associates of
Ms. Lewinsky said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But last summer, Starr and his prosecutors knew that Congress
might need her. At the time they negotiated the agreement with Ms.
Lewinsky, Starr had already received permission from a federal
three-judge panel here to send an impeachment referral to the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Office of the Independent Counsel did not share
that information with Ms. Lewinsky _ nor with the public _ at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Starr included language in Ms. Lewinsky's immunity agreement
that required her to answer questions truthfully before grand
juries ``and in any other executive, military, judicial or
congressional proceedings.'' He also required the former White
House intern to provide information to ``representatives of any
other institutions as the OIC may require.'' If she refused,
prosecutors could revoke the immunity agreement and file perjury
charges against her.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, nearly four weeks before Ms. Lewinsky agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors, Starr quietly filed a motion with a
three-judge panel here seeking permission to send secret grand jury
material to the House as part of a referral that would accuse the
president of committing impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the motion was entitled ``In re: Madison Guaranty
Savings &AMP; Loan Association,'' the Arkansas bank related to the
Clintons' failed Whitewater land deal, Starr's request was related
to his inquiry into Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
allegations that he tried to cover it up. And on July 7, the
three-judge panel granted Starr's office the authority to send the
grand jury material to the House.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it clear that Starr was preparing to deliver an
impeachment referral to the Congress weeks before the grand jury
heard testimony from either Ms. Lewinsky or Clinton, both of whom
testified in August.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, Charles Bakaly III, the spokesman for
Starr, acknowledged that Ms. Lewinsky's congressional testimony was
``specifically contemplated'' at the time. But he said the decision
to send an impeachment referral was not made until after the
president testified before the grand jury on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were laying the groundwork for a referral,'' he said, ``but
no final decision had been made in July.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been relatively quiet since his testimony before
the House Judiciary Committee in November, Starr has hardly been a
mere observer as the House voted to impeach the president on two
articles of impeachment on Dec. 19, and as the historic Senate
trial of Clinton has unfolded this month.
</P>
<P>
   His prosecutors have watched the proceedings in both houses very
carefully and his office has reacted to what it has perceived to be
mischaracterizations of the evidence by White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In December, for example, Starr challenged several assertions in
the White House's 184-page defense brief, complaining that the
rebuttal contained ``a series of misrepresentations regarding this
office's referral.'' The statements from Starr were unusual because
they were made public at a critical moment in the impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Those statements paled to the magnitude of Starr's actions on
Friday and this weekend when he returned to center stage to secure
an emergency court order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to submit to
questioning by House managers.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday outside his home in McLean, Va., Starr
said his office had taken ``the appropriate action'' and was ``not
in any way participating other than responding to requests'' from
the House managers.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, the spokesman for Starr, added, ``We have a continuing
duty under the independent counsel law to provide the House with
information relating to the impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers and some Democratic senators continued
Sunday to criticize the decision of the independent counsel's
office to intervene, saying Starr's actions clearly demonstrate his
support for the case against the president being presented by the
House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not acting as their agent,'' Bakaly said. ``There is
nothing political about this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr's office certainly made it easier for the House managers
to interview Ms. Lewinsky. In Starr's court papers, prosecutors
acknowledged that Ms. Lewinsky ``has the right'' to have
prosecutors preside over the interview with House managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The OIC, of course, is fully willing to conduct these
debriefings, if Ms. Lewinsky so desires,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several months, White House lawyers and allies have
attempted to raise questions about Starr's actions and fairness by
portraying him as an excessive, overzealous prosecutor bent on
destroying the president.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr testified for 12 hours on Nov. 19 before the House
Judiciary Committee, he sounded at times like an impassioned
advocate. A day after his marathon testimony, Starr's ethics
adviser, Samuel Dash, the 73-year-old Georgetown University law
professor, resigned to protest the independent counsel's decision
to testify as ``an aggressive advocate'' for the impeachment of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While answering a senator's question in the well of the Senate
on Saturday, White House counsel Charles Ruff challenged the
propriety of the House managers' decision to enlist Starr's
prosecutors in their bid to sit down with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said the idea that the House managers just wanted to have a
routine meeting with Ms. Lewinsky was ``sheer nonsense.'' He said
the meeting was hardly routine because the independent counsel can
``use the authority that he has under the immunity agreement to
threaten Ms. Lewinsky with jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said that prosecutors acted as observers in the meeting
Sunday with Ms. Lewinsky. ``This is not our interview,'' he said.
``The substance of the questions are not ours.''
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted that the office would have preferred it if its
prosecutors had not been asked to intervene by Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., the lead House manager. ``We were not eager to get involved
in this,'' Bakaly said. ``We certainly did not seek it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly said he was flabbergasted that his office's role in the
dispute between Ms. Lewinsky and the House managers had become such
a flashpoint of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't understand what all the fuss is about,'' he
said. ``This is purely an effort to interject politics in the legal
process, which we have encountered throughout this investigation.''

COMMENTARY: STATE OF UNREALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once a year I get invited to the White House for a
quick brain rinse and mindset on the State of the Union. This time
I wandered in the wrong West Wing door and saw what I was not
supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   There was a worried-looking Betty Currie in the corner of the
reception room, flanked by two grim suits offering advice,
presumably not about her secretarial duties.
</P>
<P>
   So what if White House aides were reassuring her, or even going
over questions she might be asked if House managers call her to
testify? They've been doing that for a year and nobody objected.
</P>
<P>
   Then what was all the fuss about the House managers' talking to
Monica Lewinsky? They wanted to find out if she will clarify her
sometimes ambiguous testimony before asking the Senate for
permission to depose her under oath.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, contrariwise, does not want to take the
chance that Monica will reveal some damning detail of their cover
story, or sharpen the conflicts in perjurious testimony about his
passivity.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the fair, unembarrassing, history-respecting solution:
depose both Lewinsky and Currie privately. If important discoveries
or clarifications are made under oath to resolve disputes, call
them as public witnesses. If not, send both women home and move to
the verdict. This is orderly trial procedure, not rocket science.
</P>
<P>
   After the presumed acquittal, should there be a vote of censure?
I think not. If individual senators voting to acquit want to get
well with a disapproving portion of their constituencies, let them
rise in their places and excoriate Clintonian behavior to their
conscience's content, railing away into the night. Those who really
want to get tough may even decline to sip acquittal champagne at
the White House victory rally.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment and trial are censure aplenty. In 2001, Clinton
may face perjury prosecution requiring a pardon from his successor;
for now, however, he will have won the right to two more years of
federal housing.
</P>
<P>
   That's all he'll win. His stratospheric job approval ratings
reflect mainly today's great good times, and contrast sharply with
the repugnance with which most Americans tell pollsters they view
him as a person. Thus, the moaning of moralists, the hand-wringing
of law-and-order types and the unhappiness of culturecampers at the
artful Clinton's latest dodge are at least premature.
</P>
<P>
   Instant analysts were bowled over by the very fact of his State
of the Union address. But this giddy gallimaufry was an appeal to
detach ourselves from reality.
</P>
<P>
   After they gently ushered me out of the off-limits reception
area, I joined other thumbsuckers in the Roosevelt Room. There,
four young Clinton aides foresaw _ with unblinking certitude _ the
next generation's ever-rising surpluses, and laid out how the money
will be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. Only a few years ago, economic sages saw huge deficits
``as far as the eye could see.'' Wrong. Even this year's budget
estimates of surplus were tens of billions out of whack. Federal
budget projections are near-Malthusian in their enormous error.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here were these earnest guys, each preparing his resume in
case their boss gets the heave-ho next week, assuring the world
that U.S. government profit in the next 15 years would equal
exactly $4.5 trillion. And Senate numbers crunchers concur.
</P>
<P>
   No recession; no medium-sized wars; no S.&AMP; L. bailouts; no
pandemics; no stagflation; no tax cuts or spending increases by
Congresses to come _ these memory-free central planners see nothing
but linear loveliness and blue skies from now on.
</P>
<P>
   After predicating the salvation of Social Security on this
rosiest scenario, they carved out half a trillion of Maybeland
money for the biggest income-redistribution scheme in history:
``Universal Savings Accounts,'' a new entitlement named after its
initials, in which a chunk of the lifelong earnings of workers
enhance retirement ``savings'' of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Tinsel is falling to confuse our radar. Can this lamest-duck
administration commit the president after the president after this
president to a State of the Union Message in 2015 married to the
Clinton model?
</P>
<P>
   No, the Era of Big Government will not return on the back of an
Age of Absurd Expectations. Through our ups and downs, the people
and not the tax collectors will decide how to spend our earnings.

SENATORS EXPRESS HOPE THAT IMPEACHMENT TRIAL WILL END SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators from both parties agreed Sunday that the
Senate is not going to remove President Clinton from office, and
they expressed a shared desire to end the impeachment trial of the
president as soon as this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the senators disagreed heatedly over the mechanics of ending
the trial. Democrats insisted that the whole case should be
dismissed now, while Republicans wanted the full Senate to vote up
or down on the two articles of impeachment against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we will get to a guilty or not guilty vote,'' said
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. ``I hope we will get to it relatively
soon, and I hope that will permit us to go on as a country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was one of eight senators _ four Republicans and four
Democrats _ who appeared on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday to
discuss Clinton's trial. Clinton last month was impeached by the
House on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice for
allegedly lying about and attempting to cover up a sexual
relationship with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The senators disagreed about many of the case's particulars, but
agreed that two-thirds of the Senate _ which is made up of 55
Republicans and 45 Democrats _ is not prepared to vote to convict
Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the desire in the Senate to end the trial soon, House
Republican managers continue to push for a full-blown trial with
witness testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate owes us a trial _ that's what the Constitution
says,'' said chief House Manager Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who appeared
earlier Sunday on ``Meet the Press.'' ``We're riding a tiger, and
we can't dismount until it's finished.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde has not persuaded Senate Democrats, who appear to have
unified behind a proposal by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., to dismiss
the trial now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope, because the country has been through such turmoil on
this issue for far too long, that we don't extend this out, drag
more witnesses in who will say the same thing they have said
before, create a spectacle on the floor of the Senate, and put this
country through more turmoil,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings, D-S.C., called the
impeachment trial a ``crassly political hijacking of the
presidency,'' and fumed, ``This political charade has gone on long
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans on the NBC panel made it clear they are
unwilling to simply dismiss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that we would think about the appropriate means
to bring this trial to a conclusion,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine. ``Never in the history of impeachment in the United States
Senate has a trial been dismissed. I hope we would think very
carefully about establishing that precedent, because it could well
encourage others in the future to use impeachment as a political
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate _ as the senators all seemed to expect _ rejects
the motion for dismissal it must then take up the question of
whether to depose witnesses. The motion for dismissal could come up
as soon as Monday if Republicans allow a vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been unanimous in their opposition to calling
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling witnesses at this point would extend this trial
probably for months, and whatever possible marginal benefit one
could gain ... is far outweighed by the long delays which will
result,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Republicans on the show expressed any enthusiasm for
witnesses, but they would not rule it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my own purposes ... I have enough evidence before me now
to listen to final arguments and to go to a final vote,'' Gorton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe agreed, saying, ``I have never been convinced at this
point that we should have witnesses. ... If we do proceed, we want
to make sure that it doesn't turn out to be the Jerry Springer
show.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said, ``The need for witnesses is
diminishing. It's not eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a handful of witnesses, the senators argued the trial
could end soon. Gorton said the trial could end this week, while
Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said, ``I think it is possible that we
could see this by the end of next week. Even if there were a
witness or two ... we could be out of this within a couple of
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond the trial's eventual conclusion with the likely
acquittal of Clinton, the senators disagreed over whether the
Senate should then go on to censure the president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Hollings, Levin and Murray want to censure him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied to us, his conduct was deplorable, and I'd vote (to
censure him) in a flash,'' Hollings said.
</P>
<P>
   And Murray, in her strongest words against Clinton yet, said,
``I am very angry at the president for his inappropriate behavior.
... I abhor what the president did.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he does not believe the Senate
has a constitutional right to censure Clinton, and Republicans
Gorton, Smith and Snowe all expressed skepticism about censure.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the residents of Idaho have already come to their own
conclusions about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to speak out for the citizens of my state, who, in
the majority , think that Bill Clinton is ... a nasty, bad, naughty
boy,'' he said.

TULSA'S RUFFIN IS SMOOTH ON AND OFF THE COURT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Michael Ruffin arrived at the
University of Tulsa four years ago, he discovered that one of his
first destinations was a freshman calculus class.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing a severe error when he saw one, he promptly dropped
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, it was only Calculus I, and such an /elementary''
course. Realizing he thirsted for a greater challenge, Ruffin
enrolled in Calculus III.
</P>
<P>
   It is virtually the only academic problem that has existed for
Ruffin, who is expected to graduate with a 3.8 grade-point average
with a major in chemical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 senior has also constructed a basketball career of
some note, establishing several school records and becoming the
first Tulsa player to post a career double-double (1,000 points,
1,000 rebounds).
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, Ruffin brings his talents to bear on TCU again as the
Golden Hurricane plays host to the Horned Frogs. TCU fans doubtless
have memories of the evening he spent in Daniel-Meyer Coliseum two
years ago, leading a 128-84 rout with 30 points and 24 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Those were career highs, but he has hardly been idle since. With
18 points and 14 rebounds in a victory at Rice on Saturday, Ruffin
recorded his 12th double-double of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Noted for strong defensive play, he is averaging 12.3 points,
10.8 rebounds and 2.6 blocks per game. He also averages better than
two steals per contest. For his career, he has 1,073 points, 1,084
rebounds and 232 blocks. He established a school rebounding record
last season, and has had 70 games with at least two blocks and 31
with three or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few athletes who, when they go to college,
manage to achieve every imaginable goal they could have had,''
Tulsa coach Bill Self said. ``Michael is one who has.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has had an outstanding career both academically and
athletically, and now he has a great future ahead of him whether he
continues to play basketball or goes into business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not much of a talker, but he leads by example. ... In
four years he's done it all. He'll practically double the school
rebounding record, and he even met his future wife.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Mistye Stewart, a 5-foot-2 chemistry major (3.0
GPA) from Dallas who is happily living with Cecil at the moment,
but plans to marry Michael in June.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil is a coatimundi (a tropical American mammal related to the
raccoon) with reasonable social skills, although he has a somewhat
strained relationship with the two ferrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's understandable, because ferrets don't get along with
anyone, but after you get to know them, they're real sweethearts,''
Stewart says. ``Anyway, I just love furry animals.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the remainder of the household, the tortoise doesn't say
much, and the hedgehog is to be handled with great care.
</P>
<P>
   They all belong to Ruffin, who once considered becoming a
veterinarian. The group originally included a three-foot-long
python, now deceased.
</P>
<P>
   The menagerie relocated to Stewart's off-campus apartment when
it was discovered that there were a few extra mouths living in the
dorm. She welcomed the group but does not miss the python.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love animals,'' she says, ``not reptiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffin says he began assembling the group ``because I like
animals, and I've always been particularly fascinated by those that
were unique, a little bit out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart says that when she and Ruffin met, he seemed to fit into
that category himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out he played basketball,'' she says, ``but other than
that, I couldn't get him to talk. I was running around with some
kids up here from Dallas, and he and I just didn't seem to have
much in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I started hearing all this stuff about how smart he was,
and about that deal with the calculus course. So after we'd been
here about a week, I told him we were going to get married.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now he talks to me. In fact, sometimes I can't get him to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Widely recruited out of Cherry Creek High School in Englewood,
Colo., Ruffin says he chose Tulsa partly because of the 1994-95
Sweet Sixteen team led by Shea Seals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started following them in the NCAA Tournament when I was in
high school,'' he says. ``Then I learned more and more about the
school, and realized this was the environment I was looking for: a
small private school with a high academic rating and a good
classroom ratio. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The team I was on as a freshman (1995-96), with Shea, when we
lost in overtime to Louisville in the tournament, is probably the
best one I've played on. But I think this team has more talent, and
we can have a great season.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ruffin and Stewart and Cecil and the ferrets and the
rest of the crew will become one in June. And then?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to play in the NBA,'' Ruffin says. ``That's always been
my goal, and it still is. But if not, I'll just use my degree;
something in the petroleum industry would be the logical thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I guess we could always just open a pet shop.''

ATTENTION-SEEKING REPUBLICANS BASH BUSH INSTEAD OF GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Republican presidential candidates scramble for
attention in a political world fixated on the impeachment trial,
they have stunned many in the party by aiming their fire not at
President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore but at one of their
own: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One after another, Republicans in recent days have ridiculed
Bush's slogan that he is a ``compassionate conservative'' or have
sought to diminish him through thinly veiled assaults on the
stewardship of his father, former President George Bush. This early
onslaught is especially striking because Bush, while he seems to be
inching in that direction, has not even said whether he will seek
the Republican nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to these candidates acknowledge that they are so
desperate to catch on _ and so frustrated that Bush's non-candidacy
has catapulted him ahead of the field in early polls _ that they
believe the only way to get noticed is to go after the one
politician who is sure to get noticed. They want to define Bush in
as disapproving a way as possible before he presents himself to the
Republican electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee described
``compassionate conservative'' as ``weasel words'' that are
``cleverly and deliberately put together to confuse people by
meaning nothing.'' Former Vice President Dan Quayle sent a letter
to his supporters declaring, ``I have ordered my staff to never _
EVER _ utter the words `compassionate conservative!''' He called
the term ``silly and insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the publishing magnate, was referring to Bush in a
speech last week when he said, ``Mealy-mouthed rhetoric and
poll-tested cliches are no substitute for a muscular, substantive
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gary Bauer, a prominent religious conservative, ridiculed
Bush's father, asserting that ``the last Bush talked about kinder
and gentler, and that resulted in an election loss.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the resolution unanimously passed by the Republican
Governors Association last November that called upon candidates to
say only nice things about each other. When Colin Powell loomed
over the Republican field four years ago, most of the contenders
were disciplined _ and politically savvy _ enough to not dare
criticize, or cross, the wildly popular general. In rebuking Bush
on matters that are not substantive, the candidates risk appearing
petty _ and desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are gathering in an all-too-familiar circular
firing squad,'' said Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a former counsel to the
Republican Party. ``It's extraordinary that presidential candidates
would not talk about Bill Clinton and impeachment and would spend
their time running down a fellow Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   On a practical level, they could provoke Bush, whose help they
would need to win the battleground state of Texas (and Florida,
where his brother, Jeb, is governor) should he not be a candidate.
On a broader level, the sniping could stir up resentments and
divisions in a party that should be focused on weakening Gore and
other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the Bushes said they were particularly surprised
by the comments of Quayle and Alexander. Quayle, after all, had
been plucked out of obscurity by the elder Bush to be vice
president. Alexander was appointed education secretary by President
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the contenders cannot help themselves. ``The other
candidates have invested a lot of time running over the last four
years, so it's hard for them to separate the personal and the
political,'' said Chris DePino, chairman of the Republican Party in
Connecticut. ``But if you're going to send the attack in, send it
to the other side. It should be us versus them, not us versus us
versus them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, the Republican strategist, said he had urged four
Republican contenders last week to halt their attacks on Bush. ``I
said, `Don't do this!''' Reed recalled. ``Attacking someone who
isn't a candidate yet can either backfire or force you to swallow
your words later. If either George W. Bush or Elizabeth Dole don't
ultimately run, every one of these candidates will be lining up to
get their support. And it may not be forthcoming if they've been
personally attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   But the White House wannabes are mindful that the more headlines
they draw _ no matter the reason _ the more forceful a case they
can make to donors and other potential supporters that they are
genuine players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is so far ahead that the race seems over before it
begins,'' said Eddie Mahe, a longtime Republican strategist. ``Most
others are $20 million away from even getting the same league in
terms of name ID.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas D. Rath, a Republican strategist in New Hampshire who was
a senior adviser to Alexander's campaign in 1996, noted that
upbraiding the front-runner is inevitable. ``You can't just win
this race by staying out of it forever,'' Rath said. ``Everyone
wants to make the point that no, the outcome is not a foregone
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Alexander defended his comments, saying that
empty sloganeering was ``one reason people are so cynical about
politics.'' But Ginsberg said that Alexander should be the last one
to attack sloganeering, given that his presidential campaign was
perhaps known for the candidate's plaid shirts. ``Guys who wear
plaid shirts shouldn't cast aspersions about symbolism.''
(Alexander said he has put his plaid shirts ``in the closest'' this
campaign, saying they threatened to distract from his message.)
</P>
<P>
   The bashing of Bush also presumes that there are points to make
by challenging the governor's conservative credentials. But he is
opposed to abortion and has pressed for tax cuts. Attacking the
notion that conservatism can have a friendly face may not be so
unpopular in a party that has been symbolized by the not-so-fuzzy
mug of Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that these candidates are motivated less by
political calculation than by the simple jealousy of candidates who
think their hard work should not be overshadowed by Governor Bush's
high standing in the polls. ``I'm not a psychologist,'' said
Patrick Garahan, chairman of the Republican Party in Vermont. ``But
you may feel a little resentment if you've been running around the
country for years and get two percent in the polls and you see
George Bush _ who hasn't even announced _ with 28 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the governor of Texas, people who know him say that
rather than scare him off, all the attention may make him more
determined to run.

POPE APPEALS TO MEXICANS TO WORK WITH THE POOR TO BUILD A JUST
SOCIETY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By RICHARD VARA &QL; 
and DUDLEY ALTHAUS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pope John Paul II, buoyed Sunday by an outpouring
of rousing devotion by an estimated 1 million faithful at a
racetrack Mass, urged Mexicans to adhere to the Christian faith to
build a just society that includes its poor and Indian populations.
</P>
<P>
   The frail 78-year pontiff, who appeared engergized by the
country's adoring reception, also urged Mexicans to reject
materialism, permissive sex morality, family breakdown and other
problems that are blamed on U.S. influences.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's exhortations fell on receptive ears, and he was
interrupted several times with warm applause and boisterous shouts
of ``Viva!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite confusion and disorganization at the papal event,
Mexico's love affair with the spiritual leader of the Roman
Catholic faith continued unabated in the third of a five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   He told an airport welcoming ceremony on Friday that it was a
source of pleasure to journey ``once again in this blessed land.''
On Saturday, he concluded a synod of bishops and called for an end
to violence, drug trafficking and other social abuses.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, he spent several minutes in prayer alone with
the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's spiritual patron. He
leaves Tuesday for a 30-hour stopover in St. Louis, Mo., on his way
to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   He visited more than two dozen patients at a hospital Sunday
night, including children with leukemia and adults with AIDS,
touching each one and kissing several.
</P>
<P>
   At the racetrack earlier Sunday, the 78-year old pontiff said:
.``Faith in Christ is an integral part of the Mexican nation,
engraved indelibly in its history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico still needs it in order to build a more just and
fraternal society, in union with those who have nothing and hope
for a better future.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, like many developing nations, is beset with a
roller-coaster economy, government corruption and uneven progress
toward democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has made a point in his public addresses since his
Friday arrival to focus on social justice and democratic reforms.
As is the custom on papal visits, the highest ranking local prelate
articulates national concerns at some public events.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Norberto Rivera, the country's conservative national
church leader, told the pope at Sunday's Mass: ``Mexico is passing
through difficult situations. It has been cheated and invaded by
poverty. Violence and life-styles foreign to its character are
undermining it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's reference to cheating is apparently directed to the
nation's endemic corruption. The ``foreign life-styles'' is a code
phrase referring to what many Mexicans consider the importation of
American cultural influences that they believe undermine the
country's conservative family and sexual values.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera told John Paul that since his last visit, in 1993, Mexico
has experienced important advances in democratic government,
education, health but that the same time, free-market economics has
made the country a ``prisoner of inhuman interests and internal
dishonesty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People suffer,'' Rivera said. ``They become desperate because
no quick solution appears to their demands for justice, food,
health and fairly paid work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace seems as if it beyond their reach and at times (people)
feel like puppets manipulated, not by threads, but by remote
control.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's sermon supported Rivera but in a low-key manner. In
addition to his call for a just society, John Paul made a point of
diplomatically supporting the nation's impoverished Indian
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope feels very close to you, admiring your cultural
values and encouraging you to overcome the hard situations you face
today with hope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's indigenous people represent the nation's most
impoverished group. Tensions between the government and the Maya in
southern Mexico came to a head in the 1994 uprising in Chiapas
state. Intermittent peace talks are at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   The pope urged the crowds to adhere to their Catholic faith and
ignore those who preach ``hatred and division.'' It was an apparent
reference to hard-line Catholic and evangelical leaders who engage
in violent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a wave of church growth and spiritual renewal, the pope
was apparently concerned with Protestant evangelical inroads in the
overwhelmingly Catholic country. But he was also concerned with the
perceived U.S. influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sons and daughters of Mexico and of the whole of America, do
not seek the truth of life in fallacious and apparently novel
ideologies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd expressed its enchantment with the pope by giving him
generous applause and continuous cheers. Not even the chaotic
organization for the racetrack Mass weakened their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 400,000 people, including a large contingent of
youth, spent the night in freezing temperature at the dusty
racetrack to assure a spot at the Mass. The early morning's near
freezing temperatures and lack of liquids and food at the track
weakened many.
</P>
<P>
   According to city authorities, nearly 1,100 people were treated
at the track for various ailments, most for lower body
temperatures, and 63 were admitted to hospitals. One man aged 56
died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston-based tour group of 130 was also caught up in the
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Vasquez and her daughter, Martha Mora, both of Corpus
Christi,, waited outside the racetrack along with the rest of the
group at 1:45 a.m. The group withstood the night's freezing
temperatures to wait for the papal Mass, they said.
</P>
<P>
   They also survived an attempt by security personnel to deny them
entry at the gate because they had no assigned place to stand, Mora
said. The group surged in with a crowd push and found a spot to
view the Mass, even though they had to jump fencing and chairs
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely worth it to see the pope in person,'' said
Mora, who had not eaten in nearly 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope's previous three visits to Mexico seems to have
strengthened and renewed the church, especially with young people
who are well-educated. Strong youth support for the church is
important since the majority of Mexicans are under the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us tenderness,'' said Lizette Ortiz Flores, 25, an
architect. ``He tells us the truth, he is the right hand of God.``
</P>
<P>
   Flores and eight other companions from Guadalajara spent the
night at the racetrack wearing only light jackets and sweaters. Her
companion, Georgia Carlin Aubert, 25, who works in international
commerce, said the pope spoke to youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope gives us what is of interest to our lives,'' she
said. ``He gives us love and gives it to all the world.''

 &HT;    Public housing looking for a few higher-income families
 &HT;    By Mary Lou Pickel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Wanted: Working families earning decent
wages.
</P>
<P>
   Position: To be public housing tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibilities: Pay higher-than-average rents and serve as
role models to unemployed neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last fall passed reforms intended to discourage the use
of public housing projects as warehouses for the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said
local housing authorities should create ``functioning societies''
by mixing higher-income working poor with those who have very low
wages or no income apart from welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, which will be phased in over the next few
years, have some local housing authority directors scratching their
heads, wondering how to attract people with higher incomes to
projects that most consider a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we have lovely and gracious units to rent, I'm not sure
how it's going to all come together,'' West Palm Beach Housing
Authority Executive Director Laurel Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of her counterparts in Palm Beach County's other housing
authorities worry they eventually may have to turn away single moms
with no place to go _ the staple of many housing projects _ in
favor of working families with higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about taking away the roof over someone's
head,'' Palm Beach County Housing Authority Director of Operations
Beth Kincey said.
</P>
<P>
   The new law encourages housing authorities to jump
higher-earning families ahead of lower-income families on apartment
waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, that means attracting tenants earning as
much as $40,950 a year for a family of four, according to HUD
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The national average for public housing tenants is $7,000 to
$8,000, according to the National Association of Housing and
Redevelopment Officials.
</P>
<P>
   A critic of the law, the Oakland, Calif.-based National Housing
Law Project, says one of the legislation's intents is to decrease
federal subsidies for housing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Families pay 30 percent of their incomes for rent; HUD covers
the difference between what tenants pay and the cost of maintaining
the apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires housing authorities to develop strategies to
improve the blend of incomes in their projects, said HUD spokesman
Stan Vosper. The federal agency has yet to set a recommended ratio
of higher-to-lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Housing authorities will be graded yearly on their efforts to
alter the mix in their projects, Vosper said. But the law contains
no clear penalty for agencies that fail to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Complying with the law should be easy, Vosper said. Housing
officials need only look at their waiting lists and pick the
higher-income people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But most housing authority directors say they are hard-pressed
to find anyone making even 50 percent of the county's median income
on their waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, a family can earn up to 80 percent of median
income and still qualify for public housing. That's up to $32,750
for a family of two in Palm Beach County _ which would have to pay
$807 a month in rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they come in and I say you're going to pay $807 a month,
they're going to look at me like I'm some kind of idiot,'' said
Carla Lewis, an eligibility specialist for the West Palm Beach
Housing Authority. ``That's too much to live in a project.''
</P>
<P>
   Letiza Dexter, 24, who lives with her two children in Delray
Beach's Carver Estates, pays $379 per month _ one of the higher
rents at the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Her annual income is $15,480 including child support, which is
only 34 percent of median income for a family of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they let all the high income people come in, what are they
going to do with the low income people?'' she said. ``They're going
to put us in the dog house.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to attract higher-income tenants is to improve the
quality of the apartments, some authority directors say.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is ceiling rents, where tenants pay the market
value of the apartment rather than 30 percent of their income. If
their income increases, they can save that money, instead of
spending it on rent.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Boca Raton Housing Authority has done for seven
years, said Sandra McGinn, its executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The housing authority charges a maximum of $475 for a three
bedroom apartment without air conditioning in its 95-unit Dixie
Manor, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have some long-term families who choose to stay there
who are making $20,000 to $25,000 a year,'' McGinn said.
</P>
<P>
   But high-rent Boca Raton is the exception to many rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Boca Raton Housing Authority has long attracted the cream of
the working poor and collects rents double that collected by other
housing authorities because it has favored higher earners for
years.
</P>
<P>
   That's a practice HUD officials formally complained about last
year, saying the housing authority may be unfairly restricting
access to families on welfare _ a charge McGinn says is not true.
Her agency and HUD are working to resolve the issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The new law will actually force Boca Raton Housing Authority to
troll for the poorest of the poor to fill their apartments.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the law contains something of a safety net for
the lowest-earners.
</P>
<P>
   It requires that at least 40 percent of a housing authority's
newly available units go to families earning less than 30 percent
of a region's median income. In Palm Beach County, that's $15,357 a
year or less for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Most housing authority directors say they'd prefer to achieve
mixed incomes by encouraging those who already live in public
housing to earn more, as Dexter did.
</P>
<P>
   She was unemployed and on welfare when she moved to Carver
Estates with her two children five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She became a housekeeper at Abbey Delray South, left the welfare
rolls and started to receive child support for her five-year-old
son two years ago. Consequently, her rent more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who are trying to help themselves _ they should try
to help them out,'' she said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Friday night, a friend said, the young woman
cried herself to sleep. On Saturday, she had to prepare once more
for another grilling as the most famous witness in the oft-told
story of the president and the intern.
</P>
<P>
   And minutes after that interview ended Sunday with the departure
of three House prosecutors in the impeachment trial of President
Clinton, Monica S. Lewinsky told a close friend, ``I gave them
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Forced to return to the scene of the presidential impeachment
scandal, Ms. Lewinsky remained at the Mayflower Hotel, out of
public sight.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's impression of the meeting, said her friend, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, was that, for all the amiability
of her visitors and all the reviewing of familiar grounds of
evidence, the House managers themselves left looking disappointed
in sum.
</P>
<P>
   On the street outside, however, they issued brief, careful
comments of optimism, portraying her as a critically needed
witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went really well,'' Ms. Lewinsky declared afterward,
according to her close friend's account. ``I felt really positive
about it, but I didn't have anything new to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who stayed in her hotel room through the day, is
``not doing well,'' said the friend. ``It's been a year, and I
think she was lulled into the quietness of her life the last few
months. She was just a mess this week. Once she learned she had to
go back to Washington, she was really upset.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether Ms. Lewinsky was free to
return to California or whether she might have to remain here for
more such interviews or to be formally deposed, if the Senate
impeachment trial decides she should be questioned as a potential
witness.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview Sunday, no record was taken and participants
were free to characterize it as they pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting took place shortly after 4 p.m. in the 10th-floor
Presidential Suite, which the hotel said cost $5,000 a night. Ms.
Lewinsky had stayed overnight elsewhere in the hotel. Coffee, tea,
soda and snacks were at hand as the participants gathered.
Reporters roamed various parts of the hotel, shielded from the
meeting by metropolitan and Capitol police.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, some hotel guests on lobby lookout reported
sighting Ms. Lewinsky with her mother, Marcia Lewis, in the hotel
restaurant. Ms. Lewinsky had two pancakes and orange juice, one
witness said, and was dressed in a dark pants suit.
</P>
<P>
   After weeping herself to sleep Friday night at the news that she
had to return here, her friend said, Ms. Lewinsky was startled by
the reporters and photographers who awaited her at the airport.
``It was happening all over again,'' she told her friend. ``It was
a year ago all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Her trip included the ``indignity'' of discovering that the
Office of Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr had reserved but not
paid for her ticket from California, the friend said. Ms. Lewinsky
and her lawyers purchased her first-class seat.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of news the friend learned involved the black baseball
cap Ms. Lewinsky wore imprinted with the insignia TSG, for The
Shooting Gallery, a Manhattan company that finances independent
films. Ms. Lewinsky received the hat from a friend working at the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The friend said Ms. Lewinsky used the phrase ``the bad days''
for the period a year ago, when Starr's subordinates first
disclosed that they had heard of Ms. Lewinsky's misbehavior with
the president and pressed her to cooperate. ``She can't wait for
this to end,'' the friend added.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting with the House prosecutors broke up, Plato
Cacheris, a smiling father figure of a lawyer, lingered to praise
his client, one witness said, telling her: ``You did great.
Everything was consistent.''

RESEARCHER SURVIVES DEADLY BITE OF SNAKE TO RETURN TO RAIN FOREST

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Sweeping her flashlight from side to side, Maura Maple
walked down a path into the lush rain forest of Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   The light illuminated small areas in the darkness, but it was
not enough to show Maple that a fer-de-lance _ one of the world's
deadliest snakes _ lay in her path.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old doctoral student from Baytown, Texas, had gone
to Costa Rica to conduct research on a type of frog. It was a
6-foot-long snake, however, that changed her plans with a painful
bite that threatened to claim her leg, and even her life.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, Maple has immersed herself in her research during
monthslong trips into the rain forest surrounding the La Selva
Biological Station, about a two-hour drive from San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found it hard to believe that anyone would pay me to sit
in the middle of a rain forest, enjoying the solitude, and
observe,'' she said of the grant money she receives.
</P>
<P>
   Maple is gathering information for her biology thesis on the
parenting habits of the Strawberry Poison Arrow Frog. The inchlong
frog, a protected species with a bright-red body and blue legs,
secretes a poison from its skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natives used to rub arrows on the frog's skin and then shoot
their prey with it,'' she said, ``but it isn't really that toxic
unless you eat (the frog). One researcher ate some pretzels after
handling them and his mouth went numb like he'd been to the
dentist.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, her parents _ Jim Maple, a retired Exxon engineer and
former Baytown school board member, and Betty Maple, a retired
education testing consultant _ were concerned when their daughter
talked of studying poisonous frogs.
</P>
<P>
   She managed to allay those fears, but her parents grew concerned
again after visiting the biological station and catching a glimpse
of another poisonous resident, the fer-de-lance.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, they stopped at a Whole Earth Provision store in
Houston to buy their daughter a ``snake stick'' as a Christmas
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guide in Costa Rica had told us that he wouldn't go into the
rain forest without one,'' Maple's father said. ``You can use it to
stick into bushes to ward off anything dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   They bought the stick Dec. 4, 1997 _ the day their daughter was
bitten.
</P>
<P>
   That day, she was beginning a week at the biology station as a
research assistant for her college adviser, collecting frogs for a
breeding colony.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, Maple and other researchers decided to gather at
the gazebo in a clearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, I wear the recommended rubber boots, which protect
against snakebites,'' she said. ``But this happened at the end of
the day when everyone was relaxing. I just had on sandals.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the group with her flashlight, she said, she scanned the
path carefully but missed the fer-de-lance _ whose velvetlike skin
has ``x'' patterns in browns, grays and yellows that make effective
camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   The fer-de-lance _ whose name is French for ``iron of lance''
because its triangular head resembles a spearhead _ often stations
itself along trails to wait for its quarry. The snake, which needs
only about five small mammals per year, strikes its prey and then
waits about five minutes for its venom to take effect, said Dr.
David L. Hardy Sr.
</P>
<P>
   A retired anesthesiologist from Tucson, Ariz., Hardy has been to
the biology station to insert transmitters on fer-de-lances to
study their behavior in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Western Hemisphere, this snake is one of the most
deadly around,'' he said. ``It's right up there at the top with the
bushmaster, jararaca and eastern and western diamondback
rattlesnakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The viper probably sensed the heat from Maple's exposed foot and
mistook it for a small mammal, Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Maple didn't know the snake was there until she felt the fangs
sink into the top of her left foot. She shook her leg and the snake
retreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, all I could think about was how gorgeous it was _ a
textbook example of a fer-de-lance. Then the pain began to set
in,'' she said. ``It felt like a nail had been driven through my
foot. One fang had gone completely through to the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she knew she had to stay calm because she had only
about four hours to get treatment. Maple hobbled about 50 yards
with the help of friends but then let them carry her because each
step felt like a knife in her foot, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At the lab, they applied an extractor to suck venom from the
bite. The venom streamed from one fang hole at first and then
trickled out for several more minutes. However, by the time the
device was applied to the second hole, nothing came out, Maple
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she was carried to a car for a long trip through the
mountains to the hospital at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the ride there, I couldn't help thinking about the film
that they'd shown us at orientation about people bitten by this
viper and other poisonous snakes. It was a horror show about people
dying or losing limbs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived about two hours after being bitten. Hospital workers
quickly injected her with 17 vials of antivenin, nearly twice the
amount usually used.
</P>
<P>
   Maple said her leg swelled until her knee was the size of a
volleyball. She begged doctors to operate to reduce the swelling,
but they had to wait until the next day for the anti-coagulant from
the venom to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they peeled back the skin on her leg with a 1
1/2-inch-deep incision, removing the connective tissue between the
muscles in a procedure called a fasciotomy. This released the
pressure on the leg and allowed for expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The incision is left open so it can be cleaned regularly to
avoid infection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they would give me something to knock me out when
they scrubbed it, and sometimes they wouldn't,'' she said,
recalling that she would hold onto the bed posts and scream during
the two-hour procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, doctors closed the wound to a few inches above her
ankle. It left a serpentine scar from her knee to her ankle and an
open incision across her foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor was not sure if he could save my foot,'' Maple said.
``He kept removing dead tissue and was unable to stop the
infection.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 days, her doctors decided she was stable enough to be
flown to Methodist Hospital in Houston on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   At Methodist, Dr. David Netscher, a plastic surgeon, discovered
some tendons, cartilage and other flesh that had to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were thrilled that they could save Maple's foot,
although the top half had been removed. Doctors later rebuilt the
top of her foot with grafts of muscle from her abdomen and skin
from her thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they removed the bandage to show me my new foot, the
doctors thought it was gorgeous,'' Maple said. ``All I saw was a
swollen thing with holes in it like Swiss cheese that was purple,
pink and red. It didn't look like a foot at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Discharged after 40 days of hospitalization, she began months of
physical rehabilitation. Her toes, pointed like a ballerina's,
would not move at first.
</P>
<P>
   Maple slowly progressed from her wheelchair to crutches, then to
a cane. Now she can walk again, although she tires easily.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she doesn't complain about the ordeal that left her with
a battered, numb and arthritic foot. In fact, she already has made
two trips back to the rain forest _ one to thank the nurses who
tended her, and another to tell her story for the TV program
``National Geographic Explorer.''

`VARSITY BLUES' HAS LOTS TO BE CHEERY ABOUT AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``Varsity Blues'' scored its second consecutive
victory at the nation's multiplexes with an estimated $10.6 million
at 2,339 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's comedy-drama, which cost a relatively inexpensive
$15 million to produce, has taken in a better-than-expected $30.8
million in 10 days. It continues to benefit from a lack of rival
films aimed at young male moviegoers, along with strong interest in
the upcoming Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance by `Varsity Blues' has been remarkable since
holiday holdover films usually dominate at this time of year,''
said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking
service. ``We originally thought it would do $36 million overall,
but it will probably go past $50 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Studios held back new product this weekend, traditionally a slow
period for moviegoing, with only one major opening -- Sony's debut
of ``Gloria'' with Sharon Stone in a remake of the John Cassavetes
film, which debuted with a feeble $2.1 million at 1,527 theaters.
The only wide release next weekend will be Miramax's romantic
comedy ``She's All That,'' targeted at young female moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in releasing a male-oriented movie on Super
Bowl weekend because everyone's so focused on parties and TV,''
Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday holdovers continued to perform well, led by Universal's
``Patch Adams'' with $8 million at 2,915 theaters to go past $108
million overall. Disney's ``A Civil Action,'' in its third weekend
of wide release, followed with $7.6 million at 2,206 sites.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's ``The Thin Red Line'' finished fourth with
$5.6 million at 1,538 theaters as the much-acclaimed war drama fell
sharply in its second weekend of wide release.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Arthur Rockwell said Fox executives are likely to be
disappointed with the lack of moviegoer enthusiasm for Terrence
Malick's offbeat re-creation of the battle of Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if `The Thin Red Line' gets a lot of Academy Award
nominations, it's not really the kind of film that draws
audiences,'' he said. ``People want to be entertained these days,
so that's why the holiday films have such strong legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's ``Stepmom'' finished fifth with $5.2 million at 2,358
theaters to go past $78 million overall, followed by MGM's second
weekend of ``At First Sight'' with a somewhat disappointing $4.8
million at 1,838 screens.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' sixth weekend of ``You've Got Mail'' came in
seventh with $4.3 million at 2,331 theaters, which gave it $104.3
million overall as it became the 15th movie released last year and
the 180th of all time to top the $100 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks SKG's sixth weekend of ``The Prince of Egypt''
continued to draw well in eighth with $3.6 million at 2,001 sites
for an overall gross of $87 million. Its performance has given the
4-year-old studio back-to-back animation successes following the
$90 million gross by ``Antz.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of critical favorites were battling for the ninth spot
with Miramax's seventh weekend of ``Shakespeare in Love'' with $3.5
million at 655 theaters edging Paramount's expanded release of ``A
Simple Plan'' with $3.4 million at 660 screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare,'' which has emerged as the strongest challenger
to ``Saving Private Ryan'' for Academy Awards consideration, could
wind up doubling its current $25.8 million gross if it snags
significant Oscar nominations in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two thrillers released last weekend dropped out of the top 10
with Universal's ``Virus'' almost dead with $2.9 million at 2,020
sites and DreamWorks' ``In Dreams'' following with $2.7 million at
1,682 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Still drawing impressively in 13th place was Disney's 10th
weekend of ``A Bug's Life'' with $2.6 million at 1,521 theaters to
pull its overall take to $151.6 million. The Pixar co-production is
only the 60th movie to top $150 million in domestic ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Miramax posted respectable returns for its relaunch of ``Playing
By Heart'' with $1.5 million at 305 theaters. The romantic comedy
opened for a week in a single theater last month to qualify for
Oscar consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's limited debut of British comedy ``Still Crazy'' performed
impressively with $112,000 at 14 theaters and will go wider on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall grosses amounted to about $77 million, down 11 percent
from the same weekend a year ago when the sixth weekend of
``Titanic'' took in $25.2 million to push its total to $274.6
million -- still less than half of its final take of $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's weekend was respectable with continued strength
from existing product but nothing like `Titanic,' '' Rockwell said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Go2net Inc., a Seattle-based Internet start-up,
went public in April 1997, the company's stock sold for $8 a share,
and a year ago, it still was trading in that range. In a single day
earlier this month, it climbed more than $53 to just under $120 a
share, and now it has dropped back to $92 _ all reflections of the
investor frenzy that has driven Internet stocks to startling
heights in recent weeks, and of the wariness that has brought many
of them somewhat closer to earth.
</P>
<P>
   The market analysts continue to debate whether the Internet rage
is absurd speculation or prescient investment, whether the
commercial promise of the World Wide Web is overhyped and whether
the medium will prove as revolutionary as the printing press or the
electric light. But for the most part, investors still seem to
hunger after the stock of anything with even the whiff of a
``dot-com'' to it.
</P>
<P>
   For the young people who work at Internet companies like Go2net,
where the average age among the 93 employees is 28, the gold-rush
atmosphere, while gratifying in some obvious ways, is not an
unalloyed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Many speak of the expectations now hovering over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher the stock goes up, the more pressure there is to
perform,'' said Kevin Bauer, a 25-year-old graphic designer at
Go2net, a network of Web sites offering financial discussion, Web
searches, games and free Web pages for businesses. In fact, the
names of some of those Web sites _ the Metacrawler Web searcher,
Silicon Investor, Playsite and Hypermart _ are better known than
the parent company's name.
</P>
<P>
   John Keister, 32, the company's president and one of its
founders, said the competition in the industry was relentless,
tinged with the general feeling that in the end, there would be a
few big winners and many losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't slow down,'' Keister said. ``You could get
crushed.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the pressure come only from from Wall Street _ many
feel it from friends and family, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother tells her friends, `Oh, Paul's working in the
Internet, he can retire for life in a few years,''' said Paul
Uhlir, 29, a sales manager. ``I don't feel that's true in any way,
but there seems to be this expectation out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while the public image may be that Internet
entrepreneurs are raking in fantastic amounts of money, most of
those gains still exist largely on paper and could easily vanish.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet stock prices generally remain strikingly higher
than they were a year ago, they have dipped and even plunged in
recent days. Amazon.com, the online book-sales pioneer, achieved a
dizzying high of nearly $200 a share earlier this month, saw more
than half the total wiped out over the next eight trading days, and
now has climbed back to $123.
</P>
<P>
   The gains remain partly because many employees of Internet
companies hold stock options that cannot be sold yet. But it is
also true that many who work in the industry, who believe most
keenly in its promise, have no intention of selling now anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you actually really followed the stock day to day, really
thought about it, you'd be a nervous wreck,'' said Russell C.
Horowitz, Go2net's other founder and its chief executive, who holds
1.4 million shares but has yet to sell one and who, despite his
nominal riches, still lives in the same two-bedroom apartment he
has occupied for several years in downtown Seattle. His last action
in the market was to buy some company stock a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd go nuts if you thought that way,'' continued Horowitz,
who was a 1984 graduate with Keister at Lakeside School, the same
Seattle private school attended by Bill Gates, the chairman of
Microsoft. ``But we don't. We're in this for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others seem oblivious, at this point anyway, to the
question of their personal wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first started, I'll admit it, I watched every trade,
every change of the ticker,'' said Ray Greenwell, a 24-year-old
software designer of games for the company's Playsite page, whose
company business card lists his job title as Dreamer of Dreams.
``But believe me, that just gets old after a while. It doesn't
really have anything to do with why I like doing this work to begin
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from planning future sales, employees here seem more likely
to regret past liquidations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it hit 40, my Dad called and the only thing he said was,
`Pay me back!''' Steve Rosen, 32, the company's director of product
development, said with a laugh. So he sold off some of his stock to
pay back loans from his father, only to see the stock rise to three
times that level a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   In riding the market roller coaster in a largely uphill
direction, Go2net is typical of many Internet companies, and of the
speculation that is surrounding ``just about anything with a
dot-com or a dot-net on it,'' in the words of David Menlow,
president of IPO Financial Network, a Millburn, N.J., company that
rates public offerings. ``I'm in my 22nd year in the business,'' he
added in an interview, ``and all the traditional definitions of
when a stock is overbought are all cast to the side. There are no
rules that apply to these Internet stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound: A few new Internet offerings have soared by 400
percent and more on their first day of trading. When
Books-A-Million, a retailer based in Birmingham, Ala., announced
last month that it was acquiring a Web site designer, its stock
soared 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in at least one way, said a Go2net spokesman, Mark S.
Peterson: ``We're kind of unique. We actually turned an operating
profit in the last quarter. That's unusual in the Internet world.''
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a profit of about 4 cents a share. But in
the topsy-turvy world of Internet trading, where companies like
Amazon.com routinely say they expect to lose loads of cash for the
foreseeable future, making a little money could even work against a
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds absurd to ask if investors, namely the institutional
guys, would fall for a company that makes money,'' said Larry
Dignan, an analyst in commentary on the Interactive Investor, an
online discussion forum. ``But that's the environment we live in
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Go2net managed to acquire the popular Web destinations in its
network partly by leveraging the value of its own stock, and all
those sites taken together make it the 25th most visited Web site
in the world, according to Media Metrix Inc., which tracks the
number of visits to Web sites. (The top three are America Online,
Microsoft Sites and Yahoo.) Go2net plans to begin an advertising
campaign soon that will promote all its units together under the
Go2net.com gateway. (``What's Next'' is the slogan _ ``It's a
statement, not a question,'' a company marketer says.)
</P>
<P>
   For now, the roller-coaster ride of the stock price remains
something that many people at Go2net say they try not to think
about too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all seems a little surreal,'' said Marne Semick, 27, a
sales manager, ``but on the other hand it really doesn't change
what we do day-to-day. We're still on the phone, hour after hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the employees seem less excited about the stock value of
Go2net than about the culture of its workplace, on the 47th floor
of a downtown skyscraper.
</P>
<P>
   That culture is casual. ``No ties allowed, and we're pretty
strict about that,'' Peterson said. A list of ``top 10 reasons'' to
work at Go2net in the company's recruiting materials includes this
one: ``We let our software engineers breed butterflies in their
offices and play strange music.''
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a distinct sense of pride in the company's
nonuniform. Matt Pangrazio, a 25-year-old sales manager, said he
loved being able to come to work wearing whatever he wanted,
including a trademark baseball cap. ``I just love getting on the
elevator dressed as I am now, wearing this hat, especially when we
get to the 45th floor, which is Smith Barney, and we're still going
up,'' he said with a laugh. ``All these people in suits and ties
and they sort of look at us, like, `Oh, Go2net, right?'''

JASPER DRAGGING DEATH TRIAL STARTS MONDAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Seven months after James Byrd Jr. was beaten,
chained by his ankles to a pickup and dragged to his death, about
150 residents of this East Texas county will report to the Jasper
County Courthouse on Monday to see who among them will judge the
first of Byrd's accused killers.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in county history, they will walk through
metal detectors into a courthouse that has been swept for bombs in
the wake of a crime so gruesome and shameful that it shocked the
town _ and the nation _ into a new dialogue on race relations.
</P>
<P>
   If 12 jurors and two alternates can be chosen over the next few
weeks, they will hear the capital murder case against John William
``Bill'' King, 24, of Jasper. If not, the trial could be moved to
another county.
</P>
<P>
   King, an ex-con who has darkened his arms and stomach with a
tangle of racist tattoos, is accused of kidnapping, torturing and
killing the 49-year-old Byrd last June 7 because he was black. If
convicted, King could face execution by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   King's co-defendants, Shawn Allen Berry, 23, of Jasper, and
Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31, of Sulphur Springs, will face
capital murder trials later. Prosecutors are also seeking the death
penalty for them.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, television satellite trucks set up on the back side
of the courthouse square, and workers put the finishing touches on
a renovated gazebo out front where daily press conferences will be
held during the trial. Radio technicians also installed an audio
feed from the second-floor courtroom to a basement kitchen that has
been converted into a press room so that reporters unable to get
one of the 40 courtroom seats reserved for the media can still hear
the proceedings. The trial will not be broadcast on TV because
Judge Joe Bob Golden rejected allowing cameras in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the media activity, the city of Jasper's 8,000-plus
residents calmly went about their normal Sunday routine of church,
visiting and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Jasper City Cemetery where Byrd is buried was empty. The
nameplate on his grave, stolen by vandals or souvenir hunters last
year, has been replaced by an etching of his name on the grave's
stainless steel vault cover.
</P>
<P>
   A wooden cross at the head of the grave was covered in white and
yellow plastic flowers, and a fresh row of turned earth was all
that remained of the rusting, leaning wrought-iron fence that until
last week had separated the traditional white and black sections of
the cemetery. The fence was removed as a symbolic gesture
recommended by a community task force formed last summer to discuss
race relations in the wake of Byrd's killing.
</P>
<P>
   The lead story on the front page of the weekly Jasper NewsBoy,
published last Wednesday, was about a controversy over the local
Catholic charity hospital's restrictions on tubal ligations and
vasectomies. At the bottom of the page was a short story on the
Discovery Channel segment on Byrd's killing that will be broadcast
Monday night, and with it, there was a brief mention of jury
selection beginning in the murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial inside urged Jasper residents to follow the lead of
Byrd's family and respond to outsiders' scrutiny this week with
``calm grace and dignity,'' and to ``face down those groups that
promote division.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of the Ku Klux Klan or the New Black Panthers
during the weekend. Both groups showed up uninvited in Jasper
following Byrd's brutal killing last summer, and black militant
leaders carried shotguns through the streets, offering to arm the
community's African-American residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they decided to stay home this time,'' said one woman,
who declined to be identified. ``They aren't welcome here.''
</P>
<P>
   Locals said many residents who have been called for jury duty
had expressed a reluctance to serve, not because of the case's
notoriety but because they don't want to miss work for three to
four weeks of jury selection and a trial that is expected to last a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   King, an unemployed construction worker, was fingered by
co-defendant Berry, his high school buddy and former partner in
crime who had helped King break into a video rental store in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It was Berry who first gave a statement to police implicating
King and Brewer but who declined a plea bargain in exchange for his
testimony. Berry contends King attacked Byrd because he was angry
that Berry had stopped to give the man a ride in the early hours of
June 7.
</P>
<P>
   Residents heading to church that morning found Byrd's
dismembered body in the middle of Huff Creek Road, near an old
black cemetery east of town. Byrd's head and right arm, ripped from
his torso when he hit a culvert while being dragged, were found in
a ditch about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   King insists that Berry dropped him and Brewer, his former
prison cellmate, at their apartment shortly after picking up Byrd.
Police say King, as well as Brewer and Berry, had blood on his
boots when he was arrested the next afternoon, and prosecutors
intend to show that a cigarette lighter found at the crime scene
was engraved with the word ``Possum,'' King's prison nickname.
</P>
<P>
   King at first refused to cooperate with his defense attorney, C.
Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr., prompting the veteran Beaumont defense
lawyer to file a motion last month asking to be removed from the
case. Judge Golden, who appointed Cribbs and will preside over the
trial, declined to replace the lawyer.

 UNDATED: would do.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The managers will have to be careful in writing their final
proposal for witnesses in order to counter the growing unease in
the Senate about the trial's running into another month.
</P>
<P>
   With even some Republicans troubled by Ms. Lewinsky's sudden
reappearance in their midst, Sen. Bob Torricelli, D-N.J., said in
an interview that the managers' use of the court to obtain access
to Ms. Lewinsky was ``a miscalculation of such proportion that it
probably increases pressure on the Republican leadership to get
this matter resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers were not expected to finalize their witness list
until Monday, and one Republican aide said before the session with
Ms. Lewinsky that she was the only solid one on the list. The
managers were also weighing calling aides and advisers to the
president, among them Vernon Jordan, Ms. Currie, John Podesta and
Sidney Blumenthal, as well as Kathleen Willey, another woman who
has said Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance to her.
</P>
<P>
   But the aide said the managers were concerned that the
president's advisers would not be cooperative witnesses and that
the Senate might bristle at the introduction of Ms. Willey.
Separately, Republican investigators also talked to Dick Morris,
Clinton's former political adviser. The managers have said the
president's state of mind was important when Morris told him a poll
showed the nation would never forgive his conduct with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   As the prosecutors prepared their presentation, Sen. Trent Lott,
the majority leader, sought to keep pressure on the White House. He
said he would go ahead with plans to submit written questions to
the president on Monday, even though White House lawyers have
backed away from a statement by Greg Craig, the White House special
counsel, indicating that the president might take written
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott
said in a statement. He said answers from Clinton's lawyers ``is
not a substitute for the president answering the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is set for two critical votes this week, one to
dismiss the trial outright and one to decide whether to allow
witnesses. Senators from both parties said various avenues were
being explored to see whether the Senate could somehow end the
trial this week. Several officials said Sen. Tom Daschle, the
minority leader, had even approached Lott to explore whether there
was a way to skip those two votes outright and move directly to
some final vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like going to an opera that's not all that great,''
said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``The tenor's been stabbed, and as
he staggers across the stage and continues to sing, you want to
stand up and say, `You're dead, fall down!' This trial is like
that. The tenor has died. Bring down the curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems unlikely that the Senate will provide the unanimous
consent necessary to change the vote sequence it has set up. And it
was also uncertain Sunday night what the final votes would be. Lott
was said by senators to be exploring whether the Senate could vote
on findings of fact on the two articles of impeachment and then
take a separate vote on whether to convict Clinton and remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are convinced there's sufficient evidence of
obstruction of justice to suggest that the president did that,''
said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who favors such an approach.
``But a lot of senators are uneasy about taking the next step, and
are asking does that justify his removal?''
</P>
<P>
   She said of the idea of voting on a finding of facts separate
from conviction would be ``tougher than a censure.'' But one
Democratic official said Democrats would not be likely to go along
with such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate does go ahead with the votes on the motions to
dismiss the case and on witnesses, several Republicans say it is
possible that six or more of their members would join with the 45
Democrats to block witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing feeling in our conference that it would be
nice if that motion did not succeed,'' said one Republican senator,
who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ``But many
members may have to hold their noses and vote for it for a lot of
internal political reasons for our party. So it's not clear who is
going to save us from ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., predicted that the motion to
dismiss the case, which could be voted on as early as Monday, would
fail. ``I believe the motion to depose witnesses will be very close
and could go either way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats suggested that they would drop the effort to
dismiss the case if they could be guaranteed that witnesses would
not be called. ``If enough Republicans would declare themselves
against witnesses, I believe we could completely avoid the vote on
dismissal,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to patch together bipartisanship after a fractious
Saturday and avoid the party line vote against dismissing the case,
some senators said they would like to see a bipartisan caucus of
the Senate on Monday, to be held in the Old Senate Chamber, where a
bipartisan plan for the trial was hammered out two weeks ago.
``Perhaps many of these things can be worked out,'' Ms. Snowe said
in an interview. ``There are a lot of things in play. I think
tomorrow could be critical.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial is to resume Monday, and some senators may
still want to submit questions through Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist. Otherwise, unless a new procedure is negotiated, the
Senate moves to the motion to dismiss the case. The House
prosecutors and the White House each have an hour to debate the
motion.

   BEEBE, Ark. _ It is so often something sad _ a funeral, a
disaster _ that draws President Clinton home to Arkansas. Yet he
always seems to savor the escape from Washington and the company of
people who have known him long enough to call him Bill.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, as he came back to survey the wreckage from a
wave of tornadoes, not only old friends and loyal admirers turned
out to greet him. Paula Jones, whose sexual misconduct suit led,
through twists and turns, to the president's Senate trial, stood at
the back of the audience of about 200 here as Clinton assured them
that the federal government would help rebuild their junior high
school, only recently completed but now a tangle of rust-red
girders, silver siding and yellow insulation.
</P>
<P>
   The president seemed unaware of Mrs. Jones' presence until a
reporter asked him about it. He ignored the question, but moments
later said in astonishment, ``What'd he say?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones, who said she was staying nearby with friends,
acknowledged that she might have caused some awkwardness by
attending, but she said that she wanted to support the community.
``I want to see what they're doing to help,'' she said of the
government. She left as soon as Clinton finished his brief remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter was a jarring reminder of the shadows in the
president's past in Arkansas _ and his present in Washington _ at
the end of a long day that frequently included fond reminiscence.
</P>
<P>
   Often smiling and laughing, the storm victims and the impeached
president clearly drew strength from each other. Clinton moved from
hug to hug, and from shouted to murmured words of affection, as he
walked the damaged streets in this hamlet and in his former Little
Rock neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, old friend,'' Clinton said, resting a hand on Kelton
Keathley's shoulder as he stepped from the foundation of Keathley's
house here. The rest of the building _ the red bricks and the white
columns out front _ was blown away as Keathley and some of his
family crowded into the bathroom. The walls fell in and then
vanished in seconds, but no one was hurt even though the shoes of
Keathley's daughter, Lulynn, were yanked off her feet.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the house, sheets of siding from the school a
quarter-mile away were wrapped in the snapped-off branches of a
tulip poplar tree. Contorted, they stretched out parallel to the
ground like flags whipped by a gusting breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that ever since his first gubernatorial campaign he
had relied for help on Keathley, who runs an automobile auction
business. Keathley asked for help rebuilding the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it'd be done,'' Keathley said later. ``I've never had
Bill break his word to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, last Thursday's tornadoes killed seven people in
Arkansas and one in Tennessee. Well over a thousand homes and
businesses were damaged or destroyed in Arkansas. Clinton has
declared a major disaster in five counties here, making them
eligible for federal disaster assistance.
</P>
<P>
   On a dazzling day for such a melancholy spectacle, the president
spent an hour and a half walking the jagged scar that a tornado
tore through downtown Little Rock, and across the backyard of the
Governor's Mansion, where he lived for more than 10 years. The
storm brought down the treehouse where Clinton's daughter, Chelsea,
played.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the smashed remains of the Harvest Foods grocery
story in downtown Little Rock, Clinton said, ``This is a tragedy we
all take very personally.'' Behind him, five white counters stood
exposed to the sky, with racks beside them still offering Juicy
Fruit and Doublemint gum.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton named surrounding streets as he recalled jogging through
the neighborhood. ``All these folks kept coming out and said: The
last time I saw you you were running by here. And I had a roof on
my house,'' said Clinton. He urged his audience to ``rebuild the
homes, fix the roofs, replant the trees and keep the spirit of the
place alive.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton walked by in his brown cowboy boots, some people
shouted to him that they loved him. When Dominique Simmons called
out, ``Hang in there!'' he replied, ``I will.'' Susie May, who used
to be in a baby-sitting cooperative with the Clintons, gave the
president a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about the recent political difficulties,'' Ms.
May said later. ``We're optimistic the truth will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Washington in a driving rain at about 7 a.m.,
Clinton began his day in Little Rock with the 9 a.m. service at the
Immanuel Baptist Church, which he used to attend as governor.
Warmly welcomed by the preacher, the Rev. Rex Horne Jr., the
president listened to a sermon about the danger of ignoring God's
commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``God grants us choices, but God guarantees us consequences,''
Horne said. Yet, he added, ``where sin abounds, so does grace.''  &QL;

SALT LAKE CITY ORGANIZERS FURNISH FEW DETAILS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ In the Wasatch Mountains that dominate the
landscape here, snow has been falling almost nonstop the last few
days, vividly illustrating the gifts of nature and meteorology that
made this city appealing as a site for the Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   And in the packed downtown meeting room where executives of the
local Olympic organizing committee faced journalists from all the
over the world Sunday in a news conference about the latest
developments in the unfolding Olympic scandal, the display was just
as vivid as all the reasons the 2002 Winter Games are in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, led by the committee's chairman, Robert Garff,
and Frank Joklik, its acting president and chief executive, offered
little new information and declined to answer many questions they
were asked. They said that because of the various investigations
under way here, they could not comment on the details of the report
released by the International Olympic Committee Sunday afternoon in
Switzerland about how and when Olympic officials here paid money to
IOC delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Both men also declined to say whether they believed the remedies
announced by Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC's president, would go
far enough in addressing the problems of influence and greed that
have been identified in how sites are selected for the Games,
saying that that was a matter for the IOC to address. They also
declined to say whether they thought Samaranch should step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a matter for the IOC,'' Garff said. ``I refuse to be
drawn into their internal politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And they declined to say whether the local committee might need
to restructure itself, saying _ as they have for weeks _ that what
happened here in the city's efforts to win IOC members' votes to
get the 2002 Olympics was the result of a few errant individuals
whose behavior lapsed, and not of a structurally flawed system that
was accepted and common knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take responsibility for the actions of certain members of
the former bid committee,'' Garff said, reading from a prepared
statement. ``Some of those actions taken were below the standards
expected by this community. Therefore I reiterate our previously
stated apology to the people of Utah.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's report, issued half a world away using information
gleaned in part from the files of the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee, offers many new details about how the IOC says its
delegates were influenced by Salt Lake City organizers, including
dates and amounts paid.
</P>
<P>
   In an unfolding story in which many of the specific facts have
remained vague or unconfirmed, the IOC report offers one of the
first documented glimpses into the process of delegate influence.
It also hints that the payments and amounts were exact and
accounted for in financial records kept by the Salt Lake committee,
and not, by contrast, paid out from some loosely controlled cash
fund.
</P>
<P>
   One IOC delegate who was expelled, Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador,
got at least four payments from the Salt Lake City committee, the
IOC report said, including one of $6,991 on Dec. 13, 1994; one of
$3,000 on Sept. 15, 1993, and two payments of $2,500 on May 23,
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Another delegate, Jean-Claude Ganga from the Congo Republic,
opened an account with one of the largest local banks here, the
First Security Bank, for receipt of his payments, the report said.
Another delegate apparently preferred his payments to be regular _
$1,000 a month for seven months between late 1994 and mid-1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference here Sunday, Joklik said he had complete
confidence the problems from the payment scandal could and would be
overcome, and that the financial and public relations implications
_ including at least several major corporate sponsors who have
become noncommittal about their economic participation in the Games
in recent weeks _ will also ease as it becomes clear that the
Olympics as a whole are serious about cleaning up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly how far that cleanup will go here, or, conversely,
how widely the blame may be distributed, remains unknown. Samaranch
has said, for example, that any IOC member on the international
level who knew or should have known what was happening in the
site-selection process will face sanctions and consequences; on
Sunday he announced the ouster of six members and continuing
investigations of three others. The officials here declined Sunday
to make that blanket promise. Garff said the question would have to
await the release of the independent ethics investigation report
expected here within the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that report is finished and in our hands we will then
take decisive action,'' he said. &QL;

ALBRIGHT SEEKS TO REASSURE MOSCOW ON `STAR WARS' PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Usage of ``Monday'' in lede sentence is CQ, allowing for time
difference.) 
(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright insisted Monday,
on the eve of what promised to be two days of contentious talks
here, that the Clinton administration's plan to develop a missile
defense system would not affect any Russian decision to ratify the
Start II treaty, languishing in the Russian Parliament since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal means the Americans and Russians would have to
amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which Moscow is loath
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Some American arms control experts have argued that by pushing
forward with the new system announced in Washington last week, the
administration was sacrificing passage of Start II, which has been
ratified by the United States and calls on both countries to reduce
their nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Start II, which reduces existing nuclear weapons,
the new missile system is designed to combat still unquantified
threats from rogue nations like North Korea and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, speaking to reporters just before landing in Moscow,
said she believed the Russians would sign Start II when they
``believed it was in their national interest,'' and that the new
plans by the administration would not bog down the nuclear treaty
any further.
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that the Communist-dominated Russian Parliament
would pass Start II only when the lawmakers understood the message
from their own military that it was best to reduce the number of
nuclear weapons through the treaty because a nearly bankrupt Russia
cannot afford to maintain its large number of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official traveling with Albright said
the Russian Parliament had held the treaty hostage for political
reasons and would probably continue to do so until lawmakers were
sufficiently persuaded by their military.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament first balked in pique over NATO expansion to
include three former Warsaw Pact countries _ Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary _ and most recently over American air strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Albright faces the toughest set of negotiations with the
Russians since she became secretary of state. Her former Russian
counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, with whom she had a businesslike
relationship, was elevated to prime minister last August after
President Boris Yeltsin dismissed his reformist government and the
economy went into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has not met with Primakov since he got his new job and
will be doing the bulk of her negotiations with Primakov at a
dinner Monday night. She will be meeting with the Russian foreign
minister, Igor Ivanov, but will be talking only by telephone with
Yeltsin, who remains hospitalized for treatment of a bleeding
ulcer.
</P>
<P>
   The once relatively smooth relationship between Moscow and
Washington has deteriorated into something quite prickly; mutual
interests are diverging.
</P>
<P>
   In this darker atmosphere, Albright has an even fuller plate of
issues than usual. This list is headed by the proposed new missile
defense system and goes on to include differences on Iraq and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she would explain to the Russians that the new
missile defense system would not be deployed until 2005. And it
would only be deployed then, she said, if the threat from North
Korea, Iraq and other rogue nations existed as fully as now
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said it would be ``irresponsible'' for the United
States not to move forward on the missile defense system given the
emerging nuclear threats from North Korea and Iraq. ``We have to
deal with the threats of the day, not the previous day or
tomorrow,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said it was unreasonable for
the Russians to complain about the United States developing a new
missile system to defend itself against rogue states when Russia
itself was helping Iran acquire nuclear missile capability.

ADMINISTRATION TO SEEK $3 BILLION FOR EMBASSY SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Scalded by criticism of security weaknesses at
American embassies abroad, the Clinton administration will seek
more than $3 billion during the next five years to fortify and
rebuild its missions overseas, senior White House and State
Department officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
request for additional money will be part of the president's annual
budget proposal, to be announced on Feb. 1. It will include a plan
for a high-level outside group to evaluate security priorities,
future construction needs and broad issues related to how the State
Department should operate to carry out its objectives overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The group will be led by Adm. William Crowe, the retired
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a former ambassador to
Britain. He led two panels convened after the bombings of two
American embassies in Africa last year. Earlier this month the
panels recommended closing a number of embassies around the world
that are vulnerable to terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday, one White House official described
the spending plan as a multistage effort ``greater than any
previous construction program.'' But the official and others
acknowledged that it fell considerably short of the spending
recommendations presented to the State Department by the panels led
by Crowe. The Crowe report recommended spending $10 billion to $12
billion in the next decade to upgrade security at scores of
diplomatic posts.
</P>
<P>
   Under the multiyear spending plan that the president will
propose, most of the construction money would be spent from 2001 to
2005, after the State Department took a year to determine
priorities, select sites and begin to design plans for new and
upgraded buildings. In addition, it proposes spending $250 million
for additional security guards, video cameras and other technical
equipment for upgraded security.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the budget proposal represents the administration's
effort to devise a strategic plan for enhanced physical security in
response to the failings that were apparent after the bombings on
Aug. 7 in Kenya and Tanzania. In September, the administration
sought $1.8 billion for security improvements, an emergency request
that Congress quickly approved.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the president's proposals were fixed in
December, before the conclusions of the Crowe report were known.
Moreover, one said, the spending plan reflected an estimate of how
much could be reasonably spent for embassy security in the coming
years. ``Everyone is trying very hard to make sure we are doing
everything we can do as fast as we can do it,'' a State Department
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another official said that after the Crowe report was made
public Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with White House
officials about the spending level for security. Presidential aides
agreed to establish a committee that would continue to review the
construction program to monitor whether spending levels are
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were optimistic that Congress would
approve the plan based on the bipartisan support for the emergency
appropriation last year. In fact, it seems possible, based on the
positions they have expressed, that lawmakers may seek even more
money than will be proposed in the budget to increase physical
security overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Crowe report to the State Department accused the agency of
an ``institutional failure'' to recognize the threat of
international terror and the danger of heavy truck bombs such as
those used in East Africa to kill more than 220 people.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the administration's security proposal reflects a
debate within the government about how best to combat terrorism
overseas. Some administration couterterrorism experts have
cautioned that strengthening buildings cannot guarantee security no
matter how much money is spent to fortify or isolate them. Those
experts have suggested other approaches, including more aggressive
intelligence collection and analysis to prevent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to increase spending for physical security is in
addition to the $2.8 billion that administration officials said on
Friday would be sought to combat threats of chemical and biological
terror and computer attacks on the United States, but it is part of
a total of about $10 billion that Administration officials say they
hope to spend in the coming budget year to prevent terrorist
attacks.

 &HT;    Broncos swagger in
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Charter No. 9011, a United Airlines
DC-10, landed 10 minutes early. The passengers walked down the
stairs, boarded four chartered buses on the tarmac and, with the
help of a police escort, completed an uneventful journey to the
Hyatt Pier 66.
</P>
<P>
   The way Denver coach Mike Shanahan sees it, this was a good omen
for Super Bowl XXXIII. His team already was ``a step ahead'' of the
trip to San Diego last January that despite a successful finish _
an upset of Green Bay _ had a shaky beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of our baggage last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year the baggage made it. And not just the stuff they
packed in suitcases before leaving Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan held his first media conference of the week Sunday
night. And he had been standing behind the podium set up in a tent
behind the team hotel only a few minutes when a question was asked
about another kind of baggage _ the residue of hard feelings
between himself and Falcons coach Dan Reeves dating back to their
time together in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first test. Would Shanahan use the Super Bowl
spotlight to continue the war of words that Reeves, the former
Broncos' coach, started last week? Or would he try to distance
himself from it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to respond to him this week,'' he said. ``The
emphasis right here is on the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons,
not my relationship _ or past relationship _ with Dan Reeves. As
far as I'm concerned, that's over with. We've got a football game
to prepare for.''
</P>
<P>
   That answer stopped the questions about Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   For about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When asked again about his former boss, Shanahan clenched his
jaw and answered icily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make this clear,'' he said. ``Maybe I didn't make it
clear. What I'm talking about right now is the Denver Broncos. If
you want to talk about the Atlanta Falcons ... we're not going to
get into my past relationship with Dan. That's over with. We
addressed that last week. Now we move on. The emphasis is where it
should be. On the game. Our players. Our city. And our Denver
Broncos.''
</P>
<P>
   After Shanahan finished talking, five Broncos' players were
brought to an adjoining tent: quarterback John Elway, tight end
Shannon Sharpe, cornerback Ray Crockett, running back Terrell Davis
and special teams player Keith Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who attracted the biggest crowd?
</P>
<P>
   Not the quarterback who most likely will play his last game
Sunday. Not the running back who was the MVP of Super Bowl XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   It was the always outspoken Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that nothing _ not lost luggage or rediscovered
emotional baggage _ is going to disrupt Shanahan's plans for this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot that bothers him,'' Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan did make one subtle change from last year's Super Bowl
itinerary. He moved curfew from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. He
explained that the change had more to do with different time zones
_ from San Diego to Miami _ than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a mature football team,'' he said. ``We've come here
to win a football game. This is a business trip. This is not a
vacation. But at the same time, I still think they can enjoy
themselves and take care of business at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' offensive linemen, dubbed ``The Muzzle Men'' for
their refusal to talk to the media, plan to enjoy themselves
tonight. They are taking $5,500 in self-imposed fines _ for
everything ranging from being quoted to missing assignments _ and
blowing it on a three limousines and dinner for 20 at Joe's Stone
Crab.
</P>
<P>
   One record already was broken Sunday. As the players walked off
the plane: defensive tackle Mike Lodish began his sixth Super Bowl
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other players have played in five Super Bowls. Lodish, a
nine-year veteran out of UCLA, will become the first to reach No. 6
_ which brings us to something Lodish prepared before leaving
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   He has been through the hype. He has heard all the questions.
So, to save time, Lodish said that he plans to carry a sign with 10
answers on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just point to the answer that I think will best fit the
question,'' he said. ``No. 6, that's the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Shanahan isn't carrying a similar sign.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only Sunday.

MILLIONS PACK RACETRACK FOR PAPAL MASS IN MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds: New 12th graf to add background on abortion in Mexico and
14th graf to update with visit to hospital.) (ko) 
By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pope John Paul II flew down from the skies in a
white helicopter into a racetrack Sunday and celebrated an outdoor
Mass for more than 1 million Mexicans, who chanted his Polish
childhood nickname, Lolek, in greeting.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who had been here three times before, chose Mexico for
his first papal trip after his election 20 years ago, and many
Mexicans feel that they have a special, personal bond with him. He
arrived on Friday to conclude a synod of bishops from all the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Mass, which he celebrated in Spanish, was his first
direct encounter on this visit with ordinary Mexicans, and the
outpouring of affection, hope and excitement was as vibrant as it
was during his first visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith in Christ is an integral part of the Mexican nation,''
the pope said in a homily that included special mention of the
indigenous peoples of Mexico, the poor and others in difficulty.
``Do not let this light of faith be extinguished! Mexico still
needs it in order to build a more just and fraternal society.''
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old pope, who is on a light schedule to protect his
fragile health, moved slowly but spoke in a firm voice.
</P>
<P>
   Believers from all over the country began gathering on the dusty
grounds on Saturday afternoon, sleeping overnight in cars or on the
ground. By midnight, the huge field was filled. And Sunday morning,
thousands of people who had spent the chilly night wrapped in
panchos, waiting to get in, were jammed outside the gates, pleading
_ many in vain _ for a closer glimpse of the pope.
</P>

   ``He means everything to us; he is our hope and our faith,''
Isabel Barrera, 46, said as she clung to a closed gate. Mrs.
Barrera, an accountant from Monterey, said she had attended a papal
event every time the pope visited. On Sunday, she said she was
counting on him to help the people of Chiapas, the southern region
where Indians and leftist rebels began an insurrection against
government troops in 1994 _ and where 45 Indians were massacred by
pro-government paramilitary fighters in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has not mentioned Chiapas or the stalled peace talks
there since his arrival in Mexico. But Mrs. Barrera, like others,
said he might have had the troubled region in mind when he spoke
generally about the needs and rights of Mexico's indigenous
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that are being done to those poor people in Chiapas
are terrible,'' she said. ``The pope can help mediate between them
and the government. He is the only one who can.''
</P>
<P>
   The horrors in other parts of the world did intrude into the
pope's message to Mexicans. John Paul ended his Mass with a prayer
for the Roman Catholic nun who was killed on Friday in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily, he asked Mexicans to protect human life and
re-echoed the church's teaching on abortion. ``May no Mexican dare
to wound the precious and sacred gift of life in the mother's
womb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal abortions are tightly restricted in Mexico, and thousands
of illegal ones are performed annually. The government has proposed
easing the abortion laws, but the church is strongly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged them to resist the lure of evangelical Protestant
sects, which have made deep inroads in Mexico and throughout Latin
America and are particularly strong in Chiapas. ``Sons and
daughters of Mexico and of the whole of Amerca, do not seek the
truth of life in fallacious and apparently novel ideologies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope made special mention of the sick in his homily and in
the afternoon, he visited a hospital. First he greeted recovering
patients in wheelchairs while a mariachi band played. Then, while a
bishop read his speech for him, John Paul went upstairs, without
television cameras, to touch and be touched by 27 terminally ill
patients, adults and children, suffering from AIDS, cancer and
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he went in Mexico, the streets along his routes were
thronged with people, singing, dancing, waving and waiting for a
glimpse of him passing in his popemobile. Even people who described
themselves as nonbelievers said they were fascinated by the appeal
of this pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its amazing to see the people, their unity and fervor,'' said
Alejandro Gonzales, 26, a cafe worker who watched the pope's visit
on television. ``We've adopted this pope as our own. I wonder what
will happen when he goes, what will happen to all this fervor. Will
the next one be received with the same faith and devotion?''

   MIAMI _ When the Denver Broncos arrived at the Super Bowl a year
ago, several players discovered on checking into the team hotel
that their luggage was missing. There was no such oversight here
Sunday evening, every Broncos player reporting that every piece of
cargo had been delivered with dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, Denver coach Mike Shanahan went to great
lengths to purposely ditch some excess baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Although some veterans privately insisted late Sunday that
Shanahan was unimpressed with an apology offered by Falcons coach
Dan Reeves early in the evening _ sometimes hate means having to
say you're sorry _ the Denver coach did his best to douse a feud
that figures to be stoked even more on Sunday afternoon.
Predictably, the initial query of Shanahan's first press conference
of the week dealt with the the acrimony dredged up last week by
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as predictable was Shanahan's reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that it's over with,'' said Shanahan, who dodged a
question about whether his relationship with Reeves is irreparably
damaged, as he said last week. ``The emphasis should be on the
players and on the teams. As far as I'm concerned, it's over with.
I'm not going to respond to questions about this the rest of the
week.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions will doubtless continue to be asked, players from
both teams conceded. And even a few Atlanta veterans noted Reeves
almost seemed to be seeking a forum for airing old grievances
during last week's 25-minute recounting of relationships with
Shanahan and Denver quarterback John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, who has somehow managed to remain above the fray, said
Sunday that he ``had no problem'' with Reeves' comments and that
there ``was no can of worms opened up as far as I was concerned.''
But Elway reiterated his strong feeling that he has been a much
more productive quarterback under Shanahan's tutelage than that of
Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers back that up,'' said Elway, who on Sunday becomes
the first quarterback in history to start five Super Bowl games.
``There's no question I've played much better the last six years
than I had in the previous 10 (years).''
</P>
<P>
   While the ballyhooed menage-a-tribulation dominated the press
session with Broncos players, most seemed bored with it already.
Having already installed their game plan during practices last week
at home, the Denver players seemed more intent on getting a chance
to fine-tune their plans and assuming the role as the experienced
team that's been here before and knows what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is old hat to us now,'' cornerback Ray Crockett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver public relations staff wasted little time making the
team's highest-profile players _ Elway, running back Terrell Davis,
linebacker Bill Romanowski and tight end Shannon Sharpe _ available
to the media. All bore the confident air of grizzled Super Bowl
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   And all assured that, by kickoff Sunday on evening, the feud
will be set aside for three hours as friction gives way to
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a business trip for us,'' Shanahan reminded. ``We've
come here to win a football game. This is not a vacation.''

   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Charter No. 9011, a United Airlines
DC-10, landed 10 minutes early. The passengers walked down the
stairs, boarded four chartered buses on the tarmac and, with the
help of a police escort, completed an uneventful journey to the
Hyatt Pier 66.
</P>
<P>
   The way Denver coach Mike Shanahan sees it, this was a good omen
for Super Bowl XXXIII. His team already was ``a step ahead'' of the
trip to San Diego last January that despite a successful finish _
an upset of Green Bay _ had a shaky beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of our baggage last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year the baggage made it. And not just the stuff they
packed in suitcases before leaving Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan held his first media conference of the week Sunday
night. And he had been standing behind the podium set up in a tent
behind the team hotel only a few minutes when a question was asked
about another kind of baggage _ the residue of hard feelings
between himself and Falcons coach Dan Reeves dating back to their
time together in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first test. Would Shanahan use the Super Bowl
spotlight to continue the war of words that Reeves, the former
Broncos' coach, started last week? Or would he try to distance
himself from it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to respond to him this week,'' he said. ``The
emphasis right here is on the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons,
not my relationship _ or past relationship _ with Dan Reeves. As
far as I'm concerned, that's over with. We've got a football game
to prepare for.''
</P>
<P>
   That answer stopped the questions about Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   For about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When asked again about his former boss, Shanahan clenched his
jaw and answered icily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make this clear,'' he said. ``Maybe I didn't make it
clear. What I'm talking about right now is the Denver Broncos. If
you want to talk about the Atlanta Falcons ... we're not going to
get into my past relationship with Dan. That's over with. We
addressed that last week. Now we move on. The emphasis is where it
should be. On the game. Our players. Our city. And our Denver
Broncos.''
</P>
<P>
   After Shanahan finished talking, five Broncos' players were
brought to an adjoining tent: quarterback John Elway, tight end
Shannon Sharpe, cornerback Ray Crockett, running back Terrell Davis
and special teams player Keith Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Guess who attracted the biggest crowd?
</P>
<P>
   Not the quarterback who most likely will play his last game
Sunday. Not the running back who was the MVP of Super Bowl XXXII.
</P>
<P>
   It was the always outspoken Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that nothing _ not lost luggage or rediscovered
emotional baggage _ is going to disrupt Shanahan's plans for this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot that bothers him,'' Sharpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan did make one subtle change from last year's Super Bowl
itinerary. He moved curfew from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. He
explained that the change had more to do with different time zones
_ from San Diego to Miami _ than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a mature football team,'' he said. ``We've come here
to win a football game. This is a business trip. This is not a
vacation. But at the same time, I still think they can enjoy
themselves and take care of business at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' offensive linemen, dubbed ``The Muzzle Men'' for
their refusal to talk to the media, plan to enjoy themselves
tonight. They are taking $5,500 in self-imposed fines _ for
everything ranging from being quoted to missing assignments _ and
blowing it on a three limousines and dinner for 20 at Joe's Stone
Crab.
</P>
<P>
   One record already was broken Sunday. As the players walked off
the plane: defensive tackle Mike Lodish began his sixth Super Bowl
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other players have played in five Super Bowls. Lodish, a
nine-year veteran out of UCLA, will become the first to reach No. 6
_ which brings us to something Lodish prepared before leaving
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   He has been through the hype. He has heard all the questions.
So, to save time, Lodish said that he plans to carry a sign with 10
answers on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just point to the answer that I think will best fit the
question,'' he said. ``No. 6, that's the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Shanahan isn't carrying a similar sign.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only Sunday.

ON SUNDAY TV, SENATORS REVIVE SPIRIT OF BIPARTISANSHIP 
</HEADLINE>

 By FRANK BRUNI

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after bipartisan cooperation in the
impeachment trial of President Clinton seemed to be collapsing,
senators hit the television talk-show circuit Sunday morning to
shore it up, floating new plans for concluding the proceedings
quickly and stressing their common desire to reach that terminus
with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Where rancor prevailed on Saturday, rapprochement seemed to be
on senators' minds Sunday as they appeared in unusually large
numbers on the televised forums that serve as conduits not only to
their constituents, but also to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, began her comments on the NBC
program ``Meet the Press'' with a slight digression. ``First of
all, let me just say that I think it is important that we continue
on a bipartisan basis,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn, instantly brushed aside a
suggestion by an interviewer on the CBS program ``Face the Nation''
that the bipartisan pact governing the trial had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I wouldn't say destroyed at all,'' Dodd said. ``We've done
a good job over two weeks to try and keep this together, and I am
still very hopeful that over the next 24 hours, we will be able to
get back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, reiterated his and his
colleagues' promise to rise above partisan feuding.
</P>
<P>
   ``By golly, I think the Senate will stay to it, even though
there's been tremendous effort in the last 24 hours to divert us
into a partisan melee,'' Craig said on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Such remarks represented a striking turnabout from the vitriol
on Saturday, when Democrats fumed about a meeting between
Republican trial managers from the House and Monica Lewinsky. The
friction between parties worsened when a spokesman for the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Lott would not allow
debate on Monday on a Democratic motion to dismiss the case against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight or over breakfast, tempers cooled as senators seemed
to realize anew their overarching investment in emerging from this
trial with their reputations _ and the reputation of their
institution _ intact. Unspoken was the example of the House, which
in impeaching the president split along bitter, partisan lines.
</P>
<P>
   Among 21 Republican and Democratic senators who fanned out
across CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN and other networks Sunday, there was
unwavering consensus on two points: A majority of senators would
defeat any motion to dismiss the case, and Clinton would ultimately
not be removed from office, because there were nowhere near the 67
votes necessary for that.
</P>
<P>
   There was also general agreement that the path toward that
outcome was not a long one and could take as little as a week,
especially if a majority of senators voted against the inclusion of
witnesses in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   That possibility seemed very much alive Sunday as several
Republican senators said they had not been convinced by the House
trial managers' argument for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't swayed me yet,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala.,
on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was equally clear that Republicans, in rejecting the
notion of dismissing the case, felt it was essential for senators
ultimately to cast yes or no votes on the articles of impeachment,
whether there was testimony from witnesses or not.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In explaining that conviction, they frequently invoked history.
They had to be true, they said, to the impeachment trials that had
gone before this one, and they had to be sure that they did not set
any dangerous precedents for the future by abbreviating a weighty
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had 15 impeachments in the history of this country
over 210 years,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, on CNN's ``Late
Edition.'' ``Two of those that were impeached resigned. In the
other 13 cases, we've had a trial, and we have rendered a
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And to say that because it is believed that there are not a
sufficient number of senators to convict, we should short-circuit a
constitutional process, is a very, very dangerous proposal,'' Gramm
continued.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans and Democrats sought to explain their positions
and, in some cases, identify areas of agreement, the retreat from
bickering was by no means complete.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats continued to express disgust and a sense of
betrayal that House trial managers had arranged to meet Ms.
Lewinsky before senators voted on witnesses, while some Republicans
accused Democrats of simply trying to fuel partisan fires to
distract attention from the president's misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there were topics beyond the inclusion of witnesses
that exposed a persistent divide between most Republicans and most
Democrats. Although several Democrats resurrected the idea of
censure, Republicans were still frosty to it.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, these differences were articulated
in voices more measured than they had been just 24 hours earlier.
It was as if senators had scared themselves into taking a long,
deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think bipartisanship is not dying,'' Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``But I think it's being
tested.''

 WEBTV HELPING TO CREATE AN INTERNET FOR ALL AGES  &HT;     By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 93, Ruth Hyman can remember the days before television.
Now, she not only watches television _ she uses her set for e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, who lives in Palo Alto's Lytton Gardens senior housing,
is one of a large number of senior citizens making a hit out of
WebTV, which connects to the Internet over people's television
sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps me going,'' said Hyman. With her newfound Internet
access, ``I learned how to look up medications, and I met a lot of
cousins I hadn't seen in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   One-third of WebTV's &UR;  &LR; 700,000 users are age 55 or older. That's
more than double the rate of older people on the Internet in
general. According to a late 1998 survey by Media Metrix in New
York, 14 percent of all Internet users are age 50 or older.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the noncomputer-generation people want is all the
benefits of the Internet without all the hassles and pain of a
PC,'' said Larry Marcus, an analyst in San Francisco for BT Alex.
Brown. ``And WebTV really simplifies the whole process. You don't
have all the configurations and system crashes. It's not trying to
be all things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Software giant Microsoft Corp. bought Mountain View's WebTV two
years ago for $425 million. While Microsoft makes most of its money
from software for personal computers, its investment in WebTV
stands as one of the key markers on the road to the convergence of
PCs and television sets.
</P>
<P>
   WebTV makes software that runs hardware ``set-top'' boxes made
by Sony, Philips and Mitsubishi. Those companies make a black,
VCR-size box that sits near the television set and connects to the
Internet. The boxes cost $99 or $199, depending on the level of
service. A keyboard that connects via infrared so you can balance
it on your lap is $49. WebTV then acts as an Internet service
provider, selling two tiers of access for $19.95 or $24.95 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   To set it up, you just plug one cord into the phone line and
another into either the television, the VCR or the cable box,
depending on your setup at home. Then you program a remote control
that comes with the WebTV box so that it will work with your TV and
VCR.
</P>
<P>
   When you turn on your TV the first time, you register for the
service; once you're up and running, each time you turn on the TV,
you get the WebTV home page, with links along the outside and a TV
show running in the center. You can then choose between going
entirely online, solely to television or doing both at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple,'' said Erna DeAnna, 73, of Bedminster, N.J.
She fears the personal computer _ ``I'm very intimidated by it,''
she said _ but her son, a computer programmer, bought her a WebTV
and it has proved perfect to keep in touch with grandchildren at
college and friends who've moved to the Sun Belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's marvelous for e-mail,'' she said. ``It's easier than the
telephone, where you can't get through or they're not in. This way,
they get the message quickly.''

<P>
   With WebTV Classic, users can e-mail and surf the Web just like
on a PC. In the more advanced WebTV Plus, people get an interactive
TV guide, in which they can click on a listing and tune right to
that channel. Some shows are now carrying special programming
allowing WebTV users to link to a Web site or other special
information right from a show.
</P>
<P>
   WebTV is only one company in a highly competitive race toward
PC-TV convergence. All the big players in the computer, television
and consumer electronics industries are trying either to put TV
shows on the PC desktop or give TV sets more computerlike
functions.
</P>
<P>
   While few of these gadgets have found widespread success, WebTV
has grown to 700,000 customers _ from 200,000 two years ago _
largely by making the Internet's killer application, e-mail, easy
for people who are otherwise computer-phobic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help _ the Internet is trapped in the PC and someone needs to
let it out,'' said Marcus, the analyst. ``I happen to think that
the TV is going to help bring the Internet to the whole next level,
and bring it to the mass market.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus is a big believer in television because of its ubiquity _
it's in nearly every home, while PCs are in barely half the
nation's homes.
</P>
<P>
   But PC penetration grew by at least 3.5 percent last year, to
48.5 percent of all households, according to Ziff-Davis. David
Card, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York, said PC
growth is encouraging and that PC penetration will increase as
younger people grow up to head their own households.
</P>
<P>
   The ZD Market Intelligence study found that most PCs are in
homes with children. Older people regularly admit that computers
are too hard for them to use.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``I basically am computer-illiterate,'' said Lora Hoffer of
East Harrisburg, Pa., a retired registered nurse. ``I'm 64 years
old and I'm not interested in learning computers. I lived all these
years without them and I think I can survive some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffer's three grown sons bought their parents a WebTV for their
wedding anniversary in 1996, and ``I've been hooked ever since,''
Hoffer said. ``I don't think they should sell a television without
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffer not only keeps in touch with her far-flung family via
e-mail, but when her teenage nephew was diagnosed with a rare form
of cancer, she conducted extensive research on the Internet. She's
also used WebTV's partnership with Internet chat service TalkCity
to open a chat room for eight former nursing classmates scattered
across the country, and now they're planning a reunion for the
first time in 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Marzenda McComb, 63, of Portland, Ore., bought her WebTV when
she embarked on a nine-week, 11,000-mile journey across the country
in a recreational vehicle, visiting friends and relatives. She had
a list of local access numbers that worked everywhere ``except in
little Podunk towns,'' and plugged her box into friends' phone
jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting an 80-year-old cousin in Denver, McComb and her husband
were snowed in for four days. ``My cousin had never had her fingers
on a keyboard in her life, but she so wanted to mail her
grandchildren,'' McComb recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Her cousin wrote a typo-filled e-mail, and typed in, ``Please
forgive my mistakes.'' But McComb told her, ``This is so awesome
that you can do this at all. Apologies are not allowed on WebTV.''
</P>
<P>
   McComb turned her WebTV box over to her cousin and bought
herself a new one, and she's become what her sister calls a
``Web-seeder, because I was doing the Johnny Appleseed with it.''
She bought units for a cousin who receives oxygen and can't leave
his house and for an energy therapist friend who wanted to have
access to a spiritual teacher online, and for other friends as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weaving the Web between our hearts, that's what e-mail
does,'' said Marna McComb, Marzenda's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   McComb is only gingerly stepping off the e-mail onto the
Internet itself. She was searching for airline tickets the other
day and thinks maybe someday she'll look into online investing.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Caldie, 69, of Los Banos (Merced County) said he uses his
WebTV to access the Web all the time, from medical research to
reading the Boston Globe and the Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel. ``The old
guy across the street in back of me has his hooked up to a little
camera on top, and he talks to his daughter in Hawaii, face to
face,'' Caldie said.
</P>
<P>
   WebTV itself continues to add even more features, such as
interactive television links connecting certain shows to special
Web sites, and searchable TV listings. These features are in WebTV
Plus, while the cheaper WebTV Classic offers basic Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what's proving popular with the senior set. ``E-mail
is very important to all of our customers, especially senior
citizens,'' said Bill Keating, WebTV senior vice president of
business development. ``They have the time to write e-mail, and
it's something they're familiar with. They grew up with postal
mail, in the olden days when people actually wrote letters.''
</P>
<P>
   WebTV doesn't go out of its way to court senior citizens,
Keating said. ``Our advertising and marketing programs are very
broad-based,'' he said, although he did note one television
commercial last year featured an old hippie in a retirement home
using WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman, the Palo Alto nonagenarian, received her WebTV when Sony
donated several units and a year's subscription to Lytton Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hyman said, when they heard her age, they balked and
told her to wait. But she called a month later, and they agreed to
give her a unit.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman is a lifelong volunteer. ``I sold Liberty Stamps in World
War I, and bonds in World War II,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's gearing up for her next volunteer project: Sony
recently donated more units to Lytton for use in the common areas
so they can be accessible to all residents. ``I'm going to be one
of the instructors,'' Hyman said.

 CHRON - MP3  
 LIQUID AUDIO TO PUT ITS MARK ON MP3 MUSIC  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Liquid Audio Inc. wants to put its own stamp on a popular Internet
music format called MP3.
</P>
<P>
   The Redwood City company will announce today that it is
spearheading a coalition of music and technology companies that
will offer record labels and artists a way to put a free digital
trademark on music distributed in the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   The Genuine Music Mark, an inaudible code embedded in an
MP3-compressed song, will not by itself prevent Internet music
piracy. But it would give consumers a way to tell whether a song
they download from the Internet is legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives artists the confidence that their music is marked as
their own and gives consumers confidence that music came from the
artist and not bootleggers,'' said Liquid Audio chief executive
Gerry Kearby.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio will unveil the Genuine Music Coalition at the
four-day Midem international music industry conference that began
yesterday in Cannes, France.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio is trying to latch onto the grassroots popularity
of MP3, a format used to compress, store and play CD-quality music
on computer desktops and distribute it over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition includes companies that have already jumped on the
MP3 bandwagon, such as GoodNoise Corp. of Palo Alto; San Jose's
Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc., maker of the Rio portable MP3
player; independent label Platinum Entertainment Inc.; and Nullsoft
Inc., the Arizona startup that makes the popular software called
WinAMP that plays MP3 songs on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio has been unsuccessful pushing its proprietary
Liquid Tracks technology as the standard for digital music
distribution. Liquid Tracks-encoded music can only be played using
Liquid Audio software.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the freely distributed MP3 format has become the de
facto standard, with even Microsoft Corp. making its Media Player
software MP3 compatible. By some accounts, there are about 20,000
MP3-formatted songs available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And the MP3 standard leaped even farther ahead late last year
with the introduction of Diamond's Rio, essentially a Sony Walkman
for MP3 tunes. South Korea's Samsung Electronics this month
unveiled three new MP3 portable players, called Yepp, that also can
record voices and tunes from FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 songs and portable players worried the world's five
biggest record labels enough for them to form an unusual
collaboration to control piracy and standardize how music is
distributed on the Internet in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Liquid Audio is opening technology used for Liquid Tracks
to embrace the MP3 world with a digital ``watermark'' that can be
embedded in a song. The watermarks are electronic certificates of
authenticity that display the artists' name and copyright
information.
</P>
<P>
   The mark can't be copied, but won't prevent songs from being
played on any MP3-compatible software.
</P>
<P>
   Although Liquid Audio won't charge for use of the watermark, the
company hopes to help grow Internet music distribution to the point
where it can generate revenues by selling encrypted songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as another step in the broadening of digital
distribution,'' Kearby said. ``It doesn't mean we have abandoned at
all the concept of security and rights management.''
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Mark Hardie believes Liquid Audio was finally forced
to face the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was interested in Liquid Tracks,'' said Hardie, senior
entertainment industry analyst with Forrester Research of
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a way to add a trademark to MP3 music makes business
sense for Liquid Audio, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity that Liquid Audio has is to take MP3, which is
currently viewed as a rogue format, and bring it into the
mainstream as an approved format,'' Hardie said.

SUN MICRO'S CHIEF SCIENTIST PREPARES TO LET THE JINI OUT OF
THE  BOTTLE
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - SUN   &HT;     By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bill Joy, Sun Microsystems' chief scientist, is to chief executive
Scott McNealy what Merlin was to King Arthur. And today, Sun's
technology wizard will reveal what he hopes will be the next wave
of magic for the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Joy, along with McNealy, will preside over the official
introduction of Jini, a technology designed to let consumer devices
connect easily to networks. With it, a person on the way home from
work theoretically could turn on the lights and the TV, turn up the
heat and start to defrost the chicken, all by sending simple
instructions over a pager, cell phone or handheld computer.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the technology will work its way into
more-businesslike applications, such as letting the user of a
notebook PC connect to a network in an airport business lounge and
immediately have the use of a scanner or printer.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing different kinds of devices to communicate with one
another is seen as the next big goal for the computer industry.
It's a mammoth challenge, given the wide disparity in chips and
software that run computers ranging from handheld digital
assistants to mainframes, as well as a panoply of peripheral
devices such as printers and modems.
</P>
<P>
   Sun of Mountain View isn't the only company on the connectivity
trail. Microsoft is hot on Sun's heels with Universal Plug and
Play. Also in the game are Lucent Technologies, the big
telecommunications supplier, and a consortium that includes
electronics giants Philips and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   But Sun seems to have a head start, thanks largely to Joy, who
has spent the past four years conjuring up Jini at the Sun Aspen
Smallworks research and development lab in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Joy, 44, is one of four men who co-founded Sun in 1982. But
unlike McNealy, who became the company's high-profile leader, Joy
preferred the ivory tower atmosphere that he had enjoyed while
tinkering with Unix at the University of California at Berkeley.
(The software he developed there as a grad student became Sun's
Solaris operating system, which runs the company's powerful
workstations and network servers.)
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; The corporate life was not for Joy. ``For me, it's enjoyable
being part of the creative process in the beginning,'' he said.
``And it's also fun to be in a situation in which only a small
number of people are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Joy has spent most of this decade in Aspen, where he was
instrumental in the development of Java, the Internet programming
language that has made Sun a major Internet player.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Java lets developers write programs that can be run on
computers regardless of their operating systems. It has been key to
bringing animation and interactivity to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Jini is an extension of Java and works with it to enable
networks to open themselves up to small devices. Here's how Jini
works: When you connect a Jini-enabled device to a Java-enabled
network, the device announces itself to the network, which places
the capabilities of the device on a sort of electronic bulletin
board shared by other devices on the network.
</P>
<P>
   If the device is something like a smart phone, it gets access to
other resources on the network. If the device is something like a
printer, it becomes available to other users on the network.
</P>
<P>
   In December, with Jini nearly complete, Joy emerged from his
wizard's tower to be point man for the new technology. He was named
chief scientist, a largely ceremonial post that he said reflected
``Scott's desire for me to take a more mainstream role in the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   His job now is to explain Jini to the media and persuade other
companies to build it into their devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind that for this to work, Sun needs to have a
tremendous number of partnerships,'' said analyst Tim Bajarin of
San Jose's Creative Strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Sun will introduce a number of agreements with companies who are
hopping on the bandwagon. Already, Cisco Systems has developed a
cable modem for Jini networks, and Quantum plans a Jini-enabled
hard disk. Other companies reportedly interested in Jini include:
IBM, Xerox, Sony and Philips.
</P>
<P>
   The first Jini products are expected to ship sometime this year,
most likely before Microsoft _ which hasn't set a date yet _ debuts
its universal connection system. Nevertheless, analysts say Sun
will quickly face competition from Microsoft, Lucent and others.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  ``You've got all these different efforts, so there's going
to be another one of these battles over standards and protocols,''
said Fran Firth, senior analyst for Cahners In-Stat Group in
Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft and Sun bring key advantages to the fray. Because
most of the world uses Windows, Microsoft already has the network
end of the equation wrapped up. All it needs is to persuade
companies to put its software in the devices that connect to the
network.
</P>
<P>
   Sun has a similar edge in that Java has become nearly as
pervasive as Windows. Even Microsoft uses it. Sun also may hold an
advantage over Microsoft because Jini software code is very small
and can easily fit into a handheld device. Microsoft could have
difficulty creating a similarly small solution based on Windows CE,
its operating system for small devices.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is whether Jini can generate significant
revenue for Sun _ something Java has not done because Sun doesn't
charge royalties for licensing it.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; As with Java, Jini technology will be available for free to
developers, with the hope that it will find its way into lots of
devices. Sun will require, however, that Jini versions made by
other companies be compliant with a standard set by Sun, thus
ensuring that any Jini device can work with any other one.
</P>
<P>
   Sun has made the same compatibility demand for Java, and even
sued Microsoft when it decided to develop an altered version of the
software that Sun claimed worked best on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from Jini could come primarily from trademark fees that
companies will have to pay on products carrying the Jini logo.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself probably won't result in much revenue. Rather,
Sun hopes to make money off Jini devices that it will make, either
by itself or with partners.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts like what they've seen so far about Jini, but
nobody's ready to call it a slam dunk in the market. The one thing
that is certain is that Joy is putting his reputation on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this works and gets adopted, he's a hero,'' said analyst
Van Baker of Dataquest. ``If not, it's just another wild-ass
scheme.''

INFOMERCIALS SLOP OVER TO THE NET  &HT;     BY JON SWARTZ
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - THE NET FILES   &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the online invasion of the infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace is being overrun by the companies behind those cheesy
late-night TV ads promoting everything from instant riches through
the sale of tiny classified ads to instant hair in an aerosol can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stuff is perfect for the Internet,'' said Ron Popeil, the
dean of infomercials and founder of Ronco Inc. _ the folks who
brought you the Veg-O-Matic slice-and-dice machine and the Electric
Food Dehydrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medium is an extension of television, except on a computer
you can order products easily and view them anytime you want,'' he
said. The Chatsworth company plans to redesign its Web site
( &LR; www.ronco.com &LR; ) and add video within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Steep media rates, a bevy of TV channels and the rapid emergence
of electronic commerce as an economic engine have prompted the
makers of infomercials to expand onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Many consider Web sites an interactive extension of
television that will revolutionize the way they display and
distribute products to some 100 million cybersurfers worldwide at
any hour of the day.
</P>
<P>
   How are they different from more traditional merchants like
General Mills and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, who also are creating Web
sites? The infomercial folks envision using their TV spots as a
means to funnel consumers to their Web sites. There, consumers will
be able to click on video clips of their favorite products _
whether on their personal computer or set-top TV Internet appliance
_ and order them instantly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``If we can convince someone to watch a half-hour show about
an exercise machine and then buy it, we can use TV to drive people
to our Web site,'' said Bruce Goodman, executive vice president at
National Media Corp., the Los Angeles production company behind
fitness guru Susan Powter and the Red Devil portable grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net gives us another option to reach our customers, it
increases visibility, the credit-card environment is pretty secure,
and the infrastructure costs are cheap,'' said Rod Rice, chief
financial officer of Direct Focus. The Vancouver, Wash., maker of
the Bowflex Fitness Machine ( &LR; www.bowflex.com &LR; ) started taking
orders online last month.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the online world is becoming a media mecca for
the shrill-voiced barkers who offer you goofy gadgets and
too-good-to-be-true financial teases.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the digital onslaught is National Media
( &LR; www.broadcast.com/shopping, www.quantumtv.com &LR;  and
 &LR; www.e4l.com &LR; ), which is providing Webcasts of its 30-minute TV
infomercials and soon will offer 10 Web channels &UR;  &LR; of continuous
sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent TV spot, sitcom ``moms'' Florence Henderson (``The
Brady Bunch''), Marion Ross (``Happy Days'') and Shirley Jones
(``The Partridge Family'') plug National's E4L Web site, which
offers some 800,000 name-brand products.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Still, all of the infomercial players will continue to rely
on the boob tube as their bread-and-butter means of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really beats television and the telephone in terms of
user reach and satisfaction,'' said Steve Dworman, publisher of
Infomercial Marketing Report in West Los Angeles. ``It will take a
while before the Internet replaces TV.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHITHER LYCOS &QL; 
Now that Excite, one of the largest Internet media companies, has
been snapped up by AtHome in a $6.7 billion acquisition, who's
next? Evidently, arch competitor Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen companies _ including CBS, Time Warner and Microsoft _
are eyeing Lycos for a possible takeover or investment, sources
said. In fact, Lycos and AtHome, which offers high-speed Internet
access through cable TV lines, held informal discussions before
AtHome merged with Excite, the same sources said. German book
publisher Bertelsmann AG _ which owns half of Barnesandnoble.com
and already has a $10 million, three-year marketing agreement with
Lycos _ also was rumored to be considering investing as much as $1
billion in the company. A Bertelsmann spokeswoman had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The AtHome-Excite ``deal helps the portal industry,'' said Jan
Horsfall, Lycos vice president of marketing. ``It illustrates the
sense of urgency of larger companies looking for partnerships in
the Internet market.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CASTING CALL &QL; 
High-tech billionaire Larry Ellison's harrowing adventures in a
deadly Australian yacht race last month probably will get the
silver screen treatment. After all, Hollywood loves a
larger-than-life story. So who should portray Oracle's
swashbuckling leader? A random query of co-workers produced the
following candidates: William Shatner (?!), Harrison Ford, Kevin
Costner, Warren Beatty, Jeff Bridges, James Woods and William Hurt.
If you think you're a better casting director, send me a note at
 &LR; jswartz &LR; sfgate.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Oracle had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT IS HIP?: &QL; 
The new Internet search tool on the block is a combination of older
search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? It's really quite simple. GoHip ( &LR; www.gohip.com &LR; ) is a
supersite that combines the search engines of Yahoo, Excite,
Infoseek, Alta Vista, Lycos, HotBot and others. Once you type in
``Abraham Lincoln,'' for example, the site posts the top-10 search
results from each individual engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as nine search engines in one,'' said Rob Walter,
vice president of the Beverly Hills company. ``You don't have to
perform a search under Alta Vista, then Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called metasearching site is free.
</P>
<P>
   ALIEN NATION: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK. Enough already. Uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Please, no more correspondence about Internet pioneer Joe
Firmage and his belief in extraterrestrials
( &LR; www.thewordistruth.org &LR; ). Reader reaction has read like a
sociology study. Those who consider him a visionary tend to be
doctors, scientists and other professionals, while Firmage's
detractors are distinctly blue collar. Both sides may have a point.

 CHRON - MARKETING  
 Retailers Waking Up to Web's Potential  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
For five years, the Internet Threat has inspired fear and loathing
among brick-and-mortar retailers. Independent bookstores are
blaming online booksellers as they shut their doors, and a growing
share of consumer spending is shifting to the digital realm.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no denying that the Web is hurting some
real-world merchants, to leave it at that is to ignore the baby
splashing around in the bath water. Retailers are just beginning to
see the potential for bolstering sales at their physical stores by
using the Web to increase traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers have viewed the Net in a confrontational way,'' said
Scott Young, senior vice president of operations at Vicinity, a
Palo Alto firm that helps conventional merchants take advantage of
the Web. ``I think they are waking up and figuring out how to use
the Web to increase sales, decrease costs and improve their
customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Riordan, the head of Deloitte &AMP; Touche's retail consulting
practice in San Francisco, puts the Web's marketing power on par
with computerized inventory tracking, which revolutionized
retailing in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bigger than computerized point-of-sale because it
touches more parts of the business,'' said Riordan. ``Like the
telephone, the Web touches everything, although I think we're just
at the beginning of understanding what it can do.''
</P>
<P>
   By now almost every big retailer with a pulse has put up a Web
site with a store-locator map, moving a basic Yellow Pages function
to the Web. But some are developing far more sophisticated Web
marketing techniques. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _Barnes &AMP; Noble  &LR; (www.barnesandnoble.com)  &LR; mines its database of
registered Web users and e-mails them about new B&AMP;N stores opening
near their homes. The e-mail message includes a cordial note from
the store manager, driving directions, a map, hours of operation
and a 20-percent-off coupon redeemable only in that store.
</P>
<P>
   _Car dealers use the Web site AutoConnect
 &LR; (www.autoconnect.com) &LR;  to tell potential customers what they have
in stock. Surfers can plug in their home address and get a list of
showrooms within, say, 30 miles that have a used Acura Legend in
stock for under $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   _Kinko's  &LR; (www.kinkos.com)  &LR; is attracting more business with its
Internet services, said Rick Davis, vice president, product
management. Kinko's, which is installing T-1 lines in every shop,
lets customers e-mail documents from their home or office to any
Kinko's in the world. A Palo Alto businesswoman can e-mail her
presentation to a Kinko's in New York or Tokyo and pick up the
paper copies at the shop when she arrives.
</P>
<P>
   _Kmart &LR;  (www.kmart.com)  &LR; is using the Web as a couponing center
_ it has had 87,000 Web coupons clipped in one month. Like Kids R
Us, J.C. Penney and other chains, Kmart keeps a stock of coupons at
CoolSavings.com. Rather than waiting for discounts to be announced
in a newspaper, CoolSavings' 1.8 million registered members can
print out scannable coupons whenever they feel like going shopping.
</P>
<P>
   _Frederick's of Hollywood and other mail-order merchants are
using the Web to increase distribution of their catalogs. In the
past three years, surfers have ordered between 3 million and 3.5
million paper catalogs from CatalogLink  &LR; (www.cataloglink.com) &LR;  of
Greenwich, Ct., one of several catalog clearinghouses on the
Internet. When given the choice between receiving a catalog through
the mail or linking to a cataloger's Web site, 50 percent more
people asked for the paper catalog.
</P>
<P>
   _Vicinity's customers _ who include Pizza Hut, Levi Strauss &AMP;
Co. and Ford _ are using the Web to identify regional or
demographic differences in consumer preferences. For example,
Vicinity's software tracks the home addresses of surfers who
download coupons for different products. That can flag a sandwich
chain, for example, to promote grilled chicken at one store and
cheese steak in another.
</P>
<P>
   _Chuck E. Cheese &LR;  (www.chuckecheese.com) &LR;  is using e-mail to
persuade disgruntled customers to give the restaurant another
chance. While an unhappy mom might not bother to mail a letter if
her kid's birthday party doesn't go off as planned, it's relatively
easy for her to bang out an e-mail, and for Chuck E. Cheese to
respond quickly with a conciliatory letter and discount coupon.
</P>
<P>
   These examples show the promise of the Web as a tool for
merchants who are savvy enough to use it in creative ways.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, of course, its impact is currently small
because Web use remains relatively limited.
</P>
<P>
   A Barnes &AMP; Noble that opened recently in Valley Forge, Pa., for
example, attracted many more customers with direct-mail coupons
than Web coupons because relatively few locals had signed up at
Barnesandnoble.com, said Mary Ann Norris, the store manager.
</P>
<P>
   One or two shoppers each day brought in the e-mailed coupons
during the monthlong grand opening, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that some retailers are finding that Web
promotions reach new customers, not just the same people through a
different medium.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck E. Cheese has found that redemption of its direct-mail
coupons has grown since the company introduced Web promotions, so
the Web-related traffic ``appears to be incremental,'' said Jon
Rice, vice president of marketing for the Irving, Texas, chain.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is expanding Kmart's market in the very desirable
direction of higher-income Americans who own computers. ``Hopefully
the offers are compelling enough to create new customers for
Kmart,'' said John Jeanmonod, merchandising manager for Kmart's
Internet division.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage of Web coupons is that they are cheaper than
direct mail. Steven Golden, chief executive of Chicago's
CoolSavings, said each Web coupon costs about one cent to deliver,
which works out to $10 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the expense of paper, postage and mailing lists
pushes direct-mail coupon costs to a minimum of $40 to $100 per
1,000 mailings, said Myron Gould, a New York University professor
who runs his own Web promotions company.
</P>
<P>
   Web couponing, which Chuck E. Cheese implements through
CoolSavings, is ``more efficient'' than paper promotions, but
``ultimately what we have to do is reach a mass market,'' said
Rice. ``CoolSavings has to continue to grow (their customer base)
for it to really be a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden said his company is doing just that. CoolSavings is
developing Web couponing programs for supermarkets that can be used
in combination with their membership cards. The company also plans
to add promotions for independent local merchants, chain drugstores
and mall stores.
</P>
<P>
   Vicinity, too, is growing; it is in talks with a Web portal to
provide an ambitiously broad product-search mechanism called
GeoSearch. The service will be similar to that offered by
AutoConnect, but will allow shoppers to find stores near them that
sell a wide range of products and brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will help people find the local place to buy, which is
how most people will always shop,'' said Vicinity's Young. ``All
we're talking about is giving stores a better way'' to reach
customers.

 CHRON - AUCTION  
 Retailers See Profit in Online Auctions  &HT;     By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the clearance sale. Mainstream retailers soon could be
using online auctions to unload excess goods, according to a report
being released today.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers now can buy computer hardware, consumer electronics
and even airline tickets on auction at places like Onsale.com and
Priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   But the report, by Jupiter Communications, predicts that there
soon will be a lot more consumer goods _ from sweaters to software
_ as more traditional retailers capitalize on the popularity of
Internet auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auctions on retail sites should be the online platform for
traditional clearance pricing and discounting,'' said Nicole
Vanderbilt, senior analyst at Jupiter and the author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1.2 million U.S. consumers purchased $461 million worth of
goods from online business-to-consumer auctions last year, Jupiter
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The New York research firm said that figure could grow to more
than 6.5 million online purchasers spending $3.2 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt says retailers can use Internet auctions not just for
clearance sales, but to build excitement about new or scarce goods
_ such as the forthcoming Palm VII digital assistant or a special
bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Ideal for auctions are items that have a limited life, such as
seasonal clothing, software and some perishables, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides selling the goods, merchants can get the added benefits
of attracting more visitors to their Web sites and keeping visitors
on the site longer.
</P>
<P>
   A few existing Web auctioneers already have branched out into
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Onsale.com now is selling watches, furniture and golf clubs in
addition to the computer products that were its mainstay.
Egghead.com launched Egghead Auctions which, in addition to
software, is offering precious gems and Barbie dolls.

OFFICE BOOM SPUTTERS IN POPULAR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Planned at the peak of the boom in new-office
construction projects in the Los Angeles-adjacent cities of Burbank
and Glendale, the J.H. Snyder project in Burbank's Media District
seemed a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   Located at ground zero in the shadow of NBC Studios, Warner
Bros. and Disney, in spring 1997 the 585,000-square-foot office
building project was considered a hot property in an area with the
lowest office vacancy rate in the county -- an unheard of 4.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Just less than a year ago Snyder held a groundbreaking ceremony,
but can't-miss has turned to never-happened -- and the office-space
bubble has burst at least for the moment in both Burbank and
Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the slowdown is decisions by studios and networks
to cut back on their development plans to bring costs into line and
increasing caution in the retail market about how long the nation's
economic boom can last.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lenders are increasingly wary, insisting that
developers prelease before starting construction and rejecting
speculative proposals. The Westside has also emerged as a
formidable competitor with 700,000 new square feet of office space
now in development in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   For Burbank and Glendale, those decisions have meant their days
as the economic promised land are over, at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of hype with a lot of big expectations with
everyone thinking there was going to be this great boom. What we've
found instead is slow growth,'' said Bob Tague, director of
community development for Burbank. ``I think they all thought the
studios would take big chunks of their projects.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In Burbank, construction on the Snyder project never started,
and today partner Cliff Goldstein says the developers are looking
for a new financing partner because the site's current owner,
Equity Office Properties, wants out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equity has in certain ways asked us to find another partner,''
Goldstein said. ``We're hoping to find a new financial partner.''
</P>
<P>
   The project was the start of a trend, and now several
developments in Burbank have faced setbacks in the past few
months. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In December, Vestar Development dropped its plan to buy the old
Lockheed B-1 site for a new retail and office center. In August,
Ford Motor Co. dropped a deal for a new automobile superstore along
the Golden State Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale's bullish development market is also slowing down.
</P>
<P>
   According to city officials, Maguire Thomas Partners has cut its
proposed office complex by 350,000 square feet. Maguire Thomas,
which is seeking to prelease, and the developers of City Center 2
both have delayed the start of construction, &UR;  &LR; and the Howard Platz
Group has downsized its latest Brand Boulevard office project from
20 &UR;  &LR; stories to nine.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, developers, real estate professionals and
economic development experts were talking about the Burbank and
Glendale boom as if there was no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a seemingly unlimited increase in demand for office
space from the entertainment industry, developers announced
simultaneously in 1997 that they were moving forward with plans to
build more than 3 million new square feet of commercial space in
the two cities. Ambitious retail projects were also touted. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Jeanne Armstrong, director of development for Glendale, said
developers got overly optimistic about the area's short-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area couldn't have accommodated all the growth that was
being talked about all at once. The entertainment industry was
expanding so quickly that it gave rise to the feeling that it was
limitless,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved with the Burbank-Glendale market say a variety of
forces have changed the outlook here from overeager to cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a discrepancy between the bullishness of
the market two years ago and today's current market situation. The
entertainment industry demand had disappeared for now,'' said Bill
Boyd, senior vice president at Grubb &AMP; Ellis. ``Not only is there
no demand from entertainment companies for high-rise office space,
they've put some of their own space on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is a perfect example.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ground zero. It's the best site in L.A. County, but
unfortunately, the entertainment industry doesn't require space
right now,'' Boyd said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Developers in the area were also hoping entertainment companies
would pay higher rents, he said. Now they are faced with renting to
traditional Glendale tenants like insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the absence of the entertainment community, the
historical tenants have resisted those rents,'' Boyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Tague, Burbank's development director, said that two years ago,
Snyder was in the best position in Burbank, while few had much
faith in developer M. David Paul's plans to build as much as
600,000 square feet near Burbank Airport, rather than near the
studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``That project has been the real success story. It's a project
everyone thought wouldn't happen because it's by the airport,''
Tague said.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul has so far built 400,000 square feet and has it all
leased out, including 200,000 square feet to Disney. He's planning
a third 250,000-square-foot phase, Tague said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul has been successful because he built his project in phases,
rather than all at once, and because the rents he is asking,
between $24 and $26 per square foot, are at a rate tenants are
willing to pay. ``I would recommend they build their projects in
small, bite-size pieces,'' Tague said.
</P>
<P>
   The Snyder project is struggling because property is so
expensive in the Media District, Tague said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is not prepared to pay an extra $3.50 per square
foot. It's too expensive,'' Tague said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd agreed, saying developers had hoped to get more than $30 a
square foot, but the market today is demanding rates in the mid- to
high 20s instead.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: demanding rates in the mid- to high 20s instead.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's Goldstein said the developers are still confident they
will be able to start construction soon. He blames the delays on a
disruptive change in partners since 1997. Equity Office Properties
bought out J.H. Snyder's original partner in the project, and now
Equity Office wants out of the deal, Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a tenant situation. We still think the market is
strong,'' Goldstein said. ``We still have interest from tenants
weekly or every two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged that the entertainment industry slowdown
on growth has had an effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say the industry is not growing at the pace it
was, which was a fairly mind-boggling pace,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, Glendale's director of development, said that while
PacTen Partners was able to build its 24-story office tower on
Brand Boulevard without any tenant commitments, lenders are now
requiring that at least 50 percent of a building be preleased
before they break ground.
</P>
<P>
   Tague said one of the biggest indicators of the entertainment
industry slowdown is that Warner Bros. and NBC have done little
building since receiving approval for their master plan expansions
just a few years ago. Both companies were eager to get their
expansions approved, saying they needed new space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected them to move a little faster,'' Tague said.
</P>
<P>
   So did Jack O'Neill, vice president of facilities at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was going like gangbusters two years ago. The demand
for space two years ago simply isn't here today,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said the retrenchment can be traced to a desire by the
studios and networks to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost is now the major mantra of everyone. It's a major concern
to the networks,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   While the studio is not building any of the office towers it
received approval for, NBC is building six desperately needed new
sound stages. O'Neill said he expects the demand for production
facilities to continue to escalate because of the needs of the five
networks and cable producers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, PacTen Partners announced it had leased six of its 24
floors to State Compensation Insurance Fund, a private insurance
company that deals with state worker's compensation claims.
Construction is slated to be finished in March for PacTen, which
unlike some others decided to build on a speculative basis rather
than preleasing. Pete Hillman, a partner in PacTen, said the
Snyder, Maguire Thomas and City Center 2 projects will not start
building at least until his building is full.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else is building anything until this building is
leased,'' Hillman said. ``You won't see anyone else get out of the
ground.'
</P>
<P>
   While Burbank and Glendale may not be booming any more, city
officials point to several promising projects still in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale is &UR;  &LR; enjoying the success of the new outdoor-retail
mall, the Glendale Marketplace, and city officials are hoping to
see the latest addition to the Galleria, an open-air shopping area
called Town Center, scheduled to open in spring 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard Platz group just finished construction on a
nine-story office tower on Brand Boulevard which it has leased to
Cigna and the Verdugo Banking Co. It is slated to build another
building on Brand this year, although the company has downsized the
project from 20 to nine stories.
</P>
<P>
   In Burbank, Regent Properties is planning a 468,000-square-foot
hotel, office and retail complex at the home of the old Burbank
police headquarters and a new complex of movie theaters is in the
works downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two cities still have the lowest office vacancy
rates in the county, Burbank at 6 percent and Glendale at 6.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the promised land,'' Tague insisted.

OFFENSIVE PRACTICES PAYING OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The sequence began with UCLA patiently moving the
ball around the perimeter. It eventually landed in JaRon Rush's
hands in the right corner. He dribbled along the 3-point line to
the top of the key, then prepared to make a pass to Baron Davis on
the left wing _ just as the play was scripted.
</P>
<P>
   At the last second, Davis sensed a defensive overplay _
Louisville had been challenging the passing lanes all game _ and he
darted past his unsuspecting defender towards the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Rush threw a perfect bounce pass to Davis, whose catch and dunk
finalized what might be the best play UCLA has run all season _
something out of Princeton's playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing what a little practice can do.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, perhaps stung by the late-game breakdowns against
Stanford, the Bruins emphasized offense. Coach Steve Lavin and his
assistants spent large portions of practice Tuesday, Wednesday and
Friday on what he calls ``the universals'' _ ball movement, man
movement, screens, unselfishness and patience _ the principles used
to attack both zone and man-to-man defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Lavin directed the Bruins through a 2{-hour workout,
uncharacteristically long for the eve of a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we needed it,'' he said. ``We continued to work on
halfcourt execution.''
</P>
<P>
   The results were immediate and irrefutable. In defeating USC and
Louisville, the Bruins scored 180 points, shot 50.7 percent from
the field and arguably played their best offensive games of the
season. The second half against Louisville was a model of poise and
precision: 19 of their 22 field goals were dunks, tips or layups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday's practice was a big-time help,'' Rush said. ``The
coaches stressed defense in the beginning of the season. Now
they're stressing a lot of offense. We're fine-tuning.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin's practice schedule changes dramatically through the
season. In October, November and December, he emphasizes fullcourt
drills that improve UCLA's conditioning and establish fast-break
execution. Workouts often last more than three hours, causing
exhaustion and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   But in the heart of Pac-10 play, with the demanding
Thursday-Saturday schedule, Lavin reduces the length and difficulty
of his practices like a swimmer tapering for a race. The Bruins are
in shape, he figures, so the emphasis turns to halfcourt offense
and defense and fine-tuning to repair whatever glitches arise.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, there was no practice Sunday or Monday.
The schedule seemed light, especially given the rare Wednesday game
at USC. But Lavin is more concerned with another universal _ that
freshmen, unaccustomed to the length of a college schedule, hit a
mental and physical wall in February.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens to Rush, Dan Gadzuric, Jerome Moiso, Ray Young
and Matt Barnes _ five of the top nine players _ the Bruins are
doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin plans to err on the light side: Keep the players fresh
with fewer (and easier) practices down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, it's a risk. Many of UCLA's worst games have followed
light practices: Washington and Miami last year, Arizona State and
Oregon State this year. Meanwhile, the Bruins' best performances
often follow strenuous workouts: Michigan last year, Oregon and
Louisville this year, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lavin seemed to find the right medium _ mixing light
but productive practices and emphasizing the primary deficiency:
halfcourt offense. The results were palpable and significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Last) week, maybe there was more emphasis on offense,'' said
assistant Steve Spencer, who oversees the opponent scouting. ``The
guys are seeing we can be successful there, that the offense will
work when they execute it with discipline.''

GRETZKY KEEPS WHAT MAY BE HIS LAST ALL-STAR MVP TROPHY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Wayne Gretzky has never driven any of the numerous
cars he has won over the course of his two-decade career in the
National Hockey League. But he said he was going to keep the sport
utility vehicle that was given to him Sunday for being named the
most valuable player of the 49th annual All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   This season and this all-star game, could be the Great One's
last. And the shiny new vehicle is something by which to remember
his sparkling 3-point performance _ a goal and two assists _ in
North America's 8-6 victory over the World at the Ice Palace Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the exact number I've been fortunate to win,''
said Gretzky, though he estimated he had been given 16 or 17.
``I've never kept one car. But I'm going to keep this one; it's
like a trophy to me. After 20 years, this is the one thing I want
to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who is the NHL's career scoring leader and was playing
in his 18th consecutive All-Star game, can still dominate
occasionally, but his body aches. His stride is not so effortless
anymore. His hands aren't what they used to be. Recently it's
become obvious that a great career is nearing its end. The 20,000
fans here recognized that, greeting him with a standing ovation
during the player introductions.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who will be 38 years old Tuesday, said at the weekend
that thoughts of retiring had crossed his mind. ``At the end of the
year I'll sit down and decide what I'm going to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who leads the Rangers with 43 points on 7 goals and 36
assists this season, centered Sunday for Theoren Fleury of the
Calgary Flames and Mark Recchi of the Montreal Canadiens. The
Fleury-Gretzky-Recchi line was the most productive combination of
the game, racking up 7 points.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Pavel Bure go from Vancouver to the Florida
Panthers, the Rangers' sights are now fixed on getting either
Fleury or Recchi, hoping that the addition of a bona fide scorer
might spark a second half surge into the postseason. Both Fleury
and Recchi are free agents at the season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they told me what the line was,'' Gretzky said. ``I said
they were really smart coaches because Theoren and I and Recchi had
played together in the past. I was lucky because I got to play with
two unselfish guys. That's what separates stars from superstars.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would like to see either Fleury or Recchi come to
the Rangers, Gretzky said: ``I'd like to get both. Is that too
greedy? I talked to those guys yesterday for a little bit, and
hopefully it works out for them. But if they can't stay where they
are, we'll take them in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about Jordan leaving,'' said the Dallas Stars' Ken
Hitchcock, who was the head coach of the North America team. ``But
when Gretzky leaves the game there is going to be a big hole. He's
what this game is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gretzky is not just a good athlete,'' Hitchcock added. ``He's
a part of the fabric of the game. He's the way you want your kids
to be, and the way you want adults to behave.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the second All-Star game to pit the North Americans vs.
the World. The new format made its debut last year in Vancouver,
resulting in the most spirited All-Star game in recent memory, an
8-7 come-from-behind victory for the World Team.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a natural rivalry that already existed within the NHL,
the new format has players defending and even throwing an
occasional body check, if it means the difference between winning
and losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little pride factor involved now,'' said Fleury, the
Flames' wing who is from Canada. ``Everybody says that the European
guys are more skilled than we are. But I don't agree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to lose because you want to prove that your side
produces the best hockey players in the world,'' said Tony Amonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``This format has some real merit to it if they stick with it,''
said Hitchcock. ``It's too bad we can't send this to Europe and
give them a home game.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Americans had a 4-1 lead after the first period on
goals by Mike Modano, Luc Robitaille, Paul Kariya and Mark Recchi.
Marco Sturm was the only World player to beat the Devils' Martin
Brodeur, who made eight saves. Dominik Hasek made 15 stops for the
World team.
</P>
<P>
   The North Americans extended their lead to 7-4 in the second
period on goals by Ray Bourque, Gretzky and Rob Blake. The World
All-Stars threatened in the third period, closing to 7-5 on a goal
by Mats Sundin. But a goal by Darryl Sydor at 2:53 and the
outstanding goaltending of Ed Belfour (12 saves) ended the World
Team's chance of a comeback.

POPE'S CALL FOR OUTREACH TO RICH STIRS COMMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON AND DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ At about the same time that Pope John Paul II gave
a final blessing at an outdoor Mass for 1 million people at a
racetrack Sunday afternoon, the Rev. Fernando Escobar sprinkled
holy water and blessed a taxi, two buses, and a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Such practices are common for Escobar at ``La Lupita,'' a
humble, triangular church in a poor and cramped neighborhood at the
southern edge of this city. It is just one of the many ways that
the church reaches out to the faithful, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done enough for our poor to bring them closer to
God,'' Escobar added. ``And now we have been given another vital
mission to touch those who are rich.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new vision for the church in the Americas that he
delivered on Saturday, the pope reminded Roman Catholics of the
importance of comforting poor and marginalized members, many of
whom have left the church and become Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   But the pontiff added an unexpected twist to his message by
calling for more outreach to wealthy people who have been lost
because of the church's emphasis on the poor or because they have
turned to a more secular lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy may fit in traditional, free-market countries
like the United States and Canada, but it is just beginning to take
hold in Latin America, where the gap between rich and poor has
widened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's been very concerned that the church has focused so
much on one class in society that it has undermined the mission of
the church to preach to everyone,'' Brian Smith, a professor of
religion at Ripon College in Wisconsin, said by telephone. ``The
church is for all, no matter who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Extending the church's evangelical net to include more of
society's movers and shakers is a sharp turn away from the leftist
political activism known as liberation theology that has been
heavily used by bishops, priests, and nuns here over the past two
decades. Although the Polish-born pope strongly opposed the
theology's Marxist principles, he embraced its emphasis on fighting
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1990s, more Latin American countries have turned
toward democracy and neoliberal economic policies. The pontiff now
has said it is time for the church to pay greater attention to the
powerful in Latin society, explaining that they need to be taught
Catholic values of generosity and self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   The document lays out the philosophy of the new mission for the
church for the next millennium, but does not offer specific
strategies. In it, the pope refers to neoliberal economies as
man-made concepts that consider ``profit and the law of the market
as its only parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Many theologians and priests agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be a vital goal for us to bring together
those who have with those who need,'' Escobar said, leaning against
one of the wooden benches that are used as pews in his church.
``But for some of us it will mean changing the way we have become
accustomed to reaching out to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto Terrazas, a 27-year-old parishioner at La Lupita, makes
roughly $5 a day as a driver for a family in the affluent Mexico
City neighborhood of San Angel. Though he accepts the pope's call
for a church that invites members of all backgrounds, he does not
want the church to go back to the days when it was viewed as part
of the wealthy and corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go to the same church as people in San Angel,''
Terrazas said while holding his 8-month-old son, Armando. ``I can't
imagine being in the same Mass with them, but I have faith in that
we can become more united.''
</P>
<P>
   Although economies have grown across the hemisphere throughout
the last decade, so has the number of poor. In Mexico, for example,
roughly 40 percent of residents live in poverty. Many Latin
American missionary specialists warn that more than half of Latin
America's population could fall into poverty in the next 10 years
unless dramatic steps are taken.
</P>
<P>
   In his homily Sunday, the pope decried the unjust economic and
social conditions in Mexico in a thinly veiled criticism of the
country's political and business leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Experts like Smith see a more practical reason for the church to
reach out to the affluent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the life of the poor is going to improve, it's the people
with wealth and political power who have to develop a social
conscience, and it's the church's role to do that,'' he said. ``I
think that's a very smart position to take. If the church's social
justice goals are to be realized, then the church has to work with
the rich.''

<P>
   They told this joke in Denver in the late 1980s:
</P>
<P>
   A man dies and goes to heaven, where he is told that heaven has
all the happy pursuits of his former life, including football.
</P>
<P>
   Taken to heaven's football field, the man notices that the
players are wearing letters on their jerseys _ HB, LB and WR _
instead of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They signify a player's position,'' the man is told. ``You
know, `HB' is for halfback, `LB' for linebacker, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's `JE'? '' the man asks, pointing to another player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's God,'' the man is told. ``He thinks he's John
Elway.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen years later, and a year after his only Super Bowl
championship, the pro football community and the Rocky Mountain
region are hesitantly, if giddily, approaching something new _ the
inevitable mortality of John Elway, football player.
</P>
<P>
   It is a celebration of a landmark career, and though Elway's
retirement is not yet official, it is fitting that he is being
celebrated on pro football's grandest stage, the Super Bowl, which
is only proper given the lifelong stage presence of Sunday's guest
of honor.
</P>
<P>
   At 38, Elway is no longer the lissome, playful,
all-things-are-possible pup of a quarterback who dashed into his
first Super Bowl with the Broncos 12 years ago, but he is no less
the star as he starts his fifth Super Bowl, a record for a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   He is a national icon, and simultaneously a peerless symbol for
Denver's expansive growth as a western capital these last two
decades. He is as famous for his accomplishments as he is for his
successive Super Bowl failures. He was embraced for his stoicism in
defeat as much as for the unfettered ebullience he showed in
victory a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a part of the American sports theater for so long
that he is one of our most easily recognized athletes _ adored in
Denver, respected in 30 other National Football League cities,
filled with talent and yet admired for effort.
</P>
<P>
   And now, by most accounts, he is playing his last game in one of
the biggest games of his career: Super Bowl XXXIII, where the
Broncos will face the Atlanta Falcons in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost wish I could step back and watch John play this game
myself,'' Shannon Sharpe, Denver's glib tight end, said last week.
``Take pictures, soak it in. It's history. Because no quarterback
will play exactly like him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver's offensive coordinator, Gary Kubiak, came into the NFL
with Elway in 1983 and has gone from being his backup to his
roommate to his coach. Sixteen years of observation have afforded
Kubiak a wealth of Elway perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's career is not a simple, easy success story,'' Kubiak
said . ``It's a long story, with enormous highs and tough times,
too. He stuck it out. And not everyone would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe said: ``He showed everybody. People learned _ you don't
tug on Superman's cape and you don't mess with John Elway.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway's wild, gaudy, record-setting career has evolved for
nearly a quarter-century, dating to 1977, when he was the country's
most heavily recruited high school quarterback. He is one of those
modern athletic stars whose time in the spotlight dates to his
adolescence. If he walks a bit like John Wayne, maybe it's because
he has lived with a movie star's celebrity since he was 16.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Washington state but raised in the Los Angeles area,
Elway is the son of Jack Elway, the Denver Broncos' director of pro
scouting and former coach at San Jose State and Stanford. Offered
college scholarships throughout the land, Elway chose Stanford just
as his father was beginning his career as coach at San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford assistant coach in charge of recruiting Elway was
Jim Fassel, the current New York Giants coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met John, the first thing he wanted to know from me was
how he could get better,'' Fassel said. ``I never met a young
player so eager to make something of himself. That's what we talked
about _ what we could do for him, what he could do for the
university and what he could do for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the minute he stepped on campus, he was like, `When do we
get started?'''
</P>
<P>
   Elway was supposed to lead Stanford to a host of Rose Bowl
titles, perhaps even a national title. None of those things
happened, though he did finish second to Herschel Walker in the
Heisman Trophy balloting as a senior. He set five major National
Collegiate Athletic Association records; he added to his budding
legend.
</P>
<P>
   At Stanford, Elway also met his future wife, Janet.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel remembers Elway's coming to him in his office early in
his senior year, unsettled about his relationship with Janet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like her,'' Elway told Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's the problem?'' Fassel asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so busy, she doesn't have a lot of time for me,'' Elway
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel remembered that later in Elway's senior year, as the star
of the game one afternoon, Elway left the field at the center of a
horde of celebrating fans, teammates and news media members.
</P>
<P>
   Standing with Janet, Fassel watched as Elway glided past, waving
to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was trying to get his attention, calling out, `John,
John,''' Fassel said, laughing. ``John couldn't hear her. I thought
how things were changing. They have a very special relationship.
They've been together for so long and through so much. But John's
life changed a bit on them and there was some adjustment to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford was just a warm-up for his entry into the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The first pick of the 1983 draft was to be made by the Baltimore
Colts. Elway told the Colts not to pick him. Over the years, many
reasons have been proposed, most centering on the Colts' mercurial
coach, Frank Kush, and the team's flighty owner, Robert Irsay.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Accorsi, then the Colts' general manager and the current
Giants general manager, drafted Elway anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if the Colts were good enough for John Unitas, they
were good enough for John Elway,'' Accorsi said recently, recalling
that spring 16 years ago. Accorsi was convinced Elway would sign
with the Colts in time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Colts' ownership was in disarray. Elway threatened to
play major league baseball and launched a brief minor league career
with the Yankees. Privately, Elway made the briefest of overtures
to the Colts, indicating his unease with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Without Accorsi's knowledge, Irsay traded Elway to Denver for
offensive lineman Chris Hinton, the Broncos' No. 1 pick in 1984,
backup quarterback Mark Herrmann and $1 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as the Broncos returned from Pittsburgh with their
fourth American Football Conference title in Elway's time with the
team, Sharpe stood at the front of the chartered jet's cabin and
raised a glass to make a toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to thank the Colts,'' Sharpe said. ``For making
that stupid trade.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If only Elway's debut in the NFL was as winsome.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reeves, Denver's coach in 1983, started Elway, something
Reeves later called ``a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway was benched after two games, though injuries to his
replacement forced him back into the lineup. He finished the year
with the worst quarterback rating in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   The next season his record as a starter was 12-2, and by the end
of the 1986 season he had the Broncos in the Super Bowl, thanks to
a spectacular 98-yard drive that buried the Cleveland Browns in the
AFC championship game. It was the 12th of 45 _ and counting _
fourth-quarter comebacks for Elway in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   He then lost the first of three Super Bowls, this one to the
Giants. Elway played well in defeat, passing for 304 yards, rushing
for a touchdown and passing for another.
</P>
<P>
   He was the league's most valuable player the following season,
which ended with a second consecutive Super Bowl loss for the
Broncos, a 32-point defeat by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 season brought Elway back to the Super Bowl again. This
time he lost by 55-10 to Joe Montana's San Francisco 49ers. Elway
was intercepted twice and threw for just 108 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're never going to forgive me for this,'' Elway said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   After the rout that evening in New Orleans, Elway _ still in
uniform, his eyes glazed _ was being led through the catacombs
beneath the Superdome grandstand when he passed a fan in Broncos
garb.
</P>
<P>
   ``John,'' the man called out. ``What happened? What happened to
you, John?''
</P>
<P>
   It was a question that would haunt Elway. For the next seven
years there were repeated, vexing near-misses in his attempt to get
back to the Super Bowl. He feuded with Reeves, a feud that has
abated but not been forgotten. Dents developed in the Elway armor,
even two losing seasons, and Reeves was dismissed, in essence,
because he could not lead the magical player to a magical season.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, sensing that Elway was drifting, some chipped away at
Elway's wholesome image, faintly dimming the luster of his star.
Elway, once the golden boy, at times seemed to lose the glimmer in
his eye.
</P>
<P>
   But he pressed on. He is not a deeply religious man, though he
has not missed a Sunday morning team prayer service in eight years.
What he does have is a competitor's faith: keep trying and never
stop trying.
</P>
<P>
   After a 3-point loss to Buffalo in the 1991 conference title
game, another near-miss, Elway said: ``I'm not done. I want to go
to the Super Bowl 10 times if that's what it takes. And if it has
to be, I'll get beat 10 times.''
</P>
<P>
   When he did finally return for his fourth Super Bowl last
January, Elway presided uncomfortably over the event. His advancing
age and the grace with which he had faced his professional
adversities had made him a sentimental favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flattering and yet it's embarrassing,'' he said at the
time. ``But I'm at it again. The fun of going to the Super Bowl in
no way compares to the wrath you get for losing one. But if it's
the ultimate loss, I'm going to assume it follows that it's the
ultimate victory.''
</P>
<P>
   When Elway willed the Broncos to victory over the Packers in a
stirring game 12 months ago, those who watched him enjoy the moment
saw a man relishing that ultimate victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is back for another try. Probably the last try.
</P>
<P>
   Elway's tour around Mile High Stadium after the Broncos' defeat
of the Jets in the AFC championship game convinced many who saw it
that they were witnessing a farewell journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was fun,'' Elway said Thursday of his lap around Mile
High. ``It was really the first time since I've been in Denver that
I had a chance to get that close to the fans, to really make eye
contact with them _ to see the joy in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Others watched and saw a connection between a beloved player and
a constituency bent on honoring him. There was a message sent and a
message received.
</P>
<P>
   ``What John did here is, he taught this team and this town about
persistence,'' Kubiak told The Denver Post. ``Because he was close
to winning a Super Bowl so many times. He could have just said,
`It's not going to happen, I've had a good career, I'm going into
the Hall of Fame.' And he could have retired two or three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he had a persistence about him that he was going to get it
done, and he made this team and this city the champions that they
are. He had a commitment to stay. He didn't have to stay. He could
have been like a lot of other guys and said that's enough. But he
kept fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Once young and invincible, jokingly likened to a deity, John
Elway _ football in hand _ appears to be coming to the end of his
long run this week. And while there will be no player with a jersey
marked ``JE'' dashing about the field Sunday night, there will be a
familiar No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In the last Super Bowl of this century, everyone watching the
game will identify.

   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors questioned Monica S. Lewinsky for
the first time Sunday, as a divided Senate surged toward a showdown
Monday amid signs that President Clinton's impeachment trial could
end as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   With their case against Clinton in jeopardy, three House
impeachment managers, accompanied by prosecutors for the
independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, interviewed Lewinsky for
nearly two hours in a Washington hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   The session, arranged after a federal judge compelled Lewinsky
to appear, unfolded on the eve of the Senate's scheduled debates
Monday on whether to dismiss the two articles of impeachment
against Clinton and whether to launch a witness phase of the
historic proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying Lewinsky as ``a very personable and impressive young
woman,'' Representative Bill McCollum, Republican of Florida, said
after the interview, ``We found that she might be a very helpful
witness to the Senate if she is called.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Lewinsky's lawyer, Plato Cacheris, disagreed
about the potential value of her testimony. Describing Lewinsky,
25, as having been ``candid, forthright, and extremely truthful''
during the session, Cacheris said: ``She added nothing to the
record that is already sitting before the Senate right now. It is
unnecessary to call her as a witness because all of her testimony
is completely and fully disclosed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cacheris also appealed for a swift end to ``the long nightmare''
that the former White House intern and her family have endured.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats blasted the meeting as a last-ditch effort by
the House Republican managers to bolster their case to call
witnesses, as support waned for prolonging the trial, particularly
among key GOP senators.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican senators predicted that the trial could end
this week. Other GOP senators said they were seeking a last-minute
compromise to complete the proceedings no later than Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, members of both parties agreed, Clinton would be
acquitted because the Senate lacks the two-thirds majority, or 67
votes, required to convict a president and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial is basically over with,'' said Senator Richard C.
Shelby, an Alabama Republican. ``The only question is, how do we
clean it up and end it.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican, said the
proceedings could end swiftly with votes on the impeachment
charges. ``I think we will reach a conclusion by the end of this
week,'' Snowe said, as 21 senators fanned out on Sunday talk shows
in a prelude to the pending showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecutors described the Lewinsky interview as a
routine step as they prepare to meet a deadline Monday to identify
witnesses they will ask the Senate to permit them to subpoena for
depositions. Clinton is charged with lying under oath to a federal
grand jury and obstructing justice to conceal his sexual affair
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be derelict in our duty if we didn't talk to her,''
said McCollum, one of the managers who interviewed Lewinsky at the
Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, five blocks from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, McCollum said he wanted to question Lewinsky
about ``her current state of mind on the grand jury testimony that
she gave.'' Part of Lewinsky's testimony contradicted statements by
Clinton about the nature of their relationship, which formed the
basis for an element of the charge that Clinton lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lewinsky's testimony conflicted with statements by
Clinton's personal secretary, Betty Currie, about gifts that
Clinton gave Lewinsky and Currie later hid under her bed.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum and other managers, Representatives Ed Bryant of
Tennessee and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, said the interview
underscored the need for the Senate to hear from Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very productive meeting,'' Bryant said. ``If
she has the opportunity to testify in front of the Senate, it would
certainly be a benefit to the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers said they plan to request depositions from
Lewinsky, Currie, and Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the Washington lawyer
and close Clinton friend. An element of the obstruction charge
relates to Jordan's help in finding Lewinsky a job in New York at a
time when Clinton was allegedly trying to conceal his affair with
the former intern from lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones, who sued him
for sexual harassment. That case was settled last year for
$850,000.
</P>
<P>
   The managers said they might also seek depositions from two
White House aides, John Podesta and Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite attempts to reach Jordan, however, the House managers
arranged no plans to interview any prospective witness other than
Lewinsky before Monday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   House investigators recently interviewed Clinton's former
political adviser, Dick Morris, about his conversations with the
president after the sex scandal first became public last year. But
the managers have expressed no interest in requesting Morris and
other witnesses, such as Kathleen E. Willey, for fear of alienating
many Senate Republicans who want to limit the scope of a possible
witness phase.
</P>
<P>
   Willey is a former White House volunteer who says Clinton groped
her near the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky interview occurred despite the vehement objections
of many Democrats, including Senator John F. Kerry, who denounced
the session as a ``shocking'' and ``negligent'' violation of the
Senate's bipartisan blueprint for conducting the first phase of the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pact, senators agreed to defer the witness question
until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry called the Lewinsky interview a ``fishing expedition to
see if they can strengthen their argument to carry the day for
having witnesses in order to prolong the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the motion to dismiss the impeachment charges is
expected to be defeated, the outcome of the witness issue is highly
uncertain. If all 45 Democrats remain unified against permitting
witness depositions, which is possible, they would need only six
Republicans to join them for a 51-vote majority to block the
witness phase of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Both votes could occur Tuesday. And if both motions are
defeated, the final obstacles to the Senate voting on the articles
of impeachment would be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Three key GOP senators, including Snowe, indicated Sunday that
they were leaning against calling witnesses, which could help give
Democrats the support they need to end the trial. Shelby and
Senator Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican, stated similar
opposition to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, several Republicans have expressed reservations
about calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think at this point I've been convinced that we need
to hear from witnesses,'' Snowe said. She said she does not want
the trial ``to turn into the Jerry Springer show.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans are scheduled to meet privately this morning
to discuss their final strategy. The senators who have expressed
opposition to witnesses are expected to face considerable pressure
from a large bloc of conservatives who believe the House managers
should be allowed to fully present their case.
</P>
<P>
   The lead manager, Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois,
issued a separate appeal Sunday for a lengthier trial, with
witnesses. ``We're riding a tiger,'' he said, ``and we can't
dismount until it's finished.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON, _ In a high-stakes battle to continue their
prosecution of President Clinton, House managers interviewed Monica
S. Lewinsky for just under two hours Sunday and said she would be
an impressive witness who would help the Senate ''determine the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate set to vote this week on whether to allow
witnesses to be deposed, senators stepped up a search for ways to
restore bipartisanship to their chamber and bring the trial to a
swift conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerating chain of events came as the Senate headed into
a decisive week, facing two votes that could either stop the trial
or prolong it. Negotiations were under way to see whether the
Senate could find a way to skip those votes entirely and jump ahead
to a final decision on the two articles of impeachment this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring complaints from Democratic senators, three members of
the House prosecution team _ Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Bill
McCollum of Florida and Ed Bryant of Tennessee _ spent the late
afternoon questioning the young woman described by Rep. Henry J.
Hyde as ``the most important witness in this whole drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Three lawyers for Ms. Lewinsky and a representative from the
Office of the Independent Counsel, Michael Emmick, also sat in on
the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Ms. Lewinsky's said the prosecutors once again
asked about the chain of events surrounding her decision to return
gifts from the president to his secretary, Betty Currie, an act the
Republicans have cited as an element of their obstruction of
justice charge against Clinton. The managers also asked her about
assistance by Vernon Jordan, a friend of the President, in
searching for a job in New York. The managers did not ask for
details of her sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was certainly impressed with Miss Lewinsky's intelligence
and poise,'' Hutchinson said as the men emerged from the interview
in the Mayflower Hotel just after 6 p.m. He said she would be a
witness who would help the Senate ``determine the truth.'' McCollum
said, ``We found that she might be a very helpful witness to the
Senate if called.''
</P>
<P>
   Plato Cacheris, one of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, who attended the
session, said, ``She added nothing to the record that is already
sitting before the Senate.'' He urged the House managers not to
call her before the Senate. ``We hope for Monica and her family
that this long nightmare will come to a quick conclusion,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In scenes reminiscent of the frenzy ignited a year ago by the
news that the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, was
investigating whether Clinton had conspired to cover up an affair
with Ms. Lewinsky, scores of reporters, photographers and
television cameramen crowded the sidewalk outside the downtown
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky arrived there late Saturday afternoon, compelled by
a federal judge to cooperate with the House impeachment team. Her
surprise return to Washington _ and Hyde's request to the
independent counsel to obtain the court order, convulsed the Senate
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that House Republicans would have to make a persuasive
argument for their witness list, several Senate Republicans
expressed skepticism Sunday on the television talk shows about the
need to hear from the principals in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want the Senate to become a spectacle, a scene,''
said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alal, who said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' that he would support calling only witnesses who ``can add
a lot.'' Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said she had not yet been
convinced that witnesses were needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if we do proceed, we want to make sure that it
doesn't turn out to be `The Jerry Springer Show,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, said he
hoped that the two parties could find a way to skip to the final
arguments and a final vote ``and get to it as promptly as is
consistent with doing the impartial justice we all raised our right
hands and said that we would do.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers will have to be careful in writing their final
proposal for witnesses in order to counter the growing unease in
the Senate about the trial's running into another month.
</P>
<P>
   With even some Republicans troubled by Ms. Lewinsky's sudden
reappearance in their midst, Sen. Bob Torricelli, D-N.J., said in
an interview that the managers' use of the court to obtain access
to Ms. Lewinsky was ``a miscalculation of such proportion that it
probably increases pressure on the Republican leadership to get
this matter resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The managers were not expected to finalize their witness list
until Monday at the earliest, and one Republican aide said before
the session with Ms. Lewinsky that she was the only solid one on
the list. The managers were also weighing calling aides and
advisers to the president, among them Jordan, Ms. Currie, John
Podesta and Sidney Blumenthal, as well as Kathleen Willey, another
woman who has said Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance to her.
</P>
<P>
   But the aide said the managers were concerned that the
president's advisers would not be cooperative witnesses and that
the Senate might bristle at the introduction of Ms. Willey.
Separately, Republican investigators also talked to Dick Morris,
Clinton's former political adviser. The managers have said the
president's state of mind was important when Morris told him a poll
showed the nation would never forgive his conduct with Ms.
Lewinsky.

 WASHINGTON: Ms. Lewinsky. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the prosecutors prepared their presentation, Sen. Trent Lott,
the majority leader, sought to keep pressure on the White House. He
said he would go ahead with plans to submit written questions to
the president on Monday, even though White House lawyers have
backed away from a statement by Greg Craig, the White House special
counsel, indicating that the president might take written
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to prepare a letter in hopes that the
president will respond to the senators' interrogatories,'' Lott
said in a statement. He said answers from Clinton's lawyers ``is
not a substitute for the president answering the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is set for two critical votes this week, one to
dismiss the trial outright and one to decide whether to allow
witnesses. Senators from both parties said various avenues were
being explored to see whether the Senate could somehow end the
trial this week. Several officials said Sen. Tom Daschle, the
minority leader, had even approached Lott to explore whether there
was a way to skip those two votes outright and move directly to
some final vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like going to an opera that's not all that great,''
said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``The tenor's been stabbed, and as
he staggers across the stage and continues to sing, you want to
stand up and say, `You're dead, fall down!' This trial is like
that. The tenor has died. Bring down the curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems unlikely that the Senate will provide the unanimous
consent necessary to change the vote sequence it has set up. And it
was also uncertain Sunday night whether the Senate's final votes
would simply be on the articles of impeachment. Lott was said by
senators to be exploring whether the Senate could vote on findings
of fact on the two articles of impeachment and then take a separate
vote on whether to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are convinced there's sufficient evidence of
obstruction of justice to suggest that the president did that,''
said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who favors such an approach.
``But a lot of senators are uneasy about taking the next step, and
are asking does that justify his removal?''
</P>
<P>
   She said of the idea of voting on a finding of facts separate
from conviction would be ``tougher than a censure.'' But one
Democratic official said Democrats would not be likely to go along
with such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate does go ahead with the votes on the motions to
dismiss the case and on witnesses, several Republicans say it is
possible that six or more of their members would join with the 45
Democrats to block witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing feeling in our conference that it would be
nice if that motion did not succeed,'' said one Republican senator,
who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ``But many
members may have to hold their noses and vote for it for a lot of
internal political reasons for our party. So it's not clear who is
going to save us from ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., predicted that the motion to
dismiss the case, which could be voted on as early as Monday, would
fail. ``I believe the motion to depose witnesses will be very close
and could go either way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats suggested that they would drop the effort to
dismiss the case if they could be guaranteed that witnesses would
not be called. ``If enough Republicans would declare themselves
against witnesses, I believe we could completely avoid the vote on
dismissal,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to patch together bipartisanship after a fractious
Saturday and avoid the party line vote against dismissing the case,
some senators said they would like to see a bipartisan caucus of
the Senate on Monday, to be held in the Old Senate Chamber, where a
bipartisan plan for the trial was hammered out two weeks ago.
``Perhaps many of these things can be worked out,'' Ms. Snowe said
in an interview. ``There are a lot of things in play. I think
tomorrow could be critical.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial is to resume Monday, and some senators may
still want to submit questions through Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist. Otherwise, unless a new procedure is negotiated, the
Senate moves to the motion to dismiss the case. The House
prosecutors and the White House each have an hour to debate the
motion.

IRAQIS WALKS OUT OF ARAB LEAGUE MEETING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In an angry rupture with fellow Arabs, an Iraqi
delegation withdrew from a high-level meeting here Sunday night as
Arab foreign ministers were adopting a statement critical of
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad hoped that fellow members of the 22-member Arab League
would use the session to focus attention on Iraq's foes, in part by
issuing an explicit condemnation of air attacks last month on its
territory by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the foreign ministers deliberated for another four and
a half hours after the walkout but made no fundamental changes in
the statement. It demands that Iraq renounce ``provocations''
against its neighbors and that it comply with all United Nations
resolutions before economic sanctions could be lifted, Arab League
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Iraqi delegation told reporters as he left the
session that the resolution ``did not comply with any of the Iraqi
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Said al-Sahaf blamed Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and Syria for the anti-Iraq tone of the statement,
which he called fruitless and negative.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in a Cairo hotel, Sahaf warned that the
United States might try to use the Arab stand as a pretext for new
attacks on Iraq. But he insisted acidly that the criticism of Iraq
did not represent any kind of broad Arab view, but only that of
``the friends of America'' among the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter outcome of the session was a fresh indication of just
how much Iraq's relations with fellow Arabs have soured,
particularly in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arab leaders have opposed or expressed regret about the
American-led attacks, which ended on Dec. 20. But they have not
done so vehemently enough to satisfy Baghdad, prompting Iraq to
respond with extraordinary venom, particularly toward Egypt and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling speech earlier this month, President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq called on Arab people to overthrow unspecified
leaders who he suggested were little more than vassals of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Such attacks have not left most Arab governments in any mood to
offer succor to Hussein, who Arab officials have begun in recent
weeks to describe _ privately but increasingly _ as a ruler whose
days should be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's walkout by Iraqi officials scuttled the hopes of Arab
League officials that the session might somehow rebuild an illusion
of Arab solidarity that was shattered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was prompted by the American-led air strikes last
month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An Iraqi account said some Arab countries, including Libya and
Morocco, had favored a resolution more favorable to Baghdad. But
those countries were thwarted, the Iraqis said, by the Saudis and
other Persian Gulf countries, the most hawkish among the Arabs in
their anti-Iraqi views.
</P>
<P>
   Sahaf, the Iraqi foreign minister, specifically accused Egypt
and Syria of having been too timid to oppose the hard-line Saudi
stand. The Iraqi walkout followed more than seven hours of meetings
by 18 Arab foreign ministers and four other representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements Sunday, some Arab leaders hewed to a
longstanding theme, emphasizing solidarity with Iraqi civilians who
have borne the brunt of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria also criticized
American policy, saying the only clear outcome of the four days of
American strikes on Iraq last month had been ``to aggravate the
suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   But as measured by the Iraqi response, the main thrust of the
Arab League statement appeared to have been sharply critical of
Iraq, perhaps more than any similar declaration since the Persian
Gulf war of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Arab League officials said, the statement
calls on Iraq to reaffirm its recognition of its borders with
Kuwait. Iraq took that step in 1994, four years after invading its
tiny neighbor, but in the last several weeks, some prominent
members of the Iraqi Parliament have urged a reversal.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also demands that Iraq resolve the issue of
Kuwaitis who are still considered missing or prisoners of war as a
result of the invasion, the Arab League officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of U.N. sanctions, Iraq urged the Arab League to
take the lead in the campaign for their lifting, perhaps even by
unilaterally declaring them to be null and void.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arab League officials said the statement was more
cautious, calling for study of ways to lift the sanctions but
saying they should remain in place until Iraq honored its
obligations to the United Nations.

EDITORIAL: ORDER IN THE TRIAL 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 25:
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend of turmoil, the Senate must act Monday to regain
control of an impeachment trial that has been improperly and
dangerously manipulated by the House prosecution managers. With
conservative Republicans like Richard Shelby and Larry Craig eager
to see the case resolved, the Senate can renew the bipartisan
spirit of responsibility that united it when the trial opened two
weeks ago. Its duty now is to restrain the zealous House
prosecutors and, in recognition that there are not 67 votes to
remove President Clinton, design a fair plan to resolve the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde's use of the federal courts and Kenneth Starr to
force Monica Lewinsky to meet with House managers Sunday was not
just a desperate effort to head off the dismissal motion promised
by Sen. Robert Byrd. It was, as Sen. Tom Harkin said on NBC's
``Meet the Press,'' a severe attack on the Constitution and the
Senate, and must not be permitted to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution awards the Senate the sole power to try
impeachment cases. Federal courts have no authority to intervene
and the House has no license to act outside the trial rules set by
the Senate. Hyde's gambit brazenly defied both constitutional
principles.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the trial, the Senate unanimously agreed that a
decision to call witnesses, or even to depose them outside the
Senate chamber, would require majority approval. The Senate is
scheduled to take up those issues this week. Until it approves
summoning witnesses, which is by no means certain, the House
managers have no authority to meet with Ms. Lewinsky or anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Norma Holloway Johnson's order to Ms. Lewinsky to meet
with House managers or Starr's office on pain of losing her
immunity from prosecution was coercive and unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday television appearances by more than 20 senators drawn
from both parties suggested that the Senate is bubbling with
plausible ideas for concluding the trial. The challenge is to sort
through them and come up with a bipartisan approach. To encourage
that outcome, Trent Lott and Tom Daschle, the Republican and
Democratic leaders, should convene another joint caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's motion to dismiss the charges is unlikely to be approved
by a majority vote. But as Shelby suggested on ABC's ``This Week,''
it can still change the dynamic of the trial by showing there are
not nearly enough votes to convict Clinton. It is also likely to
split the Senate along party lines and leave the Republicans
responsible for extending the trial, a burden they may not wish to
carry into the next election.
</P>
<P>
   The quickest exit might come from Sen. John Breaux's suggestion
that a dismissal motion include a strong condemnation of Clinton.
Another way to wind up is to move quickly to a vote on the articles
of impeachment. Many Republicans seem to favor that approach. A
censure resolution could follow.
</P>
<P>
   All that stands in the way of a verdict is the question of
calling witnesses. With Republicans like Olympia Snowe, Slade
Gorton and even the conservative Shelby questioning the need to
call witnesses, the 51 votes needed to reject further testimony
seem within reach. The nation looks to the Senate for the wise
leadership and calm deliberation that an impeachment trial
requires. The Senate has the opportunity this week to live up to
the trust placed in it by the Framers.

   PLUGERVILLE, Texas _ Jimmy Nassour wasn't sure why he kept
raising his hand when the bidding passed the $500 limit he'd set
for himself. ``I guess I got caught up in the moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The auctioneer, Bob Sheehan, held aloft the small, white Bible:
A gift from students at Winnitka Heights Baptist Church in Tulsa,
Okla., on Dec. 15, 1968, to Madalyn Murray O'Hair, the atheist
leader who once described herself as ``the most hated woman in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The bidding shot past $500, then $1,000 and Nassour hung in
there. Finally, the bidders fell away and he found himself the
owner of Ms. Murray-O'Hair's Bible for $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also bought one of her briefcases, but this is what I came
for,'' said Nassour. ``I just think it's a museum piece and that's
where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   All around the dimly lit, white-metal barn on the northeast
fringe of the Austin suburbs were garbage bags full of clothes and
cardboard boxes and bric-a-brac and dusty pieces of furniture, the
biggest garage sale you ever saw. Chinese dolls. Bronze cowboys.
Stacks of videotapes. Souvenirs from world travels. Pots and pans,
highball glasses, decanters, collectible whisky bottles. And dozens
of boxes of books.
</P>
<P>
   This was all that remained of the worldly possessions of Mrs.
O'Hair, who disappeared from her Austin office in September 1995
with her granddaughter, Robin Murray-O'Hair, and one of her sons,
Jon Garth Murray, leaving behind the family's three dogs, Mrs.
O'Hair's medications and a 1985 Porsche 944 parked at the Austin
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were able to trace them, from cell phone calls and
bank records, as far as San Antonio, where $500,000 was withdrawn
from one of the bank accounts of American Atheists Inc., the
movement Mrs. O'Hair founded after becoming a national figure with
a 1963 lawsuit that effectively removed prayer from public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, nothing. Not a hint.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say they have no idea where the trio are. Some
people believe they were robbed and murdered, others think they may
still be alive, fleeing creditors, perhaps in New Zealand, where
they were said to have bank accounts. If so, Mrs. O'Hair would be
79, her son 44 and her granddaughter 33.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government had confiscated the contents of her home
to pay some of the $250,000 she owed in back taxes and to other
creditors, an auction that was postponed two years ago when
attorneys for the three missing people filed for bankruptcy but was
finally held Saturday in a crowd of bargain hunters and curiosity
seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Hair's private papers _ her military discharge, birth
certificate, marriage licenses and years worth of meticulously kept
diaries _ were not part of Saturday's auction. They sit in a
safe &UR; - &LR; deposit box in a downtown Austin bank a block away from the
office of Ronald Ingalls, the attorney who is handling their
separate sale.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries are a sad chronicle of a yearning, unhappy life.
Mrs. O'Hair, bitter that her dreams of political influence never
blossomed, had harsh judgments of almost everyone around her, often
singling out Jews and gays and blacks. She dreamed, pitifully, page
after page, for such things as a ``luxury apartment,'' a mink coat
and a Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ends 33 years of my life,'' she wrote in April of 1953.
``This living is the pattern of it. Work, hope  &UR; _ &LR;  dream, realizing
there is not much hope the dreams will become realization. Yet
always the future invites, promises.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 5, 1959: ``The whole idiotic hopelessness of human
relations descends upon me. Tonight, I cried and cried, but even
then feeling nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a gap in the diaries, the entire 1960s and parts of the
'80s, the period when she became a national figure and when her
movement had serious financial problems. Yet there are references
to these missing diaries in the portions that remain, so they did
exist. Were they destroyed? Taken with her? No one knows.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, her New Year's resolutions included wishes for a new
headquarters, a fur coat, a luxury car and to ``humiliate Billy
Graham on television, for money.'' She intended to drive herself
and all of those around her, most of whom she considered dull and
lazy. ``This year, we do it!'' But by mid-year, she was despondent
again.
</P>
<P>
   She celebrates her court cases, bemoans her humiliations. Once,
in 1975, she found herself attacked from all sides on a national
talk show, a figure of ridicule. ``Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy,'' she
wrote. ``I get so terribly tired.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, there is more heartache and squabbling than
philosophizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more her personal stuff, her family tribulations,''
said Ingalls. ``This is not the place to come to find the fine
points of her theories or logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Various authorities have valued the diaries at $5,000 to
$100,000. Ingalls is waiting to get a bid he feels is sufficient to
take before a judge, and then everyone else will have 20 days to
better it. ``I can tell you this,'' he said. ``If I got a bid of
$100,000, I'd be on the phone to the judge in an instant.''
</P>
<P>
   The brown Porsche sat in the dirt-caked yard behind the auction
barn in Pflugerville, a couple of rust holes peering like eyes from
its mud-flecked body. An Austin car dealer eventually bought it for
$2,750, more despite the owner's notoriety than because of it. ``It
was just too good a deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people came to the auction, some staying for a few
minutes, others lingering for hours, pouring through the open
boxes. But only 275 people put up the required $250 cash deposit to
actually bid.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan worked up the crowd all day with a string of wisecracks.
He held up some framed needlepoints she had done (``Time for
kindness, and for giving, time for friendship and happy living'').
They are mentioned in her diaries as a way to relieve stress and
fill the empty evenings. ``When she wasn't praying she was
needlepointing,'' Sheehan told the crowd. ``So she had a lot of
time to needlepoint.'' They went for $35.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items fetched little, unless they had some ironic
value, like Nassour's Bible. A box of ``atheist trinkets, including
an atheist drinking glass, though you don't have to be an atheist
to drink out of it'' went for $55. Some $2 bills on which Ms.
Murray-O'Hair had crossed out ``In God We Trust'' with a black pen
went for $10 each. Five highball glasses with her name on them went
for $35 each.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan wouldn't say exactly how much the day's auction drew,
except that it was not far from his earlier estimate of $25,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls said that he thought that when news of the auction got
around, especially of the diaries, it might flush the family out of
hiding, if that's where they are. But there hasn't been a whisper
from them. Ingalls worried, too, about threats from Mrs. O'Hair's
once-multitudinous enemies, but there hasn't been a single crank
call. Apparently the embers went out on that battle a long time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of those in the crowd Saturday said they were just regular
auction goers and didn't even know who Madalyn Murray-O'Hair was.
Others said, yes, they had come out of curiosity, to see what the
famous atheist's stuff looked like and maybe take something home.
And a few had even known her.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Florence, 59, shook his head sadly at the auctioneer's
wisecracks and the crowd's laughter. ``I knew them, Robin best of
all,'' he said. ``It's really hard to see their things going like
this.''

EDITORIAL: HOW NOT TO SELL A PUBLIC PAINTING  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Jan. 25:
</P>
<P>
   On Monday at 4 p.m., Lincoln Center's board of directors will
meet to discuss, again, the terrible idea of selling the Jasper
Johns painting ``Numbers, 1964.'' The sale is arousing intense
opposition among artists, arts administrators and the general
public, and the board has a chance to avoid a mistake that would
haunt the institution for years.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising thing about the board's predicament is the
directors' surprise at the outcry. The thought of raising,
virtually without effort, an amount of money said to be around $15
million would be appealing to any board in the city. But raising
money in this manner carries far too high a price. Already one
foundation has said it will withdraw its support of Lincoln Center
if the painting is sold, and other donors may follow. Meanwhile,
the office of the state attorney general has made an inquiry
concerning the board's right to sell the painting.
</P>
<P>
   These are signals that the Johns painting is not just any asset,
to be liquidated as needed. Before this controversy erupted,
``Numbers, 1964'' _ a work commissioned by the architect Philip
Johnson for its site in the New York State Theater _ was emblematic
of the harmony between the visual and performing arts. Now, if it
is sold, it will become emblematic of a conflict between them.
</P>
<P>
   The tension leading to the removal of Richard Serra's ``Tilted
Arc'' from Federal Plaza a decade ago made a certain twisted sense
if only because the owner was the General Services Administration,
a sometimes artistically benighted federal agency. But in this case
the owner is an organization devoted to the arts. Selling this
painting would negate a premise of Lincoln Center's own existence.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Opera, which supports the sale, and Beverly
Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center, have asserted that perhaps
``Numbers, 1964'' is a work that belongs in a museum, not in a
theater lobby. But the directors of the Museum of Modern Art and
the Metropolitan Museum have opposed the sale, making it clear that
they believe the proper home is the hall for which the painting was
commissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Center and the New York State Theater deserve all the
support they can get. But as Ms. Sills and Nathan Leventhal,
Lincoln Center's president, noted in a memo to the board, the
``uniform negative reaction'' to the proposed sale is eroding
support.
</P>
<P>
   At its meeting, the board should emphatically decline the sale
of ``Numbers, 1964.'' Then it should invite all of those who
opposed this sale, some of whom already have offered financial aid
to Lincoln Center, to help raise funds for the restoration of the
New York State Theater. That task should be a means of uniting the
arts community, not of dividing it as the unwarranted sale of this
public asset would do. &QL;

THE PUBLIC: CRYING HALT BEFORE A REPUBLICAN `BULLDOZER'
</HEADLINE>
   (See related IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-LEWINSKY, IMPEACH-ASSESS,
IMPEACH-LOTT, IMPEACH-STARR, IMPEACH-JUDGE)

 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As she watches Republicans in Congress push ahead
with impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, Ellen
Mendel of Manhattan says she feels the same despair that she did as
a girl in Nazi Germany when the efforts of a stubborn group of
leaders snowballed, crushing the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is apparent that the bulldozing campaign by the Republicans
will not end,'' said Ms. Mendel, a psychotherapist. And in a moment
of self-analysis, she added: ``Their efforts are so abusive that I
was beginning to feel a sense of discouragement. I have been
feeling very isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Ms. Mendel and scores of other New Yorkers who support
Clinton gathered at Hunter College to vent their outrage and
discuss new ways to get their views heard in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing buttons that said ``Let the People Decide'' and carrying
banners that said ``Let's Fire Ken Starr and Tan Henry's Hyde,''
some 400 people packed a Park Avenue auditorium and turned what was
billed as an academic forum into a political rally.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Mendel, most of those in the audience were dedicated
liberals who felt as if they had done everything possible to put an
end to the impeachment proceedings. They voted, contributing to the
significant political blow dealt to Republicans last November. Many
have written letters to Congress and opinion articles in local
newspapers. They have walked door-to-door and stood on busy street
corners to get signatures on petitions.
</P>
<P>
   They have raised money for advertisements and helped pay travel
expenses for delegations of voters to travel to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But still, the impeachment proceedings trudge forward. Those at
Sunday's forum, sponsored by Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y.,
demanded that senators support a motion to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   But most said they felt their demands _ like their votes, their
letters and their petitions _ would be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we have lost our voice,'' said Kathy Sloane, a real
estate broker from the Upper West Side who said she had helped
raise money for newspaper advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted last month showed that
most Americans felt the same way. In a telephone survey of 1,215
people across the United States, most said they wanted the Senate
to resolve the presidential crisis without a trial and without
removing Clinton from office. In the poll, Clinton's approval
rating rose to 72 percent after Congress voted to impeach him, from
66 percent a week earlier.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sunday's assembly at Hunter opened with statements from the
panelists, mostly well-known historians and legal scholars,
including Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Bruce Ackerman, a law
professor at Yale University, and Burt Neuborne, a law professor at
New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Some speakers called the trial a travesty of justice and
demanded that the prosecutors appointed by Congress be recalled for
dishonest representations of the evidence against the president.
Others warned that Congress' image, not the president's, was being
irreparably harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sentence would not be one that penalizes Bill Clinton,''
said Neuborne, referring to the possible removal of Clinton from
office. ``But one that penalizes the millions and millions of
people who voted for Bill Clinton. It is an attempt to penalize the
American democracy that will not be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Few uttered criticism against the president. One man stood and
shouted that he should be impeached for the bombing of Iraq.
Another man admonished the crowd for talking about Clinton ``like
someone who's part of the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not forget,'' Jim Bergen said, shouting over raucous
hisses and boos, ``thou shalt not commit adultery. That is one of
the most important commandments from God.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the meeting, most people said their support for
Clinton had been re-energized. Mike Shatzkin, founder of a
publishing marketing company, said that he had put aside thoughts
of starting a campaign to charge congressional Republicans with
treason for their behavior in prosecuting the President.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, he would wait and hit Republican politicians
when it would hurt most: the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will wait until then and let the Republicans be reduced to
the minority they deserve,'' said Shatzkin, who wore tattered jeans
and a T-shirt that read ``I Like Clinton.''

SPREWELL ARRIVES BACK AHEAD OF HIS GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The first jump shot Latrell Sprewell took as a
Knick felt about as awkward as being the new kid in school. You
want to impress. You want to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   But it had been nearly 14 months since Sprewell had bumped up
against National Basketball Association talent. And it had been
just that long since Sprewell's last practice came to a cataclysmic
ending when he choked the Golden State Warrios' coach, P.J.
Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   He was starting all over again in his first practice as a Knick
on Saturday night. New team. New coach. And with that, the new guy
lofted up a shot that came with a tentative touch on a pair of
wobbly legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, it really wasn't there,'' Sprewell said Sunday
after a practice session at the State University of New York at
Purchase, which marked the first time all of the Knicks, new and
old, were on the same court. ``My legs weren't there. It didn't
look smooth at all.''
</P>
<P>
   As unsightly as it looked, Sprewell was on a NBA court. And
that's all that mattered to him. Finally, basketball was the
primary subject. How did his game look? How rusty was he? These
kind of questions seemed to come as a relief to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even explain it,'' Sprewell said. ``Just being out
here and starting to learn the plays again and being involved in
the practices and the camaraderie and those type things, it's a lot
of fun for me right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just playing my game. I'm not trying to force anything.
Just hit the open shot when they're there. If I see a guy open,
I'll get it to him. That's the way I've always played. I've never
tried to force too much. At Golden State, I was more of a focus of
the team and the offense. But here, I've got other guys who can
take the pressure off me. And I think that's going to open things
up. Teams can't key in on me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks aren't focused on his every miss or make right now,
either. They're just trying to get a feel for each other on the
court. For the first time since training camps opened on Thursday,
the Knicks had all of their pieces in place Sunday. Even the
Knicks' newest player, the spot-up shooter Dennis Scott, had
arrived for practice.
</P>
<P>
   Scott stepped onto the floor with the reputation of a player
never disciplined enough to keep his weight in check. He did little
to shed that image by showing up at Knicks' practice looking a bit
more plump than the 229 pounds he is listed at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' said Scott, who was winded as he sat against a
wall after practice. ``I'm lean and mean.''
</P>
<P>
   As a small forward with the Orlando Magic for seven seasons, his
weight fluctuated wildly. After one season, Scott went on a
vacation and gained 30 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the affable, fun-loving Scott blamed his stocky body
type. But team officials questioned his discipline. Even when he
lost weight, they were skeptical of his resolve. In the summer of
'97 Scott dropped more than 20 pounds, but those within the
organization wondered if his diet had caused him to exhibit
irrational behavior. That summer, he went on a tirade in front of a
group of kids assembled for a camp. Before the season began, he was
traded by the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his weight and demeanor have been under control.
Whatever his weight, his 3-point touch has rarely wavered. He is a
39 percent shooter from 3-point range for his career. And it's that
perimeter game that the Knicks are going to need off the bench
without John Starks. After making $3.1 million last year _ a season
that he spent in Dallas and Phoenix after Orlando traded him _
Scott had limited free-agent options. He landed with the Knicks for
the minimum of $725,000 for a player with eight years in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sprewell, Scott spent Sunday's practice just trying to find
his wind and fit in. Right now, it's a cram session for everyone.
There is new talent that has to be integrated and blended in with
the old guard of Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson.
There is little time to get the mix right, but Coach Jeff Van Gundy
doesn't expect Sprewell to find a magical touch instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let Latrell get out there and start working again,'' Van
Gundy said. ``And in time, we'll start seeing what he can do. But
to judge right now would be counterproductive. We have to see where
he's at.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was on an NBA court again. Whether he looked good or
not as the new guy, he couldn't have been happier to be playing
again after nearly 14 months in exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long layoff,'' Sprewell said. ``And I'm just
happy to be involved and getting back in the middle of things. It
has been a long time. It's tough, but I feel like I'm working my
way in well.'' &QL;

CONSTRAINTS OVER BUDGET PUT PATAKI IN A BIND WITH LEGISLATURE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ After the fiscal drought of the early 1990s, the
last two years have been a monsoon season for New York state.
Lawmakers have responded to the flood of revenue with tax cuts,
record increases in school spending, higher payments to pensioners
and a numbingly long list of expensive pet projects, from a sports
stadium in Brooklyn to bigger purses at Saratoga Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   The economy and the state's revenues are still strong, but Gov.
George E. Pataki is saying that the party is over.
</P>
<P>
   He has pledged that the 1999-2000 budget he will propose
Wednesday will increase spending by no more than the rate of
inflation. He has declared the state's budget surplus off-limits to
spending, saying that the estimated $2 billion or more must be
preserved to pay for promised tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   And while he will propose $1 billion a year in new tax cuts,
most of them would not take effect for two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   But a close look at the state budget shows that because of
commitments the state has already made, the governor can meet these
goals only by freezing or even cutting from most areas of the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists predict that inflation will be about 2 percent
for the coming year, and a 2 percent increase in the state's $71
billion budget would be $1.42 billion, less than one-third the
increase approved last year.
</P>
<P>
   Just two programs already written into law _ one to pay local
school districts to reduce property taxes, and another to expand
prekindergarten programs and lower elementary school class sizes _
commit the state to spending $1 billion more in the next fiscal
year. Contracts with state employees have built-in salary increases
that will cost even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real-world effect of staying under inflation is that you
would be cutting,'' said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, a Manhattan
Democrat and chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee.
``We have spending commitments that can't be avoided, and the
governor's idea leaves nothing left over _ less than nothing _ for
the rest of the budget. So we would have to cut everything else _
schools, health care, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pataki's budget proposal does that, independent fiscal
analysts are sure to applaud, since they have long warned that the
state could be headed for a crisis if it does not slow spending.
But the Legislature will take an austerity budget as a declaration
of war, lawmakers in both houses and parties say. ``I don't know
how he thinks he's going to do all these things and not have a
revolt on his hands,'' said Sen. Martin Connor, leader of the
Democratic minority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's aides have been tight-lipped about just what his
proposed budget will contain, but some confirm that he will call
for some spending cuts, particularly in health care programs, that
could translate to layoffs by the state, and more likely by
hospitals and contractors that rely on state money.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the assembly, controlled by Democrats,
and the Senate, run by Republicans, have become used to their
budget battles being not about hardship, but about how to split up
the bounty of the nation's thriving economy and Wall Street's boom.
</P>
<P>
   As the state ran up record surpluses in the last two years, the
governor and the Legislature eagerly spent the dividends,
increasing state spending 13 percent, after Pataki had held it
essentially flat in his first two years. Last year's 8 percent
budget increase, as the governor successfully sought re-election,
was the largest since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the budget is the main business of the Legislature,
invariably setting the tone for the year's dealings with the
governor. Many lawmakers say that a nasty budget fight this year
could make for an equally ill-tempered legislative session, making
it harder to make deals in other important areas, like health care
and criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have signaled that they will seek another big increase
in school aid and will try to protect health care from cuts. The
Senate Republicans are nearly as ardent as assembly Democrats in
supporting spending on schools and hospitals, the easiest way to
bring state money to their districts, and they are bent on enacting
an ambitious new round of tax cuts.

ON DIMAGGIO, SCORE IT AN ERROR ON NBC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aware of news reports that baseball legend Joe
DiMaggio appeared to be gravely ill, the news technicians at NBC's
``Dateline'' were ready to announce his passing at any moment. But
they were a little too ready.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, around 7:30 p.m., Eastern, the words ``NBC News
Special Report'' flashed across the bottom of the screen during
``Dateline,'' followed by the erroneous announcement that the
84-year-old DiMaggio was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an inadvertent error,'' said Cory Shields, a spokesman
for NBC. ``A technician pressed the wrong button.''
</P>

   NBC News officials scrambled to reach representatives of the
family of DiMaggio, who is resting at home after being released
last Monday after 99 days in intensive care at Memorial Regional
Hospital in Hollywood, Fla., where he underwent lung cancer surgery
and battled pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really sorry and regret the error,'' Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nachio, DiMaggio's friend for 56 years, said late Sunday
night that the former New York Yankees' great has round-the-clock
nursing care ``and a valet who attends to his needs.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio remains on a ventilator. ``He can't go for more than 30
minutes without that tube in his throat,'' Nachio said.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, who lives in nearby Harbor Island, Fla., entered the
hospital last Oct. 12 and had lung surgery two days later. For much
of his stay, he battled pneumonia, which required that his left
lung be drained numerous times.

DUVAL'S 59 IS ONE FOR THE MEMORIES IN THE HOPE CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ It was a magical round of golf, executed by
a player blessed with almost mystical composure.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever expects to shoot a 59. Until Sunday, it had only
been done twice in the history of PGA Tour competition. It is more
common for a pitcher to hurl a perfect game, more common for a
bowler to roll a 300. Shooting a 59 is almost a surrealistic
experience, something golfers dream about, but a zone that few have
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, David Duval carved his place in history during a
memorable final round of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. Shooting a
13-under par 59 at the Arnold Palmer Private Course at PGA West,
and overcoming a 7-stroke deficit, Duval strengthened his position
as the world's most dominant player. His dramatic 1-stroke victory
over Steve Pate was Duval's ninth victory in his last 28 starts and
his second victory in two starts this year. Duval won $540,000
Sunday to increase his earnings to $1.008 million this year in two
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was the way in which Duval won that left an indelible
impression. With his 6-foot eagle putt at No. 18, Duval joined Al
Geiberger and Chip Beck as the only players to shoot 59 on the
tour. Geiberger did it in 1977 at Colonial Country Club in Memphis,
Tenn., during the second round of the Memphis Classic. Beck did it
in 1991 at Sunrise Country Club, during the third round of the Las
Vegas Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Now Duval has done it, but his 59 had even more unique
qualities. Duval was the first to shoot 59 on a Sunday, when the
pin placements are the toughest and while being under the pressure
of being in contention. Duval shot an incredible 28 on the back
nine, playing his best when the tension was the greatest, and
capping it all with an eagle on the final hole. What could anyone
say?
</P>
<P>
   Those who witnessed it will not forget it. Even the man who did
it had trouble comprehending it. ``It's not really something I
expected to do in my career,'' said Duval, who finished at 26 under
par for the five-day tournament (334), one stroke ahead of Pate
(335), who shot a 66 Sunday, and two strokes better than John
Huston (336), who also shot a 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, I feel bad for Steve, because I absolutely stole
the golf tournament from him,'' Duval said. ``Tell a guy starting
the day that he'll shoot 6 under and get beat by a 59. He's going
to tell you you're crazy. It's a tough situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But few golfers are as tough mentally as Duval, and it showed
Sunday. He sensed the magnitude of the situation and he embraced
it, raising his game to a level that no other player in the world
can match at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, at his best, was stunning. He secured his historic round
with an eagle at the par 5, 543-yard No.18, hitting a drive of 325
yards, leaving him about 177 yards from the front of the green and
208 yards from the hole. Then Duval hit a magnificent 5-iron shot
that landed on the green and rolled from left to right toward the
cup. The ball stopped 6 feet from the pin, and as Duval walked to
the 18th green, he was greeted by a standing ovation from the
grandstand gallery, as everyone knew the next putt could make
history.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, Duval showed little emotion, giving a quick wave to
the crowd, his eyes hidden by his trademark sunglasses. But inside,
his emotions were churning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' he said. ``If you miss from 6 feet, you would
have preferred it to have been 30. At least you could say, `Well,
you don't ever make 30-footers anyway.' But if anything, there
might have been even a little more pressure. I took a couple of
deep breaths and hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the putt disappeared into the cup, the normally stoic
Duval pumped his fist numerous times, both after the putt went in
and after he removed the ball from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited, I'm not going to lie to you,'' he said. ``I was
more excited about the score than having a chance to win the golf
tournament. It was kind of like a double bonus. I certainly had
aspirations of winning, but a 59 was first and foremost in my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Tway, one of Duval's two playing partners, appreciated
having a firsthand view of history. ``To shoot 59, you have to do
almost everything perfect, and he was,'' Tway said. ``He drove the
ball perfectly. He hit his 3-wood or 2-iron in perfect position.
His control was unbelievable. He putted great. It was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day trailing the leader, Fred Funk, by seven
strokes, Duval opened with with three consecutive birdies. He had
five birdies on the front nine, but on the back nine, Duval was
even better. He birdied the par 4 No. 10, hitting a wedge approach
shot to 4 feet, then making the putt.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied the par 5 No. 11, set up by a pitching wedge third
shot that landed 4 feet from the hole. He made another birdie at
the par 3, 207-yard No. 12, hitting a beautiful 6-iron tee shot to
within 2 feet of the cup. After a par at No. 13, Duval made a
10-foot putt for birdie at No. 14 to reach 22 under par. Then Duval
hit another hard-to-believe tee shot, an 8-iron at the par 3,
156-yard No. 15 that landed 18 inches from the cup for an easy
tap-in birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may have been his best shot, because the distance was in
between an 8-iron and a 9-iron, and the green down there is so
narrow,'' said Mitch Knox, Duval's caddie. ``That shot took great
feel. It was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Another 6-foot birdie putt at No. 16, followed by a par at No.
17, set up Duval's chance for 59 at No. 18. When he reached the
final hole, Duval was still tied with Pate for the lead at 24 under
par, but the eagle gave Duval a 2-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   Playing four groups ahead of Pate, Duval then had to wait for
Pate to finish. Pate reached No. 18 at 25 under par, needing a
birdie to force a playoff, and an eagle to win. But Pate's second
shot at No. 18 landed in a greenside bunker, and his bunker shot
rolled 18 feet past the hole. Then Pate barely missed the birdie
putt, as it hit the ball hit the right edge of the cup, but lipped
out.
</P>
<P>
   Pate crouched in disappointment, but it was Duval's day. He is
ranked No. 3 in the world rankings behind Tiger Woods and Mark
O'Meara, but Duval's peers have already anointed him No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should been no along time ago,'' said Tway. ``The rankings
take so long to roll over, it's ridiculous. The way he has played
the last two years is unbelievable, so much better than everyone
else. But once he gets to No. 1, he'll stay there a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval will attempt to continue his streak at this week's Phoenix
Open, but he stayed clear of the debate about No. 1. ``If I say I'm
the best player in the world, so what?'' said Duval. ``It doesn't
help me win. It doesn't help me get better. Improving helps me get
better. I'm working on improving, and I need to add some majors to
my resume.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Duval added a 59 to his resume. ``I'm playing quite
well,'' said Duval with a laugh. ``And if you're talking about one
round, I probably can't play better.''

ALBANY PLAN TO USE TOBACCO FUNDS ON HEALTH CARE IS GAINING
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders in Albany have
reached a consensus that some of the money from the settlement of
the national tobacco lawsuit should be used to provide health care
for New York state's swelling number of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic lawmakers have often discussed using some of the
money _ an estimated $1 billion a year over 25 years _ to help the
uninsured. But now, the governor and the most powerful Republican
in the Legislature, Joseph L. Bruno, the State Senate majority
leader, are voicing support for their initiatives. In the past,
Bruno has spoken almost exclusively about using the settlement
money for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's advisers would not offer details of a specific
program nor the dollar amount that would be used to finance it, but
they confirmed that they would like to see some part of the money
used to help the working poor gain health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will announce an initiative in the near future that will
use some portion of the tobacco settlement to provide insurance for
low-income New Yorkers who are currently uninsured,'' said John
Signor, a spokesman for the State Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said he was motivated in part by his mother's death years
ago, which he said was hastened by a lack of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said he thought 25 to 35 percent of the settlement money
should go toward health care initiatives, with a large chunk
reserved for dealing with the uninsured, many of whom suffer from
cancer and other smoking-related illnesses that have drained
Medicaid pools in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the health care system has been disrupted because of
illnesses related to smoking,'' Bruno said in a telephone interview
last week. ``The tobacco settlement money is of great benefit if it
is used properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, has already
said he is interested in using some tobacco money for the
uninsured. ``The speaker has said he sees the money used for
combating teen-age smoking, for school infrastructure and to
establish a pool to address the needs of uninsured New Yorkers,''
said Patricia Lynch, his spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Every state is engaged in discussions _ in some cases all-out
battles _ over how to spend the nearly $246 billion from cigarette
makers that will result from lawsuits brought against the tobacco
industry to recover some of that Medicaid money. Proposals range
from antismoking programs to repairing sidewalks to new hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York, many health care professionals, especially
those that serve the poor, have insisted that the majority of the
money go for the uninsured, whose numbers rose 19.1 percent in
1997, versus the national average of 17.6 percent. Nearly one in
five New Yorkers under age 65 have no health insurance; in New York
City, the public hospital system can barely keep up with the
numbers of uninsured, which are estimated at 28 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno recalled the story of his mother, who died at 44 after
years of complications from a botched gall-bladder operation and
was frequently forced out of the hospital because his family could
not afford health insurance. Most painful, he said, was the time
that his mother arrived home from a hospital in an ambulance, which
sat in front of his house all afternoon while his father went door
to door borrowing money from neighbors to pay for it while his
mother lay mortally ill inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw as a kid what happens when you don't have adequate
health care and when you don't have funds for doctors,'' he said.
``This has a lasting effect. One of the things that is important in
my life is that there be adequate health care for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates feared that Pataki would never support using
tobacco money for the uninsured, given all the competing interests.
</P>
<P>
   But health care experts noted that the governor was once
lukewarm to committing money for uninsured children, then did so
with great fanfare last year by approving the Child Health Plus
program, which insures children of families with somewhat higher
income than the limit for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's budget, $2 billion in state funds was used to
cover the uninsured. Of that, $1.5 billion was used for charity
pools intended to help hospitals that serve that population, and
nearly all the rest to insure children through Child Health Plus.
The Pataki administration plans to spend millions more on
enrollment efforts and marketing campaigns for the program.
</P>
<P>
   While any early promise made in Albany stands a chance of
falling apart by summer, health care experts and advocates said the
bipartisan support in Albany was promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three people make all the decisions in Albany,'' Blair Horner,
the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research
Group said, referring to the governor, the Senate majority leader
and the assembly speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is also hard for me to believe that the governor would turn
his back on the uninsured,'' Horner added, noting that this is the
year that the state's Health Care Reform Act is up for debate and
renewal. A large part of that act is concerned with the charity
pools.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the leaders would specify whose program each
supports, health professional organizations, health care advocates
and antismoking groups have started to descend on the State Capitol
with their ideas for uses of the settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   The most ambitious proposal is a joint venture between the New
York City Health and Hospitals Corp. and 1199, the union run by
Dennis Rivera. Their program, called Family Health Plus, would
offer affordable private coverage to working uninsured New Yorkers
on a sliding-scale basis, aided by the tobacco settlement money.

REEVES APOLOGIZES FOR REOPENING RIFT WITH SHANAHAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.) (EDS: SUBS for stories slugged FBN-BRONCOS and FBN-FALCONS on
master sked.)  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ As the Atlanta Falcons and Denver
Broncos arrived in the Miami area on Sunday to begin workouts for
the Super Bowl, F/Falcons Coach Dan Reeves apologized for ``opening
old wounds last week'' involving his former protege and now rival,
Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said he did not want to discuss history any longer _ only
next Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The problems between Reeves and Shanahan began in the late 1980s
when Reeves, then the Broncos' head coach, began to think that John
Elway, his star quarterback, and Shanahan, his offensive coach,
were plotting plays behind his back. Reeves fired Shanahan for
insubordination after the 1991 season.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves indicated Sunday that he regretted commenting about the
old feud at a news conference last Wednesday. ``It doesn't
accomplish anything talking about it,'' Reeves said at a news
conference in Miami. ``I should be smart enough after 18 years in
this business as a head coach that when people ask you a question,
they're going to make more of it than you thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, speaking at a news conference here, also sought to
avoid further controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make this clear,'' said Shanahan. ``I'm not going to
get into my past relationship with Dan.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver quarterback John Elway was not reluctant to disclose his
opinion about the coaching abilities of both men.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked about the difference in his performance in the six
years since Reeves left, the last three of which have been under
Shanahan. Did he believe it has been better?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' said Elway, ``and I think everyone knows the numbers
back that up. I'm playing much better the last six years than I did
the previous 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Elway reached the Super Bowl three times under Reeves,
the quarterback tossed as many touchdowns as interceptions over the
span, 157. But in the six seasons since Reeves left, Elway, now a
Super Bowl champion who is back for another shot, has thrown 143
touchdowns and had 69 passes intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, meanwhile, said his years as an offensive coordinator
with the 49ers _ after he was fired from Denver _ taught him how to
win the big games. He didn't quite say it was more than he learned
under Reeves, but it was an unmistakable comparison.
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, that he was comfortable this week because
he had put in his game plan last week _ just as the 49ers did for
past Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting in the game plan a week ahead is the way I got used to
doing it in San Francisco,'' said Shanahan. ``It worked, and we're
doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to bring that over to the Broncos, and it worked,'' he
said of last year's winning approach to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan said he could not remember exactly when Reeves put in
his Super Bowl game plans _ only that it wasn't always the same
time.

CHARLES BROWN, 76, BLUES PIANIST AND SINGER 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  By PETER WATROUS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Brown, the singer of the hit ``Merry Christmas Baby''
and a member of Johnny Moore and the Three Blazers, died on
Thursday in Oakland, Calif. Brown, who was 76 and lived in Oakland,
was to have been inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in
March.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, said a spokesman at his
management company.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, toward the end of his career, had benefited from a
revived interest in his art, partly helped by support from singer
Bonnie Raitt. But in the 1940s and 1950s, Brown, as part of the
Three Blazers and on his own, was a star in the new black music
that was coming out of postwar Los Angeles. Though in the last part
of his career Brown played the role of the blues pianist and
singer, he was, as so many of the musicians in the rhythm-and-blues
scene, well versed in jazz, gospel and classical music.
</P>
<P>
   Brown also had a bachelor's degree in chemistry, which led him
to seek work in California during World War II. He landed in Los
Angeles, abandoned chemistry and took work as an elevator man near
Central Avenue, Los Angeles' center of jazz and rhythm-and-blues.
He won a spot at the amateur hour at the Lincoln Theater, much like
the Apollo's in Harlem, and in the audience were Moore, a
guitarist, and his friend Eddie Williams, a bassist. They needed a
pianist and singer, and hired Brown. The group became the Three
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The group became one of the premier examples of the new,
sophisticated rhythm-and-blues that was replacing jazz as popular
music among blacks. Like Nat (King) Cole's trio (which featured
Moore's brother Oscar on guitar), the group mixed swing, blues and
often-advanced harmony, and placed Brown's voice out in front. In
1945 they recorded Brown's composition ``Drifting Blues,'' which
became a hit, and in its introspective, sophisticated way became a
template for a new style.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's singing, casual and with a drawl, was intimate and in
the jazz crooning tradition, even if the group's sound was deeply
based in blues. One sign of the influence of Brown is that Ray
Charles' early recordings are a direct imitation of his style;
others are that Frankie Laine and Kay Starr were regulars at
Brown's recording sessions, and scores of rhythm-and-blues singers
based their careers on his style.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Brown went on his own and began recording under his
name; a year later he married rhythm-and-blues singer Mabel Scott.
In 1951, he had a hit performing ``Black Night,'' and in 1952 he
had another with a tune written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller,
``Hard Times.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next several decades, Brown's style, replaced by more
modern black music, fell out of favor, and by the 1970s Brown was
working as a teacher and janitor. By the end of the '70s, European
record companies were interested in him, and his career flourished.
Until recently, Brown spent much of his time touring and recording.
In the early 1990s, he toured as Ms. Raitt's opening act, and that
brought him to a new market.
</P>
<P>
   There are no survivors.

Hollywood's most famous leading ladies and later a popular radio
star, died on Jan. 18 at the Mayview Nursing Home in Raleigh, N.C.
She was 82 and lived in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Verrill, born in Santa Monica, Calif., was a child of
Hollywood, where her parents were musicians. At the age of 5 months
she appeared in her mother's vaudeville act, and at 3 she made her
first public singing appearance when Paul Whiteman, in whose band
her father used to play, stood her on a piano while she sang ``I
Never Knew I Could Love Anybody'' at the Palais Royale in Times
Square. ``And from that minute, I guess,'' she later said,
``singing was what I wanted to do more than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   At 15, already a veteran of a West Coast band led by Orville
Knapp, she was heard performing in a school play and asked to
audition for an off-screen role singing ``Ten Cents a Dance'' in
Barbara Stanwyck's film of the same name. She beat out more than
300 competitors.
</P>
<P>
   She soon landed work as a professional dubber. Traveling from
John Marshall High School in Los Angeles to Hollywood studios
almost every day after school, she would sing for leading ladies
whose voices were not considered quite up to par.
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned, Ms. Verrill left Hollywood in 1935 for the
``Socony Sketchbook'' on CBS radio and recorded with the Isham
Jones Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The tables seemed to turn in 1937, when she was seen on screen
in ``Walter Wanger's Vogues of 1938,'' starring Warner Baxter and
Joan Bennett. Ms. Verrill sang ``That Old Feeling,'' which became a
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The same year she was cast as the female lead in ``The Goldwyn
Follies'' and taken under the wing of Samuel Goldwyn.
</P>
<P>
   With newly dyed and styled hair, high heels and lifts in her
shoes, Ms. Verrill was presented as ``the second Myrna Loy,'' and
stardom seemed almost a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   But the Goldwyn Co. decided that the similarities between the
two actresses were too strong. Ms. Verrill, who had recorded the
film's soundtrack, suddenly found herself ousted by the actress of
the moment, Andrea Leeds, who had become an overnight success that
year in ``Stage Door.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Verrill abandoned Hollywood in the spring of 1938 for a
career in radio and retired in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Dr. Louis Duddleston, and a son,
James Breyley Jr., both of Raleigh; a daughter, Diana Caldwell of
Anchorage, Alaska, and seven grandchildren.

 &HT;    Falcons let families share players' rooms
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami _ Media members from around the nation seemed surprised
Sunday to learn that Falcons coach Dan Reeves has decided to allow
players' families to stay with them in the team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said it's just more of what his team has done all year.
When the Falcons go on the road, players occasionally take their
wives and children, especially when playing near their hometown or
college.
</P>
<P>
   So several players will have family members staying in the same
room with them at the Airport Hilton and Towers, not far from where
the team will practice at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea because it's what we've done all
year,'' Reeves said. ``We're trying to treat it as a family week.
They understand what their job is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to encourage them not to bring little children, but I
don't think that worked out too well. Some of them will have baby
sitters and nannies. As long as their concentration and focus is
where I think it will be, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Cornelius Bennett, whose family wasn't allowed to
stay with him when he went to four Super Bowls (and lost them all)
with the Bills, thinks it's a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Reeves is treating us like men because he's been doing
that since he got here,'' Bennett said. ``Having my family here is
going to make it easier ... because we're not going to have to
worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Terance Mathis, however, won't have his family in
the same hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and daughter are going to be in a hotel nearby ...
because they know how important the game is to me, and she does not
want to be a distraction,'' he said. ``I just pray to God that the
guys don't let it become a distraction to them because this is the
biggest game of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can spend the rest of the offseason with their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Schedule
</P>
<P>
   Coaches will meet this morning to decide whether to have a light
practice this afternoon. Players will be free to do as they please
until they have to board buses at 1 p.m. to head for the University
of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   They will lift weights and run lightly. If there is any
practice, it will be minimal, as the team will likely run nothing
more than passing drills.
</P>
<P>
   The team will be off Tuesday other than meetings and the
mandatory media day many players loathe.
</P>
<P>
   There was no curfew for the Falcons Sunday night and there will
be none tonight, but players have to be in their rooms by midnight
beginning Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the game plan will be installed in the Tuesday meetings,
but the bulk of it will be inserted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Skip the parties
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and free safety Eugene Robinson have played in seven
prior Super Bowls between them, and they have a message for their
teammates:
</P>
<P>
   Go to bed early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I can speak to the guys (today) and tell them how
not to win a Super Bowl,'' said Bennett, who explained that all
four Buffalo Super Bowl teams were populated by night owls.
``Everything that went on with the Super Bowl, we were caught up
in. It's the biggest party in the world, and we were known as a
party team. We partied too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who is playing in his third consecutive Super Bowl,
including a win with the Packers two years ago over New England,
was wearing his Super Bowl ring Sunday to reinforce his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell everyone, please don't come to practice
tired because you will hear about it,'' he said. ``Nighttime is for
sleeping. (Before Super Bowl XXXI, when the Packers whipped New
England), some of the Patriots were out until 4 o'clock in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting stronger
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who had quadruple-bypass heart surgery Dec. 14, said he
has recovered to ``about 85 or 90 percent of what I was before the
surgery.'' He probably will continue to allow backup quarterback
Steve DeBerg to take plays from quarterbacks coach Jack Burns and
relay them from the sideline to quarterback Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Lineup change
</P>
<P>
   As expected, cornerback Ronnie Bradford will move back into the
starting lineup for the first time since suffering a slight
shoulder separation Dec. 27 against the Dolphins. He'll replace
second-year man Michael Booker, who was beaten by Randy Moss on a
31-yard touchdown pass, and by Matthew Hatchette on a 5-yard TD
pass in the Minnesota game.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was busy fielding many types of questions Sunday,
explaining that his former offensive coordinator and quarterbacks
coach in Arizona, Jerry Rhome, is responsible for much of his
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for 'Rock' teaching me all that stuff,'' he said,
``I'd be in a cheese line somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, who was NFC Offensive Player of the Month in December,
and NFL Offensive Player of the Week after the Vikings game, has a
118.6 passer rating in the last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, on Wednesday, his wife, Diane, gave birth to the couple's
third daughter, Brynn Brodie Chandler. Her middle name is taken
from Diane's maiden name. She is the daugther of former NFL
quarterback John Brodie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely on a roll right now that doesn't happen very
often to anybody,'' he said. ``The way the season has gone, just
having a beautiful baby girl four days ago, and then the Super Bowl
the next week. Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   Old times
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said when he got the team hotel, he had a message from
Jim Kelly, he talked to Thurman Thomas, and he will talk to Bruce
Smith. They were all former teammates with the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question they're on my mind,'' he said. ``They're family,
they're blood.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Rich Brooks, who has done an outstanding
job turning the Falcons defense around in the past two seasons, is
almost sure not to be considered for any NFL head coaching
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Teams aren't allowed to interview coaches still in the playoffs,
and by next Monday it's possible every vacancy will be filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair,'' said Brooks, who coached the Rams in '95-96,
``but life's not fair.''

AN `UNBELIEVABLE' ROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ As if he needed to remind anyone, David
Duval is golf's dominant figure and has been for some time. There
are 59 more reasons to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   What the soft-spoken native of Jacksonville, Fla., did to prove
it was shoot a stunning, 13-under-par 59 on Sunday to defeat Steve
Pate by a stroke and win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic at PGA
West's Arnold Palmer course.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, starting the day seven shots behind leader Fred Funk,
went 31-28 for his 59, the third such score in PGA Tour history. Al
Geiberger had the first one in 1977 in Memphis, and Chip Beck
equaled that in the 1991 Las Vegas Invitational. There also were
two 59s on last year's Nike Tour (by Notah Begay and Doug Donakey).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable . . . everything,'' said Bob Tway, one of
Duval's playing partners. ``Just awesome. What did he shoot on the
front nine? Thirty-one? It was so good I can't keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't a lucky round,'' said Jeff Maggert, who also was
in Duval's group. ``That was pure skill.''
</P>
<P>
   To give Duval's accomplishment even more perspective, he has won
nine tournaments in his last 28 starts. He became the tour's first
$1 million winner this year ($1,008,000) _ and he has played in
only two events. He also won the season-opening Mercedes
Championships, worth $468,000, in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   When Curtis Strange became the tour's first single-season $1
million winner in 1988 ($1,147,644), it took him 24 events to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Duval started Sunday's round with birdies on three of his first
four holes. He then birdied Nos. 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16 before
finishing his day with an eagle on the par-5, 543-yard 18th. He
lofted a 5-iron from 205 yards to within six feet and made the
putt.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, not known for showing his emotions on the course,
couldn't help but celebrate after his final putt fell in the hole.
He said he knew what was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that you don't think about,'' he said. ``You
might get some wild hair out there one day when you shoot a 63, but
to do it, it is just not really something I am sure I expected to
do in my career. Certainly not in tournament golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more excited about the score. . . . I'm not going to sit
here and lie to you. I was more excited about the score than having
the chance to win the tournament. I mean, you know, kind of like a
double bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly had aspirations of winning, but the 59 was first
and foremost in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But it almost was not good enough. Pate, who held the lead for
most of the day before Duval caught fire, said he was aware of
Duval's feat when he looked at a scoreboard on the 16th hole. He
trailed by one stroke when he walked to the 18th tee and hit a good
drive, but he left his second shot in a greenside bunker. He
blasted out to 18 feet and his bid for a tying birdie lipped out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pushed it just a hair,'' he said. ``I thought it had a
chance because it was breaking left . . . it was going in on the
high side. I felt it had a good chance of going in anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval said he felt almost apologetic about his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, I feel bad for Steve because I absolutely stole a
golf tournament from him,'' he said. ``You know it happens. It's
happened to me. I mean, you tell a guy he is starting the day like
a shot behind, shoot 6-under and get beat by a 59, and he's going
to tell you you're crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate said it might have been a case of being in the wrong place
at the wrong time, despite his closing, 6-under 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I played well,'' he said. ``I hit a lot of good shots,
just not enough of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, on the other hand, had more than enough. He hit only 11
fairways but needed just 23 putts. He had nine birdies inside five
feet, including one of only six inches on the par-4, 364-yard 16th.
</P>
<P>
   The Palmer Course, regarded as the toughest of the four courses
used in this year's event, had been yielding an average of 71.656
strokes a round before Duval took it apart.

A FAIR TRADE: VIRGINIA VICE, NEW YORK JUNK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: Va.) 
(ko) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A statesman has finally emerged to make peace between
New York City and Virginia. While politicians and journalists have
been busy escalating the garbage war, Jim Spencer has come forth
with a bold diplomatic initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, a columnist for The Daily Press in Newport News, Va.,
is one of the many Virginians offended by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
recent comment about their state's ``reciprocal relationship'' with
New York. Virginians benefit from New York's cultural and financial
institutions, the mayor explained, and New Yorkers benefit by
sending trash barges to landfills in rural Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides theaters and banks,'' Spencer wrote in response, ``New
York has some crackerjack crack houses, much better than anything
Virginia can offer. And despite Giuliani's attempt to clean up
Times Square, his city has more whores and dirty-book stores. In
the spirit of letting each place do what it does best, I say we
round up all of our pushers, prostitutes and pornographers, stick
'em on a barge and float 'em up the Hudson River.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is the price of peace, how can we say no? The deal makes
sense for both sides. Virginians could assuage their wounded pride
without giving up the profits of their trash business, as their
politicians threatened to do by outlawing barges from New York. And
if Virginia's vice merchants moved north, New York's tourist
industry would profit from the surge of Virginians desperate to
continue practicing their favorite sins.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's exiled entrepreneurs might even reinvigorate New
York's beleaguered vice industry, although this is unlikely. The
most enterprising ones have already come here. Those determined to
make it big _ to be the next Bob Guccione or Mayflower Madam or
French Connection _ did not pursue their dreams by sticking around
Newport News. The vice business has long benefited from the free
flow of people and goods across state borders.
</P>
<P>
   So does every other business, but for some reason politicians
refuse to believe that's true for trash. They can't keep their
hands off garbage even though they've repeatedly made a mess of
things by interfering. It was public officials, after all, who
built and ran the notorious old municipal dumps without linings or
environmental safeguards. Then, when Federal regulations forced the
dumps to close in the 1980's, politicians were sure that America
faced a permanent shortage of landfill space, so they attacked the
``garbage crisis'' with recycling programs and incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   But the politicians' alternatives have turned out to be
embarrassingly expensive now that there's a glut of cheap space in
new landfills with environmental safeguards. These privately
operated landfills have been welcomed by rural communities that
appreciate the economic benefits of interstate commerce in trash.
Some critics argue for better enforcement of safety standards for
the trucks and barges carrying trash, but that can be done without
closing the border or having politicians decree how many tons of
trash can enter their domain.
</P>
<P>
   The chief garbage problem in need of politicians' attention is
the one created by their overpriced incinerators and inefficient
recycling programs. That ultimately may be why they're so upset by
the brisk business at the landfills. The landfills' success raises
an irritating question, as Spencer noted in his column.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why recycle?'' he wrote. ``If this state has enough landfill
space to dispose of 1.6 million tons of New York City's solid waste
each year, what am I doing digging up to my elbows in chicken
bones, used Kleenex and grapefruit rinds to snag a No. 2 plastic
jug that I inadvertently threw away?''
</P>
<P>
   A similar question occurred to me several years ago, when I
stood at a huge landfill in Charles City County, Va., and looked at
recycling bins filled with cans and bottles painstakingly sorted by
local residents. The landfill manager would have been happy to dump
them in his mountain of trash, but he was required to pay a trucker
to take them 20 miles away to a recycling center, which demanded a
further fee to take the stuff off his hands.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned this story to Spencer during the course of our
negotiations over his diplomatic initiative, and I suggested adding
a sweetener to the Virginia-New York Garbage Peace Pact:
Virginians, besides having the right to send New York bargeloads of
vice merchants in exchange for garbage, would be freed of any
responsibility to recycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like a win-win to me,'' he said.

 &HT;    Broncos' edge? They might be over it this time
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ What this Super Bowl thing looks like
right now is a gigantic retirement party for a guy who has yet to
say good-bye.
</P>
<P>
   Pass the stone crabs, please.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies a potentially significant problem for the
Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   The guest of honor, of course, is their quarterback, John Elway,
who only a year ago in the same gig finally won himself an NFL
title. In the aftermath of that success, it was widely supposed
that Elway would take his leave and call an end to a Hall of Fame
career at last substantiated by victory in The Big Game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Elway, whose record in Super Bowl outings had been 0-3,
decided to return to give it another go.
</P>
<P>
   And here he is.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas Elway and the Broncos arrived in San Diego as
double-digit underdogs to the then-defending champion Green Bay
Packers the last time around, they turned up Sunday night in South
Florida as favorites by a touchdown over the Atlanta Falcons this
time around.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, quite frankly, is a better now than it was a season ago
when it won the championship from a wild-card starting position in
the AFC. The Broncos went 14-2 during the recently completed
regular season, and thus earned themselves a bye and two home games
as a route to Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   But there is, so far, no sign of last year's desperate
motivation _ most of which was rooted in a Win One for John mantra
_ with these Broncos. Such a feeling of relief can, in endeavors
athletic or otherwise, be a very good or a very bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   The company line, voiced by Elway and other members of the one
Purple Gang that did qualify for the finale (see: Minnesota
Vikings, absent), is exactly what you'd expect it to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely takes the pressure off,'' Elway said. ``That's a
big relief. There's not such a negative feeling. The focus isn't on
what we haven't done rather than what we have. It's a lot more
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Elway's considered opinion that last year's Super success
is what pushed this year's Broncos to their level of excellence.
That sentiment was echoed by Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe,
running back Terrell Davis and linebacker Bill Romanowski during
interview sessions inside a huge white tent next to the team's
hotel headquarters for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe's contention is that the Broncos' performance through the
regular season, which included a 13-0 start, should stand as proof
that nobody is ``buying into the idea'' that Denver is complacent.
</P>
<P>
   Davis used retired Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan's six
championships to make the point that ``when you win one, you want
another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanowski, who should know (he played on back-to-back
championship teams with the San Francisco 49ers), said, ``Last year
was such a high that everybody wanted to be in this position
again.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is well and good, but it would do well for the
Broncos to build themselves toward a sharpness. Because, right now,
they look a little dull. And don't think Denver head coach Mike
Shanahan hasn't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said we were at a disadvantage last year, and
I think it made us hungrier,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that could just be a boss asking his employees to forget
about the party at least until the retirement is official.
</P>
<P>
   It's like my mother-in-law, a terrific woman who's in town and
knows little about football but a whole bunch about life, said the
other day when her 1-year-old granddaughter was throwing a tantrum:
``An axe with some temper to it always cuts better.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan might do well to use the line.

a chance to get that close to the fans, to really make eye contact
with them -- to see the joy in their eyes.'' (Jose R. Lopez/New

bitter that her dreams of political influence never blossomed, had

pitifully, for luxury items such as a mink coat and a Cadillac.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the constant scrambling among Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani's aides to demonstrate their loyalty, few could match
Bruce Teitelbaum. He began as the administration's liaison to the
city's Jewish community, then gradually ascended to become
Giuliani's trouble-shooter, advance man and surrogate enforcer _
all the duties expected of a chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   As Teitelbaum rose within the administration, so did the access
of his wife, Suri Kasirer, a public relations consultant and
lobbyist. Time and again she followed through on her claims of
expertise in government relations by lobbying or setting up
meetings with top city officials on behalf of her clients. The
officials, of course, were her husband's colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening her consulting firm in 1995, Ms. Kasirer, 40, has
assembled at least two dozen clients, many of whom regularly seek
city money, contracts or permits. City officials say that Ms.
Kasirer violated no laws by making good use of her political
connections, and there is no evidence that she has. But in
government and politics, access to power is a tantalizing _ and
lucrative _ asset that can give the few who have it at least the
appearance of having an edge over others.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Suri Kasirer provides insight into how things can
and often do work in city government _ even in the administration
of a mayor who long ago said he was different.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she's done is not illegal, but there are definitely
downsides to it,'' said Gene Russianoff, a senior attorney for the
New York Public Interest Research Group. ``It creates a cynicism
about government, because it breeds a sense that government is all
about connections and access.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kasirer and Teitelbaum, who have been together since 1993
and married since 1997, declined to comment. And the Giuliani
administration has been unable to say how many contacts Ms. Kasirer
has had with city officials. But in one example, Ms. Kasirer made
an unusual request to Joseph J. Lhota, the deputy mayor for
operations and arguably the second most powerful person in the
administration. That request was on behalf of Victim Services, a
nonprofit social service agency that paid Ms. Kasirer $12,000 to
represent it last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suri called Joe probably sometime in early fall and asked Joe
to expedite a contract because they were having trouble meeting
their payroll,'' said Colleen Roche, the mayor's press secretary.
``Joe said: `No, I do not expedite contracts. No.'''
</P>
<P>
   The episode, as presented by the administration, would seem to
support Giuliani's contention that his administration has provided
no special treatment to Ms. Kasirer's clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this administration, decisions are made on the merits,''
Ms. Roche said. ``People with legitimate concerns always get a fair
hearing, whether or not they are represented by lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kasirer's dealings with city officials came to light last
month, when The Daily News reported that she had lobbied the
Giuliani administration on several matters last year, even though
she had not registered as a lobbyist with the City Clerk's office.
The Daily News also reported last week that the administration had
granted special parking privileges to one of Ms. Kasirer's clients,
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., last summer, but Giuliani said that Ms.
Kasirer had done nothing to influence that decision. Ms. Kasirer
did register after the fact, for 1998, an action that a lawyer for
the city clerk's office said put her in compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
   In registering for 1999, Ms. Kasirer indicated her lobbying
would begin on Jan. 11. The date is significant because it marked
the first day that her husband would not be working with the
administration. He resigned as chief of staff to oversee the
fund-raising efforts for Giuliani's political future.
</P>
<P>
   On that first day, Jan. 11, Ms. Kasirer introduced Lhota to a
client who wants to transform a Manhattan homeless shelter that the
city plans to close into an upscale residence for the elderly. That
client, Castle Senior Living of Teaneck, N.J., is paying her a
$4,000-a-month retainer.
</P>
<P>
   In her filing, Ms. Kasirer indicated that she planned to meet
with many high-ranking city officials this year, on behalf of 11
clients who will pay her lobbying fees totaling as much as
$350,000. But amid growing questions about her business last week,
Mayor Giuliani banned Ms. Kasirer from lobbying members of his
administration. He later modified that decision, saying that two
other employees of Kasirer Consulting could still do business with
city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor asserted that neither Ms. Kasirer nor members of his
administration had done anything wrong, but he said he was
``sensitive'' to the fact that her activities had raised
suspicions. ``Technically, Bruce Teitelbaum is gone from city
government,'' he said last Thursday. ``But since he is closely
connected to me, it seemed to me that the better part of reason was
that she should not participate in any lobbying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kasirer's dealings with City Hall would not be the subject
of scrutiny had she not married Teitelbaum, 35, the son of a
textile manufacturer who began as a low-level campaign worker for
Giuliani in the early 1990's and aggressively rose through the
ranks. As chief of staff, Teitelbaum helped plan Giuliani's daily
schedule, oversaw special events like the recent victory parade for
the Yankees and let people know if the mayor was unhappy with them.
For example, people close to Teitelbaum say that he summoned Ruben
Franco, the recently departed chairman of the New York City Housing
Authority, to City Hall last month and asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997, Teitelbaum married Ms. Kasirer, the
daughter of an Orthodox rabbi from Queens. Ms. Kasirer had worked
for a synagogue, a national Jewish organization and several
politicians, including Mario M. Cuomo, the former governor. By all
accounts, she knew many city and state officials long before she
married Teitelbaum.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has always been in the political circuit,'' said State
Assemblyman Scott Stringer, a Manhattan Democrat who knows Ms.
Kasirer. ``She was definitely a successful political person before
she met Bruce.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her husband, Ms. Kasirer has worked almost exclusively
for Democrats, who traditionally have controlled the city's
political establishment. She spent two years as an adviser on
Jewish issues to Cuomo, and she has raised money for the
congressional races of Carolyn McCarthy, Edolphus Towns and Melinda
Katz. For several years after opening her firm, she focused on
organizing events and doing public relations. But with her keen
understanding of governmental operations, Ms. Kasirer wanted to
expand her portfolio, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to be involved in substantive things, not just
fluff,'' said Meyer S. Frucher, a former aide to Cuomo who has
remained close to Ms. Kasirer. ``And people knew her. One of the
benefits of working in government jobs at a significant level is
having the opportunity to showcase yourself to people in a lot of
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Frucher noted that as more women find prominent jobs in business
and politics, couples are increasingly faced with potential
conflicts of interest. ``The answer is not to preclude people from
pursuing their livelihood,'' he said, ``but to be mindful of these
potential conflicts.''

UNDATED: potential conflicts.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Ms. Kasirer's critics murmur that her marriage advanced
her career, her supporters insist that she is successful in her own
right. They describe her as intelligent, sociable and ambitious _
useful traits in a lobbyist, whatever her connections.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the clients that Ms. Kasirer listed in her lobbyist
registration papers did not return phone calls last week. Others
said they hired her because they thought she could get them better
visibility at City Hall _ but not because of her husband's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it's something that hurt,'' Carl Weisbrod, the
president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, said of Ms.
Kasirer's marriage to Teitelbaum. ``But we were always careful to
use her in a way that would not represent a conflict of interest.''
Weisbrod's organization, a business improvement district, is paying
Ms. Kasirer $2,500 a month for advice on ``how the city government
is going to react to something,'' for public relations and for
planning events, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lipman, the associate director of the 92d Street Y, said
his organization hired Ms. Kasirer because ``we are looking to
enhance our visibility and make sure the opinion makers are aware
of the work we do.'' The Y will pay Ms. Kasirer $15,000 over the
next eight months to help it secure city money, according to Ms.
Kasirer's filings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suri is an outstanding communicator,'' Lipman said. `We chose
her based on that expertise, not who her husband is.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say that Ms. Kasirer's connections to City Hall were
obvious, even if she did not advertise them, and that potential
clients could not help but consider them an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't have to toss Bruce's name around,'' said a friend
of the couple who asked not to be identified. ``Just going to a
party as Bruce's wife gives her incredible exposure to a lot of
important people, considering the circles they travel in. She can
get clients without saying a word.''
</P>
<P>
   In another example of Ms. Kasirer's dealings with City Hall, she
arranged for Randy Levine, another deputy mayor, to meet last fall
with the president of the Fairmont Group, a developer that wanted
permission to build a shopping mall in Brooklyn. But that proposal
had already been opposed by the administration, city officials
said, and Levine merely listened to the developer talk about
possible revisions.
</P>
<P>
   She also arranged for officials from the city Department of
Environmental Protection to meet last month with attorneys for
Brooklyn Resource Recovery Inc., a client that the city had fined
for environmental violations. ``Basically, the company was advised
how to comply with the law,'' said Ms. Roche, the mayor's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche insisted that Ms. Kasirer's role in both incidents did
not constitute lobbying because she was simply arranging meetings.
In any case, both companies have retained Ms. Kasirer to work for

   Cuomo was among several people who questioned the mayor's
decision to ban Ms. Kasirer from lobbying the administration,
saying it only enhanced the appearance that she had done something

   ``If you show me that she got a deal that she shouldn't have
gotten for these clients, then that's wrong,'' Cuomo said. ``But
there's no proof of that. She knew the mayor well and so she

John Elway's touring around Mile High Stadium after the Denver
Broncos' defeat of the New York Jets in the AFC championship game,
convinced many who saw it that they were witnessing a farewell
journey. ``That was fun,'' Elway said of his lap around Mile High.

a chance to get that close to the fans, to really make eye contact
with them -- to see the joy in their eyes.'' (Jose R. Lopez/New

Still agile but no longer a pup, John Elway, 38, the quarterback of
the Denver Broncos, will appear in his fifth Super Bowl in 16
years, a record for a quarterback. Elway has been a part of the
American sports theater for so long that he is one of our most
easily recognized athletes -- a national icon, and simultaneously a
peerless symbol for Denver's expansive growth as a western capital
these last two decades. (Jose R. Lopez/New York Times Photo)

described herself as ``the most hated woman in America,'' in
diaries that will be auctioned off, wrote on Nov. 7, 1980, ``Today
for the 1st time in 62 years, I got my own bed ....'' The diaries
are a sad chronicle of a yearning, unhappy life. Mrs. O'Hair,
bitter that her dreams of political influence never blossomed, had
harsh judgments of almost everyone around her, yet dreamed
pitifully, for luxury items such as a mink coat and a Cadillac.

adapted from a smaller model made by Elie Nadelman in 1931 and
``Sculpture'' (1963) by Edward Higgins. (Chris Maynard/New York

COMMENTARY: CAN THE NATION SAY `PRESIDENT QUAYLE' WITHOUT
GIGGLING?
</HEADLINE>
  By GAIL COLLINS  (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has spent the last six years demonstrating that in
presidential politics, there are few things more useful than low
public expectations. Now we have the perfect test case to see if
the same rule will apply to the race in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle is back.
</P>
<P>
   ``On February 3d I will have a major announcement in my home
state of Indiana,'' said the former vice president, who actually
lives in Arizona. This was on the Larry King talk show, a campaign
stop that has become as much a part of the traditional process as
Iowa or New Hampshire. King listened politely, and then informed
Quayle that one political handicapper ``thinks your prospects are
poor.'' But the good news, King added, is that ``on one level,
you're not a joke like you once were.''
</P>
<P>
   In the social conservative segment of the Republican Party, Dan
Quayle is anything but a joke. He gets a warm, enthusiastic
response for his standard speech about the nation's hunger for
moral leadership. He has lost his famous deer-in-the-headlights
look, but his aura is still rather soft and affable. In a party
where so many of the leading lights look like cranky young men,
this is no small advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of America has not given a thought to Quayle since he left
the vice presidency in 1992, thus missing such career highlights as
the Frito-Lay commercial and the revelation that George Bush wrote
``I blew it'' in his diary after he selected Quayle as his running
mate. Quayle has written an autobiography that includes a chapter
on the immortal day when he misspelled ``potato'' during an
appearance at a grade-school spelling bee. ``The fact is that the
press wasn't sure how to spell it either,'' he complained. He has
also been making speeches, and denying that he ever said his trip
to Latin America made him wish he had studied more Latin in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   The upside of spending four years in a vice presidency in which,
as Quayle admits, ``the jokes were the defining moments,'' is that
it lowers the bar for all future public performances. People may
come away impressed if he simply demonstrates that he knows the
difference between Europe and Vermont. On the downside, Republicans
who know him well and feel he was treated unfairly by the media
also tend to question whether a politician who once allowed himself
to be mugged so thoroughly has what it takes to survive a modern
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other presidential hopefuls, Quayle prepared for
this race by going on TV to announce that he has never cheated on
his wife. But he has not quite figured out how to adapt his
family-values message to the discovery that the public does not
want to hear another word about politicians' sex lives. On the King
show, Quayle vowed that he would hold Al Gore accountable for the
administration's policies, not the ``moral issues,'' which sounded
like a really great deal for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he made the rounds of the cable stations announcing
his plans to announce, he started suggesting that the vice
president should have resigned in protest over the Lewinsky mess.
That would have left the Senate facing the prospect of replacing
Clinton with Speaker Dennis Hastert, a man with approximately three
minutes' experience leading anything larger than a congressional
office staff.
</P>
<P>
   This infant presidential campaign has already demonstrated how
thoroughly Bill Clinton has muddied the differences between right
and left _ last week, after all, the country watched the Republican
congressional majority sit stonily on its hands while the president
proposed paying down the national debt. Quayle seems ready to
confuse people even further. He is running as an angry middle-aged
populist who believes too much of the nation's prosperity is going
to investors. ``If you own stock, if you're a CEO of a company, if
you've got stock options . . . you're fat and happy,'' he told
King. ``But I tell you what, if you're out there working every day
with your hands, teaching, whatever the case may be, you are having
a tough time making it.''
</P>
<P>
   When a bemused King suggested that Republicans were supposed to
like it when stockholders made money, Quayle said that the really
rich Americans ``are Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   If Quayle does make it to the top tier of Republican candidates,
he may wind up running against George W. Bush, the political
equivalent of one of those puzzles about the sister of the son of
my uncle's brother. He is sniping at Bush's ``compassionate
conservatism'' line. (``It is an attack and a criticism on
conservatives,'' Quayle said, ``and conservatives are compassionate
and that is my criticism.'') He seems less like a joke these days
than an apparition from the past _ the long-ago era of 1992, when
we did not know that the two things American voters do not seem to
care about are the adulterous behavior of the president and tax
cuts.

   Dear Diary &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flying back from Mexico on New Year's Day, my friend and I were
given United States Customs Declaration cards. The cards, to our
amusement, instructed us to sing, rather than sign, after listing
our purchases. We spent most of the flight composing a song and
when we got to the customs area at Kennedy, I showed the agent the
card and asked him if we should sing.
</P>
<P>
   He looked it over and then said with a straight face: ``It's the
new holiday policy. Go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   So we sang:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``Our eight days in Mexico, we had a shopping spree. We bought:
</P>
<P>
   Eight woven baskets
</P>

<P>
   Six margaritas

   Benjamin Sachs' exchange with a customs agent on his return from
Paris was on a more esoteric level.
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``What were you doing in Paris?''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs: ``Attending a conference on the biology of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``I didn't know that behavior had a biology.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs: ``Yes, for example, the brain is part of your biology and
it controls your behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent: ``I always thought my mother controlled my behavior.''

   The man on crutches, in soiled and worn clothing, got on the F

   The passenger next to Chester Roberts reached out and touched
the importuning man on the arm.

   Robin Gottlieb's small white poodle, Finette, attracts a good
deal of admiration on their walks in Central Park. Most people ask,
``What is his name?'' apparently assuming that all dogs are male. A
few observant types ask, ``What is her name?''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Gottlieb's favorite inquiry came from a girl of about 8.
``What is his or her name?'' she asked.  &QL;

<P>
   I look in the mirror and what do I see?

   I see an old lady who used to be me.

<P>
   I see a lined face tatted like lace
</P>
<P>
   A hint of surprise in once-intense eyes
</P>
<P>
   The cheekbones prevail and hold up the skin
</P>
<P>
   Inclined at this age to lean toward the chin.
</P>
<P>
   I toss my head back as if to retread
</P>
<P>
   The path that has led to this worn-out head.
</P>
<P>
   The body I know can be covered with cloth
</P>
<P>
   But the face can't conceal all that life has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   I turn from the mirror, my step is still spry
</P>
<P>
   Is there more to me than meets the eye?

downtown.''
</P>

   The ingenuous answer didn't merit a job offer.

   There was a long line on Mercer Street on a cold, snowy day.
Bargain hunters were waiting to be let in to Wolfman Gold's

   Still, Madeline hadn't seen ``Cats,'' and she was interested,
but after being told that it was the longest-running show on
Broadway she voiced a serious reservation. ``Maybe I should watch a
tape first,'' she said. ``I don't know if I can sit through the
whole thing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roslyn Bancorp Inc. has agreed to buy the TR
Financial Corp. under revised terms of a stock deal that seemed
dead just a few weeks ago, people close to the talks said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of the two companies, both based on Long Island,
would create the fourth-largest savings bank in New York state,
with 25 branches and $7.7 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Roslyn will pay 2.05 shares for every share of TR Financial,
which would value the deal at $766.7 million based on Friday's
closing stock prices. Shares of Roslyn closed at $21.25, up 81.25
cents. TR Financial fell 18.75 cents, to $36.6875.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, TR Financial, the parent of Roosevelt Savings
Bank, said it would end an agreement reached in May to be bought by
Roslyn unless the offer was raised to 2.1137 shares from 2.05.
</P>
<P>
   Although TR Financial will not get the higher exchange rate, it
does get to name an additional director to the board of the
combined company and gets concessions on some management positions.

JAZZ REVIEW: Ellington, Revered And Revised 
 (ms) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The audience paid a stiff price to hear Duke
Ellington's pioneering work ``Black, Brown and Beige'' last
Thursday at Carnegie Hall. Programmed as the second half of the
concert, the rarely heard piece, played by the Carnegie Hall Jazz
Band, was the bait to hold on to the audience through the first
half, a set of rearrangements of pieces by Ellington and Billy
Strayhorn.
</P>
<P>
   Rearranging Ellington and Strayhorn is an exercise in hubris,
and perhaps can be pulled off one tune at a time. But to throw the
compositions together was spectacularly misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington is quoted in the program notes as saying, ``What's
wrong with it the way it is?'' when asked if he would give
permission to have ``Black, Brown and Beige'' orchestrated for a
classical orchestra. That same question can be asked about the
works that began the program, which were rearranged out of the
extraordinary into the utterly normal.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to do this can be attributed to the ideology that seems
to rule the repertory movement. It is manifested in the idea that
the new is somehow more valid than the old, as if the originals,
well played, can't elicit a new response every time they're heard,
the way one sees or feels something new when viewing a familiar
masterpiece in a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Carnegie Hall's rearrangements are admirable, but in
this case the result was a bad case of the Icarus syndrome; the
proximity to Ellington burned the new works to the ground. Under
the trumpeter Jon Faddis' leadership, the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band
is a brass orchestra without much dynamic subtlety, which is ideal
for some material, but the Ellington orchestra was first and
foremost a band that relied on its reeds for much of its textural
richness, and on subtlety of execution.
</P>
<P>
   When the conductor Maurice Peress came out to direct the band
after intermission, things changed. He had richer material to work
with. The first third of ``Black, Brown and Beige'' is simply
beautiful, with all sorts of melodies popping out of the thick
orchestrations, and subtle repetitions of themes wafting through
the three parts of the movement. Ellington's subtitle for the piece
was ``A Tone Parallel to the History of the Negro in America,'' and
the composition is a modernist collage with rapid tempo and
metrical changes and abrupt textural shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black, Brown and Beige'' closed an epoch in Ellington's
composing, and in it one hears the past, voicings and textures that
hint at his history as a dance music composer. And it suggests the
riches that are about to come; as such, it's a piece that for all
its complexity suggests the future in which Ellington had a fuller
control over long-form compositions.
</P>
<P>
   The piece loses focus in its second and third movements, though
it has moments of loveliness. It feels, like many collage pieces,
arbitrarily full of juxtapositions. Still, ``Black, Brown and
Beige'' brims with gorgeous music and should be played more often.
It's valuable historically, and it shows an Ellington who had
arrived at a new position by discarding an old self. He was diving
into the future, a future he produced himself.

   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge football coach Ron Ponciano
is confident university president Blenda Wilson will decide to
place an 8,000-seat football facility on the school's North Campus.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Ponciano will learn the level of commitment
the university has toward football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any doubt, or any question in my mind,'' Ponciano
said. ``I honestly feel that we're going to have the stadium on the
North Campus. I have total confidence that's going to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   On numerous occasions, Ponciano has talked about the meaning of
an on-campus stadium, of it being the last major stumbling block in
keeping the Matadors from contending for a national title year in
and year out.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has talked about constructing an $8 million facility, but
residents who live near the campus have voiced opposition. They are
concerned about noise and crime while wondering what other events
might be held at the stadium besides football.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the 12-member site committee voted to recommend
an on-campus site and an off-campus site, though they were supposed
to recommend one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended a facility on the North Campus _
approximately 75 yards south of the North Campus Stadium location
just north of Lassen Street _ and a renovation of Pierce College.
The committee also voted to include the residents' preference in
its report to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman David Honda said he would need approximately
30 days to write the report and turn it over to Wilson. It's
unclear how long Wilson will take before choosing a location.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do fully understand about the fears of the community on the
issues,'' Ponciano said. ``If you took a picture of that whole room
(the night of the meeting), they would all say, `Hey, we don't mind
if there's just football there.' Do you think I want a bunch of
things going on at the football field? I agree with them on that. I
don't want a bunch of stuff going on.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready, aim, smile: An ESPN film crew was on campus last week
to shoot a commercial that's set to air in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The subject deals with what kids are willing to go through early
in their sports careers to be successful later, and at higher
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The all-sports network stopped by the track to shoot a little
girl repeatedly carrying a starting block back to the starting
line. They also were at the football field to film ``players''
hitting a blocking sled, and were in the CSUN gym locker room to
tape a swimmer shaving his head before a meet.
</P>
<P>
   __ Making the grade: Programs get blamed and sometimes lambasted
for poor academic performances, so it's only fair to recognize when
things go well.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said 23 of his players achieved a 3.0 or better GPA
during the fall semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took over here they had five kids with a 3.0 or
better,'' Ponciano said. ``Obviously, it's something I'm very
excited about.''

   The Washington Post announced Sunday that it would begin
publishing color photographs on its front page on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With this move, The Washington Post, the nation's fifth-largest
daily with an average weekday circulation of 759,122, joins most of
the nation's major newspapers in bringing color photographs and
illustrations to the front page.
</P>
<P>
   In a short front-page article by Leonard Downie Jr., the
newspaper's executive editor, The Post said its new printing
presses would enable it to publish color photographs and
illustrations on the front of its sports section as well and to
expand the use of color throughout the paper this year. The
newspaper, which is owned by the Washington Post Co., already
publishes some color advertisements, as well as color photographs
and illustrations in some of its feature sections.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times, the nation's fourth-largest daily,
introduced color to its front page on Oct. 16, 1997.

 &HT;    Spielberg, Kelley creations take home top prizes at Golden
Globes
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' gunned down the competition, winning as
best dramatic picture at Sunday night's Golden Globe Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey (``The Truman Show'') got the respect he wanted.
Newcomer Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth'') beat old pros Meryl Streep
and Susan Sarandon. Gwyneth Paltrow struck gold in another
Elizabethan role: ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which also won as best
comedy/musical. And producer David E. Kelley nailed both top TV
awards with his lawyer series ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Carrey's win, Sunday night's ceremony lacked major
surprises or upsets. It was the usual slick, disposable
entertainment. With its glitz, gags and galloping pace, the show
has turned into the anti-Oscars, the goofier Emmys; the Globes
recognize achievement in both film and television.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Camryn Manheim (a supporting actress winner for ``The
Practice'') called it ``the greatest party of the year.'' Well, it
was definitely a party _ and the guests didn't take themselves too
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Nabbing his award, Michael Caine summed up some of his past
movies: ``I made a lot of crap,'' he said. ``And a lot of money.''
Presenters Kim Basinger and John Travolta be-bopped across the
stage. Ed Harris accepted his statue with a toothpick in his teeth.
And presenter Christine Lahti strolled out with toilet paper on her
shoe. Lahti was named a winner last year while in the bathroom, in
case you forgot. If you did, last night's telecast took us into
that very restroom as Dick Clark narrated in rapturous tones. Well,
after all, ``There's Something About Mary'' was nominated, so
toilet humor seemed a natural.
</P>
<P>
   The show had its serious moments. Winning ``Ryan'' director
Steven Spielberg confessed, ``I never believe I'm ever gonna win
anything.'' Michael J. Fox, who last year announced he has
Parkinson's Disease, thanked his doctors in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the lifetime achievement award, Jack Nicholson seemed
to personify the evening with his mix of flash, talent, and
slightly seedy charm. Telling risque stories about Joan Crawford
and Rita Hayworth, he said, ``I like fun, what can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   So the question remains, does anybody take the Globes that
seriously? Yes and no. They're awarded by the 90-odd members of the
Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Many of these ``journalists''
have other day jobs, and write only occasionally about movies. In
Nicholson's words, ``a loose group of guys and gals.'' They once
gave non-talent Pia Zadora an award for her stinker flick
``Butterfly,'' but have inched toward respectability _or at least
network visibility _ in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's show was cross-generational, honoring longtimers like
Faye Dunaway (``Gia'') and Gregory Peck (``Moby Dick'') while
anointing hot, ``hip'' newcomers like ``Felicity'' star Keri
Russell. ``I think I won one of these in 1947,'' Peck said, holding
his new award. ``And it was very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globes are considered a semi-reliable forecaster for Oscar
nominations, to be announced Feb. 9. In his speech, Carrey even
made a ``remember-me'' quip about the Academy. But let's admit what
the show is really about: a chance to watch celebrities perform
with no chance for a second take. Will Gwyneth cry (yep). Will
presenter Melanie Griffith have a meltdown while struggling to read
the Teleprompter. (Nope, but it looked close.) What will Jack
Nicholson riff about next? You never knew, and that was worth
watching for.

PHILLIPS A BIG HIT IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Things weren't perfect for Danny Phillips at Cal
State Fullerton, so he left after one season.
</P>
<P>
   The world wasn't wonderful for Phillips at Pierce College, one
of the reasons why the remarkably talented kid didn't know where he
was going to school until August. Kentucky courted him, but not
many others because his production never equaled his potential.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Cal State Northridge coach Mike Batesole comes in.
He didn't care about Phillips' previous college baseball life
because it has no bearing on what he can do in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Frauds show themselves to be frauds no matter the situation, and
they do so in a short time. So Phillips, a Chatsworth High
graduate, lasted through fall practice with CSUN, a compliment to
his character.
</P>
<P>
   And he flashed the brilliant talent contained in his 6-foot-3,
195-pound frame Sunday afternoon in a 19-14 loss to San Francisco.
He smacked a pair of three-run homers and had two singles, though
the Matadors (2-1) failed to earn the series sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batesole fits the kind of coach I need, or needed, to grow up
as a baseball player,'' Phillips said. ``He's helped me a lot,
especially the mental (part) of hitting and giving us a certain
plan to stick with.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who moved from third base to center field when Jason
Watkins was injured last week, went 6 for 15 (.400) in his first
series with the Matadors. He drove in eight runs, scored six times
and stole a base.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips also displayed power. In Sunday's first inning he
reached for an outside fastball from Dons right-hander Peter Dunkle
and drove a three-run homer to right field to tie the score 3-3.
Three innings later, Phillips clouted a 1-0 Dunkle fastball for a
homer to straightaway center.
</P>
<P>
   Batesole said Phillips' success at the plate was a byproduct of
better preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big key for everybody, but it shows up more with a guy
like Danny,'' Batesole said. ``You've got a guy that's got some
good tools, and if you've got good tools and haven't gotten it done
in the past, that's the reason everybody gives. It shows up a
little more for him because there are a little higher expectations
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is your typical CSUN player, and not because he'll have
scouts busy for the next three months. He also fits the profile of
a Matador since the program was forced to scramble for talent two
years ago. He's one of 15 transfers on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking his left hand following his frustrating freshman
season at Cal State Fullerton, he opted for a fresh start at
Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I didn't have a spot at Fullerton any more, I went
looking for someplace I was going to play right away,'' Phillips
said. ``It was tough leaving from (Fullerton) to go to a JC, but I
knew I would end up somewhere. The way things have worked out, I'm
glad a wound up here. It's nice being home.''

SLAIN BOYS' FATHER HELD ON MINOR CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two brothers whose bodies were found hidden in the
coal room of a Manhattan loft building were homicide victims,
officials said on Sunday, as their father was ordered held on $10
million bail on minor charges related to their disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy found that Richard Short, 7, died of ``multiple chop
wounds to the head and neck,'' said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman
for the office of the chief medical examiner. Richard's younger
brother, John Short, 3, was beaten on the head and suffered a
fractured skull and brain injuries, Ms. Borakove said.
</P>
<P>
   An ax found near the bodies will be tested to see if it was used
to kill Richard, said a law enforcement official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' father, Ronald Short, 49, who has been the focus of an
intense police investigation since the boys were reported missing
by their mother on Jan. 13, was charged in Queens with endangering
the children's welfare by failing to bring them to school. He was
ordered held on $10 million bail, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The charge was brought in Queens because the Shorts had recently
moved to a co-op building in the Hunters Point neighborhood. The
police say they believe that the boys were killed where they were
found, in a loft building at 36 West 25th St. in Manhattan that was
managed by Short, so any charges in connection with their deaths
would have to be brought in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the extenuating circumstances of the case, Queens
prosecutors asked Justice Laura D. Blackburne to order Short held
on a high bail on the misdemeanor charges. Justice Blackburne set
bail at $10 million. The judge granted a request by Short's lawyer,
Donald B. Lyons, for a psychiatric examination for Short to
determine whether he is competent to understand the charges against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of the Shorts, both at their former residence in
Greenwich Village and at their new co-op in Queens, said Sunday
that they were shocked by the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The father seemed devoted to the kids, and the kids seemed
really well adjusted,'' said Adrian Van Caneghem, 45, a resident of
521 Hudson St. in Greenwich Village, where the Shorts lived until
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a history of domestic strife in the family.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, Short's wife, Jolanta Short, a nurse, filed a
complaint with the police that Short had been harassing her,
according to a police official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. Mrs. Short told the police that her husband had plunged
a knife into a couch on Dec. 10, 1995, the official said, and Short
was arrested on menacing charges. But the case was never
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, the police official said, Short called the police and
accused his wife of pushing their older son, Richard. After an
investigation, no signs of abuse were found.
</P>
<P>
   The family's current troubles began on Jan. 9, the police said,
when and Mrs. Short had an argument in their apartment in the
Citylights co-op at 4-74 48th Ave.. Mrs. Short left the apartment,
the police said, and when she returned her husband and sons were
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, on Jan. 13, Mrs. Short called the police and
reported the boys missing. When Short was questioned about their
whereabouts, he told detectives that they were ``in a safe place''
but he would not say where they were, said an investigator who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15, Short was arrested on charges that he had endangered
their welfare by keeping them out of school. He was freed the next
day after his wife and relatives posted $10,000 bail. But he
skipped his next court date, on Jan. 21, and a warrant for his
arrest was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Short checked himself into St. Vincent's
Hospital, where he told hospital workers that he was suicidal, two
law enforcement officials said. The hospital called Mrs. Short, who
called the police. Short was arrested at the hospital at 2 a.m. on
Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The next day detectives found the bodies of his two children.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said Short was ``distraught, as anyone would be over the
death of their two children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been held in police custody for three days,'' Lyons said.
``It's a tremendously sad case.''

BETTY BRYANT, SHOWBOAT PERFORMER, DIES AT 76 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Betty Bryant, who had such a satisfying childhood career in the
backwaters of show business that she never bothered to try to top
herself in the Broadway mainstream, died on Jan. 15 at her home in
Park Ridge, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   She was 76 and was recalled as the third generation of a family
of showboat performers who brought corn pone and culture to
riverside mid-America.
</P>
<P>
   If her life wasn't actually written by Edna Ferber or set to
music by Jerome Kern, it was surely because Miss Bryant was only 4
when Ferber's novel ``Show Boat'' came out in 1926, two years
before Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II translated it to the Broadway
stage.
</P>
<P>
   By then Miss Bryant was an experienced on-board performer, one
who had made her acting debut at the age of 6 weeks, stoically (she
didn't cry) portraying the slave girl Eliza's baby in the dash
across the ice in ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.''
</P>
<P>
   The family showboat was both her home and her stage, and for 20
years, until World War II helped bring the showboat era to an end,
she spent her springs, summers and falls going from town to town
along the Ohio River and its tributaries, sometimes stopping for
several weeks in bigger river cities like Pittsburgh or Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   During the off-season, with the boat tied up in West Virginia,
the family would visit New York or Chicago, sometimes staging
variety acts, sometimes just taking in the theatrical sights.
</P>
<P>
   With her mother as her tutor, Miss Bryant managed to get her
high school diploma from a cooperating school that monitored her
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Miss Bryant's 1994 book ``Here Comes the Showboat''
(University Press of Kentucky), hers was an idyllic life and one
she was certainly born to.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandfather, Sam Bryant, a onetime gardener at Buckingham
Palace, had no known theatrical inclinations until he fell in love
with a young Gilbert and Sullivan actress named Violet Chapman, who
had inclinations enough for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple married and came to the United States in 1884,
it didn't take many years of nagging before Lady Violet, as she
preferred to be known, had persuaded her husband to seek thespian
adventure, initially, as it turned out, in a horse-drawn traveling
medicine show in which Dr. Sam, as he was known, would hawk a
cure-all mixture of gasoline and red pepper on the first night in a
town, then stage a tent show on the second.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's children, Billy and Florence, were part of the
dodge from the beginning and by the time the family graduated to
vaudeville a few years later, they had become the Four Bryants.
</P>
<P>
   A chance summer booking on a turn-of-the-century Mississippi
River showboat gave them the river bug. Within a few years, Dr. Sam
and Captain Billy, as his son was soon known, had acquired first
the Princess and then, in 1918, Bryant's New Showboat.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Captain Billy had married the floating troupe's piano
and calliope player, Josephine Costello, who gave birth to Betty
four years later.
</P>
<P>
   From her start in ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' Miss Bryant swiftly
advanced to other roles and vaudeville turns, including impressions
of George M. Cohan and Eddie Cantor.
</P>
<P>
   As the only member of her generation among the now six Bryants
(although Aunt Florence was increasingly an absentee actress), she
played boys as often as girls, but regardless of the sex, she soon
learned, her forlorn character was sure to die before the final
curtain.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Bryant plays tended to be heavy,
heart-rending melodramas, which delighted small-town audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Billy did stage an abridged version of ``Hamlet'' once,
but after he got a look at the dazed audience on its way out, he
quickly reverted to more familiar fare, replacing it with ``Ten
Nights in a Barroom,'' a sure audience pleaser, partly, no doubt,
because Miss Bryant died so convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   As she wrote in her book, ``A dependable leading lady must be
able to run, duck, fall, get up, fall again, crawl over a bed and
under a dresser, scream, swing by a rope, deliver an uppercut,
struggle and kick and still have enough breath left to say, `If
this is aristocracy, thank God I'm a country girl.'''
</P>
<P>
   At 20 she married a fellow showboat actor, Jat Herod, a jazz
violinist who joined the Army and was soon entertaining troops, as
he and his wife continued to do after the war.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two daughters, JoAleene Miranda of Des
Plaines, Ill., and Mary Perry of Park Ridge, and three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   After their divorce in 1962, Miss Bryant, who never tried to win
acting jobs in New York or Hollywood, settled in Park Ridge, where
she directed amateur theatrical productions and gave lectures on
what it was like to grow up on a showboat.

CLIPPERS, WRIGHT SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM DESERT, Calif. _ Lorenzen Wright, the player who told the
Los Angeles Clippers he wanted to leave, was the first one to show
up.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes before the evening workout, the third-year power
forward was practicing moves, tweaking the choreography. The baby
hooks and baseline jumpers were given an exaggerated trajectory, as
if Wright were facing a best-of-seven against a mountain of
expectation that rises when you're the seventh pick in the 1996 NBA
draft. On the wall behind him were the words ``Wright Gymnasium,''
but he wasn't acting like he owns the place.
</P>
<P>
   The place owns him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad put a basketball in my hands when I was born,'' Wright
said. ``It's been there since.''
</P>
<P>
   His dad played at Ole Miss. He's in a wheelchair now. His dad
was the man in charge at a recreation center in Mississippi when a
fight broke out. A shot was fired and Herbert Wright's back got in
the way. Lorenzen Wright's dad now lives in Los Angeles, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family comes first,'' said Wright, the Clipper making
$1.925 million this season before the retroactive lockout
adjustment. ``To take care of them, I need a commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a move he seemed to have tucked away, the one that would
take him to another team. Four hours earlier at the College of the
Desert's Wright Gymnasium, Wright and his agent spiced up the
Clippers' training camp by serving notice. Trade me. Now.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he really doesn't want to leave. In fact, after two years as
a Clipper and a third on the way, he was willing to re-enlist for
another six. That's irony, folks, something for Jay Leno's writers
to chew on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard sometimes when people refer to us as L.A.'s `other'
team,'' Wright said on the night before his agent's attempted press
revelation last week. ``I want to stay a little longer; I'm hoping
to be here to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen hours later, Wright told reporters it's time for him to
move on. He had been convinced his value to the team as someone
capable of holding his own at the power forward and center
positions is worth a contract extension of $60 million for six
seasons. The Clippers have agreed that Wright is valuable but not
!ital!that &UR; !off! &LR;  valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In Wright, they see a sincere, hard-working and dedicated young
man, a player who's respected by coaches and teammates. They see a
team leader with a solid future.
</P>
<P>
   They also see a third-year player, a player under contract, who
averaged a double-single last season: 9 points and 8.8 rebounds in
29 minutes per game last season.
</P>
<P>
   And with salary cap room more crucial than ever, the Clippers
are not about to pay Wright for what he !ital!might &UR; !off! &LR;  do. With
Michael Olowokandi _ a rookie who isn't even here yet _ cast for
the role of center, they also are not about to trade Wright.
</P>
<P>
   So Wright is approaching his third season as the players' union
rep for a team he now says he wants to leave. He insists the
pay-me-or-trade-me landscape will not affect his performance. The
Clippers coaches don't doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a warrior on the floor,'' said Jim Brewer, who's entering
his fifth season as a Clippers assistant. ``He comes every night to
play. That's something you can't coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the desire to renegotiate a contract is something
that can be coached. What Wright and his agent are asking for is
the caliber of loot that will be surrendered when the Clipper's
1996 NBA draft classmates line up for new deals. Here's the list:
1. Allen Iverson, 2. Marcus Camby, 3. Shareef Abdur-Rahim, 4.
Stephon Marbury, 5. Ray Allen, 6. Antoine Walker (who's already
received an extension from Boston). The eighth pick, one later than
Wright, was budding star Kerry Kittles. Their collective scoring
average last season was 20 points per game. They also put fans in
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers don't have anyone guilty of attracting a throng,
Wright included, unless Olowokandi becomes a draw. Until that is
determined, Wright has promised to ``hold down the fort'' at the
center position.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who appear wise in their restraint, must think he
was referring to Fort Knox.

COLLEGE FRESHMEN'S INTERNET USE A WAY OF LIFE, BUT DISPARITIES
EMERGE  
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Cal., N.C. )  By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Use of the Internet as an educational tool by college freshmen
has become so prevalent as to be practically a way of life, a
survey of college freshmen shows.
</P>
<P>
   A huge 82.9 percent of new freshmen _ more than four out of five
students _ say they are using the Internet for research or
homework. Nearly two-thirds, 65.9 percent, report that they
communicate by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a great disparity in computer mastery between
students entering elite private colleges, 80.1 percent of whom say
they use computers regularly, and those attending traditionally
black public institutions, 41.1 percent of whom say that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disparity came as a kind of shock,'' said Alexander W.
Astin, founding director of the annual freshman poll taken at the
start of the fall semester by researchers at the University of
California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the survey shows an inequity that will exacerbate
other inequities,'' Astin said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also brought to light a continued decline in interest
in public affairs, but an increase in interest in community
service. It also showed a rising interest in higher education as a
means of increasing personal income though not as a means of
intellectual development. In addition, the study found a decline in
the consumption of beer and in support for abortion and casual sex.
</P>
<P>
   The survey has been conducted every year since 1966, sponsored
by the American Council on Education and the Graduate School of
Education and Information Studies at the University of California
at Los Angeles. The current survey got responses from 275,811
students at 469 two- and four-year colleges and universities in the
United States. The data were statistically adjusted to be
representative of the 1.64 million students who entered as
first-time, full-time freshmen last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The large size of the sample means that even shifts of half of a
percentage point have statistical significance, the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Astin said it was becoming clear that computer literacy
and access to the Internet were creating a society sharply divided
into the haves and have nots, Linda J. Sax, the survey director,
said, ``What remains to be seen is whether proficiency on the
Internet enhances student learning during college.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig E. Runde, director of the International Center for
Computer Enhanced Learning at Wake Forest University, was more
certain of the importance of Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet will not mean the disappearance of books and
libraries,'' Runde said, ``but if you don't have access to it, your
work will suffer in comparison with those who do. It's like not
having a telephone. You can get along by using the telephone booth
on the street corner, but not very well.''

ONCE AGAIN, A WANDERER IN A DREAM WORLD 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK ANDERSON c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Lynne Taylor-Corbett choreographed
``Chiaroscuro'' in 1994, she wished her ballet to show off the
dramatic intensity of Jock Soto, and it did so very well. He once
again looked splendid in it when the New York City Ballet revived
the work on Thursday night at the New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The performance also revealed that ``Chiaroscuro'' is not just a
showcase for a charismatic dancer, but also a sturdily constructed
piece of choreography. Ms. Taylor-Corbett has devised emotionally
evocative steps to match the changing musical lights and shadows of
a score by Geminiani based on a concerto grosso by Corelli that, in
turn, was inspired by ``La Follia,'' a haunting melody that became
one of the hits of the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
   Soto appeared to be a wanderer in a dream world, in which he
beheld visions of three women: Zippora Karz, also from the original
cast, and Jennie Somogyi and Pascale van Kipnis, who were making
debuts in their roles. Their movements ranged from the calmly
lyrical to the impetuous.
</P>
<P>
   Soto was accompanied in his journeys by James Fayette, who often
followed at his side like an alter ego, and Tom Gold, a darting,
mercurial presence. When the three men linked hands and moved with
great effort together, they could have symbolized the struggling
components of a seriously divided, yet not hopelessly split,
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taylor-Corbett filled her dream landscape with evocative
choreographic images. The only distractions from them were the
decorative panels designed by Michael Zansky that hung above the
stage just annoyingly high enough as to tempt the eye to
contemplate them, rather than the dancers.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the program was disappointing. Advance announcements
promised ``Herman Schmerman,'' the quirky and jittery ballet for
five dancers that William Forsythe choreographed in 1992 to
electronic music by Thom Willems. But what was actually shown was a
duet for Wendy Whelan and Albert Evans billed as ``Herman Schmerman
Pas de Deux.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of context, its odd stalkings, bendings, twistings and arm
wavings appeared contrived, rather than inventively audacious. Ms.
Whelan and Evans were agile, but the choreography has lost its
fizz.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Martins' ``Symphonic Dances,'' from 1994, never had much
vitality, and it is a mystery why it remains in the repertory. The
score by Rachmaninoff, from which the ballet takes its title, does
indeed make use of dance rhythms. But the key word is
``symphonic,'' not ``dances.'' This somber and weighted music could
conceivably prompt stormily dramatic choreography.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Martins simply has matched the musical phrases with
comings and goings for a principal couple and a large ensemble.
Whereas the music sounds turbulent, the choreography often looks
neat. The performers are kept perpetually busy, yet what they do
seems irrelevant. Although Yvonne Borree and Nilas Martins are
talented dancers, they were not well cast in the leading roles, for
they lacked the magnetic stage presences that could make all the
incessant activity compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which included a repeat performance of Richard
Tanner's ``Variations on a Nursery Song,'' was conducted by Hugo
Fiorato and Maurice Kaplow, regular conductors for the company, and
Neal Stulberg, one of this season's guest conductors.  &QL;

GLOBES GLITTER AS RETRO STYLES STOLE THE SHOW
</HEADLINE>

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Celebs were all goose bumps and glitz
at the Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
   The weather turned cold and windy, but few Hollywood stars
bundled up as they paraded the red carpet leading to the Beverly
Hilton Hotel for the 56th-annual awards show -- unless you count
``Touched By An Angel'' star Roma Downey, who said she wore long
gloves with her gown to keep her arms warm. In true Hollywood
style, these stars of big and small screens acted like it was a
typical sunny L.A. day, dropping their stoles, and baring arms,
backs and even midriffs, to pose for the press.
</P>
<P>
   And the fashion trends that emerged were myriad. Gold, of
course, was the favorite color, followed by red, orange and pink.
Gowns were either skin-tight sheaths or fitted bodices on full
gathered skirts. Shoes were often made of clear Lucite like those
Cinderella slippers made by Ferragamo, and purses were small and
decorative with flowers or pave crystal. Jewelry was heavy on the
diamonds, and hair styles were casual and sometimes rumpled-looking
. . . but hairdresser-to-the-stars Frederic Fekkai called the look
``modern and healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars going for the golden girl look included early arrival
Gloria Stuart, who chose gold leather pumps and purse to accent her
rust-colored chiffon gown by Harari. Looking fab, the ``Titanic''
star says she has two new films coming up, ``Love Letter'' and
``Million Dollar Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lara Flynn Boyle of ``The Practice'' was awesome in her
golden champagne-colored retro gown by David Cardona with matching
boa that turned the actress who plays an attorney into a '30s
screen siren.
</P>
<P>
   Also going for the gold were John Travolta's wife, Kelly
Preston, in a romantic Renaissance-inspired gown that laced up the
back, and teen-ager Christina Ricci with a gold fox-trimmed knit
stole wrapped around her black Versace gown.
</P>
<P>
   Visions in red -- a great color that often clashes with the red
arrivals carpet -- included Jane Seymour, who chose a burgundy
peasant-style gown by Jane Booke and accented it with a
princess-style ruby-and-diamond necklace by Harry Winston. Emily
Watson wore a Valentine-red sheath by Valentino, and Ann-Margret
made a rare appearance on the red carpet in a beaded burgundy
coat-and-dress ensemble by costume designer Nolan Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Stone always goes for the unexpected and it always works.
One year it was a Gap shirt, this year it was a bright orange
sheath with matching stole by Vera Wang.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion trophy, however, goes to Julianna Margulies of TV's
``ER.'' She traded her medical scrubs for a frothy black tulle ball
gown by Oscar de la Renta that made her the belle of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Sportier ensembles of short tank tops with full skirts that
we'll be seeing more of by spring, were worn by several young
actors, including Gwyneth Paltrow in Calvin Klein, Calista
Flockhart in Pamela Dennis, Keri Russell in Armani, and Christina
Applegate in Christina Perrin.
</P>
<P>
   Other fashion independents showing star style included Jamie Lee
Curtis, who carried a crystal-studded purse shaped like a movie
camera by Erin Lareau; Kim Basinger, who arrived in a gray '50s
circle skirt with a pink cardigan sweater; Annette Bening who wore
an Armani tuxedo without a shirt, and Camryn Manheim of ``The
Practice'' who vamped for the photogs in a slinky Anne Klein gown
that made one think of a modern Mae West.
