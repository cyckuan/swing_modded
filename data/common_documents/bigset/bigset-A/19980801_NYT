RANGERS BOLSTER PITCHING, INIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON,Texas _ The Rangers yesterday demonstrated their
aggressive commitment toward a second American League West title in
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The cost: Additional payroll and a portion of the organization's
future.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin acquired right-hander Todd
Stottlemyre and shortstop Royce Clayton from the St. Louis
Cardinals and third baseman Todd Zeile from the Florida Marlins
before last night's deadline in separate but dependent trades
designed toward strengthening the Rangers' present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to help our ballclub,'' Melvin said, ``and
there's no doubt what we did today is an effort to win our division
and go beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals received left-hander Darren Oliver, third baseman
Fernando Tatis and a minor-league player to be announced. The
Rangers also sent two minor-league players _ right-hander Daniel
DeYoung of Class-A Charlotte and third baseman Jose Santo of
Class-A Savannah _ to the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also placed shortstop Kevin Elster on waivers for
the purpose of granting the infielder his unconditional release
three days before his 34th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The two trades also signaled the financial commitment of owner
Tom Hicks, who purchased the franchise in June. The Rangers will be
responsible for approximately $3.15 million in additional salary
for the season's eight remaining weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that you have to get approval when you're
taking on additional salary over the last two months,'' Melvin
said. ``I think it's helpful to have that kind of support, and I've
had support in the past ... but this is a little bigger chunk than
we've taken on in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre (9-9, 3.51 earned-run average) became the Rangers'
primary focus after Melvin deemed the Blue Jays' demands excessive
for right-hander Roger Clemens, a four-time Cy Young Award
recipient. The Blue Jays, major-league officials said, sought left
fielder Rusty Greer, Oliver and a premier prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel it was something we were going to be able to do
without disrupting our current major-league club and a big part of
our future,'' Melvin said. ``I spent some time with that, but I got
the message loud and clear: It was going to be expensive for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he also viewed Blue Jays right-hander Juan Guzman as
the Rangers' fail-safe had the trade with the Cardinals failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fairly close,'' Melvin said of a trade for Guzman. ``I
feel if I wouldn't have been able to get Stottlemyre, I felt
confident I could have gotten Guzman.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, who during the past two seasons led National League
shortstops in assists, addressed the Rangers' concerns regarding
Elster's lack of range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt our defense had not played up to par,'' Melvin said.
``He's got very good range and athleticism. We feel he can help
improve our pitching somewhat with his defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions do not come without risk.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre and Clayton, who this season will earn $4.7 and $3.5
million, respectively, can become free agents this winter. The
Rangers will not attempt to negotiate contract extensions for
either during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is for the rest of the season,'' Melvin said.
``We'll make the other decisions at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, who will earn $3.2 million this season and in 1999,
should provide the Rangers more offensive production and
consistency, but Melvin bemoaned the loss of Tatis, the team's
23-year-old third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to give up a young player like Tatis,''
Melvin said. ``I think he's going to be an outstanding player.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin dismissed the idea that the Rangers sacrificed long-term
success for a short-term fix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going that way,'' Melvin said. ``I wish we
would have played better during the first half up to the trading
deadline and you're not having to make these moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's maneuvers might not be the Rangers' last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our club is pretty well intact, but it doesn't mean
I'll stop looking,'' Melvin said. ``There might be some tweaking.''

DODGERS GET PEREZ, GRUDZIELANEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tom Lasorda, who guaranteed last weekend that the
Dodgers would win the National League wild-card race, set out to
prove it Friday by acquiring left-hander Carlos Perez and infielder
Mark Grudzielanek from the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who pulled out of the bidding for Seattle's Randy
Johnson three days ago because of concerns the Dodgers could not
re-sign him after this year, went for the second-best available
left-hander in Perez, an All-Star during his rookie season in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to give away young players,'' said Lasorda, who traded
infielder Wilton Guerrero and three prospects. ``But we have to get
this team into the playoffs. We think Perez and Grudzielanek are
the guys to get us there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Grudzielanek will bring much-needed punch to the second
spot in the Dodgers order, the key to the trade was the flamboyant
Perez, 27, the third of three brothers to pitch in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he returned from shoulder surgery to lead the
National League with five shutouts and ranked second with eight
complete games.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Perez broke his nose during an auto accident in
Montreal, but he is scheduled to pitch tonight against the New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is just what we need,'' said right fielder Gary Sheffield.
``He is a guy who pitches a lot of innings and brings some fire to
a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, 28, tied a major-league record for shortstops with
54 doubles last season when he batted .273 in 156 games with the
Expos. With Jose Vizcaino expected to miss at least another two
weeks with a sprained right ankle that has sidelined him since June
20, Grudzielanek will start tonight at short, then probably move to
third base when Vizcaino returns.
</P>
<P>
   He will immediately improve the offense. Since Vizcaino went
down with the ankle injury, the Dodgers No.2 hitters are batting
.195 (25 for 128).
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers pursued Grudzielanek last winter before settling on
the free agent Vizcaino. He is a superior hitter but is considered
a defensive liability. That probably won't improve on the natural
grass at Dodger Stadium after playing three years on artificial
surface in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   The trade closes two wild months of speculation that Johnson,
the dominant left-hander of the 1990s, would eventually find his
way to Los Angeles. The Dodgers and Mariners began talking two
months ago and nearly completed a deal, but the Dodgers were
unwilling to give up right-hander Darren Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Mariners said the Dodgers were still
involved, although the Dodgers denied any talks. The club didn't
like the idea of acquiring Johnson for the next two months without
a contract beyond this season. They also rejected the thought of
paying Johnson, 34, a projected multi-year contract worth at least
$11 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Seattle GM) Woody Woodward we weren't interested about
three days ago,'' Lasorda said. ``He's a great pitcher, but it
wasn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost-conscious Expos were eager to trade both players, who
are expected to receive hefty raises next season.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is earning $1.5 million this season and could command
around $4 million in 1999. Grudzielanek, critical of Expos
management when he received $350,000 after his success in 1997,
also is eligible for salary arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Fox, the Dodgers new owners, had no reservations
about the increased payroll, which now stands at $61 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos were concerned only with stockpiling prospects and
received some of the Dodgers' best, including Double-A first
baseman Jon Tucker from Chatsworth. They also got Tucker's San
Antonio teammate Peter Bergeron, who is considered one of the top
outfielders in Double-A.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also gave up left-hander Ted Lilly, who split time
at Double-A and Triple-A this season. Montreal also gave up
infielder Hiram Bocachica, who will play at Triple-A Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers insisted Montreal take the gifted but erratic
Guerrero because of a sudden overload of infielders. Guerrero's
older brother Vladimir is a star right fielder for the Expos, but
Montreal manager Felipe Alou is not much of a fan of Wilton.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, 23, is best known for the eight-game suspension he
served during his rookie year (1997) for corking his bat. Dodgers
management was furious and buried Guerrero, the Opening Day second
baseman. They acquired Eric Young last July to play second and
signed him to a four-year, $18.5 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero worked out in center field during spring training, but
got playing time only after Young went down with a strained left
thigh muscle. Guerrero had two or more hits in seven of his last
nine games (.483, 14 for 29) but went 2 for 12 in Philadelphia,
where his name began to surface in trade rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a good opportunity for him,'' said manager Glenn
Hoffman, who also had Guerrero at Triple-A. ``But today we made
ourselves a better team.''

SPARKS WIN FOR WOOLRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ With a third of their WNBA season remaining,
the Los Angeles Sparks' front office felt it was a good time to get
a fresh start with a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Woolridge, who played with the Lakers from 1988-90,
Friday was officially selected to as the interim coach to replace
Julie Rousseau.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's 1-0 in the job, thanks to Lisa Leslie and Mwadi
Mabika, who each scored 15 points and grabbed eight rebounds to
lead the Sparks past the Phoenix Mercury, 71-56, in front of 9,563
at the Forum. It was the fifth consecutive loss for the Cheryl
Miller-coached team, and its second to the Sparks in nine days.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time this season the Sparks (8-13) won
back-to-back games. They defeated Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking it one game at time,'' said Woolridge, 38, whose
team plays at Utah tonight.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second Sparks coaching change in the short history
of the WNBA. In last year's inaugural season, it was Rousseau who
relieved Linda Sharp when the team sputtered to a 4-7 start.
Rousseau, who was the youngest coach in the league at 32,
resuscitated the team's season, as Sparks went 10-7 the rest of the
way, missing a playoff berth by one game.
</P>
<P>
   The energy and enthusiasm she brought last year didn't continue
this year, leading to a 7-13 start. Of course, it didn't help that
first-round draft pick Allison Feaster and Haixia Zheng were out
with injuries most of the season. She also was without Leslie for
two games recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew Julie as a strong motivator, but certainly there
was some sort of misunderstanding or misguidance from the
players,'' Sparks president Johnny Buss said. ``They just didn't
follow the beat of her drum.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the team's three core players Leslie, Tamecka Dixon
and Penny Toler.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see them play less than the minutes that we've been
expecting, I have concerns,'' Buss said. ``Certainly the pattern of
a game, depending on the opponent, has been different every week. I
didn't see us matching up properly to our opponents with the
players that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last season, when he moved from the front office to
assistant coach when Sharp was fired, Woolridge had no coaching
experience. But he spent 13 years in the NBA and has played for 14
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a basketball lifer,'' Woolridge said. ``I didn't realize I
wanted to be a coach until I came to the Sparks. I'm so excited.
It's a calm excitement. I see this as taking the last 10 games to
try and redeem the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss said he will extend to Woolridge the opportunity to prove
himself and remove the interim from his title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that with Julie; I don't know why we wouldn't do that
with Orlando,'' Buss said. ``Certainly, we're flattered with his
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, general manager Rhonda Windham fired Sharp, who was
her old college coach at USC. Rousseau also was a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem separating apples and oranges,''
Windham said. ``The team wasn't playing well. We had a young coach.
We knew the risks of having a young coach and I think we showed a
lot of patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Buss informed Rousseau of the change Thursday afternoon, and
told Woolridge and assistant coach Colleen Matsuhara later that
night. Steve Smith, who was an assistant coach with the Phoenix
Mercury last year and a scout for the Sparks this season, is the
staff's new addition.

YANKS BEAT MARINERS, 5-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An hour before he was scheduled to pitch Friday night,
Hideki Irabu rested on a couch in the visitors' clubhouse, watching
the Atlanta Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals on television as his
interpreter, George Rose, picked at a buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man had any idea if he would be employed by the Yankees
at night's end. Irabu, who teammates said was hurt and distracted
by the idea that the team had dangled him in trade discussions,
beat the Mariners, 5-3. Irabu became the Yankees' fourth pitcher
with 10 or more victories, joining David Cone (15), Andy Pettitte
(13) and David Wells (12). Jorge Posada hit two home runs for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 76-27, the second-best 103-game record in this
century, behind the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates. They have won three of
their first four games on this 10-game West Coast trip.
</P>
<P>
   According to baseball officials, Irabu was part of an offer to
the Seattle Mariners for Randy Johnson, and Irabu could have only
impressed the Mariners executives with his performance Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, his fastball buzzing and his off-speed pitches baffling,
struck out four in the first four innings, giving up just two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Seattle left-hander Jeff Fassero in Friday night's
game, Yankees Manager Joe Torre decided to go with a lineup
composed entirely of right-handed hitters.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Tino Martinez and right fielder Paul O'Neill were
given the night off, replaced by Luis Sojo and Shane Spencer,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, the Yankees' Chad Curtis doubled when his
line drive short-hopped the wall in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Spencer hit a double off the wall in
right-center, scoring Curtis (Spencer later hit a single, giving
him two hits against the left-hander _ or one more hit than Dale
Sveum, whom Spencer replaced on the roster, had in 12 at-bats
against lefties).
</P>
<P>
   Irabu struck out Shane Monahan in the third inning, and Jorge
Posada, the Yankees' catcher, moved toward the dugout, three up,
three down. Except that Monahan was the second out of the inning,
and Posada sheepishly returned to his position.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder he was eager to get back to the dugout. Batting in the
next half-inning, Posada slammed his 12th home run of the year off
Seattle's Jeff Fassero, who offered a poorly thrown curveball with
an 0-2 count.
</P>
<P>
   Two batters later, Scott Brosius lifted a home run into the
stands into right-center field, becoming the 10th Yankees player to
hit 10 or more home runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis singled home Tim Raines in the fifth, giving the Yankees
a 4-1 lead. Edgar Martinez and David Segui slugged back-to-back
homers off Irabu in the bottom of the sixth, shaving Irabu's
advantage to one run.
</P>
<P>
   But Posada blasted his second home run of the game in the
eighth, the Yankees' third solo homer.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Silicon Valley Employers Make Push for More H-1B Workers  
   
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
If misery loves company, Subbarao has many friends.
<TEXT>
<P>
   An electrical engineer from India, Subbarao has been designing
chips in Silicon Valley since 1994, under an H-1B visa that lets
skilled foreigners work here for six years.
</P>
<P>
   H-1B visas are controversial. High-tech employers want Congress
to double the number of visas to fill a labor shortage. Organized
labor, pointing at high-tech layoffs, says H-1Bs put U.S. workers
out of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But that's politics. This is Subbarao's story. Like
three-quarters of all H-1B workers, he began applying for permanent
residency soon after he started his ``temporary'' job.
</P>
<P>
   Now he complains that his paperwork is lost in bureaucratic
limbo. Before the Immigration and Naturalization Service will even
consider giving him a green card, the Department of Labor must
first certify that he isn't replacing a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   But so many tech workers want to upgrade H-1Bs to green cards,
that some applications _ like his _ have stalled in DOL for as long
as two years.
</P>
<P>
   DOL certification officer Rebecca Marsh Day said such delays are
the exception, not the rule. Most requests from high-tech
applicants get fast-track consideration, getting them in and out of
DOL in seven months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are 12,500 green card requests sitting on DOL desks
in San Francisco, and fewer hands to process them. Day's staff
shrank from 24 in 1996, to 14 at present. Day said she would be
lucky to avoid deeper budget cuts next year.
</P>
<P>
   For H-1B workers, whose futures hinge on clearing both the DOL
and INS hurdles, the delay in getting applications out of the labor
office mean prolonged uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be a pretty smooth path,'' said another Indian
engineer stuck between his H-1B and green card.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite this human traffic jam in San Francisco, Silicon
Valley employers want to ram a bill through Congress to bring in
more H-1Bs _ and eventually deepen the DOL's paper pile.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements between the White House and the Republican-led
Congress have put the bill on hold. This pause is a good time for
all sides to realize that if our national policy is to increase the
flow of H-1B workers, we need to add more plumbers to widen the
immigration pipe.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Ziffed up &LR; : ZDTV, the 24-hour computer cable channel created
by the Ziff-Davis publishing empire, will be visible in the Bay
Area for the first time today _ at least to people with
DIRECTV &UR;  &LR; satellite dishes (Channel 273).
</P>
<P>
   ZDTV, which went on the air in May, has signed deals to get its
computer programs on cable systems with a total of 6 million
viewers. But so far no Bay Area cable franchises have logged on.
</P>
<P>
   While ZDTV fights for eyeballs, ZD's magazine operation are
booming. Claude Sheer, president of ZD's New York magazine
division, was in San Francisco last week, talking about his
publications _ and his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer was particularly bullish about Yahoo Internet Life, a
guide to Internet culture published in a joint venture with Yahoo.
According to Sheer, since its debut three years ago, Yahoo Internet
Life has gotten nearly 600,000 paid subscribers _ ``making it the
fastest-growing magazine in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheer said Yahoo Internet Life has grown even faster than ZD's
PC Computing, which hit 1 million subscribers faster than any other
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by its success with Yahoo Internet Life, Sheer said
that ZD will soon introduce a new magazine in a joint venture with
Excite for small business users.
</P>
<P>
   Joint ventures seem to be the rage at ZD. Last year, it teamed
up with its archrival, Massachusetts' International Data Group _
which has a stable of magazines in San Francisco _ to fold some
once-competing magazines into a jointly-owned company, Mac
Publishing, led by CEO Colin Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the Mac Publishing board with IDG chief operating
officer Jim Casella has given him a warmer and fuzzier feeling
about doing more joint ventures with his rival, Sheer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere has been created and the dialogue exists,'' he
said.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Wireless Networking Comes Home  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In what could be a breakthrough for home networking, Diamond
Multimedia Systems will announce Monday a $199 package that lets
consumers link personal computers without wires.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Called HomeFree, the new product can be used to share printers,
scanners, modems and Zip drives, eliminating the need to have
separate peripherals for each PC. Users also can transfer
information from one PC to another, share a single Internet
connection and compete in multiplayer video games.
</P>
<P>
   HomeFree, which will go on sale in September, marks the first
attempt to bring wireless networking into the home. Currently,
affordable PC networking happens only over data lines, which must
be run through walls or under carpets.
</P>
<P>
   Several other companies are working on solutions that involve
connecting PCs via telephone lines or electrical power lines inside
the house. An alliance including AMD, AT&AMP;T, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard
and Intel hopes to get inexpensive products based on phone-line
networking into stores by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond, which is best known for high-speed video graphics cards
and modems, is counting on HomeFree to help pull it out of the
financial doldrums. The San Jose company lost $8.3 million in its
latest quarter, and its stock, which peaked at $16.25 in March,
closed yesterday unchanged at $6.13.
</P>
<P>
   With an increasing number of consumers buying second and third
PCs, Diamond officials believe the market is ripe for a way to
easily create home networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half the people buying PCs this year are shopping
for a second computer, and they fully intend to keep the old one,''
said Mike Hudson, chief technology officer for Diamond's
Communications Division. ``The phenomenon of multiple PCs in the
home is here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   HomeFree will come in two versions _ the $199 Desktop Pac for
linking two desktop PCs, and the $229 Combo Pac for connecting a
desktop PC to a laptop. Each package includes cards that fit into
the PCs, plus software for setting up and running the network.
</P>
<P>
   Additional PCs can be added to the network with single cards _
$99 for one that fits in a desktop unit, and $129 for a laptop
version.
</P>
<P>
   HomeFree uses radio-wave technology that penetrates walls and
ceilings, letting networked PCs be anywhere in a house or even
outside. The network has a range of 150 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Transfering information from one networked system to another
would be as quick as saving to a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond officials said users should not notice any slowdown in
performance for most tasks conducted over the network. For
instance, someone accessing the Internet from a PC without a modem
_ by connecting to another PC equipped with a modem _ will still be
able to surf the Web at the modem's connection speed.
</P>
<P>
   HomeFree's biggest advantage, however, may be its ease of use.
``The main issue is that until now home networks have been very
complicated to set up and manage, and you have to drill holes in
the wall to make it happen,'' said Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Analys Phil Rueppel of Bankers Trust New York said he thinks
Diamond is hitting the market at an opportune time. ``We're
starting to see a lot of families buy a second PC for a spouse or
children, and there's a desire to share files and peripherals like
printers. And Diamond is offering a pretty low-cost solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rueppel said the company faces several big challenges in
trying to make HomeFree a marketing success. It's unclear he said,
whether Diamond can leverage its brand name _ which is mostly
associated with graphics _ in the area of networking.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if the new product isn't as easy to install and use as
Diamond claims, calls from frustrated users could put a serious
strain on its technical support resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Networks can be notoriously problematic,'' Rueppel said. ``The
real question is whether HomeFree is easy to get up and running and
does it stay up without a lot of maintenance and network
administration.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   High-Tech Visa Bill Held Up  
   
 By Carolyn Lochhead and Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
A bill to expand the number of temporary visas granted to high-tech
workers was put on hold yesterday, after the Clinton administration
insisted on three conditions not found in a House-Senate compromise
announced last week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's congressional agreement, which was cheered by
Silicon Valley employers, called for adding 20,000 so-called H-1B
visas for the rest of this year and raising the total number of
skilled-worker visas from its current 65,000 ceiling to 115,000 by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition for expanding the number of visas, the House and
Senate would have required companies employing 15 percent or more
of their workforce under H-1B visas to sign an affidavit saying
they have not laid off any U.S. citizens in order to hire
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House, urged by labor groups like the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers, told congressional leaders it
wanted three changes:
</P>
<P>
   _It wants 10 percent, not 15, to be the threshold at which
companies will have to file nonlayoff affidavits. This would mean
that a larger pool of companies _ including some of best-known tech
firms _ might have to meet this requirement.
</P>
<P>
   _It wants a tougher clause stating that laid-off U.S. workers
can seek arbitration to recover lost pay if they can prove they
were replaced by an H-1B worker.
</P>
<P>
   _It wants a higher amount for a new fee that employers who hire
H-1B workers would have to pay into a fund to train U.S. workers.
The administration is asking for $500 to $1,000, while Congress is
in the $250 range.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Michigan Republican Spencer Abraham, who has led
the push to expand the number of visas, said Senator Abraham will
``take a look'' at the White House objections but that it is not
necessary to address any of them.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had threatened to veto the original Senate bill
on H-1Bs, saying it didn't do enough to protect U.S. workers. It
was unclear yesterday how insistent the White House would be on its
conditions, and whether they could unravel last week's
congressional compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McMonigle, spokesman for Senator Abraham, said the Senate is
unlikely to accept a reduction in the 15 percent ceiling, noting
that the Senate bill passed by a 78-to-20 vote margin, enough to
break a Democratic filibuster or override a White House veto.
However, pro-labor sentiment appears stronger in the House, giving
the White House more leverage.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesperson Jake Siewert professed optimism that
the differences could be ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reasonable offer on the table to address the skills
shortage,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, the Republican proposal
didn't have enough protections for U.S. workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed Hastings, president of Technet, the Silicon Valley lobby,
said industry hopes that agreement can be reached before Congress
goes out of session &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no lines drawn in the sand,'' he said. ``But we feel
the starting place is the clean and simple Abraham bill.''

HOW VOLCANOES UNDER OCEAN COULD BE KEY TO LIFE'S ORIGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    When deep-diving scientists first discovered colonies of living
organisms thriving in the intense heat of undersea volcanic vents
more than 20 years ago, they may have unknowingly found a key
secret to the origin of life on Earth.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, fresh evidence from laboratory experiments and a set of
deep space observations strengthen the possibility that primordial
life could have first been cooked up in the boiling, mineral-rich,
sulfurous steam erupting from volcanoes on the ocean floor when our
new-formed planet was still cooling billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the journal Science, three reports are being published Friday
focusing on the possible origins of life _ two from German and
Japanese chemists and one from Australian astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   From Germany, chemists Gloria Huber and Gunther Wachterauser
report that in their laboratory at the Munich Technical University,
they have created a model of a geothermal vent with all its
chemicals fuming in boiling water. They have watched as a group of
amino acids formed chains of complex peptides _ the essential step
toward creating all the proteins that make up life itself.
</P>
<P>
   Then, from Japan, Itaru Nitta and his colleagues at Tokyo
University describe their experiments showing that the
single-stranded genetic molecule RNA can also cause amino acids to
link themselves into peptides.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, astronomer Jeremy Bailey of the Anglo-Australian
Observatory in New South Wales report that they have looked into a
star-forming region of the constellation Orion where amino acids
abound, and found that the properties of those chemicals are most
probably identical to those that make up the proteins of life on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   It was back in 1977 that oceanographer John B. Corliss of Oregon
State University and famed underwater explorer Robert Ballard dived
9,000 feet deep into the Galapagos Rift Zone at the bottom of the
equatorial Pacific where amazing organisms _ red-tipped tube worms,
giant clams, spidery crabs and other previously unknown creatures
were unexpectedly thriving in a world where no light or free oxygen
penetrated. The smallest and most primitive creatures in the heated
food chain apparently fed on bacteria, which in turn depended on
sulfur from the vents for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Corliss proposed to the American Geophysical
Union in San Francisco that life might well have been spawned in
such undersea heat engines _ by then known to exist wherever great
slabs of the Earth's crust, called tectonic plates, split apart
beneath all the world's oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Corliss found few supporters because most scientists held that
life more probably began in the warm ``primordial soup'' of the
early ocean surfaces. There, primitive organic chemicals could have
grown more and more complex under the stimulus of lightning flashes
until some evolved into DNA, the master molecule of heredity. And
the DNA molecules, in turn, would later have surrounded themselves
with membranes to become the first living cells, according to the
widely held theory.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, for 10 years now Wachterhauser has argued that
compounds of iron, nickel and sulfur found around volcanic vents
could act as catalysts to form the Earth's first biological
molecules from carbon monoxide and the abundant organic chemicals
of the sea beds.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments last year, the German scientists created
precursors of amino acids _ the primary building blocks of proteins
_ from the metallic sulfides and carbon monoxide that are found in
the boiling water of undersea volcanic vents. And in their latest
laboratory experiments, the researchers now report that by adding
amino acids to their hot slurry of sulfides and volcanic gases, the
mixture did indeed link the amino acids into chains that became the
peptides that in turn form proteins.
</P>
<P>
   The German report is sure to be controversial, and Thursday in
Berkeley, Calif., evolutionary biologist Norman R. Pace, who has
long studied protein synthesis and the role of RNA, called the
German work important, but he remained skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that life arose in a geothermal environment,''
Pace said in an interview, ``and while this experiment is nice
chemistry, bio it ain't.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's report from Japan, Nitta and his colleagues describe
experiments showing that snippets of RNA taken from the human
intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli can themselves stimulate
amino acids to link themselves into peptide bonds. RNA, a
single-stranded molecule, is the genetic material that reads the
code embedded in DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Japanese experiments, Paul Schimmel and
Rebecca Alexander call Nitta's work a ``significant advance'' in
understanding how proteins are synthesized and ``something about
how life arose on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, Bailey and his colleagues used their telescope to
study the amino acids in Orion in an effort to determine whether
they are similar to those recently analyzed in the Murchison
meteorite, a chunk of debris from space that fell to Earth in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Amino acids, like many organic molecules, come in two
mirror-image forms that scientists term right-handed and
left-handed. Those in nearly all living organisms on Earth _ and in
the Murchison meteorite, too _ are left-handed, while all others
are right-handed. The amino acids in Orion, Bailey and his
colleagues report, have been polarized by infra-red radiation to
produce equal quantities of right- and left-handed molecules. So
the astronomers propose that ultraviolet radiation could do the
same thing to many organic molecules in space. As a result, they
suggest, left-handed amino acids in huge quantities could have
seeded the early Earth when it was being constantly bombarded by
comets and other objects from interstellar space, when the Earth
was young.

ANALYSIS: AMERICANS RATE CLINTON HIGH DESPITE NEW RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica cuts a deal with prosecutors. Rumors of a
semen-stained dress re-emerge. President Clinton agrees to provide
videotaped testimony.
</P>
<P>
   As the media breathlessly report the latest developments in the
fast-breaking White House sex scandal, an important bottom line has
remained unchanged _ America's utter lack of concern.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show that Clinton remains an enormously popular
president. According to polls, the public believes he had an
illicit affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and
they think he has lied about it under oath. Yet they don't believe
that makes him a bad president, is grounds for impeachment, or in
fact, is any of their business.
</P>
<P>
   Polls conducted over the past few days show _ just as they did
six months ago _ that roughly 2 out of 3 Americans approve of the
job Clinton is doing as president.
</P>
<P>
   The strong support provides him a level of flexibility and
protection that no high-priced team of attorneys or legal strategy
can offer. As long as his numbers are high, Clinton is in far less
peril than it appears he is in from watching the nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   Even if independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr is able to
establish that President Clinton has engaged in an obstruction of
justice, members of Congress will be quite hesitant to take on such
a popular figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at how little the American people care about this
stuff,'' veteran Democratic pollster Vic Fingerhut said of the
latest media frenzy. ``It's almost like the boy who cried `wolf.'
Five or six times in the past six months, the media has said `THIS
IS IT.' Obviously, this hasn't hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Washington reporters, the frenzy for scandal information
has reached a peak not seen since January, when some were openly
predicting that Clinton would have to resign.
</P>
<P>
   At the daily White House briefing Wednesday, press secretary
Mike McCurry was asked approximately 175 questions, at least 160 of
which involved the Lewinsky story. He provided no new information.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Clinton) is doing his job right now, and he's not as
preoccupied with all of you as you are with yourself,'' McCurry
said dryly to the scandal-obsessed press corps.
</P>
<P>
   It is the public's lack of outrage that has allowed Clinton to
stonewall investigators and reporters on the Lewinsky matter since
January, even when he told the press that ``I'd like for you to
have more rather than less, sooner rather than later.'' It allowed
him to negotiate testimony to the grand jury on his own terms. And
most importantly, it will force the House to move with great
caution as it ponders impeachment proceedings in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to accept that men lie about affairs,'' said Mark
DiCamillo, director of the California-based Field Poll. ``The
public tends to discount that.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's flurry of news activity has led some to argue that
poll numbers could plummet if physical evidence of a relationship,
such as the alleged dress, emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to suspect that your husband is cheating on
you, it's another thing to be confronted with the evidence,'' said
a GOP operative, who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be entering a dangerous new phase'' said DiCamillo. ``I
can't predict what the pieces are, but if Starr . . . shows a
pattern of obstruction of justice, if that can be proven, that
could upset the apple cart.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, polls show that even if the allegations against
Clinton are true, the public is not much bothered.
</P>
<P>
   A CNN-USA Today/Gallup poll released Thursday, for example,
found that 2 out of 3 believe Clinton had sexual relations with
Lewinsky, more than half believe he lied about it under oath, and
nearly half believe he participated in an effort to obstruct
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll found that fewer than 1 in 4 believe Congress
should consider impeachment, even if Lewinsky testifies that
Clinton discussed ways to conceal their alleged affair.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS News poll released Thursday shows that 71 percent believe
Clinton had an affair with Lewinsky, but even if it turned out he
obstructed justice, only 1 in 7 believe he should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is separating Clinton the president from Clinton
the person,'' said Ed Sarpolous, director of EPIC/MRA, a polling
firm based in Michigan. ``And with regards to (his personal life),
they do not believe it is their place to say.''

EXPOS POUND GIANTS AS SABEAN SCRAMBLES  
 BY HENRY SCHULMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ One year ago Friday, when the White Sox traded
pitchers Wilson Alvarez, Roberto Hernandez and Danny Darwin to the
Giants, Chicago owner Jerry Reinsdorf said he made the deal because
his team had no chance to catch the first-place Cleveland Indians,
even though the White Sox were just 41/2 games out.
</P>
<P>
   As Giants general manager Brian Sabean spends a final exhausting
day on the phone before tonight's trading deadline, he must have at
least a sense of what Reinsdorf was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants stand just 31/2 games behind the Chicago Cubs in the
National League wild-card race, but they hardly look like a lion
ready to charge.
</P>
<P>
   By dropping two of three games to the lowly Montreal Expos,
including a 12-6 defeat Thursday night, the Giants fell to 5-14
since the All-Star break, which has to make Sabean wonder if he
should part with good prospects or young players off the 25-man
roster in a bid to win this year.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days ago, the Giants acquired pitchers Jose Mesa and Al
Morman and shortstop Shawon Dunston from the Indians, and
outfielder Joe Carter from Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made those trades a week ago to see if they could pull us
out of the funk we were in after the All-Star break,'' assistant
general manager Ned Colletti said before Thursday night's loss.
``Then we'd have time to react before the July 31 deadline. We were
hoping we could see it. We hope to see something today. We did it
to give ourselves a week to see where we were.''
</P>
<P>
   The week was not very encouraging. The Giants went 3-3 against
two teams that are a combined 39 games below .500, and a game like
last night's has to give the front office pause. There are so many
problems, a quick-fix trade does not seem to be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a very pretty game tonight,'' manager Dusty Baker
said. ``They pounded us pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gardner, coming off a great start against Cincinnati,
coughed up seven runs (six earned) in 42/3 innings. Terry Jones hit
a two-run triple in the third inning, a ball that skipped past a
charging Barry Bonds, after Gardner walked catcher Chris Widger and
then walked the pitcher, Mike Thurman, on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero hit Gardner's first pitch in the fourth inning
over the fence in dead center. The Expos added an unearned run in
the inning, then took an 8-1 lead in the fifth by hitting for the
cycle against Gardner and reliever Chris Brock, who gave up Brad
Full-mer's rally-capping two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston's two-run homer in the sixth spurred a comeback that
made it 8-5 Montreal, but three runs off Mesa in the seventh, which
began with Carter misplaying a fly ball for a three-base error,
halted any thoughts of a Giants rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season isn't lost in one game, but we've got to stop this
madness and keep going,'' said center fielder Darryl Hamilton, who
injured a hip muscle on the rain-soaked dirt around the plate in
the first inning and left the game early.
</P>
<P>
   While the Giants lost, the front office continued to work the
phones, Sabean from San Francisco and Colletti in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Sabean said through a team spokesman that he is discussing
``small, medium and large deals with a number of clubs.'' Colletti
said talks are concentrated on two or three teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants need another starting pitcher, and the list of usual
suspects includes Randy Johnson of the Mariners, Todd Stottlemyre
of the Cardinals, Tim Belcher of the Royals and Carlos Perez of the
Expos. The Pirates are also entertaining offers for right-hander
Jon Lieber, a good control pitcher. The A's, who lost nine straight
before winning yesterday, now might be willing to part with Kenny
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants also are looking for relievers, because the
bullpen has thrown a lot of innings. One reliever drawing interest
is left-hander Ricardo Rincon of the Pirates, who could be moved
with Lieber in a package.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are searching for offense, too. Carter has not been
the answer in right field, but Brian Jordan, Ron Gant or Ellis
Burks could be.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' ability to cut a deal largely depends on how
attractive the return package would be compared to the players
offered by other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Colletti said the bidding has been raised not only by the
significant number of teams still in the wild-card races but also
the division leaders trying to fatten themselves up for the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just us, the Cubs, the Mets, the Phillies and the
Dodgers who are looking for help, but you've got Houston trying to
add people,'' Colletti said. ``The Padres are trying to shore up
their bullpen. The Yankees, Indians and Red Sox are involved, too.
There are far more teams looking to acquire pieces of the puzzle
than there are pieces of the puzzle.'' &QL;

WOODSON MIGHT BE REAL PRIZE 
BY TIM KEOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's today's test: Find a good reason to embrace the Raiders.
Come up with something _ anything _ that would compel you to grab
that spare $300 or $400 and take the family to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff George has glimmering numbers, but his personality doesn't
lend itself to blind allegiance. Tim Brown is cool as long as the
game plan suits his needs. Napoleon Kaufman is fun to watch, but
it's not his nature to draw attention to himself.
</P>
<P>
   New coach Jon Gruden is young and energetic. There are
occasional glimpses of charisma that may or may not become more of
a public staple, depending on his team's win-loss record.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one new face who comes to the Raiders with some
credentials in the area of promotion and marketing. Charles Woodson
developed a reputation as a young man with more than the requisite
amount of confidence while winning the Heisman at Michigan. He
describes himself like this: ``I'm going to say what I feel most of
the time, and I bring a lot of energy to the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson joins a team that has played poorly, and with an
astonishing lack of interest, over the past three seasons. He joins
a team mired in a situation that is rapidly reaching critical mass.
He joins a team desperately in need of that energy he says he
brings to the field.
</P>
<P>
   You know the East Bay jingle by now: The Raiders are fighting
the city and county, and vice versa, with legal briefs and nasty
words, at a time when both entities are supposed to be working
together to sell tickets and perhaps save the taxpayers a few
dollars in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The matter of Ignacio De La Fuente v. Al Davis is not Woodson's
immediate problem, but the Raiders hope their No. 1 pick can become
part of the solution. As a cornerback (wide receiver will have to
wait, maybe until next season), he can't control the ball, but he
knows what you're thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for me to play right off the bat,'' he
says. ``And they're looking at me to make things happen. My only
obligation here is to the team. I know from experience that you
can't please everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of the Raiders' plight, the main thrust of the
current Oakland Football Marketing Association's campaign is to
encourage PSL holders to renew their tickets for the upcoming
season. The number of PSL defections is in the thousands. The
thought of bringing in new money is decidedly secondary.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in layman's terms, the TV schedule looks like Oilers
vs. Colts on those Sunday afternoons when the Raiders are at the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working harder than we have in the past to get people to
renew,'' says OFMA director Rich Rogers. ``But I can't be at all
optimistic about any (sellouts).''
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the Raiders have made strides. For one, they
have tacitly acknowledged a few facts we've all known for quite
some time: They aren't a contender, nobody fears them anymore and
they have a lot of work to do. In fact, anything beyond six wins
will be a surprise, given their rugged early schedule and the
inevitable fits and starts that come with a new coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   They've also eliminated many of the players, most prominently
Chester McGlockton, who viewed a two-touchdown deficit as an
invitation to quit. They've made attempts to be more visible in the
community. They have been accessible and open to the media during
training camp _ not a small item when media coverage is the fans'
only means of seeing or hearing from the team.
</P>
<P>
   More could be done, of course. For instance, the 49ers and other
NFL teams get miles of great public relations by opening
training-camp practices to fans. You sit in the stands, sweat a
little bit, maybe get pile-driven into a chain-link fence as you
strain for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, you don't know what you're watching. None of
us do. You're not there to diagram defensive sets or scout
tendencies. You're there because it's a chance to see your team up
close and inexpensively.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders hold closed practices, because you never know when a
scout for the Chiefs will show up wearing a Napoleon Kaufman jersey
while surreptitiously writing down ``George likes to throw to
Brown'' in his little black book. They hold the occasional open
house (check them out this Sunday, in fact), but the prevailing
attitude is still paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the details of images and slogans, the whole ugly
mess has turned people off. It's the worst kind of new-world sports
battle: Back-tracking politicians versus a millionaire owner, with
the wallets of the public on the line. In the course of wooing the
Raiders back to town, the politicians were slavering lapdogs. Now
that the deal has soured, many of these same politicians want you
to believe they've transformed themselves into pit bulls. Somehow,
most people aren't buying it, especially those taxpayers who take
$21-million-a-year bailouts seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders' expectations have receded to a reasonable level,
and that's a start. Now the task is elemental: Give everyone a
reason to watch. Charles Woodson thinks he can help. He may not
know there's more involved than anyone could have imagined.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   How Little Guy Got Hurt in This Real Estate Partnership Saga  
   
 By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
This a story about thousands of mom-and-pop investors who got
shafted by a real estate mogul, who, in turn, got very rich at
their expense.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a complex tale that has been in the making for more than 10
years. And now, it may be finally winding down to an unhappy ending
for the small investors of a publicly traded real estate
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the little guy that got screwed in this deal,'' says Ron
Baker, a Concord real estate executive and an investor in the
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled today in Redwood City where a supervisory
judge _ who has inexplicably let this mess drag on for several
years _ will consider a resolution agreement aimed at providing
investors with some paltry (yet tangible) returns on their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the original investors of the real estate partnership,
National Realty Partners (which is publicly traded on the American
Stock Exchange), are expected to share a cash payment of about
$11.4 million. That compares to their original investments worth
several hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some 8,600 of the original limited partners of National Realty
were granted a class-action settlement &UR;  &LR; back in 1990 that has yet
to be finalized. But, for reasons that provide enough material for
a novel, it has taken until now for the class members to finally
see some action.
</P>
<P>
   But first, some history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, real estate giant Southmark turned 35 limited real
estate partnerships into a publicly traded entity. In real estate
circles the transaction is called a roll-up. The partnerships,
which owned mostly apartment complexes, were led by Atherton's
Robert McNeil, who was once the nation's second-largest syndicator
of apartment properties.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress overhauled the federal tax code in 1986, the
syndication business became obsolete and businessmen such as McNeil
sold their syndicates to big real estate firms.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, McNeil sold these limited partnerships, consisting
mostly of small investors, to Southmark, McNeil said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Southmark was one of the largest real estate firms in the
country before filing for bankruptcy at the turn of the decade. It
was run by Gene Phillips, who (guess what?) runs the entity that is
the general partner of National Realty.
</P>
<P>
   Well, after Southmark tanked, Phillips managed to retain control
of National Realty. Originally, National Realty's limited partners
were told that their shares (called units) would be worth about $66
each. But they never traded nearly that high, and in the early '90s
they traded for as low as a few dollars a unit, according to Eric
Von der Porten, a principal of San Carlos-based Leeward
Investments, a current shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, National Realty's investors weren't too
thrilled with the abysmal performance of their units. So they
pressed for a class-action settlement against Phillips and National
Realty in 1990, Von der Porten said.
</P>
<P>
   The investors reached an agreement that required the general
partner, Phillips, to make sure that National Realty's publicly
traded units reached certain target prices over subsequent years.
They also received warrants for additional units.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, National Realty's publicly traded units failed to meet
any of the price-targets set by the class-action settlement.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the investors called for Phillips to resign as head
of National Realty, which they were entitled to do under the court
agreement. In turn, the shareholders were to select a new general
partner to fix the real estate firm.
</P>
<P>
   But lo and behold, Phillips couldn't be budged. In what proved
to be a deviously brilliant move, firms controlled by him quietly
bought up National Realty's underperforming shares on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Phillips managed to amass a controlling stake in National
Realty, making the election of &UR;  &LR; a new general partner a sham.
Telephone calls to Phillips' office in Dallas were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   For the following six years, National Realty continued to
struggle along while various groups of investors and lawyers fought
over what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   An oversight committee appointed by Thomas Jenkins, a retired
Superior Court judge who has retained the case, has been riddled
with conflict and political infighting.
</P>
<P>
   National Realty investors, including Baker and Von der Porten,
accuse the judge of being far too lax in his treatment of Phillips.
They wonder why he permitted Phillips to acquire the additional
shares and retain control of the partnership. They also question
why it has taken an additional six years for Jenkins to push for a
proposed cash settlement.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Part of the problem, says Baker (who is also a member of the
oversight committee), is that there were few _ if any _
institutional investors in National Realty. If major players owned
units, investors would have seen faster action, Baker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what, if Sam Zell was in this deal, Phillips
wouldn't have gotten away with what he's been doing,'' Baker says.
Judge Jenkins was reached at his home but could not comment on the
class-action proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   To make a long story short, everybody but the investors have
been getting rich. In addition to buying undervalued stock,
Phillips' firms have been receiving millions of dollars of annual
management fees, according to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the oversight committee were earning upwards of
$50,000 a year for sitting on the panel, with one committee member
collecting a consulting fee of about $250,000. Even Jenkins is paid
about $300 an hour, according to Carol McNeil, husband of Robert
and co-chair of McNeil Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, after years of legal fees spent on behalf of
the investors, Robert McNeil isn't pleased with the proposed end of
the saga. ``I think it's inequitable for the judge to have allowed
it to come to (an $11.4 million proposed settlement),'' he says.
``Investors should get 10 times as much.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Corrections
</P>
<P>
   In a Wednesday Street Smarts column, the underwriters of two
initial public offerings were stated incorrectly. The lead-manager
of Inktomi's offering was Goldman, Sachs, and the lead-manager of
Broadcast.com's stock offering was Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 22 column, the online revenues for Barnes &AMP; Noble were
incorrectly reported. Internet-related sales for the bookseller
were $14.6 million for the year ended January 31.

COWBOYS FALL, BUT SHOW GAINS IN GAILEY'S DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ As first looks go, the inaugural performance of the
Chan Gailey era opened to favorable reviews last night at Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman looked comfortable in the shotgun. The
off-season addition of running back Chris Warren proved brilliant
when he scored on a 15-yard touchdown run after replacing an
injured Emmitt Smith in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And the revamped defensive scheme showed signs of being able to
stop the run.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle looked the best on the scoreboard, however, escaping
with a 20-19 exhibition victory.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gailey, who played his starters just the first quarter,
had to be happy with the results of his first game, even if
preseason, as an NFL head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some really nice things by the first-team offense and
defense,'' Gailey said. ``We picked up the speed of the game well
on both sides of the ball. I was disappointed we didn't win. We got
a lot of nice things to teach from on film.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith bruised his left elbow after rushing three times for 11
yards on the first series. Smith's injury was not considered
serious and he could have returned to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who was eager to test the Cowboys' new offense against
other another team, left the game with a good feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We converted a few third downs, which is a positive,'' Aikman
said. ``And we were able to put together a nice scoring drive. We
ran the ball pretty well and we had some solid pass protection. I
felt good while I was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The positive outcome, however, didn't come without a dubious
opening series when left tackle Larry Allen thwarted the drive with
a false start, reviving dark memories of the litany of penalties in
last season's 6-10 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's multiple offense looked lethal as advertised the next
time the Cowboys got the ball. Aikman hit tight end David LaFleur
over the middle for a 29-yard reception on the second play of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Warren ran behind left guard Nate Newton for 4 yards. Two plays
later, Aikman hit Michael Irvin for 8 yards and a first down out of
the shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Warren, who signed as a free agent with Cowboys in the
off-season after spending eight years with the Seahawks, took some
angst out on his former teammates. On first down at the Seattle 15,
he ran through a huge hole on the right side of the Cowboys'
offensive line and carried Seahawks defenders Darryl Williams and
Shawn Springs into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who also had a fumble, scored twice in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Also of note on the drive was the impressive play of the
Cowboys' offensive line, considered the root of the Cowboys'
failures last season. The line was impressive despite the absence
of starting right guard Everett McIver, who sustained a deep cut on
his neck in a dormitory incident at training camp this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a little while to get going,'' said Newton, who
trimmed down to 315 pounds in the off-season. ``After the first
series, we got in a groove and were able to feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense, which has modified its traditional 4-3
scheme and will offer a 3-4 look, appeared to take steps toward
improving on last season's ranking of 24th against the run.
</P>
<P>
   Newly acquired Seattle running back Ricky Watters, who rushed 30
times for 194 yards in two games against the Cowboys when he was
with the Eagles last year, gained only 19 yards on seven carries
against the Cowboys' first team defense.
</P>
<P>
   Boosting the defense was the return of Leon Lett, who missed the
first 13 games last season after being suspended by the NFL for
violating the league's substance-abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   Lett and Hennings, who is playing nose tackle in the new
defense, clogged up the middle, enabling the linebackers to pursue
from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a unit, I think we were all swarming pretty good,''
linebacker Dexter Coakley said. ``We had a lot of hats on the ball.
It all starts up front, and it was great to see Leon mixing it up
with Chad in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   If the overall defensive performance is an indication, then
untested defensive ends Kavika Pittman and top draft pick Greg
Ellis certainly didn't prove to be a liability. Neither recorded a
sack, but both played solidly against the run.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Wheaton, who got the start at free safety, did nothing to
hurt his chances in his battle against Omar Stoutmire and George
Teague, knocking down a pass and offering solid run support.
</P>
<P>
   Little was decided at No. 2 receiver. Ernie Mills got the start
but did not catch a pass. His main competitor Billy Davis caught
two for 9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Among the young players catching attention with their play in
the game were running back Beau Morgan, linebacker K.D. Williams on
special teams, free-agent receiver Jeff Ogden and third-string
quarterback Daniel Gonzalez.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Hollywood Makes a Deal for Reel.com  
   
 By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Hollywood Entertainment Corp. is paying a steep $100 million for
Reel.com Inc., a video merchant based in Emeryville that does
business mostly over the Internet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Private investors had plowed a total of $14.5 million into
16-month-old Reel.com prior to yesterday's announced deal, which
will give the owners a nearly 700 percent return on their
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood will pay $30 million in cash and issue 5 million
restricted shares worth $70 million for Reel, which includes a
growing Web site and an 8,000-square-foot store in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``absolutely makes sense,'' said Kate Delhagen, an
analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood ``has bought itself an entree into the wild and woolly
Web retail landscape. Potentially, they paid a premium for it, but
five years from now, it might not look like a premium,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring Reel, Hollywood gets an up-and-running Web presence
without having to launch one on its own. Reel rents and sells
85,000 video titles and offers movie reviews and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood also is positioning itself for the future, when
company executives believe that video-on-demand, which allows
customers to download video directly into homes via cable or
computer modems, will make rental stores obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, Hollywood will promote Reel.com in its
stores, which serve 25 million customers. Reel.com will keep its
name, though the Hollywood Video name also may appear on the site
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Reel.com's revenues last year were minuscule, about $1 million,
said chief executive Julie Wainwright, who had been preparing the
company for a public offering this fall before the acquisition by
publicly traded Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But Wainwright said traffic to Reel.com has jumped to 200,000
unique visitors last week from 20,000 in May, Wainwright said.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 percent of visitors check in to use Reel Genius, a type
of ``smart'' software that recommends movies to people based on the
other films they like or dislike, Wainwright said.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, based in Wilsonville, Ore., is the second-largest
video chain after Blockbuster, with about 1,100 stores in the
United States. It intends to keep Reel.com's current management and
operate Reel.com as a wholly owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its Web site, which launched last April, Reel.com
operates a one-year-old video store in Berkeley. &UR;  &LR; It has not been
decided whether the store will continue to operate under the name
Reel. Because of the acquisition, Reel.com has abandoned plans to
open stores in New York and Los Angeles later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge in the merger will be to satisfy both
Reel.com's customer base of film aficionados and Hollywood's
more-popular following, Delhagen said.
</P>
<P>
   But Wainwright said Reel.com, like the Web in general, is
attracting an increasingly broad audience. ``It's a nice hybrid,
which fits in extremely well with the Hollywood Video customer,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the acquisition, Hollywood announced that several
of Reel's largest shareholders had bought $67.5 million worth of
restricted Hollywood shares.
</P>
<P>
   Those investors, who will help Hollywood develop its
video-on-demand strategy, include Intel Corp., CMG &LR; Ventures, Vulcan
Ventures Inc. and Scott Beck, former vice chairman of Blockbuster
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The other major Reel shareholder is Stuart Skorman, a video
industry veteran and Reel's founder. Skorman remains a consultant
to Reel.com.
</P>
<P>
   Reel.com's 80 employees also own shares in the company.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Management Shuffle at Wells, Norwest  
   
 By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Wells Fargo and Norwest announced this week a wave of management
appointments in keeping with their pledge to make their
consolidation ``a merger of equals.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Merger Update newsletter given to bank employees this past
Wednesday named five key staff appointments, with the top two going
to Wells executives.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Vice Chairman and chief credit officer Michael Gillfillan
was appointed chief credit officer of the combined company. Jim
Vanasek, his Norwest counterpart in Minneapolis, will report to
Gillfillan.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Callahan, executive vice president of Wells Fargo and
head of wholesale banking systems, finance and operations, will
become head of human resources for the new Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hansen, her counterpart at Norwest, plans to retire after
the transition. So does Wells' current personnel director, Kevin
Sullivan, who recently succeeded Callahan in that job.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest General Counsel Stan Stroup will keep that title at the
combined bank. Guy Rounsaville, who has a similar title at Wells,
is considering whether to accept another position.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest corporate communications chief Larry Haeg will keep that
job, and Wells senior VP of public relations Kim Kellogg has
decided to leave and set up her own public relations consulting
practice.
</P>
<P>
   John Ganoe, head of corporate development and acquisitions at
Norwest, also will retain his title.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is expected to be completed in November. The
surviving name will be Wells Fargo, and its headquarters will
remain in San Francisco. Norwest chief Richard Kovacevich will move
to San Francisco as president and chief executive. Wells Fargo boss
Paul Hazen will be chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In another merger update earlier this month, the banks announced
severance benefits for 2,130 headquarters staff in San Francisco
and Minneapolis who are likely to lose their jobs as the bnks
consolidate their combined workforce of about 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Employees who have worked less than two years will receive no
less than 11 weeks of compensation, and up to 8 months of pay, if
their jobs are eliminated. For more than 20 years of service,
separation pay runs from 11 to 15 months.

HENMAN IS SMASH WITHOUT ANY FLASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tim Henman is an English tennis player. And more.
</P>
<P>
   He's English cooking. He's English weather. He's English humor.
</P>
<P>
   Dull. Drab. Dry.
</P>
<P>
   He's boring even to the English. Which makes him, when you think
about it, a curiosity in a tennis world of neon personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Henman defeated Byron Black of Zimbabwe 5-7, 6-1, 6-4 Friday
afternoon to advance to a semifinal match in the Mercedes-Benz Cup
at the Los Angeles Tennis Center. He did it in typically stolid
style, shrugging off a linesman's error near the end of the first
set as well as his own inconsistencies without so much as a
frustrated shout.
</P>
<P>
   He'll face Guillaume Raoux of France today in the semifinals
and, as they say in his native Oxford, Henman oughta moiderize him.
But that would be too flashy.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking of the way Henman, 23, is regarded by the press
back home. Here's a column in The Observer shortly after his
semifinal loss to Pete Sampras at Wimbledon a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prickly, Prissy Perfectionist Who Pulls All the Right
Strings,'' reads the headline. If the word ``prissy'' ever appears
in the headline over one of my columns, I'll expect to get slugged
in the clubhouse the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the story notes Henman's ``somewhat anonymous brand of
good looks,'' ``impassive demeanor,'' and his purposely
unprovocative conversation. His coach, his girlfriend and even his
parents come in for criticism, ``all apparently schooled in the
same defensive discretion that Henman cultivates so assiduously.''
</P>
<P>
   As you could tell by the big words, that wasn't even one of the
notorious English tabloids but one of the respected newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   There are two points to be made about this.
</P>
<P>
   First, the newspapers there ought to lighten up because Henman
is the best thing to happen to English tennis in decades. He's on
the verge of a top-10 world ranking, and failed to become the first
Englishman in 60 years to reach the Wimbledon final only because
the eventual winner got in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the newspapers there ought to lighten up because their
wish for a more flamboyant Henman is having exactly zero effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's a popular pastime of mine, to read the
English press,'' he said, coming dangerously close to cracking a
grin. ``Everybody's entitled to their opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say I'm not flamboyant enough, fine. But I'm sure
they'd much rather I play the kind of tennis I did at Wimbledon
than be flamboyant and play poorly. At the end of the day, I'm not
acting out on the court, what you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Henman has been this way since he took up tennis at
age 3, grandson of Wimbledon player Henry Billington. They talk
about his early maturity, single-mindedness and fundamental
soundness on the court.
</P>
<P>
   An early mentor is quoted saying, ``Tim's best shot has always
been his head.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been true here at the Los Angeles stop on the ATP Tour,
where, after three weeks' vacation following Wimbledon, Henman is
beginning his hard-court preparation for the Aug. 31-Sept. 13 U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, Henman faced Jeff Tarango, one of the
flightier personalities on the tour. Tarango snapped a racket over
his knee and bickered with the chair umpire throughout the match.
Henman kept his head down and won in two sets.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, it was Henman who suffered the potentially critical bad
line call. If he were Tarango, he'd still be whining about it.
</P>
<P>
   He led 5-4 and 40-30 with Black serving in the first set. The
first serve landed a foot long but was ruled good. An ace. Worst
call of the tournament. Deuce.
</P>
<P>
   Henman held his arms out and quietly asked the umpire to
overrule the linesman. Nothing doing. So Henman shook his head,
turned and got ready for the next serve.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament's second seed wound up losing the set to the
seventh-seeded Black, a former USC star who hits two-handed on both
sides, but controlled the rest of the match, closing it out with
his 19th ace.
</P>
<P>
   When Henman is in the groove, his first serve, surprisingly
strong for a 6-foot-1, 155-pounder, and his hard, flat
groundstrokes are too much for anybody. When he isn't in the
groove, you might notice a mild four-letter word, but only if you
read lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's really in my nature (to complain),'' he
said. ``I play pretty aggressive tennis, but most of the time I'm
in control of my emotions. If I'm shouting and screaming, I'm
probably not going to concentrate on the job at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here and there, you have days when you're hitting the ball
poorly, and you're entitled to a few bad days mentally. But they've
been few and far between.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, once, he did lose it on the court. He slugged a ball in
anger during a Wimbledon doubles match in 1995, accidentally
bopping a ballgirl on the head, and was disqualified. But that is
likely to go down as the single moment of insanity in a career of
calculated dullness.
</P>
<P>
   Think Pete Sampras is quiet, unshakeable, even-tempered? Well,
compared to Tim Henman, Sampras is John McEnroe. &QL;

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Tile Product Helps Clorox Clean Up  
   
 By Amy Doan  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Clorox Co. enjoyed a 32 percent jump in profits in the past quarter
from strong domestic sales of its core cleansing products, led by
the debut of a new tile cleaner.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Net income for the fourth fiscal quarter at the Oakland-based
company totaled a record $98.2 million (93 cents per diluted share)
on $819.7 million in revenue compared with $74.4 million (71 cents)
on $762.5 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings results beat an estimate by a First Call Corp.
analyst poll by 12 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive performance is very broad-based and not just
attributable to events this quarter in a single business unit,''
said Scott House, vice president and treasurer of Clorox.
</P>
<P>
   According to House, the company had record shipments for the
quarter and year for its Formula 409 and Pine-Sol cleansers,
Kingsford charcoal, Hidden Valley Salad dressing and K.C.
Masterpiece barbecue sauce. He also said the Tilex Fresh Shower
product launched four months ago has been a top seller and has
boosted overall revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh Shower is Clorox's first entry into a new household
cleaning product category called ``preventive cleansers'' that are
sprayed onto tiles immediately after someone uses the shower.
</P>
<P>
   The company also saw earnings increased due to lower taxes on
its international sales, which accounted for 18 percent of its
revenue in the past quarter compared to 16 percent a year ago.
Overseas sales were taxed at a lower rate than domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to become more global like Colgate and Procter
&AMP; Gamble and other competitors,'' said Constance Maneaty, an
analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clorox stock closed yesterday at $103.25, up $8.50 for the day.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Microsoft's Allen Buying Cable TV Firm  
   
 By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Billionaire Paul Allen may be the latest person to make a big
investment in a cable company, but in this era of converging
technologies, he certainly won't be the last.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Paul Allen, AT&AMP;T and other players in the coming months are
pursuing a (cable) strategy,'' said Cynthia Brumfield, an analyst
with Paul Kagan Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft Corp., announced yesterday that
he had agreed to buy Charter Communications of St. Louis, for $4.5
billion. He plans to merge Charter with Marcus Cable of Dallas,
which he bought in April for $2.8 billion, creating the nation's
seventh largest cable company.
</P>
<P>
   An Allen spokeswoman said he may continue to invest in the cable
industry. ``When Mr. Allen talks about his `wired world' strategy,
he contemplates a convergence of the telephone, the television and
the PC,'' said Susan Pierson, a spokeswoman for Vulcan Ventures,
Allen's investment firm in Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Allen was out of the country and not available for comment. He
co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, and he remains the
company's second largest shareholder. His net worth is estimated at
$20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal follows AT&AMP;T's announcement last month that it would
acquire TCI, the nation's largest cable company, for $60 million.
Microsoft has also made major cable investments, most recently
sinking $212.5 million into RoadRunner, Time Warner's cable
Internet service. Last year Microsoft made a $1 billion investment
in the Comcast cable company.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies are in a prime position to capitalize on the
growth of the Internet and the transition to digital television
because because they already have high-speed wires to consumers'
homes. While some cable services are already delivering high-speed
Internet access to personal computers, analysts say the real future
lies in providing interactive television. The future also could
include video-on-demand and easy access to large databases.
</P>
<P>
   Most cable systems are retooling to offer digital television,
which includes interactive TV. Such a system can enable viewers to
send and receive data, video, sound and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments in
New York, said Allen may have signaled his move away from computers
and toward television when he sold his remaining shares in his
Internet company Starwave to the Walt Disney Co. in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen views the future of the true mass market, the really,
really big bucks future, as something that will not make Starwave
obsolete, but far less significant than it is today,'' Simons said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson, Allen's spokeswoman, said that thinking represents ``a
bit of a stretch'' considering Allen's investment in Microsoft and
50 other technology and new media companies.  &LR;

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Nat Semi Wants Its Workers to Take Break  
   
 By David Einstein and Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Computer giant Hewlett-Packard and chipmaker National Semiconductor
asked employees to tighten their belts yesterday as the companies
try to ride out a downturn in business.
<TEXT>
<P>
   HP said it will impose a 5 percent pay cut on some 2,400 middle-
and upper-level managers, including chief executive Lewis Platt and
other top executives. The cut will start tomorrow and last for
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto-based HP also said it will close its U.S. operations
between Christmas and New Year's, and ask its international offices
to shut down for the same number of days.
</P>
<P>
   National Semi is asking 13,000 employees _ including 4,000 who
work at its Santa Clara headquarters _ to take off any 10 days
between September 1 and November 30. They can take the days without
pay, or can use accrued vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are suffering from the economic turmoil in Asia
that has reduced demand and prices for U.S.-made chips and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   HP, the No.2 U.S. computer maker, has been struggling to control
expenses amid a drop in revenues. It has suffered a string of
disappointing financial results and has warned that its
third-quarter earnings won't meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Anne McGrath said HP decided that pay cuts and
holiday closings were preferable to layoffs. ``The goal is to keep
the workforce intact so that when the business cycle returns, we'll
have our workers in place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost-cutting measures come on top of a recent curb in hiring
and restrictions on employee travel. They also follow more limited
pay cuts that some HP workers reportedly were asked to take after
the company posted disappointing results in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   HP hasn't had to impose such drastic cost-cutting steps since
1985, when it clamped down on hiring and overtime, limited the use
of temporary workers and closed offices over the Fourth of July
holiday. In 1971 it saved money by making workers take every other
Friday off without pay.
</P>
<P>
   National Semi's furlough comes in the wake of an earlier layoff.
In April, National laid off 1,400 workers, or 10 percent of its
workforce, mostly by closing down two obsolete factories.
</P>
<P>
   National, like other chipmakers, had rough sailing as a result
of falling prices for microprocessors and other chips used in
personal computers and electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   It also has been hurt by weakness of its Cyrix division, which
competes against Intel and AMD. The company lost $69.3 million in
its most recent quarter, and chief executive Brian Halla has said
he does not see a quick turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Like HP, National blamed poor economic conditions in Asia for
forcing it to cut costs. The company also cited softness in the PC
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not selling as many chips into the mid- and high-range
PC market,'' said spokeswoman LuAnn Jenkins. She said the main
shortfall was not in microprocessors, which are the brains of a
computer, but the bundle of chips that surround the microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty bad market,'' said Fred Zieber, president of
Pathfinder Research in San Jose. ``National has been hit by that as
much as anyone, maybe more.''
</P>
<P>
   In suspending operations, National is not alone. Intel, the
leading chipmaker, closed two factories in Oregon for eight days
around July 4.

WITHOUT THEIR NEWCOMERS, RANGERS COME UP WAY SHORT IN 10-2 LOSS TO
WHITE SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Big, deadline-beating trades like the two
that Rangers general manager Doug Melvin made yesterday are
supposed to give teams an immediate boost.
</P>
<P>
   But the first game of the new era began with a whimper last
night, as the Rangers lost to the Chicago White Sox, 10-2, at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The shot-in-the-arm theory came true in 1996. The Rangers got a
lift when Melvin acquired starting pitcher John Burkett for the
stretch drive, and went on to win the American League West crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually moves like these give you a shot of energy, especially
initially,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``In '96, I thought our
ballclub got a big lift from John Burkett. With the inclusion of
the three players we got, it gives us a big lift.''
</P>
<P>
   The boost theory got a boost two years ago when Burkett shut out
the Toronto Blue Jays in his first start as a Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will hold true this year when Todd Stottlemyre, Royce
Clayton and Todd Zeile actually join the team. Then, maybe the
Rangers will snap out of the doldrums. The team has lost six of its
past seven games and was 1 1/2 games behind the Anaheim Angels in
the AL West pending the result of the Angels game with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the 1996 booster himself took the loss last night.
Burkett allowed six runs (five earned) on eight hits in 5 2/3
innings to fall to 6-11.
</P>
<P>
   The big blow was a grand slam by White Sox designated hitter
Frank Thomas in the fifth inning that turned a close game into a
rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The four runs there took a little bit of wind out of our
sails,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Further deflating the Rangers was a two-run home run in the
seventh by Albert Belle off reliever Tim Crabtree. It was Belle's
16th home run in July, a major-league record for the month. Belle
had been tied with four players, including Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett had a good outing going until the pitch to Thomas. The
only run in the first four innings wasn't his fault. Mike Cameron
scored in the third when he reached on an error by third baseman
Luis Alicea and scored on a passed ball by catcher Ivan Rodriguez _
his ninth of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth Burkett had a chance to limit the damage to one run
when he faced Thomas with two outs and the bases loaded, but Thomas
clubbed the first pitch he saw over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was down, but it was a hanging slider,'' Burkett said. ``It
was a cookie. I thought I threw the ball well, but that was the
worst pitch of the night. It was down, but it just didn't do
anything. You can't throw a pitch like that to a guy like him or
he'll kill it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett ended with a rather ugly line, but it didn't represent
how well he pitched. The zero walks and seven strikeouts suggest he
had pretty good stuff, and might have fared better if he hadn't
thrown the pitch to Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it's been a year of `ifs' for me,'' Burkett
said. ``Instead of an off year, this has been an if year. You get a
little frustrated and tired by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The proper adjective for Burkett might be inconsistent, a word
that also applies to the offense. The Rangers still lead the majors
in runs scored, but managed just three runs the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   They figured to do better last night, against rookie
right-hander John Snyder. Snyder was 2-0, but had a 12.96 ERA in
his past two starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got to the rookie early, scoring a run in the second
on a triple by Roberto Kelly and a double by Lee Stevens. But they
didn't get on the scoreboard again until Alicea's two-out home run
in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, Oates isn't ready to discard the boost theory,
at least until the players arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Oates said. ``I'm excited about
seeing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps seeing the new players, and actually putting them in the
lineup, will provide that shot in the arm.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   More Retailers Using Rewards Clubs to Lure Customers  
   
 By Amy Doan  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
If you, like Groucho Marx, resist joining any club that would have
you as a member, you have your work cut out for you these days.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's difficult to buy anything without being asked to join
rewards clubs _ membership programs that encourage faithful
shopping with discounts and giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Businesses as diverse as the San Francisco Giants and the
Oakland A's, Lucky's and Safeway, and Sam Goody and Camelot music
stores use the cards to hand out a wide-range of rewards, including
free parking passes to the Oakland Coliseum, free Thanksgiving
turkeys and discounted CDs.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies running these programs have more to gain than
you do, not just in repeat business but in mountains of cheap,
instant market research.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a new flood of these cards recently because the
data collection technology is really maturing,'' said Michael
Moriarty, vice president of A.T. Kearney, a consulting firm in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs have evolved from their humble punch and stamp-card
origins and now are high tech, complete with bar codes that let
retailers tap into  &LR;   &LR; powerful databases of customer information.
</P>
<P>
   Club cards now are in about half of U.S. grocery stores,
compared with less than 5 percent in 1992, according to the Food
Marketing Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The cards are central to what Moriarty and other retail analysts
call ``loyalty marketing'' _ an attempt to build long-term
relationships with customers rather than generate one-time
purchases with coupons or promotions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Paw Paw Supermarkets in Michigan keeps a database
of birthdays pulled from its club card applications.
</P>
<P>
   If a customer shows up at the checkout counter within a few
weeks of his birthday, he'll walk out with a free cake and candles.
</P>
<P>
   Most large chains haven't gotten that personal yet, though some
use last names from the cards to personalize their checkers'
``thank you's.''
</P>
<P>
   Volume-buying incentives are still the most common pitch for
joining a loyalty program. Safeway's Club Card, which was launched
in September, encourages customers to shop exclusively at the
grocery chain because they can earn members-only prices and a 5
percent shopping discount after they spend $250.
</P>
<P>
   Moriarty said that despite suspicion among some shoppers that
the ``member prices'' just reflect discounts taken off of
previously raised prices, customers can, in fact, save money with
the cards. He advises them to follow the same rules that apply for
coupon-clipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't buy stuff that you wouldn't ordinarily just
because it's on sale, but you can save if something you regularly
purchase is being pushed by the manufacturer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moriarty also advises consumers to do some calculating before
joining any rewards program, especially ones that charge a
membership fee.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Sam Goody Replay program charges customers a
$7.99 annual fee before they can start earning discounts on compact
discs.
</P>
<P>
   The discounts, though, are just the ``carrot'' that keeps
shoppers coming back. The real aim of loyalty marketing is less
obvious to consumers: &UR;  &LR; information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sophisticated, cost-effective way to gather massive
amounts of spending and demographic data over long periods of
time,'' Moriarty said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when customers fill out an application for a card,
they include their residence and sometimes their age and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Then whenever a card is swiped at the checkout counter to tally
up membership discounts, a bar code instantly updates the grocery
chain's central research database.
</P>
<P>
   If a shopper suddenly is buying jars of baby food and diapers,
the store, using the data compiled on the customer, can make him a
prime target for mailings promoting school lunch supplies a few
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Stores also can crunch the data to make sure that the club
discounts increase sales and not just cut into profits for items
that already are popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can really slice and dice it now because the programs have
been around long enough and the stores understand the value of the
investment better,'' said Ann Raider, vice president of Consumer
Card Marketing Inc. in Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For about $1 million per 100 stores, Raider's company can set up
a club card program and provide tailored research runs.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a lot of cash, but the set-up price is cheap
compared with the cost of luring new shoppers away from competitors
through multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   That's an especially strong concern in the grocery business,
which is battling flat population growth and competition with
prepared-food chains like Boston Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky's and Safeway aren't the only companies battling for
customers with loyalty cards.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland A's launched a ``Frequent FanCard'' this season
comparable to the San Francisco Giants' Rewards Club, which was
started two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The A's' version lets fans earn free chicken soft tacos,
commemorative pins and game tickets if they rack up enough
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But to accumulate the points they can cash in for rewards, A's
fans first must swipe their card at an often-crowded kiosk in the
Coliseum, then answer questions on an interactive touch screen.
</P>
<P>
   The questions range from ``Did you bring your family to the game
today?'' and ``Through which newspaper do you follow the A's?'' to
``Do you prefer regular hot dogs or Italian sausage?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas before we had to rely on an outside firm to come in
and perform a fan poll, this program lets us constantly learn more
about our customers,'' said Gary Phillips, the A's ticket
operations manager.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he keeps the question list brief and that most
fans don't mind spending a few minutes at the keyboard during a
game.
</P>
<P>
   But companies must be sure that their loyalty programs don't
cross the line and start to inconvenience or intrude on customers,
said A.T. Kearny's Moriarty.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``If you have to go to a counter way in the back of a store
and fill out some huge form with personal information just to save
two dollars, it's not going to be worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Yeung, a 36-year-old shopper at the Ocean Beach Safeway in
San Francisco, said he stays away from loyalty programs because of
the privacy issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They already know too much about you,'' he said while filling
his basket with frozen Red Baron pizzas that he could have gotten
half-price as a member.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Safeway says it doesn't sell its members' individual names or
addresses, but like most other grocery stores, it sells general
research, said Safeway spokeswoman Debra Lambert in Pleasanton.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a company like Procter &AMP; Gamble might pay to access
trend data on who's buying Cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble can't send mailings directly to consumers, but
they can use the card-research database to customize the mailings
sent out by the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's enough to make Yeung ignore the ``member price''
tickets in the frozen foods aisle.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that even if he had no privacy concerns, the
savings aren't enough to induce him to stuff one more card in his
already-full wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Dodd, a 14-year-old from San Francisco looking for a pair
of silver hoop earrings in San Francisco Centre, also is keeping
her wallet free of club cards. ``I just toss them,'' she said..
</P>
<P>
   She's opted not to join the Claire's Accessories Earring Club,
which could get her a free pair after she buys nine. ``I'd have to
buy three wallets just to cram all of them in,'' Dodd said.

L.A. GANG PEACEMAKER TO RECEIVE AWARD FROM UNITED NATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- When the bullets fly in the barrios of the
northeast San Fernando Valley and the rest of the world shuts its
blinds, you'll find William ``Blinky'' Rodriguez talking one-on-one
with the gang members who prowl the streets.
</P>
<P>
   It was his persistence that resulted in the 1993 Valley Unity
Peace treaty, which brought calm to the area and might have saved
dozens of lives.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday it was announced that Rodriguez's peacekeeping efforts
will be honored with a medal of excellence from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just totally blown away -- I was like, jeez,'' Rodriguez
said after learning he won the award. ``I have to admit my blood's
kind of boiling -- just the anticipation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a suburban Sylmar resident, is one of 14 people
worldwide who will be awarded the Fete d' Excellence for 1998, the
medal-of-excellence laureate issued by the World Wins Corp., a
nonprofit organization based in Beverly Hills, in conjunction with
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the former kick-boxing champion will fly to Geneva,
Switzerland, with his wife, Lilly, to accept the award and speak
before a U.N. round table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go there and tell them there's hope -- that it's
not over till it's over,'' said Rodriguez, 44. ``The reality is,
it's been five years and there are still individuals interested in
sustaining the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the Swiss dignitaries will welcome Rodriguez and
the other laureates at a ceremonial gala concert in Geneva's
Victoria Hall. The next day Rodriguez will be presented his medal
at a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Wilda Spalding, heir to the Spalding athletic gear fortune and
president of World Wins Corp., became aware of Rodriguez's work in
the San Fernando Valley to establish the peace treaty and nominated
him for the award.
</P>
<P>
   The award sends a message to the Northeast Valley that people
who do positive things will be recognized, said Councilman Richard
Alarcon, whose 7th District encompasses many of the gang-plagued
neighborhoods where Rodriguez works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is they did such a good job that in the first year of
the peace treaty, there were 48 homicides total, and 24 were
gang-related,'' Alarcon said. ``The second year it dropped to four
gang-related homicides, and it's still way down from when the peace
treaty started.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a heart attack Rodriguez suffered a few months ago has not
stopped him from continuing his work in the community, the
councilman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blinky doesn't do this for the award,'' Alarcon added. ``I
know he has a deep, deep passion for trying to improve our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   As executive director of Communities in Schools, a nonprofit
group that works with at-risk youths, Rodriguez has been
instrumental in keeping the level of gang violence down, said City
Attorney James Hahn's spokesman Ted Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City Attorney's Office and the LAPD are quite proud of Mr.
Rodriguez in regards to this honor,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez spearheaded efforts to organize the unprecedented
peace treaty in the fall of 1993 among 75 Latino street gangs in
the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   He took to the streets with peace treaty volunteers -- most of
them affiliated with the Victory Outreach Church -- organizing
weekly meetings of gang leaders and cruising the barrios by night,
looking for potential hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   By day, he kept tabs on the gang members over the telephone.
When shootings occurred, he went into action to prevent
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Five months after the truce was brokered, city officials
credited the peace treaty for a 70 percent drop in gang-related
homicides in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the years before the treaty, Rodriguez and his wife had
worked with at-risk youths and gang members they had trained at
their Van Nuys kick-boxing and martial-arts gym. But as fate would
have it, in 1990 their son was killed by the very element they were
trying to help, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Rodriguez, a teen-ager at the time, was killed in a
gang-related drive-by shooting. His father used the experience as
the foundation for his work with the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my kid got killed, it just ignited the passion and
compassion to do the work,'' Rodriguez said. ``It was either that
or become a time bomb. We chose this route, and it's not been
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism that the treaty was disintegrating when gang
violence erupted, Rodriguez said he persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be the naysayer, and if you look at
that, you're going to stumble,'' he said. ``You have to move
forward and breathe vision and hope into the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Today he travels to schools and juvenile camps, trying to reach
potential gang members before it's too late. He also helped create
a business entrepreneurial program at Universal CityWalk that
provides middle- and upper-management mentors for at-risk youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has its pros and cons,'' Rodriguez said. ``We've
had our potholes in the road, but we're legitimate and have
provided outcomes time and time again.''

DODGERS ENJOY REUNION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the first night of the big reunion, the Dodgers
had the last dance.
</P>
<P>
   They had come to Shea Stadium Friday hoping Mike Piazza and
Hideo Nomo had gotten really homely since joining the New York Mets
earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers found a rare beauty in Roger Cedeno, whose
two-out, ninth-inning triple started a three-run rally that led to
a 4-3 victory in front of 49,407.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers already were excited about the acquisition
of left-hander Carlos Perez and infielder Mark Grudzielanek just
before the game, it was the comeback that created the biggest buzz.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that Piazza grounded into two double plays,
nearly lined into a third and got booed after every at-bat. But
this was not a night for sneering. There was too much else going
on.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young returned after nearly three weeks on the disabled
list and doubled home the winning run. But when Cedeno tripled
against Mets closer John Franco, then scored when Franco bounced a
screwball through Piazza's legs for a wild pitch, the Dodgers' day
was complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of big things happened today and it looks like all of
them good,'' said first baseman Eric Karros. ``We got a big win
against a team we need to beat, got back Eric Young and got some
people that can help us win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers remain 4{ games behind Chicago for the wild-card
spot, but they moved within a half-game of the Mets, who fell
behind San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who has been sidelined with a strained left thigh,
learned he was activated when Wilton Guerrero was pulled from the
starting lineup just moments before gametime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised, but I was ready to go,'' said Young, who grew
up in nearby New Brunswick, N.J. ``This was a big night for me. I'm
from here and I played my first game here after I was traded to the
Dodgers last year. I always want to do well here. I want us to do
well here.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Raul Mondesi is out with a bad back that could force him
to miss a few more days, Trenidad Hubbard started in center. That
made the Dodgers stay with Matt Luke against the left-handed Franco
(0-4), and Luke opened with a single to left.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a meaningless hit after Adrian Beltre and Charles
Johnson struck out. Cedeno batted for eventual winning pitcher
Antonio Osuna (6-0) and tripled high off the wall in right-center,
scoring Luke and cutting the lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers brought in Tom Prince to bat, and Franco threw a
screwball in the dirt that skidded through Piazza's legs and
allowed Cedeno to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Prince then singled and came around when Young doubled to the
wall in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was stunned, but regained its composure and booed
Franco off the field. He responded by making an obscene gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw Cedeno coming off the bench and we just went after
him,'' Piazza said. ``He really hit that ball. On the wild pitch,
he just buried the screwball and I never had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza didn't get too excited about the four-game weekend series
against his former team, either. Nomo pitches Sunday against Brian
Bohanon, who was traded from the Mets to the Dodgers for Greg
McMichael, who came over from New York for Dave Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been so much movement over there that there aren't
really that many guys I still know,'' Piazza said. ``I know it
doesn't seem possible that this could have been just another game,
but it seemed that way.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Notes:!off! Bobby Bonilla had his surgically repaired
left wrist examined Friday and was given a cortisone shot he hopes
will help put him back on the field by the end of the trip.
Bonilla, who was hoping to start a rehab program, now says he is
hopeful to contribute for the final two months. ``I'm eager to go,
but there will be only so much I can do,'' he said. ``But the
doctor was very positive after our meeting and I am, too.''...
Friday morning, Piazza spoke to Todd Zeile. the former Dodger who
went to Florida in the big May 15. Zeile, who has 66 RBI, was
traded to the Texas Rangers on Friday. ``He told me he had heard he
was going to Boston,'' Piazza said. ``I think he was pretty
bummed.''

BAN ON BILINGUAL CLASSES GETS GREEN LIGHT FROM FEDERAL JUDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge &UR;  &LR; denied an 11th-hour attempt to
stop city schools from implementing Proposition 227 next week,
suggesting that instructors are ready to teach successfully under
the new English-immersion plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for two civil rights groups rushed to court Thursday,
claiming the Los Angeles Unified School District is woefully
unprepared to educate non-English-speaking students under
guidelines announced only two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing more than an hour of arguments Friday afternoon,
U.S. District Judge Lourdes Baird acknowledged that the district
faces pitfalls, but declined to order administrators to scrap their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the change is going to cause a
considerable amount of disruption. Changes do,'' Baird said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern
California and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund were seeking little more than a delay. A lawsuit challenging
the proposition itself is still under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The new law calls for most non-English-speaking children to be
placed in mainstream classes after a year of intense English
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   To get what they wanted, the plaintiffs had to prove that
students would be irreparably damaged by the district's
implementation plan, set to begin in about 50 year-round schools
Monday, with more than 150 more schools joining by the end of the
month.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, MALDEF attorney Thomas Saenz urged people to
``put the district under a magnifying glass'' and protest if they
find blemishes in the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making it up as you go along is not the proper way to teach
kids,'' said Saenz, who in court called the district's plan a
``skeletal outline.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, the school district contributed a court
brief to a lawsuit trying to stop Proposition 227 in a San
Francisco-based federal court. But on Thursday, district lawyer
Bradley Phillips insisted that administrators and teachers are
qualified to meet the educational needs of students under the
guidelines of the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted more time. We asked for it in the San Francisco
court and we asked for it at the (state) Board of Education,''
Phillips said. ``(But) there is no evidence . . . that these
students will not be receiving an education immediately on Monday,
and in the ensuing weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird seemed to agree and bristled at Saenz's suggestion that
teachers would be unable to teach under a program that is
unfamiliar to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you might not be giving the teachers the credit
they're due,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for MALDEF and the ACLU said they might appeal or
bring the motion to court again with more facts in a few weeks, but
admitted that the battle lost this week was a crucial one.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, legally, nothing can be done before (Monday),''
Saenz said.

GIMELSTOB SCORES UPSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Justin Gimelstob is young and impetuous, so it's
no shocker when the 21-year-old shouts something mildly absurd
like, ``This is my house!''
</P>
<P>
   But when Gimelstob made that electronically amplified
declaration to a packed house at the Los Angeles Tennis Center at
UCLA on Friday night, no one could smirk at his exuberant boast. He
had already backed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob, the former UCLA star and the world's 98th-ranked
player, pulled off a stunning upset of top seed and fifth-ranked
Patrick Rafter in the quarterfinals of the Mercedes-Benz Cup. And
he had to boast _ albeit semi-seriously _ afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just joking around. I was just mouthing off,'' Gimelstob
said an hour after defeating Rafter 6-4, 6-3. But he was serious
when he said he expected the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not shocked. I'm excited,'' he said. ``I've been working
hard to put myself in a position to play that kind of match. It's a
big win. He's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory puts Gimelstob in today's semifinals, pitted against
the streaking Andre Agassi, who defeated Australian Sandon Stolle
earlier in the day. Agassi was the victim of Gimelstob's last L.A.
upset, a year ago in the same tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Which upset was the bigger thrill?
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat Andre tomorrow maybe,'' he said. Of Agassi, a
sometime-critic of Gimelstob, the former Bruin said, ``I know he
wants a piece of me.''
</P>
<P>
   No one had broken service until Gimelstob broke Rafter in the
10th game to win the first set, pumping both fists toward his
friends in the stands to accentuate the early lead.
</P>
<P>
   He broke Rafter again in the second set en route to a 4-1 lead.
Rafter eventually broke back to make it 4-3, but Gimelstob broke
back immediately, taking advantage of two double-faults by Rafter.
He closed out the match on his next service, though it took three
attempts at match point to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played very well,'' Rafter said. ``The conditions probably
weren't as quick as I have played the last couple times. It was
difficult to get much out of my serve tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   He bristled at suggestions he might be shocked at the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Gimelstob) played very well tonight. You guys are making it
out like I'm gonna go home and cry about it. It's just another
loss. Life goes on,'' Rafter said.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi struggled early in his 7-6 (7-2), 6-2 defeat of Stolle.
Why so much trouble against a clearly overmatched opponent? The
shadow knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the sun was going down, there's these trees up there
(casting shadows) that literally, every foot, (the ball) is going
in and out of the sun. You just can't see the ball at all at that
time of the day,'' Agassi said. ``When the sun went down and it
became even out there, there were no shadows and I could pick up
the ball and I started hitting a cleaner ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's other singles semifinal, unseeded Guillaume Raoux of
France will take on No.2 seed Tim Henman of England. Both men
advanced after grueling three-set matches Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Henman needed 2 hours and 12 minutes to defeat Zimbabwe's Byron
Black, a USC alumnus, 5-7, 6-1, 6-4. Raoux took 2 hours and 44
minutes to defeat Brentwood's Michael Joyce, 6-7 (7-9), 6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-hitting Joyce played most of the match beyond the
baseline, frustrating Raoux, who prefers a more up-tempo game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very difficult to play against here,'' Raoux said,
``because the balls are very soft and he's playing balls with no
power inside. So it's very tough to hit the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The slow-down was entirely intentional, Joyce said. ``Because
(Raoux) likes quick points and he likes to play fast. Most of the
French players tend to play like that. So I felt if I could make
him hit that extra ball, I'd have a good chance of winning.... He
was definitely frustrated. I had more than enough chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Just not enough for the victory.

Astros solve 
Cordova, top 
Pirates 7-4
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everett helps Hampton &QL; 
to first win since June
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PITTSBURGH _ The mere sight of Francisco Cordova usually makes the
Astros react like Superman to kryptonite.
</P>
<P>
   Leaping tall buildings in a single bound has seemed a more
realistic task against Cordova than pushing across the plate more
Astros than you could fit into a telephone booth.
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of mild-mannered Carl Everett, the Astros
underwent a transformation in a 7-4 victory over the Pittsburgh
Pirates on Friday night at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cordova was the Astros' worst nightmare last season, holding
them to just four hits in three starts covering 24 innings. Prior
to Friday, the Astros had scored only two earned runs in Cordova's
four career starts against them. Of the 11 players on the Astros'
roster who had faced Cordova, only three had a career batting
average above .200 against the crafty righthander.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl didn't know about our problems against Cordova, and I
didn't bother to tell him,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was 3-for-5 with two RBIs and a run, and all of his
damage was done against Cordova, who has as much trouble with
Everett as the rest of the Astros have against him. Everett is
hitting a whopping .875 (7-for-8) in his career against Cordova,
who allowed six runs in six innings Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl Everett was huge,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton was fairly large, too. The Astros lefty held the
Pirates to three runs in 6 innings and picked up his first victory
since June 15. Because Hampton's victories have been few and far
between, Dierker didn't want to take any chances. He let the
bullpen preserve Hampton's ninth victory but rubbed his starter the
wrong way in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker and Hampton calmly discussed the matter in the clubhouse
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't won in a while, and he wanted me to have a better
chance to get a win,'' Hampton said. ``I appreciate that, but I
just told him that the only way I'm going to be a better pitcher is
if he lets me stay out there. It's no big deal. I didn't want to
come out, but we cleared the air, and it's over with.''
</P>
<P>
   As is the Astros' drought against Cordova. They finally have a
victory against the 26-year-old righthander, who as a nemesis has
been one of their biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good win, because we don't hit Cordova well at
all,'' said Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell, who was 2-for-4 with
a home run and scored three times. ``We couldn't get anything going
against him last season. This time, we threw some different guys at
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Everett, who opened the scoring with an RBI single in the
second inning. The Astros' lead was short-lived because Pirates
first baseman Kevin Young led off the bottom of the inning with a
double, moved to third on a passed ball and scored on Manny
Martinez's grounder back to Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Only five batters from both teams reached base over the next
three innings as Hampton (9-5) and Cordova (9-9) hung zeros on the
scoreboard. Cordova finally blinked in the sixth inning, and the
Astros were all too eager to make him pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cordova) wasn't totally on top of his game,'' Dierker said.
``But there was still a point where our guys were walking back to
the dugout shaking their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell followed Derek Bell's leadoff walk with a single to
left, and both scored on Everett's opposite-field double. Everett
came home on a groundout by Tony Eusebio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys don't like to hit against sidearm pitchers, but it
doesn't bother me,'' said Everett, who raised his batting average
to .322. ``He throws the ball right into you. My approach was to go
up there swinging at the first strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros chased Cordova from the game with two more runs in
the seventh on a pair of RBI singles by Moises Alou and Eusebio,
whose hit came off relief pitcher Jeff McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton didn't stick around long after Cordova's exit. Young,
who was 3-for-3, led off the Pirates' half of the seventh with a
solo homer to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young is a good low-ball hitter, and he hit it in the right
spot,'' Hampton said. ``Other than that, I thought I had really
good stuff. I had better stuff than what the results showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Polcovich shot a two-out RBI single up the middle to pull
the Pirates within three runs. Dierker lifted Hampton after he
walked pinch hitter Lou Collier, and lefthanded reliever Mike
Magnante got the hook after Tony Womack _ the only hitter he faced
_ reached on an infield single. Jay Powell emerged from the bullpen
to record the final out of the inning _ a pop fly to right field by
NL batting leader Jason Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost thought Hamp was ready to come out of the game the
first time I went to the mound, but I decided to let him stay out
there,'' Dierker said. ``He wanted to stay in the game, but that
just tells you the kind of competitor he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates added another run in the eighth on an RBI single by
Martinez. Bagwell's 23rd home run _ a rocket shot into the
left-center-field seats off Mike Williams in the ninth _ restored
the Astros' three-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh brought the tying run to the plate against Doug Henry
in the bottom of the ninth, but the veteran righthander bore down
to record his second save. Henry struck out two of the five batters
he faced and got Young to hit a game-ending fly ball to center
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best I've felt all year,'' said Henry, who reached
95 mph on the radar gun. ``I didn't have my best control, but I
felt good physically.''

ANGELS LOSE; GM BAVASI FRUSTRATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ As an exasperated Angels general manager Bill Bavasi
explained to reporters why he was unable to make a deal for
pitching help Friday night in the press dining room, the crack of
the bat could be heard in the background.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sound of Nomar Garciaparra's three-run home run,
turning a 2-1 Boston Red Sox eighth-inning lead into 5-1, all but
ending a miserable night for Bavasi and the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Boston went on to win 7-2 behind Bret Saberhagen (11-5) and
before a sellout crowd of 43,390 at Edison Field. The only good
news for the Angels was that right fielder Garret Anderson extended
his club-record hitting streak to 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels bullpen, after blowing a strong performance by Chuck
Finley on Thursday, did the same for starter Omar Olivares on
Friday night. Olivares, who shut out the Red Sox for seven innings
on one hit, gave up the tying run in the eighth and left with two
Red Sox on the basepaths.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn broke the tie with an RBI single off Greg Cadaret, and
Garciaparra homered off Shigetoshi Hasegawa. In the ninth, Jason
Varitek homered off Rich DeLucia for two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi was spared the details of the bullpen's collapse, but it
certainly didn't appease him after a fruitless day on the phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got (Jim) Abbott (in 1995) we felt good about it, and
when we got (Ken) Hill (in '97) we felt good about it,'' Bavasi
said. ``Tonight, I don't feel so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a GM, you know there's a feeling in the clubhouse to get
something done. I know by not doing anything tonight I've created a
void, or disappointment to the ballclub. I hope is short-lived,
that in 24 hours they'll be over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi said he worked right to the deadline of 9 p.m. PDT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had a deal only five minutes before we came over
here,'' Bavasi said. ``We were going to send a package that we said
no way we would give up going in. And the other club said no. They
said it was too late to make such a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi said the club was not hindered by payroll, and that the
offers he made were more generous than when talks were initiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the morning we were stalled, so we took every club that had
an interest in our players and made one more offer,'' he said. ``We
went over the line. We drew our own line in the sand and went over
it.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen and Olivares engaged in a pitchers' duel not much
different than one night earlier when Chuck Finley and the Yankees'
Andy Pettitte battled through seven scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had only one hit through five innings, but it
resulted in a run. Troy Glaus, making his major league debut,
doubled to right field to drive in Cecil Fielder from third and
give the Angels a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen did not allow another hit until Darin Erstad and Jim
Edmonds singled in the sixth. But Saberhagen worked his way out of
that jam.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares was just as good if not better. He allowed a single to
Vaughn in the first inning, but did not allow another hit until the
eighth inning, when No. 9 hitter Mike Benjamin punched a soft liner
to right field for a one-out double. Donnie Sadler, running for
Scott Hatteberg (walk) at first, went to third on the play, then
scored to tie the game at 1 on Darren Lewis' groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus got his first major league start Friday with high
expectations. But Angels manager Terry Collins didn't want his
third baseman to feel overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him to go play,'' Collins said before the game.
``Just do what you've been doing. (begin ital)Please(end ital) do
what you've been doing. But I want him to know he doesn't have to
carry this team. He's a bright, young talent, obviously. He just
needs to go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first play in the field, Glaus ranged to his left to
field a grounder by Mike Stanley and threw him out. Then in his
first major league at-bat in the bottom of the second, he lined a
3-1 pitch from Saberhagen into the right-field corner for an RBI
double and a 1-0 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   The hit came one pitch after Saberhagen threw a fastball under
Glaus' chin.

can take a big sigh of relief because they're still here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't really focus on things that don't happen right now,''
Finley said. ``I'd welcome anyone to the club who would help make
us better. But right now, the only ones that can continue to do
that is us. We need to go out and get the job done.''

LILLIAN HOBAN, 73, CHILDREN'S BOOK WRITER AND ILLUSTRATOR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lillian Hoban, who illustrated or wrote more than 100
children's books, including those featuring a badger named Frances
and a chimpanzee named Arthur, died on July 17 at New York and
Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in
Manhattan and in Wilton, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said her principal publisher,
HarperCollins Children's Books.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoban's best-known works explored the trials and
tribulations of early childhood. She first established herself as
an illustrator in the 1960s, providing the drawings for the
``Frances'' series written by her husband, Russell Hoban, a
prolific author of children's books. She illustrated his ``Baby
Sister for Frances'' (1964) and drew the pictures for five more
books in that series about Frances and her family.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple divorced in 1975, she began writing and
illustrating an ``I Can Read Books'' series about Arthur and his
little sister, Violet. An 11th title, ``Arthur's Birthday Party,''
is due out early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Philadelphia, Lillian Aberman Hoban attended the
Philadelphia Museum School of Art, studied dance with Martha Graham
and taught modern dance in New York and Connecticut. She also
danced professionally on television during the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   She taught herself to draw still lifes, using crayons and
pastels, and started writing stories after she had her own
children, basing her tales on their everyday adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoban is survived by three daughters, Phoebe and Julia, both
of of Manhattan, and Esme, of Wilton; a son, Brom, of Austin,
Texas; a sister, Esther Man of Los Angeles, and six grandchildren.
</P>

I like drawing best,'' she once said. ``But probably what I like
better than anything is just messing around with color.''

GARCIAPARRA, RED SOX WALLOP ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-ANGELS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Gordon Edes 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With the Oakland undercard out of the way, the
Red Sox Friday night played the first of nine games against teams
that fancy themselves as American League wild-card contenders or
potential playoff rivals: three this weekend against the Angels, to
be followed by a pair in Seattle and four in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The early returns were not promising. The Red Sox, in Mike
Stanley's first game back in their midst, were limited to one hit
by Omar Olivares through seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   But then Nomar Garciaparra, whose throwing error had led to the
game's only run through seven, put the crowning blow on another
Boston comeback, his three-run eighth-inning home run propelling
the Red Sox to a 7-2 win before a sellout crowd of 43,390 at Edison
International Field.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's homer, which came after Mo Vaughn singled home
Mike Benjamin with the go-ahead run, was his fifth in six games and
ninth in 15 games. It helped make a winner of Bret Saberhagen
(11-5), who checked the Angels on five hits and an unearned run in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels threatened to climb back in the eighth against
lefthanded reliever David West, who gave up a run on a walk
sandwiched between two singles to the only three batters he faced.
But Dennis Eckersley, in one of the few meaningful relief
appearances of his farewell tour, retired Tim Salmon on a tapper to
the mound and struck out cleanup hitter Cecil Fielder before
turning the game over to Tom Gordon, who registered his 30th save.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jason Varitek, a late-inning replacement, hit a two-run
homer in the ninth to pad the lead. The Red Sox have hit at least
one homer in each of their last eight games, which coincides with
Garciaparra's installation in the cleanup spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' winning rally began with a one-out walk to Scott
Hatteberg, who was replaced by pinch runner Donnie Sadler. Benjamin
flared a double over the head of first baseman Fielder, Sadler
taking third, and Darren Lewis's grounder to the right side scored
Sadler with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   After Olivares walked John Val-entin, Angels manager Terry
Collins went to his bullpen. But Vaughn, serving as DH for the
first time this season, hit Greg Cadaret's pitch into right field
for a single, and Garciaparra, who grew up 20 minutes from here and
was playing before his personal fan club, took Shigetoshi Hasegawa
deep.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, which leads the AL West and could be a first-round
playoff opponent for Boston in October, had given the Sox fits all
season. The Angels held the Red Sox to a run in sweeping three
games here in April, then split a pair in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who has pitched at least seven innings in four of
his last five starts but came into Friday night's game with four
straight no-decisions, gave up two hits in both the sixth and
seventh but kept the Angels off the scoreboard both times.
</P>
<P>
   He did not walk a batter and has issued just two in his last 48
1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have scored at least five runs in the eight games
since Garciaparra became cleanup man.
</P>
<P>
   Through five innings, Saberhagen and Olivares were responsible
for matching one-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Garciaparra, who had made just two errors in his
last 37 games, bobbled Fielder's grounder to shortstop as he tried
to backhand the ball in the hole, then hurried his throw more than
necessary for the lumbering Fielder and bounced it past Stanley,
playing first base in place of the sore-legged Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's throw ended up in the Red Sox dugout, Fielder took
second on the play, and Big Daddy came around to score on a double
by Angels rookie Troy Glaus in his first big league at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, a UCLA All-American who needed just one year to make it
to the big leagues after being drafted No. 1 by the Angels in 1997,
leaped on a 3-and-1 fastball from Saberhagen and lined an
opposite-field double into the right-field corner past Darren
Bragg.

a 1.4 percent annual rate. Although that was well below the first
quarter's pace of 5.5 percent, it was considerably above the gain
of only 0.2 percent expected by analysts. Consumer spending rose at
a 5.8 percent annual rate. Industrial production stalled, though,

Washington ruled that the purchase of AmeriSource Health Corp. by
McKesson Corp. and the takeover of Bergen Brunswig Corp. by
Cardinal Health Inc. would violate federal antitrust laws. By Milt
Freudenheim.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-ECON (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ Last fall, as the Asian
financial crisis threatened to spread into emerging markets
elsewhere in the world, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
appeared to be taking swift, decisive action to distance Brazil

tough talk of last year has disappeared, and the promises of sharp
cutbacks have been only partially kept. By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>

   FRIEDMAN-COLUMN (Fazenda Rio Negro, Brazil) _ COMMENTARY:
SURFING THE WETLANDS. By Thomas L. Friedman. (Unlike the Amazon, de
Barros explained, the Pantanal is not threatened by poor residents
who want to destroy the habitat to relieve their poverty. Indeed,
the culture in the Pantanal is a rare example of man and nature
thriving in harmony _ through an economy of ranching, fishing and
now eco-tourism. The threat to this region comes from external
forces of globalization.)
</P>
<P>
   RICH-COLUMN (New York) _ COMMENTARY: SHALL WE DANCE? By Frank
Rich. (At Leonard Bernstein's memorial service in 1990, playwright
Arthur Laurents brought down the house when he said, ``There were
only two things Lenny was afraid of _ God and Jerry Robbins.''
Jerome Robbins, the choreographer who died this week at 79, was not
one of the most beloved figures in the theater.)

<P>
   Astros acquire Johnson for prospects
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PITTSBURGH _ The Astros pulled a major shocker late Friday night,
acquiring lefthanded pitcher Randy Johnson from the Seattle
Mariners for minor-league pitcher Freddy Garcia, minor-league
shortstop Carlos Guillen and a player to be named.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was completed just moments before the 11 p.m. CDT
no-waiver trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, we've identified our primary need to be a No. 1
starting pitcher,'' Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said.
``Well, we just got one of the most dominant ones in the game. This
is another big piece for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price was high, and it took another huge bite out of our
farm system. We may have compromised the future a little bit, but
this was a special opportunity, and we have a special club.
Opportunities like this don't come along very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Although their starters have the fifth-best ERA (3.90) in the
National League, the Astros' staff does not include the bona fide
ace most teams covet to start games 1, 4 and 7 of a championship
series.
</P>
<P>
   His 1998 numbers notwithstanding, the Big Unit is that type of
pitcher, possessing the ability to dominate the opposition on any
given night. Johnson, who was 9-10 with a 4.33 earned run average
with an American League-leading 213 strikeouts at the time of the
trade, has tossed shutouts in two of his last three outings. And in
the five seasons prior to this year, his overall record was an
astounding 75-20.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who won the AL Cy Young Award in 1995, is exactly the
type of pitcher the Astros believe they need to get past the likes
of San Diego and Atlanta in the postseason. It's safe to say
lefthanded hitters such as Ryan Klesko, Steve Finley, Wally Joyner
and even Tony Gwynn won't be looking forward to facing Johnson come
October. For that matter, no opposing hitter can be too happy about
this development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legitimizes us as a championship-caliber team,''
Hunsicker said. ``The fact he's lefthanded is even better, because
the Padres and the Braves have lineups that are extremely
lefthanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest coup for Hunsicker was pulling off the deal
without parting with outfielder Richard Hidalgo or righthanded
pitcher Scott Elarton, both of whom the Mariners had hoped to
acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is a power pitcher who probably won't reach the majors
until 2000. Guillen is an offensive-minded shortstop whose future
could be at third base, since the Mariners have arguably the best
shortstop in the game in Alex Rodriguez. Because Guillen has never
played on artificial turf, the Astros had his big-league arrival
slated for 2000, when the team is scheduled to move into the
Ballpark at Union Station. Garcia and Guillen are products of the
Astros' baseball academy in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good about being able to retain Elarton and Hidalgo,
even though we gave up players who could be impact players in the
future,'' Hunsicker said. ``This is a tribute to the depth in our
system and the job (special assistant to the GM) Andres Reiner does
for us in Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia recently was promoted to Class AAA New Orleans, where he
was 1-0 with a 3.14 ERA in two games. He was 6-7 with a 3.25 ERA in
19 games at Class AA Jackson. Guillen was hitting .295 with 12
homers and 51 RBIs at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's deal came with the blessing of Astros owner Drayton
McLane Jr., who had given Hunsicker the go-ahead to explore the
possibility of dealing for Johnson, who is owed approximately $2.04
million on his $6 million contract for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 34, can become a free agent at the end of the season,
meaning the Astros might have his services for only the final two
months of the regular season plus the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this were a case of renting a high-priced player for
the stretch run, Hunsicker said: ``I'm focused on 1998. I think the
message is clear that we're out to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mariners played at home Friday and the Astros play
an afternoon game in Pittsburgh today, it's highly unlikely Johnson
will join the team before Sunday. He last pitched Tuesday and had
been scheduled to start Sunday for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   It's also unclear whose spot Johnson will take in the Astros'
rotation, although that mystery would be solved if the player to be
named is currently in the starting rotation. If not, fifth starter
Pete Schourek likely would be the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   The underdog Astros put together a better package than
Cleveland, Los Angeles, San Diego and the New York Yankees, who
seemed close to striking a deal for Johnson earlier in the day.

   ``The price to try to improve at this time was just too high,''
said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, who did not want to
part with Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   But not too high for the Astros, who reeled in the biggest prize
on the market in an 11th-hour deal that could prove to be the
pivotal point of their season.

IN THE END, NO BIG DEAL FOR RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-TRADES-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Gordon Edes 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ While the Red Sox failed to land the starting
pitcher they had been seeking and watched the trade mart's top
prize, Randy Johnson, go to Houston at the witching hour, general
manager Dan Duquette made two more deals Friday night to strengthen
the club's bench and import another lefthander to audition in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette sent minor league pitcher Joe Hudson to the Milwaukee
Brewers for Eddy Diaz, an infielder with 16 games of big league
experience who gives the Sox some emergency backup behind Mike
Benjamin and Donnie Sadler at second base. Diaz was assigned to
Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a deal announced just after the midnight trading
deadline, Duquette traded three more minor leaguers to the
Minnesota Twins for lefthanded-hitting Orlando Merced and lefty
reliever Greg Swindell. Merced and Thursday's acquisition, Mike
Stanley, in essence give the Sox a new DH platoon to replace the
traded Jim Leyritz and injured Reggie Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps it was the trade he didn't make _ Mo Vaughn was
still in a Red Sox uniform after Friday night's 7-2 win over the
Anaheim Angels _ that will have the most lasting ramifications for
Duquette and the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In another 180-degree turn by the Red Sox first baseman, Vaughn
said he was relieved that he hadn't been traded and was encouraged
to hear that Sox CEO John Harrington had told the Globe's Will
McDonough, in a column published Saturday, that he still wants to
re-sign the All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad John Harrington did say that and was willing to put
it on the line like that,'' said Vaughn, who exactly one week
earlier had said he thought his days with the Red Sox were over and
accused the team of tailing him with private investigators and
suspecting him of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come down to it, I hope there will be no hard
feelings, no anything except an opportunity to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, asked if he had had any communications, either directly
or through back channels, that caused him to feel encouraged that
his contract situation would be resolved, said, ``By the
organization keeping me here is enough. Right now I don't know of
any discussions taking place, but keeping me here is enough for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he hopes he still can re-sign with the Red Sox. ``I
hope that does take place,'' he said. ``I've been here for a long
time. It's been a good time here. The people, the fans have been
good to me. I hope to check into the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he was encouraged by the acquisitions the Sox made
in the last 48 hours. ``We looked at the situation and were
prepared to do what we have to do with what we had,'' he said.
``But anything (Duquette) can do to help is good. We got some help.
We got some guys that can help. We're all glad in here.''
</P>
<P>
   Five starting pitchers changed teams Friday, with the biggest
prize, Johnson, going to the Astros, who did not become serious
contenders for his services until the beginning of this week. One
by one, their names popped up on the TV screens in the visitors'
clubhouse here, and one by one, their names, especially those of
the pitchers, were crossed off the Red Sox' list.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Todd Stottlemyre, to the Texas Rangers. Pitcher Juan
Guzman, to the Baltimore Orioles. Pitcher Carlos Perez, to the Los
Angeles Dodgers. Pitcher Willie Blair, to the New York Mets. And
finally, in a deal announced after the deadline, Johnson, to the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, the Red Sox announced they had acquired
Swindell, 33, and outfielder-first baseman Merced, 31, for three
minor leaguers, including another pair of pitchers, Matt Kinney and
Joe Thomas. The pitchers were both in Single A, while outfielder
John Barnes was at Double A Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Merced, playing almost exclusively against righthanders, was
batting .289 this season with 5 home runs in 204 at-bats. Merced
twice hit .300 for the Pirates but was a disappointment for Toronto
in '97 and wound up signing as a free agent with the Twins after
receiving some interest from the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Swindell, a former 18-game winner for the Indians, signed a fat
free agent contract with the Astros but wound up being released by
Houston in early June 1996. The Indians signed him 12 days later,
but he pitched poorly in Cleveland before winding up with the
Twins, with whom he had a 3-3 record and 3.58 ERA in 51 appearances
this season.
</P>
<P>
   To make room on the roster, Sox manager Jimy Williams informed
Billy Ashley in the eighth inning Friday night that he'd been
designated for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swindell gives us a lefty in the bullpen,'' said Williams, who
Friday night watched lefty David West give up two singles and a
walk to three batters. ``He throws strikes and has a good breaking
ball. And with Reggie out and Midre (Cummings) on the disabled
list, Merced gives us a lefthanded hitter off the bench.''

ASU FOOTBALL FACES GREAT EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You won't find it on the schedule, but it's there. A delicious
possibility already circled on the calendar of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   A home date in January. A bowl game in Tempe that will crown the
national champion. The night when Arizona State joins the
fraternity of contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, I'm aware that's how they're talking,'' Coach
Bruce Snyder said. ``Our team is talking about it. Other people are
talking about it . . . about ``us'' playing at home in that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder stopped for a moment and took a breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'm worried about it,'' he said. ``But I'm
sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   So it goes when you've finally arrived, when you've clawed for
recognition, traveled the long road to respect. When you lose 22 of
your first 39 games on campus, wake up and suddenly find yourself
mentioned with the handful of heavyweights dominating college
football.
</P>
<P>
   And you wonder: Are you really there? Or is your football team
simply overrated?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all of those feelings, depending on the time of day,''
Snyder said. ``At times, I think it's premature to rank us that
high. Then there are times when I say, `You know what? We really
know what we're doing.' I'm human like everyone else. You flow back
and forth, depending on your mood. But I'll tell you this _ I think
we're going to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, good is no longer good enough. As Snyder and his
staff emerge from their annual three-day retreat, complete with a
pep talk from ASU basketball Coach Rob Evans and conversation
limited only to football, they know the backdrop has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Sun Devils have won 24 of their past 29 games, a
stretch surpassed only by Nebraska, Tennessee, Florida and Florida
State. Now, Snyder walks into a high school and people recognize
his face. Now, kids are actually wearing ASU caps at his football
camp. Now, one preseason poll ranks the Sun Devils as high as No.
2, another at No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the pressure of expectations will weigh more heavily
than a difficult schedule, one that features an opening date with
Washington, a road game at Southern California, the Sun Devils'
first confrontation with Notre Dame and two road games to end the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, before the 11-0 season, I knew we'd be a good
team,'' Snyder said. ``I called Rick Pitino at Kentucky. They were
expected to win a national championship, and they did it. They
lived up to expectations. So I thought there was something I could
learn from him. We tried to get together three different times, but
it never happened. And we still went on to win 11 straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm aware that being an underdog is much different than
being favored.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his concerns, there is reason for giddiness. Snyder has
a Heisman Trophy candidate in running back J.R. Redmond. He has a
budding star in quarterback Ryan Kealy, if his legs hold up after
two surgeries in two years. He is up to his ears in skilled
receivers, and if one football is enough, the offense could average
35 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was hit hard by graduation, and no one knows who
will kick and who will punt. But with success comes depth, and this
is where the Sun Devils are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make a circle when I see a hole, and there are holes to
fill,'' Snyder said. ``But what I can do now that I wasn't able to
do the first three years is write a name in that circle. We can
fill most of the holes with quality players.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's one thing to be 90 seconds away from a national
championship no one expected. It's another to be tagged with such
weighty perceptions before the first scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But this is what you work for, and after six years, they are
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play Sun Devil football, it will all work out,'' Snyder
said. ``It just will. I can see exactly in my brain how things
should unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he pauses once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, obviously, we have to get it done.'' &QL;

WINNING WAYS EARN GORDON SOME BOOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ At most venues, Jeff Gordon fans, and there truly
are a lot of them, have to cover their ears and shield their eyes
during pre-race driver introductions.
</P>
<P>
   Not here. Not in Hoosierville, land of checkered flags and
countless Gordon wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon is introduced today in front of a Brickyard 400
crowd of more than 300,000 at mammoth Indianapolis Motor Speedway,
Gordon worshipers will far outnumber Gordon detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Because he spent part of his youth in nearby Pittsboro, Ind.,
where he attended high school after moving with his family from
Northern California when he was 13, Gordon's fans are legion in
America's heartland.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one NASCAR Winston Cup personality capable of
siphoning a raucous love-hate relationship from fans, it's Gordon,
stock-car racing's Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon bashers may not be here, but they are nearly everywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they're in the grandstands, where they proudly wear
T-shirts portraying messages such as ``Gordon Sucks'' and ``Anybody
But Gordon.''
</P>
<P>
   Or they're on the Internet, where they congregate at any of
about a dozen anti-Jeff Gordon Web sites, trading crude jokes about
NASCAR's star driver and referring to him as ``Gordo'' and ``Wonder
Twit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's crime?
</P>
<P>
   He wins too much, looks too handsome and is far too wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Gordon is the boy next door, a trait that
apparently disturbs much of stock-car racing's longtime brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior might send most victims straight to the
psychiatrist's couch.
</P>
<P>
   Not Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they dislike me because I'm taking wins from their
favorite driver,'' said Gordon, who will start on the inside of the
second row in today's Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway,
one row behind pole-sitter Ernie Irvan. ``I don't know. I just
really try and appreciate the fans I do have. I'd like to thank
them for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our sport, these things happen. You look back through the
years and when guys like Darrell Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt were
winning a lot, those guys got booed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's a good thing to have (because it means you're
winning). So I'm not ashamed of it or upset by it at all. I just
kind of wave, give a smile and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   There, more ammunition for the Jeff Gordon Haters of America.
The guy can't even strike back at his detractors with a venomous
bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The booing does affect you, but (Gordon) ignores it, and
honestly, I think it makes him hungrier,'' Rusty Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace may be right.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has become the winningest Winston Cup driver on the
circuit the past four seasons, accumulating 32 of his 34 career
victories and capturing two driving titles. And at age 26, he has
won about $18.6 million on the racetrack and earned millions more
off it endorsing such products as milk (``what else''?) and
toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Mix that together with a stunningly beautiful wife who tapes
Scripture verses to Gordon's steering wheel before each race, and a
personality that appears to have no bad habits, and what you have
is the perfect NASCAR poster boy.
</P>
<P>
   Or so you would think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't like his driving style,'' said NASCAR fan John
Allsopp, 20, of Danville, Ill., wearing a black souvenir shirt
splattered with Dale Earnhardt logos. ``I don't like how he whines.
It's like every race, he cries. I just don't like it when he goes
up against my boy (Earnhardt).''
</P>
<P>
   Angie Hogue, 29, of Greenwood, Ind., who was standing nearby,
just shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I like him is because he's good-looking,''
said Hogue, wearing a Gordon T-shirt. ``A lot of other people think
he's too perfect and everything, but that's exactly why I like
him.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR President Bill France Jr. recognizes there are fans on
both sides of the Gordon fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate (he hears a lot of boos) because he's a very
nice young man,'' France said. ``(But) America has a tough time
with guys coming in and knocking off their heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   But legendary driver/car owner Junior Johnson said Gordon is not
being subjected to the kind of constant ridicule past champions
have received.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had Bobby Allison, Darrell Waltrip and Cale Yarborough,
the fans booed them terribly,'' said Johnson, who following
retirement as a driver, became a team owner and won six
championships (three each with Waltrip and Yarborough). ``It got to
where you almost wanted to go home because you felt like you didn't
have a friend at the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Evernham, Gordon's crew chief and confidant, doesn't really
believe Gordon is hated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the sport,'' Evernham said. ``I don't think
people hate him, but they certainly don't like him winning all the
time. Gordon is just the guy who unifies all the other drivers'
fans, and they all boo him together because he's a consistent
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't his best friend, I'd boo him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Gordon has been hearing the jeers more than ever. He has
a series-high five wins this season, leads runner-up Mark Martin by
62 points in the driver's standings and has a remarkable nine
top-five finishes over his last 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   And he's returning to a racetrack in which he won four years ago
and finished fourth last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so funny and hard for me to look at this season as being
as good a season as its turning out to be because the first five or
six races, we (mostly) struggled,'' Gordon said. ``We ran awful at
Atlanta and at Las Vegas. We didn't really exactly know how the
season was going to turn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all of a sudden, May comes along and, man, we've been on a
tear. Everything is starting to click.'' &QL;

QUESTIONS AT LINEBACKER BEGIN WITH TILLMAN'S LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-LINEBACKERS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No Pat Tillman. A starter fighting for his eligibility.
Inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns about Arizona State's linebackers, Joe
Cesta isn't worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it may be the strength of the defense,'' the senior
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cesta is confident. Defensive coordinator Phil Snow admits the
scenario makes him ``kind of nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   A key piece of the puzzle, Larry Johnson, is trying to regain
his eligibility in summer school. What happens with Johnson will
dictate where and how often the other linebackers play.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Johnson back would be significant. The senior was a
valuable part of last season's defense, recording 39 total tackles
and eight for losses, as well as three sacks and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   With Tillman gone, the Sun Devils need the outside linebacker's
ability and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The other two spots likely will be won at Camp Tontozona. Cesta
improved over the course of the 1997 season and is a front-runner
to start in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Cesta said he focused on conditioning this summer and has
increased his speed and strength while decreasing his body fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better going into camp,'' he said. ``Last year, I
didn't know the defenses. Now I feel a lot more comfortable with
the position, the coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens with Johnson likely will determine Stephen Trejo's
fate. If Johnson returns, the sophomore will battle Cesta for the
middle spot. If he doesn't, Trejo could move outside.
</P>
<P>
   Trejo started five games last season and developed a reputation
as a solid hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The weak-side job also is up for grabs. Adam Archuleta, a former
walk-on from Chandler High School, has impressed the staff with his
determination and is an early favorite to start. The sophomore
apparently took good notes playing behind Tillman.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone could replace Tillman. Not only did he lead the
team in tackles, but he seemed to make everyone around him better.
</P>
<P>
   Snow hopes the leaders begin to reveal themselves at camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another concern is we just don't have the numbers at
linebacker,'' Snow said. ``We'll have to see how they develop at
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior Terrelle Smith will make a bid for one of the starting
jobs after playing at defensive end last season. Redshirt freshman
Eric Fields took advantage of Johnson's absence in the spring and
gained valuable first-team experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot to piece together,'' Snow said. ``Camp is
going to be important for this unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesta said, ``Other than full-game experience, (the linebackers)
have a lot going for them: good size, ability. We'll be fine.'' &QL;

   To Europe, where it is rumored that he is in line to become
Jacques Villeneuve's Formula One teammate at the newly formed
British American Racing team?
</P>
<P>
   Or nowhere?
</P>
<P>
   Vasser, who finished third in Friday's International Race of
Champions event at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, won the
Championship Auto Racing Teams driving title two years ago and was
third last season behind teammate and champion Alex Zanardi.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi is nearing a second straight crown this season, and
Vasser is in second place.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi's signing with the Williams F-1 team appears imminent,
but will Vasser follow him overseas?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, even Vasser doesn't have an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this talk has kind of blindsided me,'' Vasser said. ``I'm
32 years old, and I've never thought about Formula One before. But
I don't want to get to be 37 or 40 years old and have to say to
myself, `You never even thought about it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm inches away from a deal with (CART car owner) Chip
Ganassi, and I don't want to hold him up. Chip is kind of
frustrated with me, but I hope he can understand. I have to see if
there really is a viable option out there. No one has given me that
option, but if someone does, I'll give them a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be ambiguous. I just don't know if I have an
opportunity out there. But I owe it to myself to find out what the
bottom line is.''
</P>
<P>
   Motor mouths &QL; 
 &QL; 
Could a window of opportunity to somehow merge the warring Indy
Racing League and CART circuits be on the horizon?
</P>
<P>
   There is some talk that Oldsmobile officials are displeased its
IRL Aurora engine has been competing mostly against itself.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, Andrew Craig and Tony George. It's time to straighten
out this mess. Television ratings are awful and fans are
disenchanted.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Why not compromise and devise a one-engine formula? The
technology already is in place for CART engine manufacturers to
blueprint a normally aspirated motor.
</P>
<P>
   How about give and take, people?
</P>
<P>
   ``CART needs to be here, no doubt about it,'' said Mario
Andretti, who was at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Friday as a
guest of Texaco. ``You need to have the best available drivers
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like just having the (NASCAR) Busch Series here at
Indy and not the Winston Cup cars. There needs to be a
compromise.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pit stops &QL; 
 &QL; 
Last week's U.S. 500 was the best of times and also the worst of
times. It may be the best race I've ever seen. Twice while watching
it, I nearly cracked my skull on my living room wall. The tragedy
was the horrible accident that killed three spectators. Awful, just
awful.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion to CART officials regarding the Handford wing device,
the reason for last week's breathtaking racing: Do whatever it
takes to devise such a wing for the 1-mile ovals, then watch
disgruntled fans returning to the grandstands and to positions in
front of their television sets on Sunday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona drivers Charles Davis Jr., Bob Ream and Hank Winter
finished 1-2-3 last week in a Bandit Sprint Car series race at
Perris (Calif.) Auto Speedway. Valley racer Rob Davis finished
eighth. Good work, boys.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Darland of Kokomo, Ind., won Indiana Sprint Week, edging
runner-up Tony Elliott by a single point. J.J. Yeley, the only
Valley driver to crack the top 10, finished sixth.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Busch Series driver Jeff Purvis was fined $10,000 and
suspended until Sept. 8 after an altercation with driver Mark Green
last Saturday at South Boston (Va.) Speedway. &QL;

   &UR; FOR SUNDAY AMS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Aug. 2:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL: &LR;  (``i'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CASTRO-CARIBBEAN-TOUR (St. George's, Grenada) _ Underlining the
failure of U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba diplomatically, Fidel
Castro has embarked on a triumphant tour of the English-speaking
Caribbean, which is scheduled to bring him on Sunday to this tiny
island nation where U.S. troops expelled Cuban forces nearly 15
years ago. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-KOSOVO (Breznica, Yugoslavia) _ On a hardscrabble hilltop
farm with a collection of sod huts, wooden outhouses, fields of
corn and wheat and lines of newly dug trenches protected by sand
bags, there live some of the dwindling numbers of what the Serbs
proudly remind people are their ``loyal Albanians.'' The separatist
ethnic Albanian rebels, who have taken control of portions of
Kosovo province in Serbia and who have attacked this farm several
times recently, are known here as ``terrorists.'' The Serbian
police are ``comrades,'' and the crumbling old order is revered. By
Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-INTERNET (Toronto) _ While Canada's laws are clear on how
to deal with offensive written material, they are still untested on
communication that seeps across the border electronically.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ECON (Moscow) _ Late summer and early fall in Russia has
always been a time of fiscal pressure, as governments scramble for
money to help bring in the harvest and to get ready for the
deliveries of goods to Arctic regions. But the fiscal crisis brings
much added pressure this year. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-LAND-CONTROVERSY (Jerusalem) _ For decades, the Jewish
National Fund has been known for its tree-planting and land
reclamation projects in Israel. But the fund, whose land purchases
have created the core of modern Israel, has become embroiled in
controversy over its efforts to settle Jews in Arab neighborhoods
of East Jerusalem. By Joel Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   CAMBODIA-ELECTION (Phnom Penh, Cambodia) _ Battered by coups,
violence and voting day manipulation, Cambodian voters waiting to
learn the results of last Sunday's elections faced a new challenge:
mathematics. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   KENYA-WILDLIFE (Kitengela, Kenya) _ The clash between farmers
and lions in Kitengela reflects a growing conflict between people
and wild animals in this East African country that conservationists
say poses a serious threat to the survival of wildlife. By James C.
McKinley Jr.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-ELECTION (United Nations) _ It is election season at the
United Nations, and campaign finance reform provokes even less
enthusiasm than it has in the U.S. Congress. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   ANGLICAN-CONFERENCE (Canterbury, England) _ As the world's
Anglican bishops are gathered in this historic cathedral city for
their once-a-decade meeting, the Lambeth Conference, a major trend
can be discerned among the lists of those invited to attend. For
the first time since these conferences began 130 years ago, the
bishops who are heads of dioceses in the Church of England, the
Episcopal Church, and the Anglican Churches of Canada and Australia
_ which historically sent missionaries abroad _ are outnumbered by
their counterparts from the Anglican churches of Africa and Asia _
the continents to which so many of those missionaries were sent. By
Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-U.S. (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ With U.S. officials
warning that Indonesia is on the verge of economic and social
collapse, a Clinton administration delegation led by Defense
Secretary William Cohen called on Indonesia's new president and
military commanders to honor their pledge to end human rights
abuses and show restraint if government opponents take to the
streets again. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL: &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CONTROCEPTION-COVERAGE (Washington) _ Seizing upon the celebrity
of the male impotency pill Viagra, family planning groups are
pressing lawmakers in Congress and the states on a long-ignored
demand that employers cover the costs of contraception as a health
benefit. They are confronting lawmakers with the inequity they see
in some employers' covering Viagra while denying women help in
avoiding unwanted pregnancies. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   TEAMSTERS-ELECTION (Charlotte, N.C.) _ At first glance, Tom
Leedham's race for the teamsters' presidency appears pretty
far-fetched. So much seems stacked against him. He is not nearly as
well-known as James P. Hoffa, and his campaign apparatus and
treasury pale in comparison with Hoffa's. But Leedham's biggest
problem may be trying to cast himself as the candidate of the
so-called reform wing of the union. After all, Leedham was a
lieutenant of Ron Carey, the teamsters' disgraced, recently
expelled president. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   MAINE-HIGHTECH (Belfast, Maine) _ A decade or two ago, the
economy of this city of 6,500 residents was dominated by poultry
processing, one of the heavy, messy industries Maine has been known
for through much of the century. But now, Belfast is becoming the
poster town for the quick-spreading change. Belfast's rubber-boot
jobs are being replaced by telephone-headset jobs, of the sort that
have turned other states like Nebraska and Wyoming into headset hot
spots. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   NAVAJO-RUNNING-CLINICS (Shiprock, N.M.) _ Since before recorded
time, American Indians ran _ for trade, for communication and for
the spiritual belief that a runner creates a living cord between
the earth and the sky. But in recent decades, the American Indian
running tradition has faltered. Now, Becki Wells, 23, a Blackfoot
Indian who hopes to run the 1,500 meters in the 2000 Olympics,
believes she is a role model to Navajo girls who are flocking to
the 17 Wings running clinics on the Navajo reservation this summer.
By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-WIRETAP-ARRESTS (Los Angeles) _ The practice of
``hand-offs,'' where investigators who hear of drug activity while
listening to a wiretapped conversation pass that information to a
second set of officers who are expected to establish ``independent
probable cause'' for an arrest, has come to light in several recent
Los Angeles cases.
</P>
<P>
   LAWSCHOOL-ADMISSIONS-TWEAKING (Undated) _ It is a fine line that
college admissions officers tread when deciding how many candidates
to admit. The Northeastern University School of Law in Boston, for
example, found that it has done too good a job filling the 185
slots for the class of 2001, which enters next month. So the law
school has been trying, gently, to persuade some of them not to
enroll _ yet. By Nadine Brozan.
</P>
<P>
   MBA-GROWTH-SPURT (Undated) _ The 1990s were supposed to be lean
years for graduates of the nation's top business schools.
Overpriced, overabundant and caricatured in movies like ``Working
Girl,'' MBAs were destined for the same fate as junk bonds and
Manhattan real estate _ or so business school deans and business
journalists predicted at the start of the decade. Seven fat years
later, MBAs have never been more numerous _ or more in demand. By
Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON: &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY-IMMUNITY (Washington) _ The behind-the-scenes story of
the unlikely Starr-Lewinsky alliance, which was put together by a
cast of lawyers, some of whom have received no public attention. By
Don Van Natta Jr. and Jill Abramson.

<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. -- Tim Klosterman came into his own as a
teen-ager, starring on the football and swimming teams in high
school, partying and surfing with friends in his free time. And
then, at 19, he found God.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Garon was a stand-up comic with a girlfriend who tried to
fill that empty space inside by dabbling in different religions.
And then, at 37, he heard God's call to serve the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of priests -- survivors of a worldly life -- is
finding its way to a spiritual life at a time when the Roman
Catholic Church faces a shortage of young men willing to dedicate
their lives to serving God.
</P>
<P>
   Klosterman and Garon are among the men heading this fall to St.
John's Seminary in Camarillo, about 50 miles northwest of downtown
Los Angeles in neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the seminary drew on a steady stream of local
Catholic school graduates, youths who seemingly were born to the
calling.
</P>
<P>
   Today seminarians are more likely to have lived life as adults
in the secular world -- even built careers -- than to have known
since their childhood catechism class that they would become
priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized there was something more I could be contributing,''
said Garon, who is midway through his undergraduate work and has
six years to go before being considered for the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I was missing something. I was on the outside
looking in.''
</P>
<P>
   Built 60 years ago in the hills overlooking Camarillo, St.
John's Seminary prepares men for the priesthood in Los Angeles, now
the nation's largest diocese, and the surrounding Southwestern
states.
</P>
<P>
   The stately, old main building hardly hints at the contemporary
priests being formed at the school, which counts Cardinal Roger
Mahony as an alumnus. It has worked to keep pace with the diverse
community it serves, welcoming midlife students once dissuaded from
attending, writing technology grants for Internet access, and
tackling issues like celibacy with support classes for students.
</P>
<P>
   When the summer session comes to a close and regular classes
resume in fall, the halls will fill with more than 175 American and
foreign-born men. About half come from the Pacific Rim, and about
half are pursuing a religious vocation after years of secular
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the seminary reflects the multicultural life of a
global village,'' said Monsignor Jeremiah McCarthy, 51, a former
student who took over as rector of the theological school in 1994.
``We look to prepare them in a way that's integrated and holistic,
and a way that's collaborative.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a different era when the seminary opened in 1938 on 100
lush acres donated by Don Juan Camarillo. Boys knew at an early age
whether they would join the church and high school seminaries sent
a steady stream of graduates to St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sort of made up their minds younger in the
Depression,'' said Monsignor John Hughes, 74, the pastor at St.
Mary Magdalene's Church in Camarillo, who entered St. John's as a
teen-ager in 1942. ``You sort of grew up older.''
</P>
<P>
   When Our Lady Queen of the Angels Seminary High School in
Mission Hills -- the last of the area's junior seminaries -- closed
after the 1994 earthquake, the traditional system of priestly
formation came to a virtual standstill.
</P>
<P>
   National studies report that while one-third of young Catholics
express an interest in the religious life, just 6 percent actually
pursue a vocation. And even as the church struggles to close that
gap, it has had to deal with the repercussions of highly publicized
sex scandals that stigmatized the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is the situation has stabilized,'' said the Rev.
Timothy Reker, director of the U.S. bishop's office for vocations
and priestly formation. ``We hope to build on that slowly and
surely and increase the number of students.''
</P>
<P>
   Garon, a struggling Hollywood actor and comic, was raised as a
Catholic and tried on religions from Buddhism to Scientology but
had sidelined churchgoing for much of his adult life. Then a
reunion with more religiously observant relatives left him longing
for a spiritual livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   He started attending an area church, St. Peter Claver in
suburban Simi Valley, and was working as a salesman when he felt
the time had come to consider the priesthood. He entered St. John's
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He's heard the skepticism from those who wonder why he wants to
become a priest but also has seen the enthusiasm on the faces of
friends when he shares his belief in his faith.
</P>
<P>
   Garon knows it will be a difficult journey, but he has an
unyielding conviction it is a trip he must try to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take it one step at a time,'' Garon said. ``If I continue
to hear God calling me, I'm going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1960s, when the Second Vatican Council brought
fundamental changes to the way men prepare to become priests, St.
John's allowed no newspapers or off-campus excursions. Students,
typically straight out of high school, lived on a daily regimen of
prayer and study, without the professional internships and social
interaction of seminarians today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a monastery; we never left it,'' said Hughes, the
Camarillo monsignor. ``A lot of time was spent trying to develop
spirituality. We were sort of anxious to get out there and share
it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the guys -- as seminarians often call themselves --
are likely to have dinner off campus instead of at the
coffeehouse-like campus cafeteria, or to take summer jobs to repay
student loans for their $16,000-a-year tuition.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-Plus Program offers older students a special course of
academic study, and a field-education program sends seminarians
into community-service jobs for real-life work experience.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evenings during the school year, undergrads have been
known to break out their guitars for a jam session in one of the
dorms named after famous saints, belting out hits from the Eagles,
Jackson Browne and Jars of Clay.
</P>
<P>
   When Jane Klosterman thinks of her son among them, she is filled
with hope that her youngest child will find peace in the
priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I) just want what's best for him,'' said Klosterman, a former
religious-education teacher who was surprised by her son's career
choice. ``Every step of the way, he just needs to pray and follow
his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Klosterman family is the exception among a Catholic
Church population that recruiters say no longer encourages the
priesthood as it once did, requiring increasingly innovative ways
to nudge men to the calling.
</P>
<P>
   From elementary school vocation workshops to a new CD-ROM
describing the religious life, the archdiocese is seeking to reach
out to the one-third of Catholic youths who have considered
religious life.
</P>
<P>
   During his long talks with applicants over meals and formal
interviews when they come to the diocese, church officials try to
figure out if the man would make a good priest. It's a long
process, typically taking up to 200 candidates to find a class of
20 seminarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's more exciting, sometimes it's more
depressing,'' said the Rev. Dick Martini, the Los Angeles
Archdiocese's vocational director. ``This year, especially, I
actually thought I was going to get 35 men in the seminary.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the school enrolled just 17.
</P>
<P>
   For a school that includes top regional Catholic leaders among
its alumnus, including Mahony and Tod Brown, the newly appointed
bishop of the Orange County Diocese, today's students carry a
legacy and a reputation that expects them to become tomorrow's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tall order for men who, like those during Mahony's era in
the class of '62, are simply trying to fulfill their spiritual
calling, with no hint of where the church will send them or what
their lives will become.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way, even today, you could prepare a student for
what he would actually experience as a priest,'' said Joe George,
the pastor in nearby Thousand Oaks, who recalled that era when he
and Mahony were classmates at St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when both men had returned to the seminary for a
special event, Mahony agreed. ``He turned to me: Joe, could you
ever imagine anything like this?'' George recalled. ``We just
didn't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 20, Klosterman isn't sure what will become of his time at
St. John's _ whether he'll actually go on to become a priest or
choose another lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a retreat with young monks that the once painfully shy
boy _ who went on to become captain of his high school football and
swimming teams _ found solace in the religious way of life. He
realized it was his faith that had been the guiding factor through
his youth, and he wants to know if it will be his calling for the
rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   So on breaks from his summer job at a local swimming pool,
Klosterman has visited the campus, considering his vocation and
checking out the prime local surfing spots where he hopes to spend
his free time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel called to this,'' he said, ``and I know God will
help me.''

pressing lawmakers in Congress and the states on a long-ignored
demand that employers cover the costs of contraception as a health
benefit. They are confronting lawmakers with the inequity they see
in some employers' covering Viagra while denying women help in

   ANGLICAN-CONFERENCE (Canterbury, England) _ As the world's
Anglican bishops are gathered in this historic cathedral city for
their once-a-decade meeting, the Lambeth Conference, a major trend
can be discerned among the lists of those invited to attend. For
the first time since these conferences began 130 years ago, the
bishops who are heads of dioceses in the Church of England, the
Episcopal Church, and the Anglican Churches of Canada and Australia
_ which historically sent missionaries abroad _ are outnumbered by
their counterparts from the Anglican churches of Africa and Asia _
the continents to which so many of those missionaries were sent. By

<P>
   This spring the call went out to the creators of television
programs: The networks want something original, something fresh; no
more cop shows, lawyer shows, emergency-room shows and sitcoms
about the dating dilemmas of New York City 20-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the results look disappointing, according to one
top programmer, who in an unusually confessional interview assessed
the coming television season in blunt terms: ``The quality of the
new shows this year is absolutely horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   But how about original? Well, the new season features the
first-ever sitcom set in the Lincoln White House and featuring Mary
Todd Lincoln grabbing Abe's stovepipe hat, climbing on a table and
warbling, ``Happy Birthday, president,'' with Monroe-like (and I
don't mean James) fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer.'' If nothing
else, the comedy series, to be unleashed this fall by the
mini-network UPN, signals the desperate need for network television
to find something that breaks though the bland clutter that many
executives say is causing the ever-increasing erosion of their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   With its producers acknowledging that UPN executives asked them
to ``do something outrageous,'' ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' might be seen
as what happens a year after an outrageous, dirty-mouthed animated
show called ``South Park'' becomes a talked-about hit on a cable
channel seen in less than half as many homes as a broadcast
network.
</P>
<P>
   That open call for outrageousness led to such ideas as a
``karaoke sitcom,'' in which an audience member would be dropped
unrehearsed into the cast of a comedy each week, and ``Catch Me If
You Can,'' which was to feature a couple of contestants on the lam
around the country and hunted by professional trackers. Neither of
those shows made the fall schedules. That leaves ``The Secret Diary
of Desmond Pfeiffer'' to inject a hearty dose of the outrageous
into the new season.
</P>
<P>
   How outrageous is it? In the pilot episode Lincoln downs brandy
doctored with an aphrodisiac that leaves him so charged up that he
starts rhapsodizing about all those boys going to war with ``big
biceps'' and ``washboard stomachs,'' and winds up in a hug with his
black aide, declaring, ``It's not right for one man to own another
_ respect, care for, vacation together, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   That aide is Desmond Pfeiffer, a fictional member of the White
House kitchen staff, an unlucky emigre from England, where he was a
wealthy landowner. (Nobody's going for verisimilitude here.)
Desmond's last name, by the way, is pronounced with the P, as in
``Puh-feiffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is fictional: Gen. Ulysses S. Grant is around,
drinking in all of his scenes and forgetting which color uniform
his troops wear. And Mary Todd Lincoln is featured throughout.
First, she's upset because Abe has hired a new secretary, Mona,
with an especially low-cut bodice. (Abe does growl like a wolf at
the prospect of Mona taking dictation.) Mary calls Mona a foul name
through a pretend cough.
</P>
<P>
   Later Mrs. Lincoln laments that she and Abe haven't had much of
a love life since that war started and, from her bubble bath, she
makes a play for Desmond.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond puts her off at one point by sending her downstairs with
the message: ``Francis Scott Key left a bag of taffy for you in the
Green Room.'' So he would have been dead for 20 years at that point
in history, how's Mrs. L. supposed to know that?
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Abe gets enough of the love potion to the point that
Mrs. Lincoln exults to Desmond, ``The Old Rail Splitter is back!''
</P>
<P>
   According to Barry Fanaro, one of the show's creators, this is
not meant to be a conventional sitcom and certainly not a history
lesson. Instead, its goal is contemporary political satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not making as much fun of Lincoln as we are of
Clinton,'' Fanaro said. ``Lincoln is going through the same
scrutiny that a president goes through now. And we're able to make
fun of politics today. We'll also make references to other
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else comes close to ``Desmond Pfeiffer,'' despite the
crying need, as Peter Roth, the president of entertainment for the
Fox Network, put it, for programs that are ``different and
distinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   But is this the definition of ``different and distinctive''
programming that viewers really want?
</P>
<P>
   Chi McBride, who stars as Desmond, said: ``Everybody's not going
to like everything. I wouldn't have liked being in the pitch
meeting for `Hogan's Heroes.' `See, some Nazi concentration camp.
And it's funny!'''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: ``Hogan's Heroes'' ran for six years.

<P>
   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada _ Underlining the failure of U.S. efforts
to isolate Cuba diplomatically, Fidel Castro has embarked on a
triumphant tour of the English-speaking Caribbean, which is
scheduled to bring him on Sunday to this tiny island nation where
U.S. troops expelled Cuban forces nearly 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All visible traces of that conflict, the only time American and
Cuban forces have ever directly confronted each other, are gone
now. So too, at least in theory, is the Cold War, which for a few
days in October 1983 made this verdant country of barely 100,000
people a bloody battleground.
</P>
<P>
   But when Castro lands here at Point Salines airport, which was
partly built by Cuban workers and which for that reason was
condemned by the Reagan administration as a base for Castro-ite
subversion, an old struggle will be resuming on different terms.
Though no longer seeking to challenge the United States militarily,
Cuba is once again actively jockeying for influence in the region,
to the delight of ministates unhappy about Washington's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is part of a Cuban campaign to strengthen trade and
political ties with its smaller neighbors in the wake of the
collapse of the Soviet bloc. But the warming relations also reflect
English-speaking Caribbean leaders' growing impatience with what
they see as Washington's lack of interest in their development and
rigidity toward Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are implacably opposed to the economic blockade of Cuba,
which is morally wrong,'' Jamaica Prime Minister P.J. Patterson
said at a rally this week in Montego Bay at which Castro was
presented with the keys to the city. The blockade, Patterson said,
``constitutes a threat to the sovereignty of other states.'' He
also said he found it lamentable that ``shadows of Cold War
hostilities continue to haunt us in this hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Since early 1997, Prime Minister Keith Mitchell of Grenada and
leaders from Barbados, Dominica, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and
St. Vincent and the Grenadines have visited Havana. But the pace of
the regional renewal of relations has intensified since Pope John
Paul II visited Cuba in January and urged the world to ``open
itself'' to Cuba, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   At a summit meeting of the 16-member Caribbean Community, or
Caricom, in St. Lucia last month, leaders of English-speaking
island nations made it clear that they want to invite Cuba to join
their trade bloc, whether the United States likes it or not. In
June, Caribbean nations led a successful effort to give Cuba
observer status with the Lome Group, an international body whose
members, as former colonies, are granted preferential trade
treatment in European markets.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, U.S. officials seem largely indifferent to the
region's strengthened political ties with Cuba, contending that it
is a ``failed model'' no longer representing a security threat to
the Caribbean or the United States. But they also acknowledge that
there is little they can do to prevent the relationship from
deepening without damaging larger US. interests, notably securing
cooperation in the struggle against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   If only for their own protection, small Caribbean nations prefer
to engage Cuba rather than to ignore or isolate it. They see Cuba,
with its 11 million people, as a strong competitor for the tourist
dollar and _ looking ahead to a more open post-Castro era _ a
potential rival for foreign investment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about Cuba a lot,'' said Vishnu Ramlogan, director of
the Tourism and Industrial Development Company of Trinidad and
Tobago, an official agency. (Castro is not visiting Trinidad.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of Cuba makes them a strong competitive force
and an important player in the region, in both tourism and
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, Castro has sought to calm such concerns about
his intentions. In a speech in Jamaica, he said Cuba sought the
``strengthening of links'' and the ``sharing of experiences'' with
its Caribbean neighbors, in order to develop ``multi-destinational
aspects of our main tourist resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Castro's itinerary during a six-day swing appears
intended to maximize his opportunities to play the role of
avuncular and benevolent regional elder statesman. On his first
stop, Jamaica, he visited the tomb of a former prime minister,
Michael Manley, who pursued a policy of friendship toward Cuba in
the 1970s that alarmed and alienated the United States. He even
paid tribute to a Jamaican child who recently won a spelling bee in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Barbados, Castro took part Saturday in ceremonies marking
Emancipation Day, a holiday throughout the Caribbean that
commemorates Britain's abolition of slavery in the region in the
1830s. He also dedicated a memorial to the 73 people killed when
terrorists blew up a Cuban airliner shortly after it took off from
the Barbados airport in October 1976, a notorious episode
attributed to Cuban exile groups.
</P>
<P>
   During the two days he will spend in Grenada, his most
controversial stop, Castro will dedicate a plaque at Point Salines
airport, honoring the contribution of Cuban ``internationalists.''
He is also scheduled to meet the mother of Maurice Bishop, the
pro-Cuban former prime minister whose killing during an October
1983 coup attempt, led by dissident members of his own party,
sparked the American invasion of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Castro will travel to the Dominican Republic,
which resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba earlier this year
after 37 years, to take part in a regional conference. Capping a
year of unusual diplomatic activity, Castro is also to visit
Portugal and South Africa before the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much more than mere political symbolism involved in
Cuba's rapprochement with the English-speaking Caribbean. Despite
severe economic problems of its own, including fuel and power
shortages, drought and a lack of foreign exchange, Cuba has begun a
major effort to provide economic and other assistance to its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials say that more than 200 Cuban doctors, teachers,
sports coaches, engineers and other technicians are working in
Caribbean nations. In addition, about 250 students from Caribbean
countries have been granted full scholarships to study at Cuban
universities.
</P>
<P>
   In Grenada, Cuban engineers are helping design a new national
stadium, and some Grenadians have been flown to Cuba for medical
care. To help St. Kitts and Nevis recover from a hurricane, Cuba
sent farmers there seeds and tons of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban effort helps fill a large gap left by a diminished
American profile in the region. American aid to the Caribbean fell
nearly 90 percent between 1985 and 1995, from $226 million to $26
million, and the U.S. Agency for International Development has
closed its regional office in Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of needs and we have not been getting support,''
Mitchell, the prime minister of Grenada, said in an interview here
after returning from his visit to Cuba last year. ``Our traditional
friends have indicated that the days of grants, aid and soft loans
are gone. We cannot understand this. People know we are in trouble,
and we need help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has also stirred resentment among its
Caribbean allies by pressing the World Trade Organization to end an
arrangement that guaranteed Caribbean bananas preferential access
to European markets. As a result, the United States' political and
economic leverage throughout the region has weakened, and Cuba's is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young people are on my back,'' Mitchell explained. ``They
voted for me, and if it were not for them, I would not be in power
today. People want their lives improved, they want health care,
they want jobs, they want opportunity, and I can't deliver. But I
have to deliver for them and I am willing to accept help from
anyone, so long as it is done on our terms and does not interfere
with our independence and sovereignty.''

<P>
   A deranged man who believes that the CIA and other secret
government forces are conspiring to control his mind goes on a
rampage, and innocent people die.
</P>
<P>
   Lashing out in an explosion of paranoia, this figure has become
an American archetype. By the time a gunman barged into the Capitol
on July 24, killing two police officers and wounding a tourist, the
figure was so familiar that the suspect, Russell Weston Jr., might
have been wearing a sign around his neck: loner, with delusions of
government persecution. Diagnostic history: paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The usual discussions ensued about the clinical nature of
schizophrenia, which medical science has concluded is a biological
disease of the brain. But little attention was paid to the cultural
dimension of the ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries produce terrorists and murderous psychopaths,
but experts say the United States clearly leads the world in the
production of deranged people with paranoid delusions who commit
public acts of violence _ individuals like Timothy McVeigh, who
killed 168 people when he blew up a federal building in Oklahoma in
1995, and who believed that the military had secretly implanted a
computer chip in his buttocks.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many of these paranoid schizophrenics focus their
delusions on the same few suspects: the CIA, the president and
other federal agents?
</P>
<P>
   ``A strain of paranoia has always been just below the surface of
the American attitude toward the government,'' said Geoffrey Cocks,
a historian at Albion College.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shweder, a professor of human development at the
University of Chicago, said, ``Paranoids as a rule pay close
attention to what's going on.'' Considering some of the documented
abuses by the CIA, the FBI and other federal agencies, Shweder
said, a deranged mind could easily find evidence to spin delusional
theories.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much detailed research on why America produces
delusional people prone to violence, but some experts say the easy
availability of guns and explosives contributes to the phenomenon,
as does the weakening of traditional family and community safety
nets that used to keep many of the violent mentally ill in check.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the World Health Organization during the 1980s found
that paranoid schizophrenics in 10 countries shared ``persistent,
compelling delusional beliefs about themselves and the world in
which nothing is accidental and everything has special
significance,'' said Assen Jablensky, a professor of psychiatry at
the University of Western Australia who helped evaluate the
research.
</P>
<P>
   The study _ which focused on Japan, Denmark, Colombia, Nigeria,
India, the former Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Britain, Ireland
and the United States _ found that schizophrenics generally
responded better to treatment in less developed countries than in
more technologically developed ones.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that schizophrenics in Colombia, Nigeria
and India suffered less severe symptoms than those in Britain and
the United States, a difference attributed to cultural factors like
stronger extended families and greater financial pressure to hold a
job.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Westermeyer, a professor of psychiatry at the University
of Minnesota who has done extensive research on the mentally ill in
Southeast Asia, said that in less developed countries, ``People who
have paranoid delusions tend to focus them more on powerful
spiritual forces, like demons or gods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they feel their life is being taken out of their control
they might look to things like sorcery, ghosts or the animistic
forces in nature,'' he added, or to ``black magic'' directed at
them by relatives or neighbors with whom they are having a dispute.
</P>
<P>
   An obsession with ``sources of great power'' is a common thread
among all delusional paranoids, said Irving Gottesman, a professor
of psychology at the University of Virginia. In the United States,
paranoid delusions ``usually involved God or Jesus'' until well
into this century, Gottesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came radio, which carried messages from unseen voices from
far away, followed by television, which distilled broad national
experiences into intensely personal images. With the advent of
broadcast technology, Gottesman said, ``We went from Jesus to the
CIA without a break, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Westermeyer added: ``In the United States, you don't see nearly
as many mentally ill people anymore who have delusions and
hallucinations with regard to God and the saints as you did 20 or
30 years ago, when I was first doing this work. In our secular
society, it's more a matter of, well, `The president or the CIA is
affecting my behavior by radio waves or microwave receivers in my
teeth.'''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme cases like the shootings in the Capitol aside, the
source of most violence by paranoid schizophrenics is closer to
home, Westermeyer said. ``You actually get more of that kind of
violence on a pedestrian level _ people ascribing the evil in their
lives to a spouse, to parents, a boss or co-workers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Goldstein, an associate professor of psychology at
Stanford University, said: ``We all feel some paranoia or have what
could be classified as delusional thoughts occasionally. That
doesn't mean we're all suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who are, she said, it is logical, if not
reasonable, to fix on bogymen like the CIA: ``Somebody all-powerful
is out to get me? It must be the CIA. Why? It's all-powerful. It's
done all these bizarre things. And it's secretive.''

   WASHINGTON _ For years, the late Speaker Thomas O'Neill's famous
dictum that all politics is local has been gospel in this capital,
believed in the soul, repeated early and often. But Tip O'Neill
hadn't seen this year's fight over statistical sampling to augment
the 2000 Census and to account for those who are generally missed
by traditional head-counting methods.
</P>
<P>
   As if defying the laws of politics _ and some might even say
logic _ the pitched battle over what seems an arcane subject has
not been marked by the regional divisions that normally define
fights over how to count the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the current imbroglio has been a purely partisan
affair, so much so that some of the principals seem to be putting
party loyalty above the interests of their state or region.
Republicans are fighting _ and Democrats are staunchly supporting _
the Census Bureau's plans to use statistical sampling even though
there is evidence that the states that will be helped the most by
sampling will be the strongholds of their own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not understand the Republican opposition to sampling,''
said David Bositis, a senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies, who is studying the impact of the
use of sampling on the census. ``The states that would be hurt the
most are much more Democratic than the states that are
Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed methodology is straightforward. The Census Bureau
plans to count at least 90 percent of all households in every
census tract _ neighborhoods of roughly 1,700 dwellings. The
results of that large ``sample'' will be used to estimate the
number and characteristics of the people in the remaining 10
percent. To provide a quality check, statisticians will compare
their estimates with the result of a national survey of 750,000
households.
</P>
<P>
   But if the method seems clear-cut, the lineups for and against
sampling seem bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1990 census had been adjusted using sampling methods,
Georgia's population would have been boosted by about 300,000. Some
demographers feel the same result would probably happen in 2000.
Yet sampling is opposed by all the members of the state's
Republican delegation, including Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has
filed suit in federal court to have the Census Bureau's plans
declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study by the Congressional Research Service suggests that
if the Census Bureau does not use sampling in 2000, Mississippi
could lose a congressional seat. Yet the technique is vigorously
opposed by the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``No one
is served well by having some computer in Washington guess how many
people live in Buckatunna, Mississippi,'' Lott's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic proponents of sampling exhibit their own
incongruities. A study by the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies indicates that some of the states with the most to
lose from sampling are Ohio, Michigan, Massachusetts and Missouri.
But some of the staunchest proponents of the method are people like
Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House minority leader, and Rep.
Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that everybody on both sides of the aisle ought to
look closer at what sampling might do to their respective states,''
said Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a sampling opponent who was
the ranking Republican on the House committee that oversaw the 1990
census. ``Some people favor sampling. But if their numbers go up a
little bit because of sampling, and the numbers go up substantially
in other states, they may lose.''
</P>
<P>
   An explanation for the positions might be that politicians, like
generals, are fighting an old war. Like many issues where race is
involved _ and it is minorities who are disproportionately
undercounted _ the assumption is that it is a problem of blacks in
northern cities.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 1990 census showed that the undercount was becoming
more an issue for the Sun Belt, a sign of how the South and West
are being transformed by the influx of Latino immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real change from where the undercount was in 1990
from where it was in 1980,'' said Paula Duggan, a senior policy
analyst for the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a research center for
Northern lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But ignorance of the country's demographic shifts is not the
whole answer for the sharp partisanship that characterizes the
current debate over sampling.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1990 census many Sun Belt lawmakers, both Republicans
and Democrats, were well aware of how their states would be
short-changed in the allocation of federal funds. They pleaded with
the Bush administration to adjust the population count upward based
on numbers that had been derived through sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now argue that they merely want a more accurate
count when the data are used for disbursing federal funds. But,
they say, the use of sampling to apportion seats in the House and
draw congressional districts is illegal and could be manipulated
for partisan advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're allocating representation in Congress, where there are
always winners and losers, which is much more fundamental than
money,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who opposes sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the current political dynamic may be pushing both
parties toward positions on sampling that may be against their own
regional or state interests.
</P>
<P>
   Because such a large proportion of those who are missed by
traditional counting methods are minorities, some analysts say, the
Democratic Party, whose statewide and national candidates depend on
black and Hispanic voters, have little or no choice but to support
sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you imagine what would happen if the Democrats said we
don't care if there is a black undercount or a Hispanic
undercount?'' Bositis said.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Republicans holding a thin majority of 11 seats in
the House, there may be a palpable fear that anything, including
sampling, might cause them to lose power. After all, holding onto
the chairmanship of a congressional committee that decides which
federal programs are financed is probably more politically
compelling than getting a few million additional dollars through
funding formulas based on population counts.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In another era, the domino theory was used to
justify America's risking of lives in Southeast Asia and other
battlefields of the Cold War. Lose one country to communism, and
others would fall. Historians will long argue whether the theory
was right, or a politically convenient fiction. But few were
willing to gamble on finding out, until the threshold of national
pain became too great in the rice paddies of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   For a year now the domino theory has been making a comeback,
this time paired with the newest buzzword in foreign policy:
contagion. The general idea is the same _ if one country's economy
is permitted to implode, it could start an uncontrollable set of
events around the world _ even if it has less to do with guns and
communists than with currency reserves and the psychology of
panicked investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial domino theory has actually proven more accurate
than the national-security domino theory,'' Lawrence Summers, the
deputy secretary of the Treasury, mused in his office last week.
``Vietnam fell and other countries didn't. But you saw what
happened after Thailand,'' the ground zero of the Asian meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a significant shift in the way some in Washington
look at how the world is woven together. Before the Mexican peso
crisis in late 1994, only economists talked about ``financial
contagion.'' Now it is the throw-away phrase of dozens of daily
headlines. Like any fast-spreading disease, it now comes in many
varieties: There is market contagion, export contagion, yen
contagion, and now even reverse contagion, which is akin to giving
the flu to children and then catching it from them all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats who were comfortable with the old Cold War dominoes
now stuff their speeches with speculation about contagion's
political impact. Last week Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
cautioned that the political impact was just beginning to be felt.
``Misery,'' she warned in Australia, which is reeling from Asia's
troubles, ``can give rise to mistrust among nations.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Clinton administration, like the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations during Vietnam, is using the fear of falling
dominoes to get Congress to finance a policy of containment.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday President Clinton used the latest evidence of a
slowdown in the American economy _ 1.4 percent growth in the second
quarter, down from 5.5 percent _ to bolster his arguments that
Congress should pony up $18 billion more for the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF cites the anxieties about ``systemic contagion'' in the
world's major economies to explain why it has led rescue efforts
totaling roughly $150 billion in Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea
and the riskiest bailout of all, Russia. (And that excludes this
summer's coming attractions: Ukraine, Pakistan and perhaps
Malaysia.)
</P>
<P>
   But how many of the world's problems can contagion really
explain? Can a banking crisis in rich, mismanaged Japan really
explain the flight of investors from broke, mismanaged Russia? Why
should a stampede of investors out of a small nation like Thailand
cause absolutely nothing for two months and then lead to a stampede
in neighboring Indonesia and then faraway emerging markets from
South Africa to Brazil?
</P>
<P>
   And since it was not exactly a well-kept secret that Southeast
Asia is a hotbed of cronyism, corruption and weak banks, how could
some of the world's savviest investors suddenly conclude that this
a fatal flaw, one that sent them racing to pull out their money?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that sometimes the fall of the fiscal dominoes
makes perfect sense. Except when it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The most straightforward strain of economic contagion is as old
as international trade, and these days farmers in North Dakota and
miners in Australia can tell you all about it. Asia's slowdown has
cut deeply into its consumption of all kinds of commodities.
</P>
<P>
   It took a while to ripple through the world economy, but now it
has hit full force. American exports, which drove economic growth
for so long, have fallen off a cliff. Moreover, the resulting
commodities glut has depressed prices for everyone. And the price
declines have wreaked havoc elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's biggest problem is that it can't convince its people to
pay taxes, but its second-biggest problem is the decline in oil
prices that has cut into its most important source of hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other, more complex channels of contagion, like
the currency devaluations that have sent Asia reeling. More than
ever, countries compete with each other the same way companies do:
South Korea and Japan, for example, both produce computer chips and
cars. And when one country's currency falls, those products are
suddenly available in the United States and elsewhere at sale
prices. That tempts other countries to let the value of their
currencies fall.
</P>
<P>
   That can quickly turn into a vicious, competitive cycle, which
is one reason the United States is pleading with China and Russia
not to devalue their currencies. ``If China devalues, Southeast
Asia is back in the fire,'' says one senior IMF official. ``And if
Russia devalues, that's it for the Ukraine.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors, of course, don't stand around watching. They play a
critical role in fueling the fires, or tamping them out. And this
is where the markets and the politics get so intertwined that it is
impossible to tell where domestic economic policy stops and
diplomacy begins.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, for example, The New York Times reported that
American officials and outside experts now believe Japan's banks
may have upward of $1 trillion in bad debts. Traders began to sell
the yen, and kept selling after the new Japanese finance minister,
Kiichi Miyazawa, made comments about his economic plans that
sounded wobbly to investors around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Russian officials, fresh from their latest
IMF bailout, sounded marginally less serious about implementing the
reforms they promised in return for the world's money. Investors
hit the sell button.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This is where the market contagion kicks in. If Japan is getting
sicker, doesn't that mean its time to sell currencies elsewhere in
Asia, where everything depends on how fast Japan recovers? And
other investors, sitting in their offices in New York or at a home
computer in Berlin, may simply decide that they didn't know as much
about some of these countries as they thought they did.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than examine the differences between Thailand and
Indonesia they succumb to the natural reaction to pack up their
cash and get out of every emerging market. Technology has made that
cheaper and easier to do than ever, so infections spread faster
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon is not limited to new investors. ``We were
astounded to discover how little some very large investors knew
about Korea,'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said a few months
ago. Once burned, he noted, they looked for similar symptoms
elsewhere and found them all over the globe. That's when those
dominoes start falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to describe this is rational panic,'' said
Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist who has studied the causes of
contagion. ``Even if you think that conditions are fundamentally
sound in a country, if everyone else is headed out the door, it
makes sense for you to head out, too, because someone is going to
be left holding the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Sachs and others have been studying the question of how to
identify countries that could easily fall prey to contagion. He and
others are increasingly focused on the ratio of a country's
short-term debts to its foreign currency reserves. If the debt
soars out of line with the reserves, it can lead to panic. But the
IMF is hesitant to blow the whistle on countries that appear headed
for trouble, for fear of causing a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   So countries are looking for other solutions. Tung Chee-hwa, the
chief executive of the world's most free-market city, Hong Kong,
startled Clinton's delegation during its visit last month when he
talked about whether Asian countries should control the flow of
capital into and out of the region. No one in Asia talked that way
when $400 billion poured in between 1990 and 1996. But then it all
left at once.
</P>
<P>
   All that money is not going to flow back any time soon.
Investors hate uncertainty. Eventually, bargain hunters sense that
the bottom has been hit and money is once again trickling back into
Thailand and Korea. But as anyone who has played with dominoes
knows, knocking them over takes a lot less time than setting them
up.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., likened homosexuality to
kleptomania and alcoholism. But through a prism of pragmatic
politics, his comments seemed to make sense: The latest Gallup Poll
shows that 59 percent of Americans say that homosexual behavior is
morally wrong. In his own party, Lott played to a particularly
receptive audience, because Republicans are far less accepting of
homosexuality than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Given the pounding President Clinton took in 1993 when he tried
to overturn the ban on homosexuals in the military, he, too, seemed
to be asking for trouble recently when he issued an executive order
barring federal agencies from discriminating against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's move may have been shrewd as well: The most
pronounced shift in attitudes toward homosexuals in recent years
has been a steady increase in support for equal rights in
employment, housing and job protections. A survey by the
president's pollsters, released last week by the Human Rights
Campaign, a gay group, showed that 70 percent of Americans support
Clinton's order.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion about homosexuals is so fluid, and often so
seemingly contradictory, that it can be treacherous for any
politician to take a stand on anything related to homosexuality.
For years Democrats and Republicans have been skittish about the
issue, and not only because many people are uncomfortable about
delving into private lives. Attitudes toward homosexuality are so
complex that they cannot easily be transformed into yes or no party
platforms.
</P>
<P>
   The subject has been so verboten that it was considered a
triumph for homosexual organizations when, early in Clinton's first
term, the White House released a photograph of the president
meeting with leaders of the groups.
</P>
<P>
   But now, homosexuality has sprung to the lead of political
dialogue on more fronts than ever. Last week, the House approved a
measure that would deny federal housing money to San Francisco
because of its support of homosexual partners; a measure, also
passed, would take $21 million from housing programs for people
with AIDS and give it to veterans. The House will also consider a
measure that would deny federal money to carry out Clinton's order
regarding gay federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans have succeeded in blocking his nomination of a
wealthy gay contributor, James Hormel, as ambassador to Luxembourg.
The debate intensified when conservative groups began running
full-page newspaper advertisements featuring ``reformed''
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexual groups responded with their own advertisements,
including one that featured smiling Republican parents and their
lesbian daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, too, are becoming more visible on gay issues. Clinton
was the guest of honor at a fund-raising event Saturday in East
Hampton, N.Y., sponsored by gay Democrats. Vice President Al Gore
and Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the Democratic leader, are
increasingly willing to back gay issues. Gore will be the featured
speaker in September at the annual dinner of the Human Rights
Campaign. And five openly gay Democrats are running for Congress
this year, a record number.
</P>
<P>
   For both parties, the debate is intended to bring out voters on
the fringes next November. Surveys show that the most conservative
Republicans are particularly uncomfortable with homosexuality, just
as the most liberal Democrats are most likely to embrace gay
rights. But a deeper explanation is that with the increasing
aggressiveness of the gay political movement and the greater
visibility of gays in pop culture, there is an assumption that
tolerance is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about these issues as Americans as we never
have before,'' said Richard Socarides, a senior White House adviser
who is the principal liaison on gay issues. ``I'm sure that the
changes in public opinion are quite frightening to conservatives _
but they're irreversible.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be wishful thinking. While attitudes seem, slowly, to
be drifting toward acceptance, the conundrum is that most people
still do not approve of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contradiction is that Americans are strongly in favor of
equal opportunities _ even for a situation they don't necessarily
approve of,'' said Frank Newport, the editor of the Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the proportion of Americans who think homosexuals
should be hired as elementary school teachers has steadily
increased, to 55 percent in 1996 from 27 percent in 1977, according
to the Gallup Poll. But there is still a sizable proportion who do
not want homosexuals teaching elementary students. And in the view
of many Americans, homosexual behavior is now more acceptable than
adultery. But people still lump the two in the same category.
</P>
<P>
   Survey after survey shows a generational divide. Seven out of 10
people who are 65 and older say homosexual behavior is wrong,
according to the Gallup Poll; only five out of 10 who are between
18 and 29 have that view. While a recent Gallup Poll found that
more people think homosexuality is a product of environment and
upbringing rather than a biological trait, more and more Americans
think homosexuality is not a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Because attitudes toward homosexuals are evolving, politicians
can draw the wrong conclusions from poll findings that seem to back
their views. The proliferation of AIDS made the public less
sympathetic toward homosexuals in the 1980s, but by the time of
Clinton's election in 1992, tolerance had increased immensely. But
Clinton may have mistakenly concluded that an increase in support
for gay rights meant that people would support homosexuals in the
military. They did not.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was more mindful of the polls in his re-election
campaign, when he signed a bill that opposed gay marriages. The
move enraged homosexual organizations but was intended to help him
rebuild good will with conservative Democrats. Politically, it was
a no-lose position because even most Democrats who believe
homosexual behavior is morally acceptable do not believe that
homosexuals should be allowed to marry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are now finding that despite public discomfort with
homosexuality, sharp oratory may not be welcome either. Some are
now distancing themselves from Lott's comments, fearing they could
make the party appear intolerant and carry a political toll in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it helps to have public leaders engaged in that
kind of dialogue,'' Speaker Newt Gingrich said. Gary Bauer, a
prominent conservative who heads the Family Research Council, said
he wished the debate would focus on policy matters like gay
adoptions (which polls show most Americans do not favor) _ not on
whether homosexuality is a sin. But he also said, ``On the sin
issue, I don't want to undercut Trent in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said he did not share the view
of some Republicans that criticism of homosexuals by people like
Bauer made his party appear insensitive. He said he worried more
about Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who as part of his aggressive
courtship of gay voters has condemned many of his fellow
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone like D'Amato saying we're intolerant hurts us far more
than anything Gary Bauer says,'' Goeas said, ``because it plays
into the label of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   That Republicans are even debating how not to appear intolerant
is perhaps the best evidence of how the perception of public
attitudes toward homosexuals has evolved.

<P>
   Centuries ago, when laying siege to Moscow was a coming-of-age
rite for aspiring young plunderers and sackers, a tradition
developed in which invading chieftains camped southwest of town, on
a big hill by the Moscow River, and awaited word of surrender.
Legend says Napoleon slept there, in 1812, at the climax of one of
history's most infamous military campaigns. This was no ordinary
hill.
</P>
<P>
   It no longer exists. A few years ago, the Russians bulldozed it
tabletop-flat to build an outsized monument to their victory in the
Great Patriotic War, otherwise known as World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Russians take World War II seriously. This is not to say that
Americans do not. Perhaps to its credit, America has been bowled
over, emotionally and viscerally, by ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the
new Steven Spielberg film that is being hailed as a corrective to
Hollywood's glorification, even trivialization, of combat.
Moviegoers are yanked out of their romantic reveries about war by a
display of gore that makes Sam Peckinpah look like Mr. Rogers. They
may never look at a war movie the same way again.
</P>
<P>
   To which Russians might say, ``What took you so long?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If on your territory there was a war every 10 years, and half
the country was destroyed and every family lost someone _ well,
what attitude would you have toward war?'' asks Pavel Chukhrai.
``For us, war was never a stroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Chukhrai, a Spielberg fan, has more standing to speak about war
films than most. He is one of Russia's most successful modern
directors. His most recent film, ``Vor'' (``A Thief''), was
nominated for an Academy Award and won a sheaf of foreign prizes.
It is the story of a family taken in during World War II by a con
man in a military uniform; it is also a parable about the rule of
Stalin and Russia's tragic search for a strongman.
</P>
<P>
   Chukrai's 77-year-old father, Grigory Chukhrai, is the director
of one of Russia's most acclaimed and controversial World War II
films, ``Ballad of a Soldier.'' It is the 1959 story of a war hero
who is rewarded with home leave, falls in love, tends to his mother
and eventually returns to the front to die in battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian films always had big crowds of soldiers, battle scenes
and people giving their lives for the motherland,'' he said in an
interview last week. ``I decided to make a film about what happens
when the world loses a single nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   These are pacifist themes, yet as the invasion of Afghanistan
and the conflict in the breakaway republic of Chechnya demonstrate,
all Russians are not pacifists.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the military disasters in both places go a
long way to explain the strain of cynicism that runs through
Russian attitudes toward the military today, which both Chukhrais
acknowledge. Among the young in particular, war and military
service, at a time when the government is hard-pressed to pay its
soldiers, have lost much of their appeal, as they did in the United
States after the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``For generations after me, the Great Patriotic War is very far
away,'' said the younger Chukhrai, who was born in 1946. ``The
attitude isn't so emotional. I can have an attitude toward Napoleon
and the War of 1812, but it isn't emotional. It's the same with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Russian emotional involvement with the Great Patriotic
War is not so easily dismissed. May 9, victory day, remains the
greatest of Russian holidays. There is a group of young Russians
who volunteer time and effort to search for the unrecovered bones
of lost Soviet soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are a little rankled that Americans seem to know so
little of the winter siege that preoccupied Hitler's army while the
West marshaled its strength for the campaign in Western Europe that
inspired countless miles of Hollywood celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   Russian army casualties, conservatively estimated at 29 million,
represented more than three-quarters of all Allied casualties in
the war, according to the historian Orlando Figes _ and that's not
counting Russian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   As the two Chukhrais make clear, World War II for the Russian
people was never a struggle for Stalin or communism; rather, it was
a struggle against German invaders. In America, a nation which has
not been invaded since 1812, it is a distinction that is easily
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were not defending communism,'' the younger Chukhrai
said. ``They were defending their national identity, their loved
ones. It is not for nothing that people who fought there believe to
the end of their days _ 40, 50 years later _ that this was the high
point of their lives.''

   BREZNICA, Yugoslavia _ On a hardscrabble hilltop farm with a
collection of sod huts, wooden outhouses, fields of corn and wheat
and lines of newly dug trenches protected by sand bags, there live
some of the dwindling numbers of what the Serbs proudly remind
people are their ``loyal Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president and Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic is
still master over these few acres in Kosovo. A photo of his face
hangs on the wall of the central four-room house.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist ethnic Albanian rebels, who have taken control of
portions of Kosovo province in Serbia and who have attacked this
farm several times recently, are known here as ``terrorists.'' The
Serbian police are ``comrades,'' and the crumbling old order is
revered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Albanian,'' Sali Krasniqi, 62, said, his voice quivering
with nervous tension as he darted along the top of his earthworks.
``But I respect all people. Everyone is against me because I defend
freedom. I did not sell my soul to hate Serbs and build a greater
Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi, whose family sheltered Serbs from local fascist
militias raised by the occupying Italians during World War II, went
on to become a fervent supporter of Tito's communist state of
Yugoslavia. His neighbors say he worked as a police informer, which
he denies.
</P>
<P>
   In this Serbian province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian,
the support for the rebels has grown since a Serbian crackdown
began in March. Very few Albanians here remain loyal to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Because Krasniqi's family decided not to back the separatist
movement, they have been threatened, ostracized, beaten and then
attacked by rebel patrols. He and his five sons, armed with a
collection of shotguns and old carbines, stand guard all night
around the family compound. They rarely go into town and when they
do, they travel in an armed group. The family is a sad reminder
that Kosovo has been divided into two bitter, irreconcilable camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a traitor and has always been a traitor,'' said Jetish
Shala, 56, another ethnic Albanian, who stood near his cornfield a
few hundred yards away. ``No one in the village speaks with him. We
treat him as if he does not exist. He is the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic used the discrimination by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
against the Serb minority a decade ago as kindling to build the
virulent nationalist movement that brought him to power. He became
the Serbian leader, then president of Yugoslavia, of which Serbia
and Montenegro are the two remaining republics.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run news organizations, often apparently fabricating
accounts of rape and murder to inflame Serbian passions, turned to
men like Krasniqi to repeat the official line.
</P>
<P>
   Many times over the years, he has denounced separatists on
Belgrade television and allowed two of his daughters to marry
Serbs, an act that alone would have caused him to be shunned by the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation has taken many forms, he said, standing in his yard
with a pistol in a brown leather case on his belt. A decade ago, he
said, ``I had a job in a brick factory. My hands were badly
injured. I went to a hospital in Belgrade and was promised a
pension. The local Albanian authorities, however, destroyed my
documents. I never got my pension.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that the drinking water on the farm was contaminated
when a dead cat was tossed into the well. The family cow and dog
were shot and killed. None of his 11 children were able to finish
school, he said, because of the hostility of their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   His four school-age grandchildren, both girls and boys, have
been beaten, taunted as being ``Milosevic's children'' and
repeatedly thrown by classmates into the creek at the bottom of the
hill until they no longer dared to go to class at the local primary
school.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, a local ballad singer, Halit Gashi, wrote
the ``Song of the Traitors,'' played on the traditional quiftelija,
a bench-shaped two string instrument, that ridiculed by name those
ethnic Albanians who backed the Serbian government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not Albanian,'' the refrain goes about Krasniqi, who
played a cassette of the song. ``He is not even human. He was
bought with Serbian money and Serbian women. The traitor Krasniqi
is paid to steal our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The children, who are sent each night to the dirt-floored cellar
to sleep, are dressed in rags and barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   There is little food in the house. Krasniqi's wife, Habibe, 55,
apologized because there was not enough sugar to mix in the cups of
thick Turkish coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 8-year-old daughter, Elvedina, walked into town to buy a
kilo of sugar and the other children threw her in the creek,'' said
Naim Krasniqi, 32, one of the Krasniqi sons, who has three young
children. ``They dumped the bag of sugar in the water. She came
home in tears and said she was never going to town again.''
</P>
<P>
   The father and five sons, the only loyalists here, are now
largely cut off from the Serbs and are gearing for further attacks.
The Serbian police, fearing ambushes, have not driven into the
village of 260 homes for weeks. Krasniqi and his relatives worry
that if the rebels get past the trenches and sandbags, the family
will join the list of some three dozen ethnic Albanians executed by
the rebels this year for collaboration with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   As the men got out the weapons for the night, Krasniqi pointed
out the white stucco houses dotting the dun-colored fields and
grassy meadows that belonged to Serbian families when he was a
child, but that are now all in the hands of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbian families were slowly driven out,'' he said. ``The
terrorists tell my neighbors we will all be killed, that my head
will be delivered to the local rebel commander, but we have fought
them off so far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was out collecting wood the other afternoon and she
saw two of them in the woods,'' he continued. ``She dropped the
wood and ran. They began to shoot. We shot back for an hour. I saw
one fall. My sons wanted to go capture him but I did not let them.
The terrorists took his body away.''
</P>
<P>
   Aferdita Krasniqi, the 20-year-old wife of Bekim Krasniqi, 20,
another one of the sons, suffered a miscarriage during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is trying to recover,'' her husband said. ``We don't have
money to put her in a hospital. Besides, it's not safe to leave the
farm.''

<P>
   The 54-day General Motors strike erupted over local issues, like
the automaker's push to speed up work at a plant in Flint, Mich.,
but the strike shared a theme with walkouts as far away as Denmark
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying these strikes and others is labor's push to resist
what many economists say is an irresistible force: globalization,
which opens markets to fierce competition. Globalization has pushed
GM and other companies to reduce costs, and has created downward
pressures on wages in wealthy countries. It has pushed companies to
downsize, transfer jobs overseas and press their workers to produce
more.
</P>
<P>
   It was GM's effort to take many of these steps _ to speed up
production and to transfer work to low-wage Mexican factories _
that precipitated the strike, which was settled last Tuesday after
paralyzing production and idling 190,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders say they are trying to slow _ and possibly even
tame _ globalization, to make it less hostile to workers, and
limit, for example, the exportation of jobs. But many economists
say unions can neither slow nor stop globalization, a trend in
which the economies of the world are growing ever closer and
competition keener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're fighting history,'' said Clyde Prestowitz,
president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based
research group. ``It's partly a doomed effort to preserve an old
way of life that's not preservable.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the GM strike and other anti-globalization actions may
backfire by provoking companies to accelerate plans to export jobs
so they can minimize their dealings with truculent unions.
</P>
<P>
   The GM strike can backfire in other ways. With the dealers
complaining that their lots are depleted, sales of GM cars are
expected to fall, and the consequent loss in market share will
pressure the automaker to close more plants and lay off more
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts predict that GM, frustrated by the
union's resistance to cost-cutting measures at individual plants,
will simply close several plants altogether to slash costs.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said unions were often short-sighted in fighting efforts,
like GM's, to cut costs in the face of global competition.
``General Motors management has to do what it's doing, as painful
as it is, and bite the bullet now,'' Josten said. ``If they don't
do that now, GM's market share will diminish. It will become
increasingly less competitive and ultimately there will be fewer GM
employees due to layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor unions are stepping up their battle against
globalization. In California, the nation's largest apparel union
has protested Guess' decision to move jeans production to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, workers staged a rash of strikes, angry that
foreign pressure to open markets and to stop subsidizing industry
is undermining their job security. In Denmark two months ago,
500,000 workers struck after employers resisted demands for six
weeks of vacation, saying they could not afford it because of
foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders acknowledge it is impossible to halt
globalization, saying their goal is to transform it into a less
harmful force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade unions are trying to shape history, not reverse it,''
said David Smith, director of public policy for the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to put the globalization genie back in the
battle,'' Smith said. ``Whether it's workers in Flint or workers in
Seoul, people are wrestling with the question of, `How are we in
this moment of epochal change going to make this work for working
people?'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The unions argue that corporations gain too many of the benefits
of untamed globalization, fattening profits while squeezing wages
and encouraging downsizing. And they say they are fighting for all
workers, not just for union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``History will show you that wherever there have been strong
trade unions, there has been a fairer distribution of the wealth
created,'' said Bill Jordan, general secretary of the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions, a coalition of unions from 141
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists say globalization is boosting not just
corporations but the world at large by helping hold down prices, by
pressuring industry to increase efficiency and by making more
inexpensive products available to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And, economists point out, globalization sometimes helps push
wages up, not down. Boeing and Microsoft, for example, can pay high
salaries partly because of the immense foreign demand for their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, concerned that globalization could prove the great
downward leveler of wages, union leaders often state that their
goal is ``upward leveling'' _ to improve wages and working
conditions abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, when American unions pressured Congress to shelve
legislation to extend free trade to other nations, labor was often
branded as protectionist.
</P>
<P>
   But unions defended themselves, saying they would go along with
the legislation as long as new trade agreements guaranteed labor
and environmental rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you raise labor standards in low-wage countries, that's
good for them and it's good for us,'' said Frank Borgers, a
professor of labor relations at the University of Massachusetts.
``It would slow the exodus of jobs.''

<P>
   KITENGELA, Kenya _ On a clear day, Agnes Patita can see the
tourists in vans inching along dirt roads, searching the plains for
antelope, zebra, giraffe and, if they are lucky, an elusive pride
of lions.
</P>
<P>
   But the majestic cats the tourists pay to see are dangerous
pests to Mrs. Patita. Lions have killed more than 20 cattle here in
the last two months. On a recent night, two lions broke into the
Patitas' corral and killed 10 goats and sheep.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is they kill the livestock we depend on for school
fees, for food, for everything,'' Mrs. Patita said. ``The tourists
don't understand. They travel in cars. They don't live the way we
live.''
</P>
<P>
   The clash between farmers and lions in Kitengela reflects a
growing conflict between people and wild animals in this East
African country that conservationists say poses a serious threat to
the survival of wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, aerial surveys show, Kenya's wildlife
has been disappearing steadily as the country's human population
expands and farmers encroach on lands that were once wild. At the
same time, small-scale poaching for meat by Kenya's impoverished
rural people has also increased, conservationists say.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kenya sets aside 8 percent of its land for national
parks, the protected areas are not large enough to accommodate the
animals' migration.
</P>
<P>
   At any given time, most of the animals are not within the parks,
and so they trespass on increasingly crowded farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, when hunting was made illegal here, at least 40
percent of the range animals have disappeared from Kenya's
savannahs _ a drop of at least 412,000 animals _ and they are
continuing to disappear at a rate of 2 percent to 3 percent a year,
according to an analysis of government surveys.
</P>
<P>
   For some species _ the Thomson's gazelle, the waterbuck, the
greater kudu, the oryx and the elephant _ the declines have been
steeper, far above 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's creeping ecological debacle has set off a strenuous
debate among ranchers, scientists, conservationists and small
farmers over how to reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   One camp, led by the current director of the Kenya Wildlife
Service, David Western, wants to find ways to make wildlife
profitable for local people and give them a reason to protect the
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Another, led by the former head of the wildlife service, Richard
Leakey, argues that Kenya should instead fence off wild lands, more
strictly enforce anti-poaching laws and, in essence, give up on
trying to stop the decline of wildlife elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers, meanwhile, argue that they have the right to use the
wildlife on their lands, so they will have a financial interest in
maintaining them. Under current Kenyan law, the state owns all
wildlife, and it is illegal to sell or hunt them without a permit.
Giving landowners custody would open the door to profitable
ventures like sport hunting and exporting animals to zoos and game
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   For Kenya the stakes in the debate are extremely high. The
country's beauty and picturesque wildlife are among its few natural
resources. Along with beaches and coral reefs on the coast, the
African wildlife attracts tourists who spend about $400 million a
year, the largest single earner of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those earnings never find their way into the pockets
of small farmers and herders who must put up with the destruction
wild animals cause on their lands.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists like Western are encouraging farmers and
ranchers to pool their lands, open private game parks and get into
the tourist business themselves. These projects are already
operating in a half-dozen Kenyan communities, and plans have been
drawn up for 30 more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to preserve the wildlife, you have to find a way
to make money on it,'' said Nicholas Georgiadis, an ecologist who
heads the private Mpala Research Center in Laikipia. ``Can you
create a balance where the wildlife creates enough income so that
people want to maintain it?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The projects that have succeeded, like the Il Ngwezi Sanctuary
in Samburu district, have done so because a small number of
families have shared in the profits and because they have received
financial help and training from international conservation
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In other places, though, the slim revenues from the sanctuaries
have been either spread too thinly among the owners of the land or
skimmed off by corrupt local officials. Some of the sanctuaries
also lack trained managers capable of running a successful tourist
resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience will run out unless these newly introduced forms of
land use can see tangible benefits,'' said Nehemiah Rotich,
chairman of the East Africa Wildlife Society. ``They would like to
see wildlife making money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leakey argues that such projects will never succeed on a
scale large enough to save wildlife. He and other conservationists
maintain it is a pipe dream to think such schemes can reverse the
underlying causes of the decline. Not only is there a human
population explosion coupled with little arable land, but Kenya has
no comprehensive land-use plan that would zone land for wildlife,
agriculture and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with the fact that we have islands of
wildlife,'' Leakey said. ``What we need is the political leadership
to say we need these parks intact. The antagonism to wildlife can
be dealt with as the antagonism to tax collectors is dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 when the first park, Nairobi National Park, was
established, there were only 5 million people living in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are 30 million trying to eke out a living on the same
land, and only about a fifth of the country receives enough
rainfall to raise cash crops.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, tens of thousands of people have migrated
into lands not suitable for farming throughout Kenya. These farmers
have plowed under and overgrazed buffer zones around parks and
reserves that the animals must use as dispersal areas during wet
seasons, wildlife officials say. Wild lands in Kenya have been
disappearing at a rate of 2 percent a year, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Impoverished people, many facing extreme hunger because they are
trying to farm in arid regions not suitable for crops, have poached
thousands of animals for food.
</P>
<P>
   While the government's anti-poaching efforts, begun in the late
1980s, dramatically slowed down the wholesale slaughter of
elephants and rhinoceroses in the last eight years, the local
police have done little or nothing to stop a burgeoning underground
trade in bush meat, conservationists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally illegal, but everyone's doing it,'' said Rob
Barnett, of Traffic, an environmental organization that has just
completed a study showing the trade in bush meat is thriving in
Kenya. ``The law-enforcement people aren't enforcing the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most extensive clash between man and beast has taken
place in the Taita Hills, a range of mountains sandwiched like a
peninsula of humanity between the western and eastern halves of the
Tsavo park.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for land over the last 25 years has forced tens of
thousands of Taita people, who in the past lived on the fertile
slopes of the mountains, to move down onto the rangelands below, an
arid savannah that was carved up into large communal ranches for
cattle grazing in the 1960s. These migrants have splintered much of
the ranchland into smaller farms, and they have run into constant
battles with elephants, lions and buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
   At the park headquarters near the town of Voi, Crisant Mueme is
a ranger whose job is smoothing out the park's ruffled relations
with farmers.
</P>
<P>
   He and his colleagues keep a dog-eared log book that reads like
a police blotter in a big city, except the criminals are all
animals. One night a lion takes 10 goats. On another an elephant
tramples a man coming home from a bar. Nine people are injured
chasing buffaloes from their fields. There are pages and pages of
entries about zebras, elephants and buffaloes destroying crops.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 alone, there were 87 reports of elephants trampling
crops and two people were killed by the mammoth animals. Rangers
were forced to kill three rogue elephants over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to educate the community about the importance of
wildlife and how we can benefit from it,'' Mueme said. ``They are
listening to us, but it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   One place where animals have wreaked havoc is the Mramba Group
Ranch, a 30,000-acre piece of land right on the border of the
western half of Tsavo park.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two people were trampled to death by elephants in
Mramba, Mueme said. Farmers there report constant problems, mostly
lions killing cattle and elephants eating crops. An electric fence
has been erected around the parts of the ranch under cultivation.
But the animals are already finding ways around it, local officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these problems, the governors of Mramba ranch have asked
permission from the wildlife service to set up a game sanctuary,
hoping to cash in on the tourists visiting Tsavo park and a second
private sanctuary in Taita run by Hilton Hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lived along with the wildlife, but we haven't
benefited from it,'' said Richard Mwambili, a member of the
governing committee of the ranch. Mwambili said the ranch does not
yet have the resources to build roads and lodges needed to attract
tourists. Though 15 camp scouts have been trained by the wildlife
service, they remain idle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The delay has frustrated many residents. To overtake what the
ranch can now make from cattle, Mwambili said the sanctuary would
have to make more than $300,000 a year from tourism, and it will
take several years to build up a steady stream of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be the manager,'' he said. ``But I'm not managing
anything at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many farmers in Mramba say they are willing to give the
sanctuary a chance, despite their long-running war with wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Nzalu, 24, is typical of some of the young residents who
support the idea. He has been trying to squeeze a living out of 20
acres of arid land his father gave him four years ago, but now he
has signed up for a job as a scout in the future sanctuary. ``The
tourists are not coming to see us,'' he said. ``They are coming to
see the animals. They will be our business. In this region we can't
rely on rainfall. This is a semi-arid area.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the older farmers in Mramba support the idea.
Mwamburi Mwikamba, for instance, said he was staking his future on
the sanctuary, even though his pregnant wife was killed in 1991 as
she tried to scare elephants away from their cornfields. One of his
employees was killed by an elephant last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animals are not good, and they are not bad,'' Mwikamba
said. ``If the game sanctuary is put up at Mramba, some of my own
children might be employed there. If the tourists come, the money
from tourism might help sending our children to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for park officials, only three of the 28 community
ranches in Taita have accepted the notion of tourism as an
alternative to agriculture, wildlife officials say.
</P>
<P>
   More than half are considering parceling out the rangelands to
individual families for farms, despite the constant threat of
drought. It is a formula wildlife officials maintain would mean
losing more vital dispersal areas and migratory paths for animals.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 58 percent of the animal population of Tsavo, some
106,600 individual animals, vanished between 1973 and 1993, said
Mohammed Dhidha, the regional biodiversity coordinator in Tsavo.
Some species, like the black rhinoceros and the Hirola antelope,
are near extinction. Others, like the lesser kudu, have experienced
a 90 percent drop since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing short of a land-use policy by the government will stop
this,'' said James Ndungu, a wildlife official in charge of
community coordination.

 LAW SCHOOL COPING WITH TOO MUCH SUCCESS  (jw) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a fine line that college admissions officers tread when
deciding how many candidates to admit.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeastern University School of Law in Boston, for
example, found that it has done too well in filling the 185 slots
for the class of 2001, which enters next month. It accepted 755 of
its 1,750 applicants, figuring that only a third or so would
actually enroll. But 290 students signaled their intent to do so.
</P>
<P>
   So the law school has been trying, gently, to persuade some of
them not to enroll _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   The problem began about five years ago when law schools saw the
number of applicants drop. Rather than maintain the size of the
entering class, which would dilute the quality of students, some
schools decided to reduce it, said Paul Bauer, assistant dean and
director of admissions at Northeastern Law School. ``Northeastern
was one of many schools who did that, going from a high of 200 down
to 175.''
</P>
<P>
   There it remained until this year, when it appeared the picture
was changing again. ``We saw signs that the trend was stabilizing
itself or even reversing, so it was decided to increase the class
size by 10, from 175 to 185.''
</P>
<P>
   But admissions officers guessed wrong. Instead, the applicant
pool fell by 20 percent. What to do to avoid a sea of empty seats
in the fall? The strategy: actively court the students offered
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted 220 deposits,'' Bauer said, explaining, ``There are
always people who change their minds during the summer and we
wanted to be at 190 when classes begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise: 290 people sent in deposits.
</P>
<P>
   So last month, the school sent a letter to the incoming class
asking its members to consider postponing enrollment. The letter
offered a full refund of the $500 deposit and guaranteed spots for
next year. ``Now we are down to 245,'' Bauer said Friday, the
deadline withdrawal day. ``Twenty-seven have deferred and 18 have
said they will go elsewhere or work.''
</P>
<P>
   The school has also been using financial incentives to deter
some students who applied for but did not receive scholarships. So
far, few have taken the offer of a $5,000 scholarship, renewable
over three years, Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   How did the law school manage to attract too large a class from
a shrunken pool of candidates? An intensified marketing campaign,
it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Receptions at which prospective applicants could meet alumni
were held in New York, Washington, Boston, Los Angeles and San
Francisco and attracted so many people that Atlanta and Chicago
will be added next year. In addition, recruiters spent more time
visiting college campuses and a new series of publications was
distributed, tailored to the student.
</P>
<P>
   After acceptance letters were mailed, students received personal
calls of congratulations. The prospects were invited to an
on-campus open house, with tours, classes, alumni receptions,
panels and cocktails with the university president. Clearly the
strategy worked.

RUSSIA GETS NO RELIEF FROM ECONOMIC HEAT WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ August can be a tricky month in Moscow, in part because
of memories of the coup that began at dawn on Aug. 19, 1991, when
the leader of the Soviet Union was away on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   People were rattled again by those memories this week when
President Boris Yeltsin returned unexpectedly from his vacation to
prepare, as he put it, for the ``hot'' political autumn ahead, when
a new round of austerity measures will take effect.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of the late-summer heat now being felt in Moscow
was the unannounced visit this weekend by Stanley Fischer, the
International Monetary Fund's deputy director, less than a month
after the fund put together a package of $22.6 billion in
international credits for the cash-strapped Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   The quick return trip by Fischer, who led the negotiations with
Russia, was seen as a stepped-up effort to maintain the pressure as
Moscow staggers through its tall list of promises to foreign
lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Much still remains to be done, when the Parliament convenes for
a special session on Aug. 17, to consider further budget and
revenue measures, including important changes in the income tax
law.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the fund's next $4.3 billion installment could
depend on approval of these measures by the Communist-dominated
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who signed the Parliament's first batch of fiscal
reforms into law on Friday night, is said to be narrowing his
choices for a new economic policy official who will be charged with
coordinating the response of the government to its financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Late summer and early fall in Russia has always been a time of
fiscal pressure, as governments scramble for money to help bring in
the harvest and to get ready for the deliveries of goods to Arctic
regions, where the days are getting shorter and the temperatures
are already beginning to drop.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis brings much added pressure this year. In a
meeting with 80 Western investment bankers and fund managers late
last week, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko reported that there was
some good news _ a slight improvement in the fiscal situation.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues have inched toward 80 percent of the goals set by the
monetary fund for tax collection, which has been one of the most
glaring failures of Russia's recent governments. The tax collection
totals were up to 19.5 billion rubles in July, or $6.2 billion,
from 18.5 billion rubles, or $6 billion, in May.
</P>
<P>
   The government also announced plans for further privatization,
including the sale of a 25 percent stake in the telecommunications
holding company Syazinvest, 10 percent of the giant oil company
Lukoil and 5 percent of the natural gas monopoly Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also bad news, including a gloomy projection of
two more years of virtually no growth in the Russian economy, with
an increase of only four-tenths of 1 percent seen for 2000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several Western investors said the most significant news from
the meeting with Kiriyenko and top Russian finance officials was
what they said they were not going to do: They promised not to
issue any more debt until at least October and renewed pledges not
to devaluate the ruble or default on Russia's foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts foresee a slight weakening of the ruble in coming
months, but they said the change from a current dollar-pegged rate
of 6.1 _ if it happens _ is likely to be both slight and gradual.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko, 36, whose first 100 days in office ended this week
without a hint of a honeymoon, won high marks for a sober,
realistic and well-briefed account of Russia's fiscal situation.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts said that the Western investors were still
awaiting more concrete evidence of the Russian effort before
considering a return to the market.
</P>
<P>
   One important signal is expected when Yeltsin appoints a
successor to Anatoly Chubais as the government's chief economic
policy coordinator, with the rank of deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais himself, now director of Russia's giant electricity
monopoly and the trouble-shooter for the current crisis, is said to
be a candidate, but few expect him to take the job. Yegor Gaidar,
who as acting prime minister launched Russia's economic reforms in
January, is also said to be under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of either Chubais or Gaidar would be seen as a
reassuring signal to Western investors. But by the same token,
either one would be seen as a red flag for the anti-Yeltsin
opposition, which blames their policies for Russia's economic woes.

COMPLEX FORMULA GIVES CAMBODIA HEAD THE EDGE IN ELECTION OUTCOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Battered by coups, violence and
voting-day manipulation, Cambodian voters waiting to learn the
results of last Sunday's elections faced a new challenge Saturday:
mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   An election official, appearing on television with a blue marker
and a white board, explained that once the slow vote count is
completed, legislative seats will be allocated by a complex formula
that will favor the party of the incumbent leader, Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Few people could follow the intricacies of the formula. ``The
guy has just explained it and I still don't understand it,'' a
Cambodian journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   Favoring larger parties over smaller ones, the formula is
expected to give Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party a bare majority
in the 122-seat Parliament. Under the formula that most parties had
thought was being used, his group would have been just short of a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, Hun Sen's total falls well short of the
two-thirds' majority needed to form a government. He has offered to
enter a coalition with his chief rivals, Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, but both men are still protesting the vote count.
</P>
<P>
   The vote totals are emerging slowly, and a preliminary official
count was not expected until next week. But unofficial counts have
made it clear that Hun Sen has won.
</P>
<P>
   The exact size of his victory is still unknown, along with the
extent to which he will be forced to rely on coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Election Committee, Samraing
Kamsan, said Saturday that the new formula for allocating seats
should not come as a surprise. He said it was described more than
two months ago in election materials distributed to all 39
registered parties.
</P>
<P>
   But its intricacies and implications appeared to have escaped
them. Moreover, the election committee made no effort to point out
changes made since.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very worrying,'' Sam Rainsy said Saturday. It
appeared that his party's expected total would drop to 15 seats
from 18 under the newly publicized system.
</P>
<P>
   Ranariddh's projected total would drop to 43 seats, from 45. The
prince, who is in Bangkok for the weekend to play golf, made no
public comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's projected total would rise to 64 seats, from 59,
giving him the absolute majority to ensure his party's dominance
over legislative work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``So you see that the change in formula to allocate seats in
this case has a very high significance,'' said Peter Schier, an
electoral expert who represents the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, an
international democratic foundation that has been involved for two
years in preparing Cambodia's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just talk among some weird university eggheads, you
know,'' he said. ``This is politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now, he said, is whether the formula was changed
for technical reasons or whether the change was a political, though
apparently quite legal, sleight-of-hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have difficulties to believe that this was only a technical
change,'' Shier said, ``because as you know it has very big
political repercussions. It's a question of whether the biggest
party gets an absolute majority or not. So it seems to be a
political question, frankly speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote count itself is going excruciatingly slowly. Saturday
was to have been the day when the committee's ``official
preliminary results'' were to have been announced. But only a
trickle emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's spokesman, Samraing Kamsan, said the process of
collating, tabulating and verifying was taking a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, don't put me on the spot,'' he asked when pushed about
complete numbers. &QL;

PRESSURE IS GROWING FOR HEALTH INSURERS TO COVER CONTRACEPTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Md., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seizing upon the celebrity of the male impotency
pill Viagra, family planning groups are pressing lawmakers in
Congress and the states on a long-ignored demand that employers
cover the costs of contraception as a health benefit. They are
confronting lawmakers with the inequity they see in some employers'
covering Viagra while denying women help in avoiding unwanted
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Foundation of
America, which has been leading the lobbying in Congress for birth
control coverage, said, ``The groundswell is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland was the first state to mandate coverage of prescription
contraceptives in workers' health insurance plans, approving a bill
in April. At least a dozen other state legislatures are weighing
similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the Senate and House have approved provisions,
attached to appropriations bills, that would require the federal
government to offer all commonly prescribed forms of contraception,
including birth control pills, intrauterine devices and diaphragms,
to its 2.4 million employees who have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriations bills have yet to be considered, but the move
to provide coverage for federal workers ``is very good news,'' said
Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., who with Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., led
the drive for the House measure. ``It demonstrates that across the
ideological spectrum, we recognize that women _ and men _ have to
have the right to plan their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Broader bills have been introduced in the Senate and House that
would cover many of the nation's private-sector workers. Prospects
for passage, however, are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The measures have been generally opposed by employers and
insurers, and by anti-abortion groups. But in Congress, at least,
opposition has been more restrained than on other matters of
reproduction and on lawmakers' efforts to mandate health benefits,
like wide freedom in choosing doctors, that the employers say would
raise the cost of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate measures have been sponsored by two lawmakers on
opposite sides of the abortion debate: Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who
is a liberal on the issue, and Harry Reid, D-Nev., who opposes
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to do a great deal of soul searching,'' Reid
said. ``We're not forcing anybody to use contraceptives. We're
saying that if your plan prescribes prescription drugs, you have a
right to prescription contraceptives.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing studies of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit
research and educational organization in New York that is a leading
lobbyist for the benefit, Reid said that 3.6 million women had
unintended pregnancies every year and that 44 percent of the
pregnancies ended up as abortions. ``And it's not a bunch of
teen-age kids being promiscuous,'' he said. Women also pay 68
percent more in out-of-pocket costs for medical care than men do,
the institute says, in part because of the cost of contraception.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When Viagra, produced by Pfizer Inc., became available this
spring as a treatment for male impotency, many health plans moved
to cover prescriptions for it. Some insurers have since restricted
or denied the benefit, but women's groups say they are still
affronted by many plans' unilateral denial of prescription
contraceptives, even while covering abortion and sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   Many government and private-sector workers and their spouses and
children are either denied all forms of prescription contraceptives
or covered for only one or two.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the Senate and House provisions for coverage of
federal workers are signed into law, workers will be able to buy
contraceptive pills, intrauterine devices, Depo-Provera shots,
Norplant inserts and diaphragms, all for the same $5 or $10 that
they pay through their health plans for other prescriptions. The
provision would also cover such doctor services as counseling and
diaphragm fitting.
</P>
<P>
   Like many women's groups, Planned Parenthood sees wider use of
contraception as a means of curbing the demand for abortion and
easing tensions among advocates of reproductive rights and foes of
abortion. ``The point of agreement between pro-choice and pro-life
ought to be in preventing unintended pregnancy,'' Ms. Feldt said.
</P>
<P>
   Such groups say the fact that Congress is grappling with the
issue of coverage of contraceptive benefits for the first time is
in itself a significant breakthrough, and the provisions for
federal employees another. Federal benefit plans often become the
standard for many large private-sector companies.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the broader bill could build. The insurance
industry, groups representing both large and small employers, and
managed care organizations all make the same argument. ``Our
position is, we're opposed to mandates of any sort,'' said Dan
Danner, chief lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent
Business, which represents small employers.
</P>
<P>
   The Guttmacher Institute says that including the full range of
prescription contraceptives in health benefit plans would add
$17.12 a year to employer costs of the plans per worker and $4.28
to the employee's share of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But together with other mandates that Congress is considering in
managed care legislation, the total cost could discourage employers
from offering the plans or employees from subscribing to them.
</P>
<P>
   A large health maintenance organization in California,
Foundation Health Systems, said that oral contraceptives were
standard features of the insurance coverage that its 5,000
California employers buy to cover 2.2 million workers. But devices
are an extra-cost option that many employers refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``So yes, we see it as a problem,'' Lisa Haines, a spokeswoman
for the organization, said of wider coverage. ``It's obviously
going to drive up premiums for a standard benefits package.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ugoretz, president of the Erisa Benefits Committee, which
represents 200 large corporations, said: ``It may be good social
policy. On the other hand, so is affordable health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, employer and insurance groups have not allied in
coalitions as they have against the broader managed care proposal
in Congress, nor have they started buying advertisements to fight
the proposal. Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance
Association of America, said, ``We're concentrating our fire on the
managed care legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent groups that oppose abortion _ the National Right
to Life Committee and the Roman Catholic Church _ oppose mandated
coverage of contraceptives, in part, both say, because some
contraceptives can cause abortion by killing a newly conceived
embryo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We oppose it strongly,'' said Gail Quinn, executive director
of the Pro-Life Secretariat of the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   When a benefit is mandated, she said, workers are denied the
right to choose a health plan that does not have that benefit.
``That's coercive,'' she said. ``It's unwarranted, and it's
unprecedented.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIPROCK, N.M. _ Against a backdrop of junked cars and sagging
trailers, a long line of young Navajos set off one recent morning,
running toward the East, running toward the rising sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the sun comes up, the gods come up, so we run to greet
the gods in the morning,'' Kelly Upshaw, a Navajo from Fort
Defiance, Ariz., said as she unwound from the run, pacing about a
high school track here. ``That is how my parents taught me.''
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old college junior, she came home to the giant Navajo
Nation reservation this summer to help teach running clinics
organized by Wings of America, a youth program for Indians based in
Santa Fe, which is leading a running renaissance in Indian country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running has its roots in the spiritual tradition,'' said
William Channing, the group's president. ``Running increases pride,
self-esteem, cultural identity. It brings people together in a
healthy lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Since before recorded time, American Indians ran _ for trade,
for communication and for the spiritual belief that a runner
creates a living cord between the earth and the sky. This tradition
carried over into the 20th century when, in the 1912 Olympics, Jim
Thorpe, a Sac and Fox, won gold medals in the decathlon and the
pentathlon and Louis Tewanima, a Hopi, won a silver medal in the
10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent decades, the American Indian running tradition has
faltered. As the Indians' fleet-of-foot styles of life have ceded
to the sedentary, health indicators for Indians have plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the Navajo Nation, home to one-fifth of America's 1
million Indians living on reservations, one-quarter of the
population has diabetes, a condition not detected here a half
century ago. About one-quarter of Navajo young people are obese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two generations ago, people were more active physically,
growing their own food, chopping their own firewood, herding their
sheep,'' said Dr. Chris Percy, director of Shiprock's community
heath services.
</P>
<P>
   On the social level, the Navajo Nation has 45 percent
unemployment, high rates of drug and alcohol abuse, a teen-age
suicide rate that is three times the national average, and a murder
rate that is 4.5 times the national average. With half the
reservation population under 21 years old and gangs proliferating,
Navajo elders are desperate to steer the younger generation toward
self-discipline and attainment of goals.
</P>
<P>
   Becki Wells, 23, a Blackfoot Indian who hopes to run the 1,500
meters in the 2000 Olympics, believes she is a role model to Navajo
girls who are flocking to the 17 Wings clinics on the reservation
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go with the alcohol and sex _ or you can go with the
running,'' she tells teen-agers. ``If you are serious about high
school athletics, you are less likely to go out drinking every
weekend, you are less likely to get pregnant and more likely to go
to college.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival of running among Indians is easily seen here in
Shiprock, one of the Navajos' largest towns. At Shiprock High
School, which was built within view of the town's 7,200-foot-high
namesake butte, running teams for boys and girls draw about
one-fifth of the 500 students eligible for school sports.
</P>
<P>
   Reynalda Harry, a 15-year-old Navajo, said that running builds
pride at her school, Newcomb High School. ``We are lifting up the
school, showing people we are not just a low-class high school,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Every year since Wings was founded in 1988, the group has sent
teams of boys and girls in the 14-to-19 age group to the National
Cross Country Championships sponsored by USA Track and Field. Wings
teams have finished first nine times out of a possible 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wings clinics have been held on 60 reservations, from
the Penobscot in Maine to the Jicarilla Apache in New Mexico, the
strongest runners often come from the Southwest, in part because of
high-altitude training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get calls every week from Indian communities around the
country, but there is not a huge percentage we can help without
more money,'' Channing said. The organization's largest corporate
sponsor is Nike, which this year covers almost one-quarter of
Wings' $250,000 budget, and about $70,000 in shorts, shoes, shirts,
caps and bags.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of running on self-esteem could be seen tattooed on
the right arm of Tim Martin, a Navajo running instructor who
prefers his tribe's traditional name, Dine. Leaving behind high
school friends in dead-end jobs, the 24-year-old Wings runner is
completing his college education this year and sporting a tattoo on
his shoulder. Under a green-blue spear is printed: Dine-Warrior.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go out, I want people to know I am Navajo,'' he said.
``It drives me to run harder.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Maine _ The tide used to blush red with chicken blood
here and, when it ebbed, leave watermarks written in feathers.
Flurries of down sometimes whitened Main Street, as if left by a
town pillow-fight. Pleasure boats shunned the harbor, fearing the
slimy fat that would coat their hulls. And summer visitors, not
used to the smell, held their noses as they passed from odor to
odor _ the poultry plants, the sewage plant, the fish plant.
</P>
<P>
   Such are residents' unaffectionate memories of Belfast a decade
or two ago, when the economy of this sloping-to-the-sea city of
6,500 residents was dominated by poultry processing, one of the
heavy, messy industries Maine has been known for through much of
the century.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Belfast is becoming the poster town for the
quick-spreading change taking place as the state _ long famed for
its textile mills, paper plants and shoe factories _ makes a
belated entry into the postindustrial age.
</P>
<P>
   In what Gov. Angus King advertises as the most striking
transformation of a Maine town by higher-tech industry, Belfast's
rubber-boot jobs _ most lost when plants closed _ are being more
than replaced by telephone-headset jobs, of the sort that have
turned other states like Nebraska and Wyoming into headset hot
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not chicken pluckers anymore; we're telecommunicators,''
said Gail Berry, a 49-year-old Belfast native and former hair
stylist.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry works for MBNA, the largest independent credit-card
lender in the world. So do 1,500 other people in the mall-like
building the company opened here in 1996, handling calls from
credit-card users or would-be users, and their numbers are expected
to swell by 2,000 more. Across Maine, such call centers have become
the state's largest new industry in the last decade, creating more
than 10,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Call centers are ``the sort of postindustrial analog to the mill
economy,'' said Charles Colgan, an economist at the University of
Southern Maine. ``In a way, they have replaced the textile and
apparel and shoe mills in the sense that they employ moderately
skilled people, a large number of them, at a lower cost than you
would employ those same people in a larger urban setting, and at a
much lower cost for the land and buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   That mill analogy may help to explain what seems at first a
psychological mystery to outsiders: the lack of unanimous rejoicing
over the call centers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a company like MBNA has created thousands of
nonpolluting jobs where they were much needed; the jobs offer
health insurance and other benefits and pay not badly for
hereabouts, beginning at an average first-year salary and bonuses
of $25,000; employees work in seas of cubicles in airy,
climate-controlled, pale green rooms. On top of all that, the
company has given millions in charity to local hospitals, libraries
and schools.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, ask people in Belfast about MBNA and the feelings they
express are often decidedly mixed. Their appreciation of the jobs
and the philanthropy is swirled with unease and skepticism over an
arrival of such size, with so much money, and with a powerful
corporate culture of slogans, performance incentives,
suburban-looking design and even jacket-and-tie dressing much more
familiar in, say, Connecticut than in rural Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hate it,'' said Ryan Brown, tending bar one recent
night at Bruno's &AMP; Rico's Pub, a shabby-cozy, bear-cave of a town
bar. ``It's just that would you rather live and die on your own
time cutting sardines or would you rather be bought and paid for
and owned by MBNA?''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least,'' countered Mike Reynolds, who runs the laundry next
door, when you work for MBNA, ``you don't smell like fish when you
get out of work.''
</P>
<P>
   And at least people have work. Maine has lagged about two years
behind the national recovery from the recession of the late 1980s,
and though it has replaced all the jobs it had lost and begun
expanding, it still has northern pockets where unemployment reaches
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Belfast particularly hit the skids in the 1980s, as its shoe and
poultry factories closed, and the fine old shipbuilding city gained
a reputation as a druggy, dead-end spot.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, said Jay Davis, deputy editor of the weekly
Maine Times, the seedlings of the city's turnaround were being
planted, and outside grants came in to put in an industrial park,
fix up the downtown and create a waterfront park. A new civic
energy was growing among the town's disparate groups of old-time
Maine families, former hippies and transplanted retirees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no great influx of jobs until 1993, when MBNA,
seeking to base a branch of the company in New England, brought
several hundred jobs to nearby Camden, attracted in part by
summertime ties the company's president, Charles Cawley, had to the
seaside area.
</P>
<P>
   And as for MBNA's arrival in Belfast in 1996, Davis said, ``It's
the biggest thing to happen to Belfast since the poultry industry
in the 1950s by far.''

   He sees the call center as an improved, 21st-century version of
a mill or factory. ``It's trying to do what the shoe factory did,
too, which is to make money for its owners and shareholders,''
Davis said. ``And that's what it's there for, and when it stops
doing that, it's not going to be there, just like the shoe factory
wasn't here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   King sounds less skeptical when he paints his picture of the
new, improved Maine. In an interview, he spoke about the magnetism
that Maine's quality of life _ its low crime and rocky beauty (he
did not mention its winters) _ is exerting on high-tech workers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, King said, biotechnology, at $350 million in gross
annual revenue, is a bigger money-maker for Maine than lobstering
and potato farming combined. But the two top industries remain
tourism and manufacturing, with an emphasis on paper and
shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Colgan, the economist, said Maine's high-technology sector
had still clearly failed to achieve the critical mass needed for it
to take off. And the call centers, he said, should be seen mainly
as great employment boosts for particular rural regions _ like
Belfast's Waldo County, long known as one of the poorest counties
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Already, MBNA has opened a call center that is likely to employ
up to 200 people in Presque Isle in far-northern Aroostook County;
ICT Group, another call-center company, has opened centers in the
last year in inland Oxford and Pittsfield, and Sitel Corp. has
moved into remote Limestone, in distant Aroostook. L.L. Bean, known
as the grandfather of Maine telephone business, is also thriving,
and call centers are becoming so common that they are known to
poach one another's workers in some Maine spots.
</P>
<P>
   Although MBNA may not define Maine's economic future, it
certainly seems likely to define much of Belfast's, at least for
the near-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here and we love it here,'' said David Spartin, vice
chairman and spokesman for MBNA, which by last year was the
eighth-largest private employer in the state, with well over 3,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   That size and power disturb some people here. ``My beef is that
they're too big for this area, much too big,'' said Doug Hufnagel,
a local columnist who has been one of the few residents to air
doubts about MBNA in public. He has printed up scenic postcards
depicting a Hollywood-like sign and satirically declaring ``Welcome
to Cawleywood'' _ a reference to Cawley of MBNA.
</P>
<P>
   Hufnagel's criticisms bespeak a broader culture clash: MBNA has
struck many here as profligate in its willingness to tear
structures down or undo decor that seems perfectly fine. Its new
money can strike those used to old-money summer people as brash,
and even the very business it is in _ credit _ contradicts the
Maine emphasis on thrift.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hufnagel backtracked. ``I don't know _ it's jobs,'' he
said. ``For a lot of people it's better than McDonald's or the
chicken factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, in fact, say MBNA seems just about like heaven, and
applications outnumber jobs 10 to 1, company officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to work at MBNA two years ago, Lisa Ripley, 31,
worked mainly at near-minimum-wage jobs in a local seafood-smoking
factory and at a leather tannery. There were seasonal layoffs and
little chance of advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, her family is so proud of her work as a customer
advocate (``You know that number on the back of your credit card?
That's me.'') that her grandmother insists on broadcasting that she
is an MBNA ``manager,'' even though she is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest difference between my family and me is
they still get up in the morning and go to their job,'' Ms. Ripley
said. ``I get up in the morning looking forward to another day in
my career.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ For decades, the Jewish National Fund has been known
for its tree-planting and land reclamation projects in Israel.
Generations of Jews have given money to plant a tree in Israel,
vicariously greening the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund, whose land purchases have created the core of
modern Israel, has become embroiled in controversy over its efforts
to settle Jews in the Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the fund say they are carrying out a mandate to
acquire property for Jews in their ancient homeland. But the
displacement of East Jerusalem Arabs in the process has raised
questions about aspects of the fund's activities.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, a Palestinian family of 28, the Ghuzlans,
face eviction from their home of 32 years. The Israeli Supreme
Court ruled that they were living on land bought by Jews in the
1920s that now belongs to the fund, the land purchase arm of the
World Zionist Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is planning to hand over the house to Jewish settlers,
who have been steadily moving into houses acquired in the Ghuzlans'
neighborhood, the village of Silwan, near Jerusalem's Old City. The
settlers have vowed that the area, the site of the ancient
Israelite capital of the biblical King David, will be turned into a
Jewish neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the law of the jungle,'' Riyad Ghuzlan said, sitting in
the living room of his house on a steep hillside under the Old City
walls.
</P>
<P>
   There are several similar enclaves in Silwan. The entry of Jews
in recent years has raised tensions and set off violent incidents
in East Jerusalem, the volatile core of the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict, whose future is supposed to be determined in peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's involvement in Jewish settlement and displacement of
Arabs from homes in East Jerusalem has drawn sharp criticism from
Israeli peace advocates, who say such activities are perverting the
group's original calling.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1901 to acquire land for Jewish settlement in
Turkish and later British-governed Palestine, the fund played an
important role in creating a territorial haven for Jews fleeing
persecution abroad. Today, critics say, the fund has become an
agent for the dispossession of another people, staining its
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The JNF has become an arm of the extremist settlers,'' said
Tzali Reshef, a leader of the Israeli group Peace Now.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's main focus remains land development, soil reclamation
and afforestation in Israel, but in East Jerusalem it has promoted
Jewish settlement among Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't settlers, they're Jews living in Jerusalem,'' said
Shlomo Gravetz, the fund's board chairman. ``The Jewish National
Fund is a fund of the Jewish people, and its job is to settle Jews
in its properties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Silwan, it's the City of David,'' Gravetz added,
using the biblical name for the area. ``Settling the City of David,
where our forefathers lived, is a political objective? It's a
national objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Legally, Ghuzlan's cause is lost. Israeli courts have determined
that in 1923 his grandfather sold the land on which the family home
was later built to Baron Edmond de Rothschild, a Jewish
philanthropist who bought lands for Jewish settlement in Palestine.
The fund acquired the Rothschild properties in 1975, and in 1987
sued Ghuzlan's father.
</P>
<P>
   After years of legal deliberations and an appeal by the Ghuzlans
to the Israeli Supreme Court, it ruled in 1997 in the fund's favor,
granting Ghuzlan's father a one-year stay to negotiate an
agreement. The fund granted another half-year extension, which
expired on July 22, and says that upon their departure, it is
prepared to pay the Ghuzlans more than the sum of $75,000 set in
court.
</P>
<P>
   But Ghuzlan sees the decision as political, part of a plan by
the settlers and the government to push Arabs out of East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Seidemann, an Israeli lawyer who represents the Ghuzlans,
said the fund had rejected an arrangement that would have allowed
the family to remain.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians see a double standard. While Jewish settlers in
East Jerusalem and Hebron have been allowed to reclaim properties
owned by Jews before Israel was established, Palestinians are
barred from recovering homes lost in the war that followed Israel's
declaration of independence in 1948.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If they want to give back what were Jewish properties prior to
1948,'' said Ziyad Abu Zayyad, a member of the Palestinian
legislature from Jerusalem, ``they should give back Arab property
in west Jerusalem and in all of Palestine that Arabs owned before
1948.'' This is a very discriminatory regime, entitling Jews to
rights simply because they are Jews, and depriving these rights
from Arabs simply because they are Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghuzlan said his family had lost two homes in 1948 in what is
now a Jewish neighborhood of Jerusalem. In another twist, his
grandfather was given a letter of gratitude in 1929 for protecting
Jews in Silwan from Arab rioters during a wave of anti-Jewish
violence that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a family we owe an historic debt to,'' Seidemann said.
``The only reason for getting them out is to promote a political
cause.''  &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ Ever since the Communist Party took charge here in
1949, China's leaders have thrived on an unending cycle of
political campaigns. With quaint-sounding names like Let a Hundred
Flowers Bloom or the Cultural Revolution, campaigns were supposed
to sound noble. The realities were often horrific.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all was the Great Leap Forward, Mao Tse-tung's cockeyed
scheme of mass industrialization that destroyed the economy and
caused a famine that killed 30 million people around 1960. Yet even
in lesser campaigns, the same pattern was repeated: In public,
innocent victims were persecuted in the name of a bogus ideal; in
private, it was actually crass political jockeying that inspired
and directed a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that legacy, political campaigns continue in China
today. As in the past, they sound noble, but are purely political.
Most ordinary people are now wise enough to ignore them. But the
party itself is still clinging to its antiquated ways.
</P>
<P>
   Last month President Jiang Zemin unveiled China's latest
campaign. It targets smuggling, which reached epidemic proportions
in China years ago and is a trade dominated by the People's
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   True, in this case the target is hardly innocent, but as in
other campaigns, larger goals are being pursued. Jiang wants the
nation's military forces to relinquish their vast business
operations and, more important, he wants to reassert the authority
of the central government.
</P>
<P>
   That authority is being eroded by a variety of factors,
including the freer flow of information and insidious corruption.
Perhaps the biggest question facing China today is whether the
Communist Party is becoming vulnerable to an unexpected political
jolt strong enough to topple it. No one can predict such surprises
or their results _ like the failed Soviet coup in 1991 that yielded
the unintended consequence of propelling Boris Yeltsin to power _
but people can smell vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   They smell it today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a question of time,'' said a magazine editor in
Beijing, reflecting a popular sentiment. ``No one believes in
communism anymore, so how can there be any justification for a
Communist Party ?''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing utter dissatisfaction among wide sections of the
populace, and facing the potentially explosive danger of wide
unemployment as inefficient state-owned industries are overhauled,
Jiang is starting to tinker around the edges _ trying to change his
system to save it.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, newspapers and television programs were given mild
encouragement to report on egregious corruption cases. A handful of
university professors and scholars at research institutes have
started talking openly about the need for political reform.
Magazines with juicy stories of political intrigue, although highly
unreliable, are selling more openly on Beijing streets.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a small step toward greater openness when
President Clinton visited in June and, during a live national
broadcast, was shown publicly disagreeing with Jiang on sensitive
topics like the Tiananmen massacre of 1989 and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to take advantage of the marginally more tolerant mood,
some political dissidents have emerged in the past month to try to
announce the formation of a fringe party, still expressly
forbidden. Several have been detained and then released in a
merry-go-round of a legal procedure that reflects a minor softening
in Beijing's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   All these modest changes come at a time when the government,
with a new pro-reform prime minister, Zhu Rongji, is trying to
reduce the size of central ministries and undertake a vast reform
of China's outdated banking and housing systems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jiang seems to be betting that a minuscule amount of opening
will help assuage the innumerable complaints that gurgle near the
surface all the time throughout China. It is a wager with sizable
risks, looming even larger if China's economy stalls.
</P>
<P>
   For there is a distinct possibility that steps toward openness
and accountability will only create even greater pressure on the
floodgates of popular discontent. As with Mikhail Gorbachev's
attempts to save the Soviet system by reforming it, letting in a
little sunlight can expose a void where political legitimacy should
be.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the military equation. Judging that the time is right for
change in China's political and economic culture, Jiang has ordered
the military to relinquish its business operations.
</P>
<P>
   The order was treated with incredulity at first, so deeply
entrenched is money-making in the contemporary culture of the
People's Liberation Army. Yet Jiang appeared to be serious, as
China's media went into full blitz to make the point that he was,
with army generals and senior officials emerging one after another
to say they were earnestly addressing the task of fighting
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, the worst-kept secret in China was that the
army operated an enormous smuggling racket. It was a stunning
political milestone for Jiang to say publicly (addressing a meeting
of top military officers no less) that China's military was deeply
involved in illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than question the root of the problem _ an
authoritarian system that leaves the military unaccountable _ or
even reconsider the high import duties that make smuggling cellular
telephones, cigarettes and diesel oil so profitable, China's
leadership instead declared a campaign against smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   An expert political tactician, Jiang is unlikely to have
launched the anti-smuggling campaign, or to have ordered the
military out of business, without confidence that senior military
officers are on his side.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the main threat to the success of his campaign appears
to be not an outright rebellion by money-making officers but a
miasma of obfuscation and hidden transfers of ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Wei Jianxing, a senior official in charge of anti-corruption
efforts, alluded to that peril at a recent public meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army, armed police and law enforcement departments are
prohibited from hiding, relocating, transferring or selling
properties belonging to enterprises they run, or from distributing
funds and property belonging to firms held privately under any
name, from making false financial reports or rewriting, hiding or
destroying financial documents,'' Wei said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the larger issue is whether taking on the military _ until
now off limits to public criticism _ will provoke a deeper
examination of failings by the ruling authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army has always been sacred,'' said a retired Communist
Party official who is sharply critical of the current group of
leaders. ``It seems a very bold move to take on the army, no matter
how corrupt it has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what is the next step?''

THE SIX-MONTH JOURNEY TO A STARR-LEWINSKY ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 4 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 7 p.m. ET EMBARGO
for electronic media.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disguised by a blonde wig and sunglasses, Monica
Lewinsky boarded a flight last Sunday morning in Los Angeles, an
anonymous beginning to a 48-hour odyssey that transformed the legal
and political dynamics of the independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
four-year investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The next day in New York, Ms. Lewinsky met secretly with the
independent counsel's team at an East Side apartment belonging to
Starr's mother-in-law. After a five-hour debriefing and a
late-night drive to Washington, the former White House intern
signed an immunity deal on Tuesday that freed her from legal peril.
But it also confronted Clinton and his presidency with a morass
that he will be forced to face in grand jury testimony in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who turned 25 on July 23, has moved a step closer
to a cherished goal. ``For my birthday,'' Ms. Lewinsky had told her
family, ``I want my life back.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on that birthday morning, Ms. Lewinsky was told by her
new lawyers, Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris, that Starr had called,
breaking weeks of silence and offering to reopen immunity
discussions. That night, her family celebrated at a French
restaurant in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Ms. Lewinsky's six-month journey from target to
cooperating witness was culled from more than a dozen interviews
this week with lawyers involved in the investigation, as well as
with associates and friends of the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   A Starr-Lewinsky alliance that seemed unlikely as recently as
last month was put together by a cast of lawyers, some of whom have
received no public attention. Ms. Lewinsky found a trusted mentor
in Sydney Hoffman, a 46-year-old lawyer in Cacheris' firm, who was
able to establish a bond with Ms. Lewinsky and then lead a critical
round of questioning that bolstered Ms. Lewinsky's credibility with
Starr's team. Sam Dash, the former Senate Watergate counsel who has
advised Starr on ethics issues, also played a pivotal role.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the most important players in this week's legal drama
were seasoned criminal defense lawyers, Stein, 73, and Cacheris,
69, who have only represented Ms. Lewinsky since June 2. The two
Washington insiders, who work in different law firms in the same
office building, broke a six-month deadlock of bad blood and broken
promises between Starr's prosecutors and Ms. Lewinsky's first
lawyer, William Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations opened with an offer from Starr that Ms.
Lewinsky would be ``queen for a day,'' an ironic term of the legal
arts that would allow the former White House intern to tell her
complete story to prosecutors _ but with a promise that nothing she
said could be used against her if, at the end of the interview,
Starr remained unsatisfied with the level of her cooperation and
declined to grant immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the resulting legal coup this week, Stein and Cacheris
are somber, perhaps because, like Dash, they are veterans of the
Watergate crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to celebrate,'' Stein said in an interview
in his book-lined law office here, facing an etching of
Shakespeare. ``None of this called for a party. This is a
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   On a cold afternoon last January, Ms. Lewinsky was confronted by
a retinue of FBI agents and lawyers working for Starr who
questioned her for hours. They threatened to prosecute her for
perjury by using her taped confessions to a friend about an affair
with the president _ a relationship that she had denied in sworn
testimony in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit.
</P>
<P>
   To defend his client, Ginsburg first submitted a proffer _ a
statement of expected testimony _ for Ms. Lewinsky that confirmed a
sexual relationship with the president, said lawyers familiar with
her account. But the proffer did not say that the president or his
allies had encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath in the Jones
case. The proffer did not satisfy Starr. And while Ginsburg argued
in court that Starr had offered Ms. Lewinsky immunity, Ginsburg
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Starr then turned to other matters, spending months in
protracted court battles with the White House, which attempted to
throw roadblocks in front of the prosecutor with claims of
attorney-client privilege, executive privilege, and an effort to
keep the Secret Service agents and uniformed officers that guard
Clinton from testifying.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Ginsburg's public characterizations of Starr as
someone who may have ``ravaged the life of a youngster'' were
received with glee in the White House. And the distrust between
Ginsburg and Starr's office grew so deep that all communication
ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky herself was instrumental in the ultimate decision
to dismiss Ginsburg, said lawyers familiar with the decision. He
had never been her choice. When her father first suggested him back
in January, friends recalled, her reaction was immediate: ``Dad,
he's a malpractice lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   She kept Nathaniel Speights, an experienced criminal defense
lawyer and Ginsburg's Washington co-counsel. Ms. Lewinsky was also
relying on advice from a savvy spokeswoman, Judy Smith, hired with
the help of her mother's lawyer, Billy Martin. Martin and Ms.
Smith, who is also a lawyer, helped guide Ms. Lewinsky in the
choice of Stein and Cacheris.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith began to change the landscape of Ms. Lewinsky's
insulated world. For Ms. Lewinsky, who several friends say is
lonely and bored and rarely gets to socialize with people her own
age (she feared anyone seen with her would be subpoenaed by Starr),
Ms. Smith became a new confidante.
</P>
<P>
   It was Marcia Lewis, Ms. Lewinsky's mother, who read about Stein
in a New Yorker magazine profile and suggested approaching him.
Martin, who knew both Stein and Cacheris, concurred. So did Ms.
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, Ms. Smith asked Cacheris whether his firm had any
female lawyers. It did: Ms. Hoffmann, a former assistant U.S.
attorney and the lawyer who became a mentor to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Stein and Cacheris decided that it was time for some diplomacy.
They paid a courtesy visit to Starr, whom both men knew through
Washington legal circles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the office, Stein talked in tough but measured terms
with Starr. ``I have one good trial left in me,'' Stein told him,
``and I'm going to put it at Monica's disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words sent a clear message to Starr's prosecutors: Ms.
Lewinsky was prepared to fight an indictment. And Starr was well
aware that Stein had won the only acquittal in a major criminal
trial in the Watergate case, representing Kenneth Parkinson, a
Nixon lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   For Starr, Stein's remark also increased the pressure to work
out a deal with Ms. Lewinsky. Starr knew that if Ms. Lewinsky was
indicted, a trial would likely delay his final report for a year or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial overtures, neither side talked for more than a
month. Then on Tuesday, July 21, Starr telephoned Stein and
suggested a meeting. The next day, Stein and Cacheris met at the
independent counsel's office with Starr and Dash. Afterward, Stein
and Cacheris sent a proffer letter that outlined what Ms. Lewinsky
was prepared to say under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proffer was not that different from the one
Ginsburg had submitted the previous winter, the climate had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trusted each other,'' Cacheris said, ``and trust had been a
problem in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr responded with his ``queen for a day'' offer.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse that week, Starr's office had sent
signals that the inquiry had reached a critical phase and might be
nearing its conclusion. Late Thursday afternoon, July 23, two grand
juries were taking testimony for Starr at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Although the public did not know it yet, Starr had served a
subpoena on the president. It was the first time a sitting
president was summoned to appear before a grand jury, and it
ordered Clinton to appear on Tuesday, July 27.
</P>
<P>
   Time was of the essence, and it was to Starr's advantage to have
Ms. Lewinsky's account first, before he questioned the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted it sooner rather than later,'' Cacheris said of
Ms. Lewinsky's account. Stein and Cacheris told Ms. Lewinsky that
meeting with Starr, given his time pressures, was ``a favorable
development.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed to meet last Monday in New York. Both camps
worried that reporters in Washington would find out about the
secret meeting if held there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had nothing to lose,'' Cacheris said. ``She could say what
she wanted to say, as long as it was the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one thing left to negotiate prior to the meeting:
The lunch menu. Starr and Stein decided on tuna fish sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Several friends of Ms. Lewinsky's said she was terribly
anguished over the prospect of testifying against the president,
but an even greater worry weighed on her. She knew that her mother
was also vulnerable to prosecution by Starr because she had kept
her daughter's cocktail dress with a stain. Lawyers said that Ms.
Lewinsky told prosecutors that the stain could provide evidence of
a a sexual encounter with the president. The dress is being tested
for physical evidence at the FBI crime laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has come to understand that she was going to
assume responsibility for the portion of this that was her fault,
and just tell the truth,'' a friend said. ``If the presidency goes
down, the president has to take responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, an agreement made Ms. Lewinsky nervous. She asked friends
last weekend, ``Am I doing the right thing?'' They encouraged her
to do whatever she believed it would take to put an end to her
six-month ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky told Stein and Cacheris that she was ready to talk
to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Although the five-hour meeting last Monday was held in the New
York City apartment of Starr's mother-in-law, Starr was not
present. But Cacheris and Stein were pleased to see Dash take a
leading role in organizing the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   While Dash raised the comfort levels of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers,
Ms. Hoffman, the lawyer in Cacheris' office, had grown close to Ms.
Lewinsky, and she was able to make Ms. Lewinsky feel more at ease.
Ms. Hoffman started the session by asking Ms. Lewinsky a series of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   After about 30 minutes, Starr's team _ Dash, William Bittman and
Sol Wisenberg _ asked questions of Ms. Lewinsky. ``There was no
rancor,'' Stein said afterward. ``It was congenial, dignified and,
under the circumstances, it was elevated.'' An FBI agent took
notes.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 p.m., Cacheris ended the meeting. Ms. Lewinsky returned
to a friend's apartment. That night, Starr left a message on
Stein's answering machine. Ms. Lewinsky's performance had been
deemed credible by his deputies. There was the basis for a
transactional immunity agreement, which is full and blanket
protection from prosecution unless prosecutors find that Ms.
Lewinsky has lied to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Cacheris and Stein went to Starr's office to pick
up the immunity agreement, which Starr had signed. They brought it
back to their offices, where Ms. Lewinsky signed it just before 2
p.m., when Stein and Cacheris announced it to the public with a
one-sentence statement outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   At that time and in a recent interview, both Stein and Cacheris
declined to discuss detailed terms of the agreement, or Ms.
Lewinsky's proffered testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky now faces the difficult task of attending daily
debriefings with Starr's prosecutors, which a friend said have been
``grueling.'' But she is preparing for her grand jury testimony,
which is likely to occur sometime later this month and could last
only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been apprehensive about all of this,'' Stein said.
``She is a bright person and is bright enough to know this is very
serious business.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ No less an authority on Watergate than Richard
Nixon proclaimed President Clinton's Whitewater affair graver than
the scandal that ended Nixon's presidency and ruined his
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe it?'' Nixon said to Monica Crowley, the young
researcher who chronicled his thoughts in the final years of his
life. ``They said it's nothing like Watergate. I say it's worse. In
Watergate, we didn't have profiteering, and we didn't have a
body.'' He was referring to the 1993 suicide of Vincent Foster,
Clinton's close friend and deputy White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's comment came in April 1994, nine days before his death _
and four years before the appearance of the telltale dress, the
talking points and the Tripp tapes.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last week, the Whitewater scandal of which Nixon
spoke had completed its transformation from a musty investigation
of an Ozarks land deal into a 24-hour national soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky agreed to tell prosecutors about her
relationship with the president, and to give an account of a
December meeting in which the two agreed to deny a sexual
relationship. And Clinton agreed, after months of resistance, to
testify on videotape in a criminal inquiry, making him the first
sitting president to appear before a grand jury investigating his
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Nixon's assessment, which seemed so quirkily
self-serving in the context of Arkansas real estate, is
Washington's conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The columnist George Will declared Clinton's behavior ``more
menacing to the civic culture'' than Watergate because Clinton had
enlisted the public as co-conspirators by repeatedly asking them to
believe the unbelievable. Corruption of the public, Will said, is
worse than abuse of governmental institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The author William Bennett _ brother of the president's lawyer,
Robert Bennett _ said Clinton's scandals were ``worse than
Watergate'' because they belittled the presidency and rendered the
public insensate to immorality.
</P>
<P>
   Will and Bennett are both longtime conservative critics of
Clinton, so perhaps their comments are predictable. But
commentators from all parts of the political and ideological
spectrum are predicting that the Lewinsky matter will have lasting
consequences as Watergate did, not only for this president but for
the presidency and for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it will, though it's worth stopping for a minute to
note that nobody has a clue yet what even the short-term
consequences for Clinton will be.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another way to compare Watergate and Whitewater.
While the former did have large and lasting effects, it is easy to
imagine that the latter will not.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate, the benchmark scandal for this generation, did more
than bring down a president. It brought to Washington a
congressional class of young, reform-minded Democrats who delayed
Republican ascendancy for 20 years. It deepened the Vietnam-era
public distrust of government. And it spawned legislation meant to
curb the influence on money on politics and created the office of
the independent counsel now occupied by Kenneth Starr, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars and political observers say Clinton's troubles _
however they are resolved _ will not have profound effects like
Watergate, which diminished the power and moral authority of the
presidency and changed the way Americans viewed their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the effects commentators have predicted for
the Clinton scandals, and some of the counter-arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The Crippled Presidency Theory
</P>
<P>
   Clinton inherited a presidency that had been downsized by
Watergate and the end of the Cold War. He further diminished the
office with a deliberate attempt to lower the public's expectations
of what its occupant could accomplish. Two years ago he declared
the end of the era of big government and embarked upon a program of
bite-sized policy initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky matter contributed to the diminution of the
presidency, as Jay Leno and David Letterman supplanted political
scientists as the public interpreters of the nation's highest
office.
</P>
<P>
   But quite apart from the current investigative frenzy, Clinton
has given little indication that he intends to try to accomplish
big things in his remaining 29 months in office. With a hostile and
divided Congress and a complacent public, his space for political
maneuver would be limited, even if he commanded broad public
respect. While nearly 70 percent of the public approves of the job
he is doing, 56 percent don't like or trust him as a person,
according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be ups and downs in the prestige of the
presidency,'' said Alonzo Hamby, a presidential scholar at Ohio
University. ``Some presidents will bring more authority and credit
to the office than others. It's sort of a shame in this case. We
started out with this obviously intelligent, engaging, interesting
younger president and now we've come to be talking about how good
he is at ceremonial occasions and projecting empathy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Not-So-Splendid Isolation Theory
</P>
<P>
   White House aides and sympathetic legal authorities say
Whitewater could inflict lasting damage to the presidency by
increasing the isolation of the office. Courts have ruled
decisively against Clinton's claims of privilege for conversations
with political advisers and in-house lawyers. An effort to shield
Secret Service agents from grand jury testimony in the Lewinsky
matter was also slapped down.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled last week that Bruce Lindsey,
deputy White House counsel and Clinton's closest confidant, could
not invoke lawyer-client privilege to avoid testifying before the
Lewinsky grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Judge David Tatel, in dissent, predicted dire consequences of
the ruling, saying the unique demands of the presidency require
freewheeling advice from aides and government lawyers. The
majority, however, decided that future presidents have no need to
worry about a breach of confidentiality unless they are plotting
potentially illegal acts subject to legitimate investigation.

</P>
<P>
   The Political Fallout Theory
</P>
<P>
   Democrats naturally worry that Clinton's problems could rub off
on them, not only in congressional elections this year but in the
presidential race in 2000. But Clinton's fortunes and those of his
party have often failed to coincide. And it is telling that many
Republicans see more political problems for them if Clinton leaves
office prematurely than if he survives. If he quits, Vice President
Al Gore becomes an incumbent candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Silbey, professor of political science at Cornell
University, said that even assuming the worst outcome for Clinton _
resignation or impeachment, both of which he considers highly
unlikely _ there would be little political impact. Gore would move
into the White House and presumably continue the policies that he
and Clinton have pursued for the past five-plus years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a personal tragedy for Clinton, and one more
terrible bump in the blows we've been taking as a political system,
but it doesn't have the staying power that Watergate did,'' Silbey
said. ``People would shrug their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Changed Public Discourse Theory
</P>
<P>
   One effect of Whitewater that may take a long time to dissipate
is the lifting of taboos on discussions that not long ago were
considered unfit for public discourse. In 1987 Gary Hart opened
politicians to questions about extramarital sexual affairs. Clinton
survived weeks of questions during the 1992 campaign about his
relationship with Gennifer Flowers. He finally quieted them with a
qualified confessional on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone contemplating a run for public office must weigh the
prospect that his or her morality will be debated on cable
television by sex therapists, jury consultants and dime-store
philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching some of these press briefings over the past weeks,
you get the idea that nothing is sacred after all,'' Silbey said.
``That's the longest-lasting impact of all. Nothing is out of the
arena of discussion, and maybe some things should be.''

HOOPLA FOR CLINTON IS MUTED IN HAMPTONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ The Hamptons didn't exactly offer President
Clinton a red carpet and a clamorous ovation this weekend. The
greeting was more confused than that, more complicated, muted.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there were the high-profile parties, being thrown by the
likes of the investment banker Bruce Wasserstein and the actors
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, where the president is expected to
raise some $2 million for the Democratic National Committee. And
there was the hospitality of Steven Spielberg, who offered his
Georgica Pond estate to the president and first lady, arguably as
desirable a place to spend the night as the Lincoln bedroom. But
those were the celebrities and big-money folks who give the
Hamptons their reputation and cachet. The ordinary affluent
weekenders who give the Hamptons their crowds and soaring
real-estate prices, and the year-rounders, who generally can't wait
for September, responded with a more layered enthusiasm. Glamour
and power are no big deal here, after all; they come with the
territory. Hence: no bunting. No yahoos waving flags and wearing
campaign hats.
</P>
<P>
   For a party, The Barefoot Contessa, a gourmet food market in
East Hampton, baked about 80 vanilla cupcakes with American flags
done in marzipan. Amagansett, a smaller town, put on a more
patriotic display, welcoming the president's motorcade Saturday
morning with flags lining Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest welcoming sign was on the side of the Stephen
Talkhouse, a music club in Amagansett, where Jefferson Starship, a
band from the era when Clinton was not inhaling marijuana, played
on Friday night. The enormous sign, on behalf of a 17-year-old chef
at the club, Eiji Shiga, read: ``Welcome Bill and Hillary, Please
help keep our friend, Eiji, out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiga, who is awaiting sentencing for a series of robberies, is
a well-spoken young man who admits he deserves to go to prison but
who hopes for a lenient sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he'll see the sign, say, `What's up with that?' and stop
in,'' Shiga said of the president, with a hopeful grin.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people expressed their lack of interest by not showing
up this weekend at all, fearful, perhaps, of a traffic nightmare or
maybe dissuaded by showers on Friday morning. But whatever the
reason, Route 27, the main east-west road through the South Fork of
Long Island, was uncharacteristically unclogged all day Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was the site of the Basinger-Baldwin and Wasserstein
bashes, as well as the president's weekend radio address,
Amagansett, which is generally sleepy to begin with, never really
woke up. And maybe most amazing, downtown East Hampton and Sag
Harbor, ordinarily mobbed with shoppers, have both been reasonably
navigable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only time I ever got a parking space in front of
the Red Horse Market,'' said Tara Newman, a year-round resident of
Sag Harbor, referring to another gourmet food store in East
Hampton, ``Even in the winter you can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no place is so inured to glitz and indulgence that
the president fails to make an impression. By the time he arrived,
the rumors of where he would eat (the Bridgehampton Cafe?), golf
(the Atlantic Golf Club?) and shop (Newtown Lane?) had been
circulating for days.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, when he arrived at East Hampton Airport by
helicopter from Westhampton (where Air Force One had landed), a
crowd of maybe 200 people had pulled their cars off Route 27 and
waited for a glimpse of him as his motorcade made its way to
Spielberg's house.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   It was an amused gathering on the side of the road, including
Michael Silberkleit, the publisher of Archie Comics, whose wife,
Nancy, wore an oversized Archie head; Corey Watson, a college
student from California working as a pool man for the summer who
held up a small sign that said ``Legalize Marijuana''; and the
housekeeping and maintenance staff of the financier Ronald
Perelman, whose driveway opens on to the motorcade route. Perelman
himself passed on the parade; he is in Europe, his staff members
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, in restaurants, it was easy to overhear the
conversations about Clinton, his sex life and whether he lied about
it and encouraged others to do so. And here, as elsewhere, there
was both titillation and shame, as people argued over what the
president's strategy should be or would be when he testifies for
the grand jury later this month. Apologize to his wife and family
and the American public and ask for understanding? Or deny, deny,
deny?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said, even if she catches you in bed with the
sheets down, say, `Honey, you got it wrong,' '' said Derek Ford,
who may or may not have been joking. ``It's very hard to say, if
you're a man in a powerful position, to say `no, no, no' to all the
opportunities,'' said Ford, who owns a chain of women's clothing
stores in Canada and was visiting the Hamptons with his wife and
teen-age daughter. ``I've been married four times for that
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Racy speculations over what went on between the president and
Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern, often led to
head-shaking lamentations over the fact that alleged sex acts and a
dress that may have semen stains have become the focus of a special
prosecutor investigating the nation's chief executive, not to
mention the focus of the nation's discourse. And poor Hillary! Poor
Chelsea!
</P>
<P>
   For many the issue is not whether there was sex play in the
White House, but whether it matters. Is Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, a symbol of the democratic system or simply a
zealot?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous, it's sexual McCarthyism,'' said David
Oestreich, a New York City businessman who was a house guest in
East Hampton. ``It occurred to me recently that maybe there's some
entrapment involved here. Why is she keeping all that stuff? Is
that a normal thing?''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite view was expressed on a roadside billboard in front
of the Southampton Full Gospel Church, where each week a line of
scripture is posted for the benefit of weekenders arriving in the
Hamptons on Route 27. This week's selection is from Hebrews:
``Whoremongers and adulterers, God will judge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sign is an indication of the moral quality of our
society,'' said the Rev. Donald Havrilla, the leader of the
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the sign was discourteous to an important visitor,
Havrilla replied: ``We all live on our reputations. Religious
leaders have a responsibility to weigh in on Clinton's behavior,
and from what I've seen I'm not impressed. If the shoe fits, he
should wear it. If not, then it shouldn't bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, perhaps, at the Amagansett Fire House, where the
president delivered his weekly radio address Saturday morning, that
the prevailing local attitude toward the weekend was best
expressed. There, on Friday evening, the department's second
assistant chief, Kent Howie, was placing black patches embroidered
with the company insignia, normally for shirt sleeves, on the
department's red flag. The flag was supposed to hang on the wall
behind the president, but there were stains on it.
</P>
<P>
   Howie couldn't say he was a political supporter of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's still the most powerful man in the world,'' Howie
said. ``And we're glad to have him here.''

   The 1990s were supposed to be lean years for graduates of the
nation's top business schools. Overpriced, overabundant and
caricatured in movies like ``Working Girl,'' MBAs were destined for
the same fate as junk bonds and Manhattan real estate _ or so
business school deans and business journalists predicted at the
start of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Seven fat years later, MBAs have never been more numerous _ or
more in demand. At schools in the top tier, variously defined as
the top 5, 10 or 25, recruiting by companies has turned cutthroat.
The typical University of Chicago graduate turns down so many job
offers that the dean's main worry has become ``dealing with all the
disappointed companies.'' And the salaries of MBAs have climbed
even faster in the 1990s than in the so-called Decade of Greed. The
first-year pay packages of Stanford graduates, for example, have
soared 62 percent after inflation in the 1990s, compared with 21
percent for the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The ferocious competition for top MBAs reflects the best economy
since the 1960s, specifically a surge in businesses that advise
companies on new products, acquisitions or overseas expansion. It
also reflects the long-term shift of pay and opportunity in today's
service economy toward those with knowledge and ideas. More than
anything, though, it is a sign of the extraordinary degree to which
the term MBA has become synonymous with raw business talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to find the best people you can, and business
schools happen to be accumulating them,'' said William Matassoni, a
partner for communications at the consulting firm McKinsey &AMP; Co.,
which expects to hire more than 400 MBAs this year. ``So you go
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The median offer this year for a new Stanford MBA, for example,
was $120,000, more than double the first-year salary at the peak of
the '80s, and more than five times the 1978 figure. Inflation has
been 142 percent over that period.
</P>
<P>
   And Stanford does not boast graduates with the highest earnings.
East Coast schools whose graduates are more likely to wind up in
high-cost, high-pay cities like New York and Boston report even
loftier starting pay. Half the graduates of the Wharton School of
the University of Pennsylvania received offers of more than
$133,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the top 25 schools, the best compensation packages offered to
new MBAs are well above $200,000. Small wonder that more of the
best and the brightest are headed to business school instead of law
school. A graduate of New York University Law School who joins a
leading firm will make $91,000 a year, not precisely peanuts but
nearly $30,000 less than a counterpart from the university's Stern
School of Business. At Stanford, law school and business school
graduates were neck and neck in starting pay in 1978 and in 1988,
but the school's new MBAs are making 50 percent more than its law
graduates this year.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the pay surge all the more noteworthy is that an MBA
has become something of a commodity. In 1965, fewer than 10,000
were granted. As recently as 1977, when graduates of top programs
were grabbing headlines with $22,000 starting salaries, the nation
was producing 48,000 MBAs a year _ a figure sufficiently alarming
to prompt Lawrence Fouraker, the dean of the Harvard Business
School, to predict a collapse in starting salaries. Since then, the
number has nearly doubled to 94,000, almost two and a half times
the number of law degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer volume of MBAs is deceptive, though. The graduating
classes of elite schools _ the ones being plied with six-figure
offers _ have grown little. The explosion has happened among the
more than 600 programs that do not make it into the top 25
nationally ranked schools, where the McKinsey consultants and
Goldman, Sachs bankers do their recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the degrees are awarded to part-timers who stay on
the job, who tend to be subsidized by their employers and who are
looking to change career tracks or move into middle management.
More than a fifth are getting degrees to start businesses,
according to a recent survey by the Graduate Management Admission
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Starting salaries for the mass of MBAs have hardly climbed into
the stratosphere. This year, the typical MBA with some work
experience will earn almost $60,000, compared with a salary of
$25,000 in 1980, or the equivalent of $49,000 in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, MBA pay packages are swelling not just from
higher base salaries but a clutch of extras. A typical offer from
an investment bank consists of a $75,000 base salary, a $25,000
``stub year bonus'' for the rest of 1998, and $30,000 more in
signing and moving money. Other companies lure recruits with
second-year tuition, ``settling in'' allowances equal to half a
month's salary and other goodies like forgivable loans.
High-technology companies and venture capital firms _ the trendiest
destinations _ are handing out stock options and equity stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consulting pays better in cash,'' says Mark D. Homan, 30, a
graduate of the Kellogg School at Northwestern University in
Evanston, Ill., who will receive stock options at Cisco Systems,
the networking giant. ``But if you hit the right high-tech company,
you can make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the risk, not to mention the workload, is often
commensurate with the rewards. The typical tenure on first jobs in
consulting, investment banking and some of the faster-growing
high-technology fields is less than three years. ``The salary
number doesn't tell the whole story,'' said Robert Hamada, dean of
the business school at the University of Chicago. ``How many fall
off the ladder? How many work 80 hours a week?''

</P>
<P>
   Mainly, companies are looking for something that is notoriously
difficult, and thus expensive, to identify: raw business talent.
</P>
<P>
   It has never been tougher to get into a top school. Applications
have soared since the early 1990s by as much as 25 percent at
Harvard and 89 percent at Wharton. To fill a class of 383, Stanford
sifted through 6,336 applications. Twenty years ago, the ratio of
applicants to class seats was half as big. Test scores are higher,
and top schools can pick people who are exceptional in other ways.
Harvard, for example, is known for choosing Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Today's MBAs don't just test better; they are road-tested. In
the 1970s and '80s, employers complained that MBAs lacked the
experience or wisdom to handle mid-level management jobs. ``We're
not talking about wet-behind-the-ears youngsters,'' says Karen Dowd
of Brecker &AMP; Merryman, a human resources consulting company. ``Now
MBAs are 30 years old, have a minimum of four years' work
experience. Thirty percent are married.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian Barry, 31, a graduate of Northwestern's Kellogg
school, is exactly the kind of seasoned recruit that McKinsey &AMP; Co.
favors. After earning a bachelor's degree in operations research
and industrial engineering from Cornell, Barry spent six years as a
lieutenant in the Navy's nuclear submarine fleet, showing
leadership qualities. Four-month stretches at sea demonstrated his
capacity for teamwork and personal sacrifice. A successful summer
internship at Marakon Associates, a consulting firm in Stamford,
Conn., suggested that he knows what to expect from a consultant's
peripatetic life.
</P>
<P>
   And MBAs from top schools, like Kellogg, have made an enormous
financial commitment. Tuition at these business programs is $25,000
a year for two years, five times the average for state schools;
books, computers and software account for a few thousand dollars
more. The biggest expense, though, is lost earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Catie McCreary, 33, a University of Chicago graduate
who received a fistful of offers from manufacturers and consulting
firms. Like more and more new MBAs, Ms. McCreary walked away from a
fast-track job, hers in the booming fresh vegetable packaging
business that paid in the high five figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father almost had a heart attack,'' she said, ``but my
decision was based on what I wanted five, 10 years out.'' While her
friends were buying houses, Ms. McCreary poured the $50,000 she had
saved into tuition. Thanks to that nest egg, she graduated with
just $30,000 in student loans; many of her classmates have two to
three times as much debt.
</P>
<P>
   Snaring the best MBAs is just as vital for some businesses, like
consulting and investment banking, as attracting customers or
capital for other enterprises. Consulting, a field with annual
growth in the double digits, sucks up a third of the graduates of
top schools like Wharton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take someone out to develop a business strategy for
a global organization that doesn't have an MBA from a top school,''
said Jeanie Mabie, head of recruiting for Price Waterhouse Coopers,
the accounting and consulting firm. Price Waterhouse hired nearly
250 MBAs from 25 top schools this year. Consultants at such
concerns start at $125,000 and often make two to three times that
amount by their third year.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects are causing some to change careers. Mike Lynch,
33, an MBA from the University of Chicago, joined the Boston
Consulting Group in March. A tenured professor in audiology and
speech at Purdue University, he figured that he could apply the
same analytical and communications skills that won him tenure and
research grants to better effect. His brother, who went to
Dartmouth's business school and then to Andersen Consulting, gave
him the idea. ``I'd have been a full professor for 40 years,''
Lynch said, explaining his decision to change careers. ``There
wasn't enough new stuff that was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a year or two, he expects to be making three times what
he was at Purdue _ and seeing more of the world than West
Lafayette, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the MBA boom won't last forever. After the stock
market crash of 1987 and during the slow economic growth of the
early 1990s, job offers shriveled and starting salaries flattened
out. For now, though, MBAs get to write their own tickets. When
trying to decide between competing job offers, Barry created what
he calls a ``discounted happiness flow model'' on his computer. He
assigned a weight of just 7 percent to compensation, 15 percent to
``interesting co-workers'' and 12 percent to location, among other
criteria. ``The market is so good,'' he says, ``that you can afford
to ask: What do I want?''

NEW OPPONENT TO HOFFA TRIES FOR THE REFORM VOTE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Mich., Ore., Mo., Fla., Calif., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ At first glance, Tom Leedham's race for the
Teamsters' presidency appears pretty far-fetched. So much seems
stacked against him.
</P>
<P>
   He is not nearly as well-known as James Hoffa, his opponent with
the famous name and famous father. And his campaign apparatus and
treasury pale in comparison with Hoffa's.
</P>
<P>
   Leedham is such a relative unknown that when he campaigned in
front of the United Parcel Service depot here last week as the
morning mist lifted, many workers brushed right past him, paying
him little heed.
</P>
<P>
   But Leedham's biggest problem may be trying to cast himself as
the candidate of the reform wing of the union. After all, Leedham
was a lieutenant of Ron Carey, the Teamsters' disgraced, recently
expelled president.
</P>
<P>
   He still insists that he should not be counted out. Noting that
Carey was also a long shot when he first won the presidency in
1991, Leedham asserts that he can beat Hoffa, son of the late union
leader who disappeared in 1975, by rallying the Teamsters' reform
wing when the union's 1.4 million members vote this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The race is a face-off between two very different men who would
take the union in very different directions. Leedham, whose power
base is an outspoken group of Teamsters who have struggled for
years to fight corruption and increase democracy in the union,
pledges to encourage rank-and-file participation as a way of making
the Teamsters more powerful and more responsive.
</P>
<P>
   The race also includes a third lesser-known candidate, John
Metz, a Carey ally who heads a St. Louis local and the union's
public employees division. Hoffa said he expected to win easily,
predicting his opponents would split the votes from the Carey wing.
But Leedham insists that Metz will win few votes.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's main message is to restore the union's clout of old by
unifying its fractured membership, by seeking to bring Carey
supporters together with the scores of longtime leaders of Teamster
locals that form his power base. It is a group the Leedham forces
deride as a corrupt old guard.
</P>
<P>
   Leedham, a trim 47-year-old who worked for years as a
warehouseman, argues that the stakes could not be higher in the
race to head one of the nation's biggest, most powerful unions. If
Hoffa wins, Leedham said, the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters will return to its dark days when it was synonymous with
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts of the Carey wing to change the union over the
last seven years are also at stake. Already, some former Carey
supporters, wanting to be on the winning side, have endorsed Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win,'' Leedham said at a truckers' diner.
``We're getting a terrific response all across the country. We've
got a terrific grass-roots campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, a labor lawyer in Detroit, belittles his opponent's
chances and, in light of Leedham's close ties to Carey, takes
umbrage at Leedham's efforts to style himself as the
anti-corruption candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has absolutely no credibility with the members in that he
has failed to repudiate Ron Carey,'' Hoffa said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to turn his relative anonymity into a virtue, Leedham
insists that Hoffa's famed name might not be such a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a name that's a two-edged sword,'' said Leedham, who has
long headed a 4,000-member Teamsters local in Portland, Ore., in
addition to heading the warehouse division since his appointment by
Carey. ``To Teamsters I'm talking to, that name speaks to weakness
and corruption. It reminds them of the days of back-room deals and
sweetheart contracts. It reminds them of the days our pension fund
was referred to as the mob's bank.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some workers warmed to Leedham's message during two days of
16-hour-a-day campaigning in which he visited a truck depot in
Greensboro at 4 a.m. and shook hands at the UPS hub here at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the UPS center, two candidates on Leedham's slate and
two UPS workers distributed yellow flyers while the candidate,
dressed in a blue polo shirt, sought to shake hands and chat with
everyone entering the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Using retail politics little different from those of a
gubernatorial candidate, he told the workers: ``I'm Tom Leedham.
I'm running for general president of the Teamsters. I'm running
against Hoffa Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   One worker, dressed in UPS's signature brown uniform, walked
past, accepting a flier but too rushed to chat. A muscular
part-time sorter and loader stopped, gave him a heart-felt
handshake, said, ``You're my man,'' and agreed to wear a Leedham
campaign button inside the depot.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hovelson, a 34-year-old loader with the nickname of Pit
Bull, was swayed by Leedham. ``He has the experience,'' Hovelson
said. ``He's also a reformer who wants to keep the mob out and the
old guard out. Hoffa's going to bring the old guard back in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoffa forces say it is hypocritical for Leedham's supporters
to suggest that their candidate is corrupt when Leedham was so
closely tied to Carey. This week a court-appointed oversight board
expelled Carey because he had failed to stop a scheme, engineered
by several aides, in which the union gave $885,000 to liberal
groups and in exchange contributors to those groups donated
$221,000 to Carey's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carey defeated Hoffa 52 percent to 48 percent in that race, but
his victory was thrown out because of the financing scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pressure from Hoffa, Leedham refuses to repudiate the
ousted president. ``I've already said that I don't agree with the
wrongdoing on either side,'' Leedham said. ``I have no intention of
repudiating the kind of rank-and-file programs that led to the
victory in last year's UPS strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Leedham said there was a double standard for the oversight board
to expel Carey but not Hoffa. Last spring, a federal monitor found
that Hoffa had lied under oath and deliberately misreported
campaign contributions. Hoffa denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's supporters predict their man will run strongest in the
Midwest and in freight, the region and the division where his
father was king. Hoffa also voiced confidence that he would win
because several prominent Carey allies in Tampa, Los Angeles and
New York have recently endorsed him. One of them is Carl Haynes,
president of a New York City local, which, with 24,000 members, is
the Teamsters' largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most important thing is for the divisions in the
union to be eliminated and to take care of its financial situation
so we can fight our battles,'' Haynes said. ``I think Hoffa has a
better opportunity of achieving that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leedham's backers predict he will do best in the warehouse
division and in Carey's base, the 185,000 drivers, sorters and
loaders at UPS. Leedham is relying heavily on Teamsters for a
Democratic Union, a Detroit-based group that was crucial to Carey's
1991 and 1996 victories. More than 1,000 of that group's members
are distributing pro-Leedham literature, and Leedham hopes their
politicking outweighs the endorsements Hoffa received from local
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leedham calls for rank-and-file power so it's a natural that
the reform movement is backing him,'' said Ken Paff, national
coordinator of Teamsters for a Democratic Union. ``Hoffa's about
power for the officials and their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Leedham is relying on small donations from Teamsters, and as he
crisscrosses the country, he sleeps and eats at members' homes and
is driven around by Teamsters who take vacation days to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the warehouse division, Leedham pressured C&AMP;S, a
large warehousing company, to agree not to oppose unionization
efforts. He arranged for the first nationwide contract for the many
warehouses of the Kroger supermarket chain, although Hoffa attacked
that agreement as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Leedham has enlisted Teamsters at most warehouses
to survey members about what they want in future contracts _ all
part of his strategy to involve the membership. In his view, the
more active members are, the more democratic, the less corrupt the
union will be and the better they will hold together during
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me my goal in 10 years,'' he said, ``I would like
to have a union where when you ask Teamster members, they'll tell
you they belong to an honest, democratic union.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am probably responsible for the odd fact that people don't
seem to name their daughters Lolita anymore,'' Vladimir Nabokov
once said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita'' is Nabokov's story of Humbert Humbert, a 36-year-old
man, and his doomed obsession with a 12-year-old girl. Few literary
creations have entered the popular imagination in the same way
``Lolita'' has.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the idea of Lolita, defined by the American Heritage
Dictionary as ``a seductive adolescent girl,'' should be passe.
After all, if they were made flesh, Humbert and Lolita would not
seem out of place on ``The Jerry Springer Show.'' There, under the
hot lights, Humbert would slump in his chair, alternately sullen
and importuning, while Lolita, peevish and out of control, would be
restrained by stagehands as she seethed about how Humbert done her
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Nabokov's ``Lolita,'' or at least what people think of when
they think of Lolita, continues to disturb. Sunday night, a new
R-rated movie version, starring Jeremy Irons and directed by Adrian
Lyne, will have its American premiere on Showtime cable television.
It will open in theaters next month.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Cincinnati-based National Coalition for the
Protection of Children and Families urged Showtime not to broadcast
the movie, but the network declined to cancel it. ``This film will
increase child molestation and have a harmful effect on pedophiles
and healthy men,'' said Jerry Kirk, the group's president.
</P>
<P>
   Like the novel, the new movie almost didn't reach the public.
Nabokov's novel, completed in 1953, was rejected by five American
publishers for fear of being prosecuted for obscenity, before it
was published in Paris in 1955 and in New York in 1958 by G.P.
Putnam's Sons.
</P>
<P>
   The movie languished for more than a year, its distributors
deciding on only a limited release in Europe, which was absorbed by
pedophilia scandals in Belgium last year. Similarly, American film
distributors, worried that the subject matter would be box-office
poison, rejected the movie until Showtime, in search of
high-profile programming, picked it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nabokov did not write Lolita to gain sympathy for
pedophiles,'' said Alfred Appel Jr., editor of ``The Annotated
Lolita'' (Vintage, 1991). ``Lolita is not about pornography. It's
about a crippling obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   But what also disturbs is that Humbert is recognizably human,
said the novelist Martin Amis, who wrote an article in the Atlantic
Monthly on ``Lolita'' in 1992. His obsession shocks, Amis said,
because it is the failing of a human being, and not that of a
monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of hidden sexuality in a child is a haunting one,''
he said. ``It is something that some part of us wants to see, but
another part of us never wants to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Tricky on the page, ``Lolita'' is even trickier on screen. The
book was first adapted to film in 1962 by Stanley Kubrick, who
complained later that he had not anticipated the intensity of
studio censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The movie eventually became more chaste, with Humbert becoming
older and less vigorous in the person of 52-year-old James Mason,
who never kisses Lolita. At the same time, Kubrick made Lolita more
lurid _ and a teen-ager _ in the person of 15-year-old bikini-clad,
lollipop-licking Sue Lyon.
</P>
<P>
   The lurid stuck. When people think of Lolita, they think of that
sexually aggressive teen-ager, not Nabokov. The latest movie
version hews closer to the book, but any depiction of sex with a
child, unfiltered by Nabokov's ironic prose, is shocking. Lyne's
Lolita, Dominique Swain, who was 15 at the time of filming, is made
to look, with pigtails, like a 12-year-old.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After a screening of ``Lolita'' earlier this year, the movie's
screenwriter, Stephen Schiff, was startled when a woman blithely
said to him, ``I guess you called her Lolita because she was really
kind of a Lolita, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Today there seem to be so many real-life counterparts to Humbert
and his ``Lo'' (full name: Dolores Haze), ranging from the
buffoonish to the discomforting to the horrifying: Amy Fisher and
Joey Buttafuoco, Soon-Yi Previn and Woody Allen, JonBenet Ramsey
and her murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Coontz, author of ``The Way We Really Are: Coming to
Terms With America's Changing Families'' (Basic Books, 1997), said
earlier Americans held views about children and sexuality that
would be disturbing today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1889, the age of female consent was 10 in 14 states,
including Alabama and New Jersey, and as young as 7 in Delaware.
Campaigns led by early feminists helped raise the age to 18, she
said. ``In a way, however, innocence then became eroticized,'' Ms.
Coontz said. ``Lack of experience, innocence, became the ideal for
the marriageable woman. But what is the ultimate lack of
experience, if not the prepubescent?''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Postman, who wrote ``The Disappearance of Childhood''
(Vintage, 1994), said ``Lolita'' is disturbing for a far deeper
reason; childhood, as an age of protection from adult secrets, is
fast disappearing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the new technologies, television being at the forefront,
there are fewer and fewer secrets _ medical secrets, sexual
secrets, political secrets,'' Postman said. ``Adults used to reveal
secrets to you, the child, in stages, in school, in books. When you
knew all the secrets, you become an adult. But now all of that is
available on the Internet or TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as society has become more tolerant of sexual matters,
including adultery and homosexuality as well as teen-age sex, it
has become less tolerant of anything that hints of adult sex with
preteen children, said Paula Fass, author of ``Kidnapped: Child
Abduction in America'' (Oxford University, 1997). ``We've become a
society obsessed by, haunted by, sex with children,'' she said.
``I, as a parent and citizen, want our children protected, but now
any kind of adult love or attention paid to children is immediately
suspect.''

<P>
   For Schiff, it was easy to keep the novel's late 1940s period
for the movie. ``I didn't set Lolita in contemporary times for a
simple reason,'' he said. ``It would be absurd. Parents today would
be looking for Humbert Humbert everywhere.''

U.S. DELEGATION STRESSES HUMAN RIGHTS IN INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With U.S. officials warning that Indonesia
is on the verge of economic and social collapse, a Clinton
administration delegation led by Defense Secretary William Cohen
called on Indonesia's new president and military commanders
Saturday to honor their pledge to end human rights abuses and show
restraint if government opponents take to the streets again.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Indonesia
since President Suharto was forced to resign last May after 32
years in power. He said that the country, the world's fourth-most
populous, was in the midst of a crisis and that he had urged its
leaders to move quickly ``toward a democratic form of government.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense secretary described his meetings here with President
B.J. Habibie, Suharto's former vice president and his successor,
and Gen. Wiranto, the military commander, as ``very open, very
candid.'' He said he was encouraged by their response. Habibie, he
said, ``indicated his strong commitment to place human rights at a
very high level of concern and his commitment to the people of
Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 people were killed in May in the rioting that
led to Suharto's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Suharto era did not halt the staggering economic
slide of Indonesia, which now faces its worst economic crisis in
decades. An estimated 100 million people _ about half of the
population _ are expected to sink below the poverty line by the end
of the year. The crisis has wiped out 30 years of impressive
economic growth. Malnutrition is widespread and growing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that Cohen and senior U.S. military
commanders were sent to Indonesia last week in hopes that such a
high-level visit would impress the country's military. As the
strongest government institution in Indonesia, it may hold the key
to the future of this sprawling archipelago nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ties in recent years between U.S. and Indonesian military
commanders have been close _ far too close, according to rights
groups in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has been embarrassed by reports that an elite
U.S.-trained Indonesian military unit was responsible for some of
the killings in May, as well as the kidnappings of democracy
activists who have still not been found.
</P>
<P>
   The special forces unit, known as Kopassus, was led at the time
of the riots by Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto
who is known to be especially close to his American military
counterparts. Prabowo has since been demoted by Wiranto, his
military rival.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen held a news conference at the Defense Ministry after
meeting here with Wiranto (who like many Indonesians uses only one
name). The defense secretary said he had urged the Indonesian
commander to press forward with investigations of the military's
responsibility for the recent violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know that the Indonesian government has a number of
investigations under way in terms of any abuses of human rights,''
Cohen said. ``It's important that such investigations be carried
out openly, honestly, with integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States suspended most of its ties to the Indonesian
military as a result of the uprising in May. Yet despite the
allegations that U.S.-trained troops might have been responsible
for some of the worst of the violence, Cohen said the United States
hoped to ``build upon a military relationship in the future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other U.S. officials here said the Defense Department had
determined that even if U.S.-trained soldiers had committed some of
the murders, the United States should continue to work with the
military, to maintain influence over what happens next. Indonesia
is considered important to U.S. economic and strategic interests in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that ``we
want to find out whether American-trained forces were involved, but
we don't begin from the proposition that even if they were, that
somehow means that the training programs were wrong.'' He said it
was ``wrong to damn the whole program simply'' because of the
actions of a fraction of its graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Saturday that the Indonesian military decision to
withdraw some combat troops from East Timor was also ``very
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie has vowed to find ways of providing greater autonomy to
East Timor, the former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in
1975 and annexed in 1976. The disputed territory has been the scene
of fierce fighting between the Indonesian military and separatists,
and troops have repeatedly been accused of rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Indonesian army began the withdrawal of 1,000
fighters from East Timor in what it said was a gesture of good
will. Its force of soldiers and police officers there numbers about
11,000.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe thunderstorms with 1-inch-diameter hail and violent winds
damaged cars and hotel buildings at the Walt Disney World Complex
near Orlando, Fla., on Friday evening. The thunderstorms were
ignited by colliding sea breezes over the Florida peninsula. A
tenacious cold front will push into central Florida on Sunday,
increasing the likelihood for strong thunderstorms with drenching
rain, gusty winds and hail.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the cold front, ample sun and refreshingly cool air for
the season will infiltrate the Carolinas and Georgia. Autumnlike
humidity levels will allow overnight lows to fall into the 60s. The
exception will be along the immediate coast, where clouds and a few
showers will occur.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, sunshine and low humidity will also grace the
Northeast and eastern Great Lakes, though a cold front will support
clouds and a few showers in northern Maine and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds will increase in the western Great Lakes as a warm front
approaches from the west. Closer to the front, clusters of
thunderstorms will develop from Montana to Arkansas. Thunderstorms
will also develop near the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the Florida
panhandle as sea breezes lift torrid air. Blistering heat will
torment the Southern Plains again Sunday as high pressure aloft
suppresses showers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered heavy thunder will develop in the Rockies
and intermountain West on Sunday afternoon as monsoon breezes
continue. Heat will build in the Pacific Northwest while California
remains seasonably warm with only a few areas of coastal fog.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Private Heat
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of July, Dodge City, Kan., measured a record low
afternoon temperature of 75 degrees. At the same time, just 400
miles to the southeast in Dallas, a record high was tied at 106
degrees, one of only a few record maximums this summer in the city.
Unlike previous summer heat waves, which often affect large
sections of the nation, the Texas heat wave of 1998 has been
intense, but confined. Indeed, most of the northern half of the
Plains, Middle West and Great Lakes has averaged near or below
seasonal temperatures in July, leaving the western Gulf region in a
private heat spell.

GROWTH IN THE ANGLICAN CHURCH COMES LARGELY FROM AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTERBURY, England _ As the world's Anglican bishops are
gathered in this historic cathedral city for their once-a-decade
meeting, the Lambeth Conference, a major trend can be discerned
among the lists of those invited to attend.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since these conferences began 130 years ago,
the bishops who are heads of dioceses in the Church of England, the
Episcopal Church and the Anglican Churches of Canada and Australia
_ which historically sent missionaries abroad _ are outnumbered by
their counterparts from the Anglican churches of Africa and Asia,
the continents to which so many of those missionaries were sent.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sign of something larger, say some bishops and academic
experts who study religious trends, that among the 37 churches that
make up the Anglican Communion (and within other branches of
Christianity as well), the center of gravity is gradually shifting
toward the Southern Hemisphere. The faith there is growing rapidly,
while many churches in North America and Europe increase slowly or
even decline.
</P>
<P>
   Within Anglicanism, ``the growth takes place mostly in the
south, in the developing churches,'' said Bishop Simon Chiwanga, a
leading prelate at the conference, who is head of the Diocese of
Mpwapwa, in east central Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   When his diocese was created out of a larger church jurisdiction
in 1991, it contained 93,000 members of the Church of the Province
of Tanzania, the Anglican church there. But since then, he said,
his flock has increased to about 120,000 _ a figure greater than
the number of Episcopalians in New York City and northern New
Jersey combined.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with their increased numbers, the bishops from Africa
and Asia have helped set the tone of discussions at this year's
conference, which might be described as economically liberal and
socially conservative.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, for example, has expressed deep concern over
foreign debts carried by developing nations, declaring that these
impose a financial burden that keep poor countries mired in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some African bishops have sided with church
conservatives against any attempt by liberal bishops from the
United States and Europe to adopt a more welcoming stance toward
homosexuals in the church.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 800 bishops are attending the conference, some of
them assistant bishops and others suffragan bishops, or
bishops-elect.
</P>
<P>
   The three-week gathering, a purely consultative affair that ends
on Aug. 9, is being held at the University of Kent, a complex of
modern beige-colored buildings atop a hill with a sweeping view of
Canterbury's skyline and its massive cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   This city _ popularly associated with Chaucer's pilgrims and
their goal, the shrine to Thomas a Beckett _ is the seat of the
archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual leader of the Church of
England, an independent religious body since King Henry VIII broke
with Rome in the 1530s. Within the Anglican Communion, the
archbishop, the Most Rev. George Carey, lacks the power and
prestige of a pope, but does possess a degree of mystical authority
as a ``unifying symbol'' for the various Anglican churches.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1978, a majority of the world's Anglican population
lived in Britain, said David Barrett, a professor at Regent
University in Virginia Beach, Va., who is editor of the World
Christian Encyclopedia, a compendium of statistics about churches
around the globe. But today, he estimated, the British constitute
only about 35 percent of 73 million Anglicans worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett distributed a pamphlet to the bishops at the conference,
projecting that by the year 2000, Anglicans would number 31.6
million in Africa and 6.1 million in Asia. By contrast, the Church
of England estimates its current baptized membership at 26 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is,'' Barrett said, the Anglican population is
increasing in Africa and Asia ``while in Britain, it's declining
very slightly.'' He added that similar growth patterns prevail
among Roman Catholics, Baptists, Methodists and Pentecostals and
many independent churches.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Vatican statistics, between 1976 and 1995, the
Roman Catholic population in Africa more than doubled to 107
million, while Catholics in Asia increased by 90 percent, to 101
million. Europe's Catholic population grew by less than 10 percent,
to 288 million, according to those statistics.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree, those changes have been reflected in the College of
Cardinals, the body that chooses the popes. In the 20 years since
the election of Pope John Paul II, the proportion of European
cardinals in the college has declined from 50 percent to 46
percent, while the cardinals from Africa, Asia and Latin America,
taken together, have risen from 36 percent to 41 percent of the
total, according to figures in an analysis of the college by the
Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine ``America.''
</P>
<P>
   For some years now, Vatican-watchers have included cardinals
from outside Europe on their short lists of possible candidates for
the next pope. Recently, a similar idea was raised, albeit
obliquely, about the next archbishop of Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents available for study here at the Lambeth
Conference is one known as ``The Virginia Report,'' a consideration
of the nature of the Anglican Communion, written by theologians and
church leaders. Among the questions it raises is, ``Does an
archbishop of Canterbury necessarily have to be a member of the
Church of England?''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have studied the phenomenon of church growth in
developing nations, whether church leaders or academics, offer a
variety of reasons for it. The churches, they say, are benefiting
from general population growth trends, the desire of people
migrating to cities for a sense of community, the attraction of
church-run school and hospital systems, and the comfort of services
that practice forms of spiritual healing.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Khotso Makhulu of Botswana, another leading
figure at the conference, said many Christian churches had grown as
they had adopted African forms of worship, incorporating music and
dance into their liturgies. ``The church in many areas is moving
away from staid and bland expressions of Christianity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big day in the past would have been pretty well a solemn
high Mass Western-style, with Gregorian chant and plainsong,'' he
said. ``Now what is happening is musicologists are coming to the
fore, writing African hymns.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, he added, is rooted in local cultural expression:
``It's an affirmation of who I am before my God and the world.''

ROAD TO SEAT AT U.N. IS PAVED WITH PERKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ It is election season at the United Nations,
and campaign-finance reform provokes even less enthusiasm than it
has in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for one of the five seats up for election each year
on the Security Council has brought some imaginative gestures by
some of the 185 U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, when Sweden was pitching hard for a seat,
a staid diplomatic dinner party at the elegant New York town house
of Consul General Dag Sebastian Ahlander was interrupted by a blast
of saxophones from the pantry. A band just off the plane from
Stockholm _ all women, in black leather _ burst into the dining
room to jazz up the evening.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the year when Portugal put on an extravagant food
festival _ and a lot of diplomats and officials from Third World
nations got trips to Japan and Japanese watches. ``Overkill,'' one
diplomat called it, since Japan was already favored to beat India
in a contest for an Asian seat. Japan, as well as Sweden and
Portugal, were elected.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Greece turned the heads of even blase diplomats.
Competing for a seat against the Netherlands and Canada, two rather
more restrained nations, Greece invited U.N. delegates on a trip to
look over some Olympic sites, hear about a plan for declaring an
international truce to mark the 2004 Olympic games, which will take
place in Greece, and then relax on an Aegean cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitri Gemelos, a spokesman for the Greek Mission to the United
Nations, insists that the trips _ there were two, because more than
120 diplomats and relatives accepted the invitation _ were not
related to Greece's bid for a Security Council seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to convince people that it was not that, but most
people thought it was a campaign for candidacy of the Security
Council,'' he said. ``I do not see the correlation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has 15 members. Five permanent seats belong
to the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia. The 10
remaining places _ now held by Bahrain, Brazil, Costa Rica, Gabon,
Gambia, Japan, Kenya, Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden _ are filled by
elections in the General Assembly and rotate within regions: five
from Africa and Asia, one from Eastern Europe, two from Latin
America and the Caribbean and two from a hybrid group known as
``Western Europe and other.'' That includes New Zealand, Australia
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Australia and New Zealand really want to join the Asians, but
``Anglo-Saxons'' are not yet welcome in that club. Israel has not
been invited to join any group, and cannot hope to be elected to
the council any time soon. At least 75 other countries have never
held a seat.
</P>

   Rotating terms are for two years, with five seats surrendered
each year so that there is always an overlap. Asians have already
agreed that when voting takes place in the fall, Malaysia will take
the seat to be vacated by Japan. Argentina will replace Costa Rica.
Africans have chosen Namibia to replace Kenya.

<P>
   Europeans are much less disciplined about coming to an
agreement, said Robert Zaagman, first secretary at the Dutch
mission. They take the battle down to the wire.

<P>
   The Dutch had a cruise, too, but it was on the East River in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just talking about cruises,'' said Zaagman, whose
government has not sought a Security Council seat since the
mid-1980s, when the competition was not so intense. ``In general
the amount of high official time invested seems to have gone up a
bit. Now you see armadas of special envoys traveling around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Security Council has become much more active and much more
of a player since the paralysis of the Cold War ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, the Dutch have heard all the rumors about expensive
gifts changing hands and brown envelopes left in hotel rooms during
junkets. They like to think they can win election on their sober
record of good international works and do not need sweeteners.
``For us, giving cars or computers would never be part of the
deal,'' Zaagman said.
</P>
<P>
   Danilo Turk, Slovenia's representative, also said he noticed a
growing intensity in the competition for Security Council seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of competitiveness has been rising since 1992,'' he
said. ``A lot of campaigning is going on, and it takes a lot of
time and energy.'' Last year, Slovenia became the first of the
former Yugoslav republics to win a seat. Turk, a former professor
of international law, led the charge against Macedonia and Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the smaller nations get wistful about the way big
powers do not have to bother.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the comfortable situation of permanent members,'' Turk
said. ``Nonpermanent members have to work much harder.''

 ST. GEORGE'S, Granada: foreign investment.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think about Cuba a lot,'' said Vishnu Ramlogan, director of
the Tourism and Industrial Development Company of Trinidad and
Tobago, an official agency. (Castro is not visiting Trinidad.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of Cuba makes them a strong competitive force
and an important player in the region, in both tourism and
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trip, Castro has sought to calm such concerns about
his intentions. In a speech in Jamaica, he said Cuba sought the
``strengthening of links'' and the ``sharing of experiences'' with
its Caribbean neighbors, in order to develop ``multi-destinational
aspects of our main tourist resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Castro's itinerary during a six-day swing appears
intended to maximize his opportunities to play the role of
avuncular and benevolent regional elder statesman. On his first
stop, Jamaica, he visited the tomb of a former prime minister,
Michael Manley, who pursued a policy of friendship toward Cuba in
the 1970s that alarmed and alienated the United States. He even
paid tribute to a Jamaican child who recently won a spelling bee in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Barbados, Castro took part Saturday in ceremonies marking
Emancipation Day, a holiday throughout the Caribbean that
commemorates Britain's abolition of slavery in the region in the
1830s. He also dedicated a memorial to the 73 people killed when
terrorists blew up a Cuban airliner shortly after it took off from
the Barbados airport in October 1976, a notorious episode
attributed to Cuban exile groups.
</P>
<P>
   During the two days he will spend in Grenada, his most
controversial stop, Castro will dedicate a plaque at Point Salines
airport, honoring the contribution of Cuban ``internationalists.''
He is also scheduled to meet the mother of Maurice Bishop, the
pro-Cuban former prime minister whose killing during an October
1983 coup attempt, led by dissident members of his own party,
sparked the American invasion of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Castro will travel to the Dominican Republic,
which resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba earlier this year
after 37 years, to take part in a regional conference. Capping a
year of unusual diplomatic activity, Castro is also to visit
Portugal and South Africa before the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much more than mere political symbolism involved in
Cuba's rapprochement with the English-speaking Caribbean. Despite
severe economic problems of its own, including fuel and power
shortages, drought and a lack of foreign exchange, Cuba has begun a
major effort to provide economic and other assistance to its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials say that more than 200 Cuban doctors, teachers,
sports coaches, engineers and other technicians are working in
Caribbean nations. In addition, about 250 students from Caribbean
countries have been granted full scholarships to study at Cuban
universities.
</P>
<P>
   In Grenada, Cuban engineers are helping design a new national
stadium, and some Grenadians have been flown to Cuba for medical
care. To help St. Kitts and Nevis recover from a hurricane, Cuba
sent farmers there seeds and tons of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban effort helps fill a large gap left by a diminished
American profile in the region. American aid to the Caribbean fell
nearly 90 percent between 1985 and 1995, from $226 million to $26
million, and the U.S. Agency for International Development has
closed its regional office in Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of needs and we have not been getting support,''
Mitchell, the prime minister of Grenada, said in an interview here
after returning from his visit to Cuba last year. ``Our traditional
friends have indicated that the days of grants, aid and soft loans
are gone. We cannot understand this. People know we are in trouble,
and we need help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has also stirred resentment among its
Caribbean allies by pressing the World Trade Organization to end an
arrangement that guaranteed Caribbean bananas preferential access
to European markets. As a result, the United States' political and
economic leverage throughout the region has weakened, and Cuba's is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young people are on my back,'' Mitchell explained. ``They
voted for me, and if it were not for them, I would not be in power
today. People want their lives improved, they want health care,
they want jobs, they want opportunity, and I can't deliver. But I
have to deliver for them and I am willing to accept help from
anyone, so long as it is done on our terms and does not interfere
with our independence and sovereignty.''

CANADIANS AIM TO CLOSE PRO-NAZI WEB SITE BASED IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Just days after a pro-Nazi trilogy of novels called
``Lebensraum!'' was published in the United States last April,
Canadian customs agents confiscated a shipment of the books at the
border, contending that they promote hatred against Jews and
violate Canada's anti-hate laws.
</P>
<P>
   The trilogy's author, Ingrid Rimland, 62, promotes the books and
the ideas they contain on a Web site she runs out of a San Diego
suburb. The site is named Zundelsite, and it is filled with the
words and ideas of Ernst Zundel, a Toronto resident who is one of
the world's most insistent Holocaust deniers and distributors of
anti-Semitic literature. The trilogy was privately published. Its
title, meaning living space, is a reference to German imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   While Canada's laws are clear on how to deal with offensive
written material, they are still untested on communication that
seeps across the border electronically. Canadian customs agents
regularly seize books, magazines and compact disks that violate
standards of decency or promote hate.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the first time there is a serious attempt to address the
issue of the same kind of material on the Internet. The Canadian
Human Rights Commission has charged Zundel with spreading hate
propaganda and is intent on shutting down the Zundelsite. The
commission contends that although the site is run from California,
Zundel controls its content and thus can be prosecuted under
Canadian laws.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Zundel began last fall and has encountered
complications as the quasi-judicial tribunal wrestles with new
legal issues of law and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think the Internet is a law-free zone _ much as some
people might want it to be when it suits their purposes,'' said
Bill Pentney, general counsel for the Canadian Human Rights
Commission. ``We are trying to control _ not the Internet _ but
Ernst Zundel by applying Canadian laws to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has raised questions of freedom of speech, which is
guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Recently
Zundel was prohibited by the House of Commons from holding a news
conference in a room in Parliament that is available to the public.
He complained that his rights had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately it has everything to do with freedom, and all these
other issues are really only subjective, peripheral, spinoffs,''
Zundel said during an interview in his home. ``I am a not a
country, I am one man, and I say this man will not be browbeaten.''
</P>
<P>
   The German-born Zundel, 59, has lived in Canada for 40 years,
but he has been denied citizenship on the ground that he is a
security risk. He sees himself as a martyr, hounded by governments
that have unfairly portrayed Germany's history. The Zundelsite, set
up in 1995, prominently features his assertion that reports of the
Holocaust are a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth McVay, founder and director of the Nizkor Project,
an extensive Holocaust resource Web site, sees the issue
differently. ``Zundel is a man who peddles lies and hatred for
profit,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the thorny issues raised by this case is how to determine
the origin of an Internet site. If the Zundelsite is based in
California but Zundel is in Toronto, to what country does the site
``belong'' and who is responsible for its contents? The Canadian
Human Rights Commission contends that Zundel controls the Web site
and therefore can be prosecuted under Canada's hate laws. Canadian
authorities are seeking to apply Section 13 of the Canadian Human
Rights Act, which prohibits anyone from using telephone lines to
spread hate messages based on race, religion or ethnic origin.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Morgan, national legal counsel for the Canadian Jewish
Congress, said it would be almost impossible to bring a suit in the
United States to shut down the Zundelsite because of First
Amendment protections of free speech that have already been
extended to the Internet in previous cases. Ms. Rimland concedes
that she frequently uses Zundel as a consultant but insists she is
in charge of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian authorities have tried to prosecute Zundel before. In
the 1980s, he was brought to trial twice, under the weaker
anti-hate laws in effect then. His first conviction was overturned
on a technicality, but he was retried and convicted in 1988 under a
law prohibiting the spreading of false news. That decision was
overturned when the Supreme Court of Canada declared the law
unconstitutional in 1992.

LOS ANGELES CASE RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT WIRETAPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The official report of Ramiro Delaherran's arrest
last December seems to be a straightforward account of some very
lucky police work: Los Angeles County sheriff's officers stopped
him because he made an abrupt left turn without using his signal in
a suburb east of Los Angeles. Then they happened to find that the
red Ford Thunderbird he was driving was loaded with 150 kilograms
of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But as his case dragged through the Los Angeles legal system,
Delaherran, 28, insisted he had not driven erratically at all. His
lawyer's suspicions were raised when the prosecutor refused to turn
over the police dispatcher's tape, made when the arrest was radioed
in.
</P>
<P>
   And in June, the authorities disappeared from Delaherran's life
just as mysteriously as they appeared in his rear-view mirror six
months before, allowing his case to be dismissed when the tape was
not produced.
</P>
<P>
   Delaherran did not get far: Federal authorities took over the
case and arrested him July 13; their case is pending. The federal
complaint against Delaherran makes clear that it was not his
driving that initially made officers suspicious; rather, it was a
long-running wiretap investigation of a drug ring by the federal
Drug Enforcement Administration that brought him to the attention
of the local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Delaherran was caught up in what is called a ``hand-off,'' where
investigators who hear of drug activity while listening to a
wiretapped conversation pass that information to a second set of
officers without saying where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   Those officers, who may even be from a different law-enforcement
agency, are expected to establish ``independent probable cause''
for an arrest. The existence of the wiretap and the tip that it
generated are rarely disclosed to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The practice came to light for the first time in March, when a
state judge, Gregory Alarcon, ruled that prosecutors must turn over
wiretap evidence in a 1996 case involving the arrests of three men
and the seizure of 190 kilograms of cocaine. Philip DeMassa, a
lawyer for one of the three men, said the wiretap evidence showed
that his client, Lauro Gaxiola, was asleep the day of his arrest
and was not involved in alleged drug transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles County district attorney,
acknowledged in June that such information had been withheld in 58
cases since 1993, and said his office would adopt an interim policy
of notifying defendants when their cases involve wiretap
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   But the district attorney's office has also defended the
procedure, saying that the office is entitled to withhold the
information when doing so serves the public interest, and that
judges who were informed of such evidence in previous cases did not
require it to be disclosed. Further, one official said, defendants
were notified in 27 cases when wiretaps were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we've done has been in good faith,'' said William
Hodgman, who oversees the major narcotics division in the district
attorney's office. ``There's no conspiracy to deprive any defendant
of what they lawfully should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Concealing wiretap surveillance from defendants has been a
common though relatively unknown practice in Los Angeles and other
U.S. cities where drug trafficking is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In hearings, Los Angeles officers who developed the practice
with the district attorney's office in the mid-1980s have testified
that the goal was to build a wall between the wiretap and the
arrest so the surveillance could be used in continuing
investigations. One officer testified in January that he conducted
hand-off investigations ``hundreds of times,'' with 10 percent to
15 percent of the cases involving wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   But disclosure of the practice has drawn complaints from defense
lawyers that it is a breach of defendants' due process and
discovery rights, and has raised accusations of wiretapping-law
abuses. Defense lawyers say concealed wiretaps preclude their
seeking suppression of evidence by arguing that applications for
the wiretaps were defective.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   DeMassa has charged that wiretap evidence originally withheld
shows that his client is innocent. And defense lawyers cite federal
and state law saying evidence produced as a result of a wiretap
cannot be admitted in court unless the existence of the wiretap is
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a subterfuge,'' said Andrew Marc Stein, Delaherran's
lawyer. ``It is a material misrepresentation to the court, the
public and the defendant. They're teaching police officers to lie
by omission.''
</P>
<P>
   The public defender's office has filed a demand for names of
defendants whose cases originated with wiretaps, and a writ asking
a judge to declare the practice unconstitutional. DeMassa and Stein
said they might seek dismissal of their clients' cases based on
claims of outrageous government conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In Delaherran's case, when his arrest occurred, federal
officials were in the middle of a yearlong wiretap investigation
that netted nearly 4 tons of cocaine, $15 million in drug proceeds
and the indictment on July 10 of nine men, including an official in
the Arellano Felix cartel of Tijuana, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Though federal authorities have not specified what role, if any,
Delaherran had in the Felix operation, they said they had not
wanted to jeopardize the broader investigation at the time of his
arrest by having to disclose their wiretaps in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   So investigators passed the information to the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department, which made the arrest of Delaherran
and took the case to state court. If the judge on the case required
disclosure of the wiretap, the federal authorities told state
prosecutors, the case was to be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants convicted without disclosure of the wiretap evidence
against them face significant hurdles in seeking new trials. To
succeed, defense lawyers must show that the wiretap applications
were defective and the evidence derived from them prejudiced their
cases.

JABS TRADED IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ In California politics, this lazy summer season is
traditionally the lull before the autumn storm, but the two major
party candidates for governor began trading thunderbolts here on
Friday night in the first of five promised debates. And when it was
over, they had shed sweat, heat and light on topics from abortion
to the death penalty to offshore oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democrat, and Attorney General Dan
Lungren, the Republican, each strove in their hourlong televised
encounter at the San Diego Convention Center to seem the relaxed
embodiment of the state they would lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Lungren perspired profusely in the hot television lights,
and Davis, the most cautious of politicians, repeatedly dodged
direct answers, and when challenged on the consistency of his
support for the death penalty suddenly suggested Singapore as a
model for effective law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was an unusually direct and spontaneous personal
exchange, carried live in at least nine cities around a state where
politics is overwhelmingly dominated by paid television advertising
and voter interest is low.
</P>
<P>
   Clear differences emerged in the debate. Davis repeatedly drove
home his strong support for abortion rights and gun control, while
Lungren put Davis on the defensive for his unwillingness to give
unequivocal answers on topics from American Indian gambling to
negative campaigning and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of us backpedals and the other tells you where he
stands,'' Lungren told reporters later.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Davis allowed that Lungren, a longtime opponent of
abortion, was ``a decent person'' but said, ``He's committed to
taking away a woman's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the encounter amounted to a dry run for a closely
watched contest in which the candidates are competing to succeed
Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who is barred from seeking a third
term.
</P>
<P>
   The only available polls show Davis holding a modest lead, and
both candidates sought to stake out the middle ground by pledging
increased support for public education in a state where the once
renowned school system is beleaguered by the two-decade legacy of
tax cutting that began with Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot measure
that capped local property-tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   But inevitably, it was the flash points of difference that stood
out. Davis, who has 23 years of experience in state politics and
whose strategy centers on trying to portray Lungren as a
conservative out of step with mainstream voters, accused his rival
of failing to vigorously enforce the state law banning assault
weapons and of being slow to support a moratorium on offshore oil
drilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, did you just not understand the law?'' Davis asked him.
</P>
<P>
   But Lungren, who spent 10 years in Congress representing his
hometown of Long Beach before becoming attorney general eight years
ago, maintained his poise as a smiling conservative appealing to
traditional values in the Ronald Reagan mode, and afterward
acknowledged his shiny forehead by declaring simply, ``I sweat a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he worried that he could fall victim to the moist
image that dogged Richard Nixon, Lungren replied with the precision
of the doctor's son he is. In fact, the elder Lungren was Nixon's
longtime personal physician, and Lungren quickly noted that in his
first televised debate with John F. Kennedy in 1960, ``Richard
Nixon had a 103-degree temperature.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lungren also managed to rattle the usually unflappable Davis,
who supports the death penalty, by questioning what he said were
two votes that Davis cast against capital punishment as a member of
the state Assembly in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Davis professed to have no memory of the votes but promised to
check before the next debate, in Fresno on Aug. 18. Then, peppered
by Lungren, Davis blurted out, ``Let me just tell you, I think
Singapore is a good starting point in terms of law and order.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked afterward whether he meant to endorse Singapore's harsh
penalties, like caning, for minor offenses such as painting
graffiti, Davis said he had merely been ``trying to let people know
that I'm not going to tolerate violent crime,'' adding that
Singapore had ``very clear rules and very little crime.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Davis' most forceful moments came when Lungren challenged
his opposition to requiring parental consent for abortion for
minors, and Davis replied that ``any child in a loving family is
automatically going to ask'' permission, but that to require it in
all cases risks prompting young women who are at loggerheads with
their families to seek back-alley abortions or even commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the core issue, we are in fundamental disagreement,'' Davis
said. ``I trust a woman, who in concert with her own God, her own
doctor and her own conscience comes to a decision on the most
difficult and delicate thing involving a woman's health. You don't
trust a woman to make that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lungren responded with equal force by saying, ``The belief
that somehow parents and the family unit are more dangerous to a
child than the government or an unknown doctor and unknown nurse or
an unknown counselor strikes at the very essence of the cornerstone
of our society _ that is, the family.''

CLINTON TRIES TO CONTROL HIS PARALLEL PRESIDENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-HAMPTONS)  
(lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. _ As President Clinton travels the country these
days talking policy and politics and raising money, it is as if
there are parallel presidencies under way: the stormy one portrayed
in news accounts, which is beset by talk of DNA testing on a party
dress and of possible impeachment proceedings, and the sunny one
that Clinton publicly inhabits, which on Saturday was all
health-care politicking, golf and fund raising among the
well-heeled of the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Through more than five years in office, Clinton has seemed to
travel in his own climatic zone, regardless of what bad news was
thundering nearby. But never has that zone seemed quite so small,
and so starkly at variance with the prevailing system, as it does
now.
</P>
<P>
   The bags under his eyes look as overpacked as ever, but Clinton
never seems other than calm and confident in public. Some of his
aides, however, betray a little uncertainty about which presidency
will ultimately carry the day this time.
</P>
<P>
   They excoriate reporters as having already made up their minds
that Clinton has not been honest in denying a sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky; but they simultaneously take comfort in polls
showing that while most people think Clinton lied about the
relationship, they do not much care.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton travels, many of the people who come into contact
with him share, or at least adopt, his sunny outlook. Crowds still
go wild for him: One woman who shook his hand at the Westhampton
airport called it ``the experience of my life.'' At a fund-raiser
Friday night in East Hampton, Bruce Wasserstein, the investment
banker, raised a toast to the Clintons for a ``remarkable
achievement,'' saying, ``This is obviously a wonderful time for all
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   For a president seeking comfort or inspiration, things could
only look wonderful from Cranberry Dune, Wasserstein's 25-acre
oceanfront estate, where Clinton dined with Billy Joel, Quincy
Jones and others.

<P>
   The 14,000-square-foot home, built around a transplanted
16th-century Scottish barn, is set in rolling lawns, pine trees and
gardens of day lilies, hollyhocks and black-eyed Susans. In similar
splendor, the Clintons are staying at the estate of the filmmaker
Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's own fund-raising remarks, which are largely
extemporaneous, underscore how separate the parallel presidencies
appear to be in his own mind. ``I care a lot about this country's
history,'' he said at Wasserstein's house. ``I've spent a lot of
time reading and studying it, trying to feel it in the White House,
in every room.''
</P>
<P>
   The president makes no direct mention in his remarks of his
troubles in Washington, instead laying out a list of goals as if
his presidency were as fresh as it was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He calls for ``progress over partisanship,'' often at the same
time as he is scoring a few partisan points. And he lays out his
chief policy goals, including securing Social Security and
Medicare, improving primary and secondary education, protecting the
environment and combating ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   At Wasserstein's estate, he also pointed out that there were
``still neighborhoods in New York City that have double-digit
unemployment rates'' because of low investment and people who lack
skills. ``We're never going to have a better time than the next
couple of years to try to help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say the perception that he has continued to work
hard at his job sustains his high approval ratings. He cannot
afford to slack off, they say, and he has no desire to do so.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Saturday, Clinton delivered his weekly radio address live
from a fire station in Amagansett. He devoted it to promoting his
``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' a series of protections for people in
managed-care plans. It is an issue that the Democrats believe will
work for them in the fall elections, and it also connects to a
subject that has long been central to the president's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Since the latest series of developments in the Lewinsky
investigation, Clinton has glanced up and acknowledged the storm
clouds only once, and only for a moment. In the Rose Garden on
Friday, he made lengthy remarks on the state of the economy, the
importance of the International Monetary Fund and the tasks
awaiting the new government of Japan. The moment he said, ``Thank
you very much,'' the questions erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait,'' he said, 10 times, before quieting the crowd and
briefly connecting the two presidencies.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he wanted ``this matter behind us'' and that he
would testify ``completely and truthfully.'' Clinton added that he
had said all he would say about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,
at least until he speaks to prosecutors in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton is as steadfast as her husband in
publicly ignoring the other presidency. At Wasserstein's house, she
spoke before the president did, praising his accomplishments and
his vision for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take great pride in introducing someone who I know very
well,'' she said, before pausing to note that it was ``a little
strange'' to introduce one's spouse. ``Depending upon the kind of
day you had, you know,'' she said, ``you might give a different
sort of introduction.''

COMMENTARY: THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is a consumer tip I never thought I'd find in
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``If semen is found on the dress, prosecutors would then
probably seek a saliva or blood sample from the president to
determine if the DNA matched,'' read the lead story on Friday about
President Clinton's travails. ``Such a stain would retain DNA
material for many years, unless the dress had been cleaned with
detergents, said experts in DNA testing. Dry cleaning alone would
not remove it, nor would storage under poor conditions, they
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Hints from Heloise meets White House coverage. Forget money
laundering. Now it's just laundering.
</P>
<P>
   With ``There's Something About Mary'' and ``BASEketball,'' we
are in the era of gross-out movies, celebrating the disgusting,
breaking taboos on private parts, precious bodily fluids and
puerile sex jokes.
</P>
<P>
   With Monica Lewinsky, Ken Starr and Bill Clinton, we are in the
era of gross-out politics. Even in a scandal that has set new
records for crudeness, the return of the infamous ``love dress,''
as the tabloids call it, represents a grotesque turn.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of girl saves such a trophy, much less sends it to her
mother for safekeeping? One TV commentator dubbed it ``the 90s
version of a corsage.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been many surreal moments, but surely this one broke
new ground. President Clinton coming out to the Rose Garden and
trying to brag about the rosy economy, when he knew the reporters
were waiting to pounce with only one question: ``Would you
voluntarily give a DNA sample in advance, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   This week was a bizarre convergence of many unsavory elements of
our society: the Clinton case merging with the O.J. case. Here was
Barry Scheck back talking about DNA testing. Here was self-styled
``citizen-journalist'' Matt Drudge reporting that when Linda Tripp
told Lucianne Goldberg about the dress, the hard-boiled literary
agent consulted with one of her authors, Mark Fuhrman, about how a
semen stain on a garment could be obtained for testing. (A Q-tip
dipped in water.) With the fate of the republic hanging on a navy
blue cocktail dress, here was Bill Clinton jetting off to the
Hamptons to visit the homes of Steven Spielberg and Alec Baldwin
and Kim Basinger for an orgy of fund-raising and celebrity in a
gross-out synergy of Hollywood and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Although we do not like to admit it, America seems addicted to
scraping the bottom of the barrel. We're getting cruder, more
self-involved and more over-the-top by the minute. Phil Donahue
devolves to Jerry Springer. Woody Allen devolves to the Farrelly
brothers and ``South Park'' guys. Helen Gurley Brown devolves to
Elizabeth Wurtzel.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of entertainment and politics that began with John
Kennedy and Ronald Reagan reached a sour fruition with Bill
Clinton. He campaigned and governed using lowbrow forums of popular
entertainment, answering questions about boxers or briefs. And now
the lowbrow culture he cultivated has engulfed his presidency and,
most likely, his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton's place in history will be as the president who
worried about his place in history,'' says The New Republic's
literary editor, Leon Wieseltier.
</P>
<P>
   Just as movie and television comedy is permeated with the
ill-mannered, self-indulgent mentality of adolescent boys, Clinton
has reversed the usual pattern of the presidency, switching from a
paternal model to an adolescent model. He expects us to clean up,
ignore or forgive his messes.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to feel sorry for the likable and boyish president.
Leaders should have some zone of privacy. And Clinton's tormenters
are all so creepy, opportunistic and partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what the public thinks, most journalists I know are not
panting after this story. Like the public, most of us find it
disgusting and wish it would go away. No matter how many heartfelt
speeches Linda Tripp gives about being at one with them, Americans
are never going to forgive her illicitly taping a friend. And they
are never going to approve of the salacious, relentless route Starr
has taken in his pursuit of Clinton's scalp.
</P>
<P>
   But the jam Clinton finds himself in is a direct result of his
lack of discipline, his refusal to take responsibility and his
willingness to lie, cover up, use loyal aides or smear talkative
ex-girlfriends when all other means of escape seem blocked.
</P>
<P>
   You might call it a vast gross-out conspiracy.

MERCKX RIDES IN FABLED FATHER'S SHADOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LE CREUSOT, France _ It's not always a smart thing to go into
the family business. Axel Merckx knows.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian, 26 years old next week, is riding in his first Tour
de France. At that age, his father, the fabled Eddy Merckx, had
already won the Tour three times, including his debut in 1969. Eddy
Merckx went on to win it five times and share the record with
Jacques Anquetil, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain.
</P>
<P>
   They were all giants, and Axel Merckx is the first to admit that
he is not a giant. ``I'm me, not my father,'' he says irritably.
``Almost nobody gives me the chance to be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   His father won more than 400 races and the son has won two.
Nevertheless, the younger Merckx, who rides for the Polti team from
Italy, had performed well enough to find himself in 11th place
among the 96 riders left before Saturday's 32-mile individual time
trial in Burgundy from Montceau les Mines to Le Creusot.
</P>
<P>
   He finished ninth for the day, failing by four seconds to
overtake the rider in 10th place over all but moving into the elite
when the eighth-placed rider, Bjarne Riis, a Dane with Telekom,
dropped to 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Merckx was not the only man moving up on the rainswept,
undulating course. Jan Ullrich, the defending Tour champion, the
German leader of Telekom, made up the 14 seconds by which he
trailed Bobby Julich, an American from Glenwood Springs, Colo., who
rides for Cofidis, and rose to second place over all.
</P>
<P>
   Both riders, being realists, thought they had no chance of
catching Marco Pantani, the Italian leader of Mercatone Uno, who
wore the leader's yellow jersey by nearly six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   They were right. Ullrich won the race against the clock, in
which riders started three minutes apart, in 1 hour 3 minutes 52
seconds, a speed of 30.3 miles and hour. Julich finished second,
1:01 behind, as he dropped to third over all. Pantani was third,
2:35 down, and, barring accident, is assured of victory by 3:21
over all when the race ends with a mainly ceremonial stage into
Paris Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Merckx has rarely won as a member of the Telekom,
Motorola and Polti teams, he has had such fine results as third in
the 1996 Tour of Lombardy one-day classic and fourth that year in
the world championship road race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a serious and steady rider who does best when the race is
hardest,'' said Merckx's coach with Polti, Gianluigi Stanga.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy Merckx is a tougher judge. ``He's not doing bad,'' said the
father early in the Tour. ``It can be better but it's the beginning
for him. I hope he can do better in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for him, carrying the name. But Axel is doing
what he likes to do, and for me, if Axel's happy, I'm also happy.''

JETS GET FINE-PRONE COX TO REPLACE JONES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The volatile Bryan Cox, a three-time Pro Bowl
performer who has spent $100,000 on fines in his career, agreed to
a contract with the New York Jets Saturday that would make him the
middle linebacker in place of the injured Marvin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells acknowledged Cox's stormy past _ in a game
last year for the Bears, he drew consecutive 15-yard penalties for
unsportsmanlike conduct _ but said: ``I've been lucky with
veterans. O.J. Anderson, Everson Walls. They just want to know what
you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The move came with the swiftness that has marked Parcells'
regime when faced with a problem. Jones, the team's leading tackler
last year, suffered a freakish injury during a Friday practice
session when an unidentified teammate tripped over another player
and landed on Jones. Jones tore two ligaments in his left knee and
will be lost for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, the Jets had no one who could be counted on in the
same way. The backups are 34-year-old Pepper Johnson, returning
from quadriceps surgery, and the journeyman Dwayne Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was cut two months ago by the Bears, who had tired of his
criticism of the team's management. Even some of Cox's teammates
were angered by his emotional outbursts on the field. Cox will be
reunited with one of them, safety Anthony Marshall, with the Jets.
It was Marshall who said after Cox's consecutive penalties in the
Bears' loss to Tampa Bay: ``There's no need for that, none at all.
We're out here to win football games, not to put on a show for the
cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall had left practice and was not available for comment
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cox signed a four-year, $13.5 million deal in 1996 with the
Bears following five outstanding seasons in Miami. He had 34 1/2
sacks for the Dolphins, including 14 in 1992. In 25 games with the
Bears he got only eight, but he did produce 232 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the sack total is not particularly alarming to
the Jets because in Parcells' scheme the middle linebacker is not
expected to be a critical pass-rusher. The Jets rely more on
outside linebackers for that purpose. Also, the team is switching
its defensive front alignment to the 4-3, which counts on the
middle linebacker to stop the run.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Cox had announced last winter that he expected
the Bears to release him, and he was right. In his two seasons with
the team he was fined several times, including $10,000 in the
season's opener against Green Bay, when he threw a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   He was known for his temper when he played with the Dolphins as
well, once creating headlines when he made an obscene gesture to
Bills fans in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   At Chicago, the Bears used a rotating system of captains, but he
refused the honor one week when it was his turn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there is one coach in football who understands
linebackers, it is Parcells. He was the man, after all, whose
Giants defense was anchored by Lawrence Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Parcells and Cox share a bond: horse racing. Parcells used
to own several thoroughbreds in partnership with Mike Francesa, the
radio and television personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian owns horses,'' Parcells explained, ``and I used to see
him in the winter at Gulfstream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian and I are going to talk. I know he's a good kid.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Parcells said he spoke to Cox twice on Friday night. He also
knows his talent. He has been coaching against him for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his volatility, Parcells said: ``Maybe you need a
little fire around here. It might help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Glenn Foley said of the move, ``I heard he's a good
locker-room guy. Real intense. He'll have a lot of work to do when
he gets here. The defensive schemes are pretty difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Reining in his emotions may be more of a chore for him, though.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS:
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Foley looked considerably sharper in the club's second
scrimmage of training camp. After completing barely half his passes
in the team's first scrimmage on Wednesday, he connected on 12 of
14 attempts for 102 yards in Saturday's scrimmage. He also found
Keyshawn Johnson for a 7-yard touchdown pass and produced points on
a 42-yard John Hall field goal. Vinny Testaverde, who had outshined
Foley in the first scrimmage, was 8-of-15 for 97 yards with no
scores. But Hall did complete one of Testaverde's drives with a
34-yard field goal ... Johnson made a key sideline grab in traffic,
one of the skills he has been attempting to improve on.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jason Fabini shared right tackle with the veteran Siupeli
Malamala, and it is likely the fourth-round draft pick is on his
way to becoming the starter ... Jerald Sowell had a nice 30-yard
catch and run from his fullback spot ... Curtis Martin, who missed
six days with a hamstring injury before returning Friday, was held
out of the scrimmage. The entire team is off on Sunday. ``It's been
a long 10 days,'' Parcells said of the nonstop camp.

MAJOR CHANGE IN SORENSTAM'S OUTLOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Sweden)  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario _ Win or lose this weekend, Annika Sorenstam
will not lose the respect of her peers on the Ladies Professional
Golf Association Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys forget about Annika,'' said Meg Mallon, a veteran,
talking to a group of reporters. ``Then she gets ticked off and
wins. So don't do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be too late. Playing as if she has something to prove,
Sorenstam followed an opening-round 68 with a 66 on Friday, to
reach 10 under par (134) at the du Maurier Classic, the last
women's major of the year. Sorenstam started Saturday tied for
fourth place with Mallon, two strokes behind the co-leaders, Pat
Hurst (12 under par) and Brandie Burton, and one stroke behind
Betsy King.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the pre-tournament talk centered on Se Ri Pak's
attempt to win her third consecutive major, Sorenstam has quietly
gone about the business of playing superb golf. Pak started
Saturday in trouble, tied for 36th place at 5 under par, needing a
miraculous comeback to win. Meanwhile, Sorenstam was in stalking
position, with a chance to win her fourth tournament of the year,
which would tie Pak for the most LPGA victories in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To know Sorenstam, a 27-year-old from Sweden, is to know a
perfectionist. She shows little emotion on the course, but she is a
fierce competitor, and she admitted that she was excited about
being paired with Pak and Karrie Webb (6 under par) during the
first two days of the tournament. The fact that she outplayed Webb
and Pak made the pairing even more enjoyable for Sorenstam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always very competitive at the top, whether it's Se Ri,
Karrie or Kelly Robbins,'' Sorenstam said.
</P>
<P>
   While Sorenstam is too modest to talk boldly about how good she
is, her peers know. They know she was last year's LPGA player of
the year, winning six tournaments in 1997. They know she set an
LPGA record for single-season earnings last year, more than $1.2
million. They know she leads the LPGA Tour this year in scoring
average.
</P>
<P>
   And they know that Pak's presence as a new threat will only fuel
Sorenstam's motivation. Pak entered this week as the Tour's leading
money-winner ($768,211) this year, but Sorenstam was No. 2
($678,784), and Sorenstam would close the gap, or perhaps even
overtake Pak by winning the du Maurier.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sorenstam has a chance to win her third major in the
last four years, after winning back-to-back U.S. Women's Opens in
1995 and '96. ``Majors are important _ they are at the top of my
list,'' Sorenstam said. ``Majors make history. But this week, I'm
trying to approach it differently and not take it so seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sorenstam is serious about winning, and she has learned to
pace herself, worrying less about how often she plays. Sorenstam
married David Esch in January 1997, and away from the course, she
enjoys water skiing, tennis, and cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The du Maurier is Sorenstam's 15th event this year; she has
played in fewer than anyone in the top 20 on the money list. But
taking time off has allowed Sorenstam to feel fresh whenever she
competes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'm taking a different approach by not playing as much,''
Sorenstam said. ``This is my fifth season, and if I was going to
continue doing this, I needed to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Pak should take Sorenstam's advice. Pak appeared tired
during the first two rounds, perhaps drained by playing in her
sixth consecutive tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam understood how Pak felt. In 1997 at Pumpkin Ridge Golf
Club in Cornelius, Ore., Sorenstam had a chance to become the first
player to win three consecutive U.S. Opens. Instead, she missed the
cut. Sorenstam showed class by staying in town that weekend to
watch Alison Nicholas defeat Nancy Lopez by one stroke. And the
experience taught Sorenstam a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a really hard time at Pumpkin Ridge,'' Sorenstam said.
``I put a lot of pressure on myself and I couldn't handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sorenstam has proved she can handle success, and she wants
more. Pak may be the tour's newest sensation, but Sorenstam is not
ready to step aside. With Sorenstam, Webb, who is 23 years old, and
Pak, who is 20, the LPGA has three young stars to promote and lead
the way into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give up until I achieve my goals,'' Sorenstam said.
``I'm still here. And I still enjoy playing.''

ASTROS BEAT THE DEADLINE IN JOHNSON SWEEPSTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Previously skedded as BBO-TRADES; see also BBO-NOTEBOOK)

<P>
   If anyone needs another indication of how great a season the New
York Yankees are having, look no further than Randy Johnson. The
intimidating pitcher had been scheduled to face the Yankees in
Seattle Saturday night for the first time since the 1995 playoffs,
but now the only way they'll have to see him is if they play the
Houston Astros in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In the most stunning development of a day loaded with 13 trades
involving 48 players, the Astros acquired Johnson from the Mariners
10 minutes before the nonwaiver trading deadline Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Cleveland Indians had been considered the
leading contenders for the 34-year-old left-hander, but the Astros
snatched him with a package of three minor-league players that was
as surprising as their success in getting him. One player is to be
named. The other players are Freddy Garcia, a 21-year-old pitcher,
and Carlos Guillen, a 22-year-old infielder, both products of the
Astros' state-of-the-art Venezuelan development program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gerry Hunsicker, the Houston general manager, had
pursued Johnson for the past month, it took a series of half a
dozen telephone conversations Friday to get what he wanted, a No. 1
starter for the team's rotation. It was not an easy day.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Woodward, the Mariners' general manager, spent much of the
time in his conversations with Hunsicker trying to get two of the
Astros' best young players, outfielder Richard Hidalgo and pitcher
Scott Elarton. Hunsicker resisted and made a counter offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 11 o'clock New York time, I didn't think we had a chance,''
Hunsicker said by telephone from Houston. ``Then at 10 after 11, I
decided to make one more call. That stimulated discussion, and they
called back 10 minutes later and said they were seriously
interested in our offer.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the clock seemed to move rapidly toward midnight, Woody
Woodward, the Mariners' general manager, did not call back. ``When
I hadn't heard from him at a quarter to 12, I was certain we
weren't going to get it done,'' Hunsicker said. ``I figured one of
the other teams jumped in and increased their offer.''
</P>
<P>
   But at 10 minutes to midnight, Woodward called and accepted the
Astros' package.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a close call that when Hunsicker, following
procedure, called Nancy Crofts, the National League's executive
director of player records, to report the trade, she told him that
her clock was precisely at midnight. A minute later, she said, and
she would have to get permission to allow the trade.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trade that prompted praise from other baseball people
but also wonderment that the Mariners accepted all minor leaguers.
They had expressed a desire for a major-league starting pitcher,
Ramiro Mendoza from the Yankees, Dave Burba from the Cleveland
Indians, for example, but now they had settled for none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised to see that Houston got him,'' said Tommy
Lasorda, the Los Angeles Dodgers' interim general manager, who made
a seven-player trade with the Montreal Expos Friday. ``All the talk
was it would be the Yankees or Cleveland. That was a shock when I
heard Houston got him. The thing I don't understand is what they
got after what they were asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker somewhat took exception to the suggestion that the
Mariners settled for players of little ability. He said that Garcia
is considered one of the best half dozen or so minor-league
pitchers and that Guillen could have been the Astros' starting
shortstop or third baseman in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Johnson is their No. 1 pitcher, and it is now the
other NL contenders who will face what American League teams had
been accustomed to and dreaded.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs have the most immediate concern because they
are trying to catch the Astros in the NL Central. Assuming the
Astros don't suffer a total breakdown, though, the Atlanta Braves
and the San Diego Padres, the league's best teams all season, will
encounter the Johnson impact in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get to the postseason,'' Hunsicker said, ``we didn't
want to have to do it without a No. 1 pitcher. We lost Darryl Kile
last winter and we hadn't replaced him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had a 9-10 record after having compiled a 75-20
record the previous five years, has sulked his way through the
season in Seattle because the Mariners had not honored his request
and traded him after they decided last winter they were not going
to keep him after this season. Johnson has not commented on the
trade, but now that he has gained his wish, he is expected to
revert to the consistently dominating pitcher he has been for the
Mariners.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disguised by a blonde wig and sunglasses, Monica
Lewinsky boarded a flight last Sunday morning in Los Angeles, an
anonymous beginning to a 48-hour odyssey that transformed the legal
and political dynamics of the independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
four-year investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The next day in New York, Ms. Lewinsky met secretly with the
independent counsel's team at an East Side apartment belonging to
Starr's mother-in-law. After a five-hour debriefing and a
late-night drive to Washington, the former White House intern
signed an immunity deal on Tuesday that freed her from legal peril.
But it also confronted Clinton and his presidency with a morass
that he will be forced to face in grand jury testimony at the White
House on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who turned 25 on July 23, has moved a step closer
to a cherished goal. ``For my birthday,'' Ms. Lewinsky had told her
family, ``I want my life back.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on that birthday morning, Ms. Lewinsky was told by her
new lawyers, Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris, that Starr had called,
breaking weeks of silence and offering to reopen immunity
discussions. That night, her family celebrated at a French
restaurant in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Ms. Lewinsky's six-month journey from target to
cooperating witness was culled from more than a dozen interviews
this week with lawyers involved in the investigation, as well as
with associates and friends of the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   A Starr-Lewinsky alliance that seemed unlikely as recently as
last month was put together by a cast of lawyers, some of whom have
received no public attention. Ms. Lewinsky found a trusted mentor
in Sydney Hoffman, a 46-year-old lawyer in Cacheris' firm, who was
able to establish a bond with Ms. Lewinsky and then lead a critical
round of questioning that bolstered Ms. Lewinsky's credibility with
Starr's team. Sam Dash, the former Senate Watergate counsel who has
advised Starr on ethics issues, also played a pivotal role.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the most important players in this week's legal drama
were seasoned criminal defense lawyers, Stein, 73, and Cacheris,
69, who have only represented Ms. Lewinsky since June 2. The two
Washington insiders, who work in different law firms in the same
office building, broke a six-month deadlock of bad blood and broken
promises between Starr's prosecutors and Ms. Lewinsky's first
lawyer, William Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations opened with an offer from Starr that Ms.
Lewinsky would be ``queen for a day,'' an ironic term of the legal
arts that would allow the former White House intern to tell her
complete story to prosecutors _ but with a promise that nothing she
said could be used against her if, at the end of the interview,
Starr remained unsatisfied with the level of her cooperation and
declined to grant immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the resulting legal coup this week, Stein and Cacheris
are somber, perhaps because, like Dash, they are veterans of the
Watergate crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing to celebrate,'' Stein said in an interview
in his book-lined law office here, facing an etching of
Shakespeare. ``None of this called for a party. This is a
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   On a cold afternoon last January, Ms. Lewinsky was confronted by
a retinue of FBI agents and lawyers working for Starr who
questioned her for hours. They threatened to prosecute her for
perjury by using her taped confessions to a friend about an affair
with the president _ a relationship that she had denied in sworn
testimony in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers and agents told Ms. Lewinsky that she could avoid
prosecution if she agreed to secretly tape record her conversations
with Betty Currie, the president's personal secretary, and with the
president himself. Ms. Lewinsky declined.
</P>
<P>
   Later, to defend his client, Ginsburg submitted a proffer _ a
statement of expected testimony _ for Ms. Lewinsky that confirmed a
sexual relationship with the president, said lawyers familiar with
her account. But the proffer did not say that the president or his
allies had encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath in the Jones
case. That account did not satisfy Starr. And while Ginsburg argued
in court that Starr had offered Ms. Lewinsky immunity, he lost.
</P>
<P>
   Starr then turned to other matters, spending months in
protracted court battles with the White House. All the while,
Ginsburg's public characterizations of Starr as someone who may
have ``ravaged the life of a youngster'' were received with glee in
the White House. And the distrust between Ginsburg and Starr's
office grew so deep that all communication ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky herself was instrumental in the ultimate decision
to dismiss Ginsburg, said lawyers familiar with the decision. He
had never been her choice. When her father first suggested him back
in January, friends recalled, her reaction was immediate: ``Dad,
he's a malpractice lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   She kept Nathaniel Speights, an experienced criminal defense
lawyer and Ginsburg's Washington co-counsel. Ms. Lewinsky was also
relying on advice from a savvy spokeswoman, Judy Smith, hired with
the help of her mother's lawyer, Billy Martin. Martin and Ms.
Smith, who is also a lawyer, helped guide Ms. Lewinsky in the
choice of Stein and Cacheris.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith began to change the landscape of Ms. Lewinsky's
insulated world. For Ms. Lewinsky, who several friends say is
lonely and bored and rarely gets to socialize with people her own
age (she feared anyone seen with her would be subpoenaed by Starr),
Ms. Smith became a new confidante.
</P>
<P>
   It was Marcia Lewis, Ms. Lewinsky's mother, who read about Stein
in a New Yorker magazine profile and suggested approaching him.
Martin, who knew both Stein and Cacheris, concurred. So did Ms.
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, Ms. Smith asked Cacheris whether his firm had any
female lawyers. It did: Ms. Hoffman, a former assistant U.S.
attorney and the lawyer who became a mentor to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Stein and Cacheris decided that it was time for some diplomacy.
They paid a courtesy visit to Starr, whom both men knew through
Washington legal circles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the office, Stein talked in tough but measured terms
with Starr. ``I have one good trial left in me,'' Stein told him,
``and I'm going to put it at Monica's disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words sent a clear message to Starr's prosecutors: Ms.
Lewinsky was prepared to fight an indictment. And Starr was well
aware that Stein had won the only acquittal in a major criminal
trial in the Watergate case, representing Kenneth Parkinson, a
Nixon lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   For Starr, Stein's remark also increased the pressure to work
out a deal with Ms. Lewinsky. Starr knew that if Ms. Lewinsky was
indicted, a trial would likely delay his final report for a year or
longer. On Tuesday, July 21, Starr telephoned Stein and suggested a
meeting. The next day, Stein and Cacheris met at the independent
counsel's office with Starr and Dash. Afterward, Stein and Cacheris
sent a proffer letter that outlined what Ms. Lewinsky was prepared
to say under oath.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known what other evidence Starr has assembled, but Ms.
Lewinsky could provide testimony that helps prove that the
president lied under oath and tried to obstruct justice. Time was
of the essence, and it was to Starr's advantage to have Ms.
Lewinsky's account first, before he questioned the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, on Saturday clarified
how the president will be questioned by the independent counsel's
office at the White House. Kendall said the testimony will be
carried on a one-way live feed to the grand jury, and recorded on
videotape for any jurors who are absent.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the new proffer was not that different from
the one Ginsburg prepared, but the climate had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trusted each other,'' Cacheris said, ``and trust had been a
problem in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr responded with his ``queen for a day'' offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted it sooner rather than later,'' Cacheris said of
Ms. Lewinsky's account. Stein and Cacheris told Ms. Lewinsky that
meeting with Starr, given his time pressures, was ``a favorable
development.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed to meet last Monday in New York. Both camps
worried that reporters in Washington would find out about the
secret meeting if held there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had nothing to lose,'' Cacheris said. ``She could say what
she wanted to say, as long as it was the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one thing left to negotiate prior to the meeting:
The lunch menu. Starr and Stein decided on tuna fish sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Ms. Lewinsky said she was terribly anguished over the
prospect of testifying against the president, but an even greater
worry weighed on her. She knew that her mother was also vulnerable
to prosecution by Starr because she had kept her daughter's
cocktail dress with a stain. Lawyers said that Ms. Lewinsky told
prosecutors that the stain could provide evidence of a a sexual
encounter with the president. The dress is being tested for
physical evidence at the FBI crime laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has come to understand that she was going to
assume responsibility for the portion of this that was her fault,
and just tell the truth,'' a friend said. ``If the presidency goes
down, the president has to take responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while in Los Angeles last weekend, Ms. Lewinsky asked
friends : ``Am I doing the right thing?'' They encouraged her to do
whatever she believed it would take to put an end to her six-month
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky told Stein and Cacheris that she was ready to talk
to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Although the five-hour meeting last Monday was held in the New
York City apartment of Starr's mother-in-law, Starr was not
present. But Cacheris and Stein were pleased to see Dash take a
leading role in organizing the meeting, as he had in setting up
negotiations with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   While Dash raised the comfort levels of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers,
Ms. Hoffman, the lawyer in Cacheris' office, had grown close to Ms.
Lewinsky, and she was able to make Ms. Lewinsky feel more at ease.
Ms. Hoffman started the session by asking Ms. Lewinsky a series of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   After about 30 minutes, Starr's team _ Dash, William Bittman and
Sol Wisenberg _ asked questions of Ms. Lewinsky. ``There was no
rancor,'' Stein said afterward. ``It was congenial, dignified and,
under the circumstances, it was elevated.'' An FBI agent took
notes.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 p.m., Cacheris ended the meeting. Ms. Lewinsky returned
to a friend's apartment. That night, Starr left a message on
Stein's answering machine. Ms. Lewinsky's performance had been
deemed credible by his deputies. There was the basis for a
transactional immunity agreement, which is full and blanket
protection from prosecution unless prosecutors find that Ms.
Lewinsky has lied to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Cacheris and Stein went to Starr's office to pick
up the immunity agreement, which Starr had signed. They brought it
back to their offices, where Ms. Lewinsky signed it just before 2
p.m., when Stein and Cacheris announced it to the public with a
one-sentence statement outside the building.
</P>
<P>
   At that time and in a recent interview, both Stein and Cacheris
declined to discuss detailed terms of the agreement, or Ms.
Lewinsky's proffered testimony.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement to grant transactional immunity to Ms. Lewinsky's
mother was negotiated by her attorney, Billy Martin, with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky now faces the difficult task of attending daily
debriefings with Starr's prosecutors, which a friend said have been
``grueling.'' But she is preparing for her grand jury testimony,
which is likely to occur sometime later this month and could last
only a few days. After that, Ms. Lewinsky could be called upon to
testify in public at a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee
if it chooses to hold impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been apprehensive about all of this,'' Stein said.
``She is a bright person and is bright enough to know this is very
serious business.''

COMPLEX FORMULA GIVES CAMBODIA HEAD THE EDGE IN ELECTION OUTCOME

<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Battered by coups, violence and
voting-day manipulation, Cambodian voters waiting to learn the
results of last Sunday's elections faced a new challenge Saturday:
mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   An election official, appearing on television with a blue marker
and a white board, explained that once the slow vote count is
completed, legislative seats will be allocated by a complex formula
that will favor the party of the incumbent leader, Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Few people could follow the intricacies of the formula. ``The
guy has just explained it and I still don't understand it,'' a
Cambodian journalist said.
</P>
<P>
   Favoring larger parties over smaller ones, the formula is
expected to give Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party a bare majority
in the 122-seat Parliament. Under the formula that most parties had
thought was being used, his group would have been just short of a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, Hun Sen's total falls well short of the
two-thirds' majority needed to form a government. He has offered to
enter a coalition with his chief rivals, Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, but both men are still protesting the vote count.
</P>
<P>
   The vote totals are emerging slowly, and a preliminary official
count was not expected until next week. But unofficial counts have
made it clear that Hun Sen has won.
</P>
<P>
   The exact size of his victory is still unknown, along with the
extent to which he will be forced to rely on coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Election Committee, Samraing
Kamsan, said Saturday that the new formula for allocating seats
should not come as a surprise. He said it was described more than
two months ago in election materials distributed to all 39
registered parties.
</P>
<P>
   But its intricacies and implications appeared to have escaped
them. Moreover, the election committee made no effort to point out
changes made since.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very, very worrying,'' Sam Rainsy said Saturday. It
appeared that his party's expected total would drop to 15 seats
from 18 under the newly publicized system.
</P>
<P>
   Ranariddh's projected total would drop to 43 seats, from 45. The
prince, who is in Bangkok for the weekend to play golf, made no
public comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's projected total would rise to 64 seats, from 59,
giving him the absolute majority to ensure his party's dominance
over legislative work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``So you see that the change in formula to allocate seats in
this case has a very high significance,'' said Peter Schier, an
electoral expert who represents the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, an
international democratic foundation that has been involved for two
years in preparing Cambodia's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just talk among some weird university eggheads, you
know,'' he said. ``This is politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now, he said, is whether the formula was changed
for technical reasons or whether the change was a political, though
apparently quite legal, sleight-of-hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have difficulties to believe that this was only a technical
change,'' Schier said, ``because as you know it has very big
political repercussions. It's a question of whether the biggest
party gets an absolute majority or not. So it seems to be a
political question, frankly speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote count itself is going excruciatingly slowly. Saturday
was to have been the day when the committee's ``official
preliminary results'' were to have been announced. But only a
trickle emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's spokesman, Samraing Kamsan, said the process of
collating, tabulating and verifying was taking a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, don't put me on the spot,'' he asked when pushed about
complete numbers. &QL;

   MARIS _ GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Roger Maris' family and friends in
Gainesville talk about how the Home Run Chase has brought their
dad's memory back to life, 13 years after he died of cancer. Three
of six children look just like him, refer to him in the present
tense, keep a daily vigil on the record and offer praise about Mark
McGwire while maintaining: ``We want Dad to keep the record.'' And
his widow admits she has mixed feeling about the home run race:
``It's exciting'' but it brings back memories of what he said was
the media's unfair treatment of her husband who lost his hair
because of the pressure. ``I really can't tell you how I'd feel''
if McGwire breaks the record. (Capozzi, PALM BEACH POST). 40.

   STREAK _ Twenty years ago this weekend, history brought Gene
Garber and Pete Rose together at Fulton County Stadium. Rose was
closing in on a record for hitting in consecutive games, and Garber
was just closing. Garber struck out Rose to end the streak and end
baseball's biggest story of 1978. Now Garber is a farmer, who tries
to stay as far away from baseball as possible. And Rose has been
exiled from baseball and is trying everything in his power to get
back in. One moment, two people, 20 years. (Rosenberg, Atlanta

A DYNAMO REDEFINES TURKS' ROLE IN THE WORLD
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A messenger recently visited the ambassadors
of Latin American countries in Ankara and handed all of them
something they had never seen before: an invitation to meet with
the foreign minister and discuss ways to improve relations between
Turkey and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Foreign Minister Ismail Cem summoned Turkey's
ambassadors in Africa home to lay plans for a new diplomatic
offensive on that continent.
</P>
<P>
   These sessions had to be wedged between Cem's frenetic foreign
travels, which have taken him to more than 30 countries in his
first year in office. He has visited the United States and almost
every European country and is planning trips to lands from
Argentina and Canada to India and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of his success is the stream of foreign dignitaries
visiting Turkey. The president of Romania and the prime ministers
of Spain and Italy have been here in recent days, and President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this decade Turkish foreign policy has been weak and
vacillating, reflecting the instability of Turkish governments and
Turkey's inability to find a new role to replace its Cold War
position as a front-line NATO state bordering the Soviet Union.
Foreign ministers have changed so often that some have barely had
time to furnish their offices, much less develop cogent strategies.
Cem's immediate predecessor, Tansu Ciller, was so uninterested in
the job that she often went weeks at a time without even appearing
at the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, Cem's energy and sweeping new visions
have come as an unexpected but welcome dose of adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to change the scope of our foreign policy,'' Cem
(pronounced jem) said in an interview, speaking colloquial English
as smoke curled from his pipe. ``We no longer perceive ourselves as
a country on the outer periphery of Europe. Of course we are part
of Europe. But now we see ourselves as a pivotal country in the
emerging geography of Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enormous amounts of oil and gas are beginning to flow out of
the Caspian basin. China is emerging as an economic giant. Goods
will soon be moving in huge volumes around this region. You only
have to look at a map, and to understand the size of the Turkish
economy, to realize that we are in a very new and very important
position.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Turkey suffered a humiliating setback when the
European Union refused to consider its application for membership.
But while some Turks reacted with anger and frustration, Cem calmly
asserted that Turkey had many other places to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his initiatives have required delicate balancing acts.
Turkey has cemented strong ties with Israel, for example, but has
also made new overtures to Iran, Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, notably in relations with Greece and the
Republic of Cyprus, he has not been able to make any substantial
progress.
</P>
<P>
   When traveling in what he calls ``the new Eurasian geography,''
Cem uses an approach that was anathema to his predecessors. He
portrays himself as the representative not only of a 75-year-old
republic, but also of the long Ottoman political tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey has for years had a foreign policy in which the
historical factor did not exist,'' he said. ``We are bringing that
factor back into play, and when I go to places like Macedonia,
Albania, Bosnia, Azerbaijan and central Asia, I see that it brings
a very positive response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Jerusalem, I was told very proudly that the walls of
the old city were built by a Turkish sultan. People are aware of
the history they share with us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cem, 58, is a member of the Democratic Left party, led by Deputy
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit. He studied political science in
Switzerland and has spent much of his career as a journalist,
including a spell as director of the state-run Turkish television
network. Photography is his private passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most intellectually interesting and thoughtful
foreign minister Turkey has had in some time,'' a European
ambassador said. ``When you talk to him you see his eyebrow curl,
and you have the feeling that he's really thinking things through.
Unfortunately, he runs into a wall in some countries because of
Turkey's human rights problems. I also have the feeling that he has
to take a tough line on Greece and Cyprus in order to have the
freedom to shape policy in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In his heart he's pro-Western, pro-European, modern and
liberal-minded,'' the ambassador said. ``That isn't true for
everyone in his party or everyone in his government.''

EMOTIONAL INDUCTIONS AT FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Induction ceremonies here on the front steps of
the Pro Football Hall of Fame are always full of emotion and
reflection. It was that way Saturday for Tommy McDonald, Anthony
Munoz, Mike Singletary and Dwight Stephenson.
</P>
<P>
   And it was especially that way for Paul Krause.
</P>
<P>
   Krause, 56, was a safety for the Washington Redskins (1964-67)
and the Minnesota Vikings (1968-79). He is the National Football
League's career leader in interceptions (81). His presenter, the
former Vikings coach Jerry Burns, called Krause a natural athlete
and a family man. He said that many critics contend that all Krause
did at his position was sit back, wait on the ball and play center
field.
</P>
<P>
   Burns' retort is, ``So did Willie Mays.''
</P>
<P>
   Krause was on the Hall of Fame ballot for the last two years but
missed out. This time, however, he scored and offered a tearful
tribute to his wife of 35 years, Pam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two and a half years ago, my wife was in a terrible car
accident,'' Krause said. ``She was in a coma for five and a half
months. The doctors told me she would not make it. They told me
that if I believed in God, I should start praying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been rough on our family for the last couple of years. I
didn't make the Hall of Fame during that awful time. And then I was
up for consideration again this year, and Pam said: `You're going
to make it this time. God wants me to be there when you get in.'
Well, Pam, it's happened just the way you said.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened for the Krause family in a special way.
</P>
<P>
   It happened for each family.
</P>
<P>
   It happened for Krause and McDonald and Munoz and Singletary and
Stephenson _the class of 1998, who now see their bronze busts
placed in the hallowed hall along with all of the others. There are
194 players in the Hall of Fame now. These five are now forever
part of the National Football League's rich history, and they have
earned its highest individual honor.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, 64, after being presented by Ray Didinger, a former
Philadelphia sportswriter, could not contain his glee. He danced to
the music of ``Staying Alive'' and asked each of his fellow
inductees to join him.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald played for the Philadelphia Eagles (1957-63), Dallas
Cowboys (1964), Los Angeles Rams (1965-66) and Cleveland Browns
(1968). He scored 84 touchdowns and averaged a touchdown reception
in one of every six catches. At 5 feet 9 inches and 175 pounds, he
is the smallest player ever to enter the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I seem excited or like I won the lottery?'' McDonald asked,
screaming. ``Yes! I'm in the Hall of Fame. Does it look like me?
Thank you Canton _ I love it!''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz, 39, was presented by his son, Michael, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz played all 13 of his seasons and 185 of his games with the
Cincinnati Bengals. He was the third player selected in the 1980
draft. He became the first player to earn 11 consecutive Pro Bowl
appearances. He is a member of the NFL's 75th anniversary team. He
is the first Hispanic to reach the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, though, meant as much to Michael as one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, thanks for always being there,'' Michael said. ``Thanks
for always keeping us in your heart on the road. Thanks for taking
us along when you could. Thanks for being Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz was moved. During his acceptance speech, he said of the
bronze bust that was placed next to him: ``I've been sculpted, just
like that, and my life has been full of so many details. I have
tried to be an offering; a sacrifice. I thank God. And I thank Dee
Dee, my wife and best friend for the last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Singletary, 39, played linebacker for the Chicago Bears for 12
consecutive seasons, the last one in 1992. He was tenacious,
ferocious and a leader. He missed just two games during his entire
career, and both were in 1986. He was the NFL Man of the Year _ the
most prestigious civic honor an NFL player can earn _ in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary became the first player to be presented by his wife.
Kim said that her husband's focus on excellence on the field
matched his focus on excellence within their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was blessed with great teammates,'' said Singletary, who was
part of the defense of the Bears' 1985 Super Bowl champion _ a
defense that is considered possibly pro football's best ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you reach for success in life you fall flat on
your face, and you need someone there to pick you up,'' he said.
``I had that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson, 40, said he did, too.
</P>
<P>
   He was the nucleus of the Miami Dolphins Super Bowl teams in
1983 and 1985, and was Miami's offensive center for all of his
career (1980-87). Eight seasons, 114 games. His presenter, Don
Shula, his former coach, said that because Stephenson was always in
great shape, Stephenson would still be playing pro football had it
not been for a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into the National Football League just hoping to be on
a football team,'' Stephenson said. ``I realize I did not get here
by myself.''

COMMENTARY: A CASE OF LIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The days and nights pass with excruciating slowness for Jeffrey
Blake. At age 29, he has spent more than a quarter of his life in
state prison. Now the man whose testimony put him in prison says he
was lying all along.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Garner has passed a lie detector test with his latest
story. The test results are no guarantee, but you need them with a
fellow like Garner. He's the kind of guy who will tell you in the
middle of a blizzard that the sun is shining and the temperature is
approaching 90.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1990 he told police and prosecutors that he saw Blake
murder two men in a car in the East New York section of Brooklyn.
He said he saw it with his own eyes, saw Blake running beside the
moving car, firing into it with an Uzi.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony was the only evidence against Blake and even the
lead prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Anthony Catalano, said
at a hearing that it ``was not a particularly strong case.'' But a
jury convicted Blake and he was sentenced to 36 years to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Catalano's comment was a gross understatement.
The case against Jeffrey Blake was virtually nonexistent. Dana
Garner is a flake who has claimed to have stumbled across several
homicides and has changed his story a number of times in the Blake
case. It now appears unlikely that he was even in New York on the
day the two men were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Garner testified in 1991 that his girlfriend, Margaret Allen,
had also witnessed the murders. In a sworn affidavit this month,
Ms. Allen, a resident of North Carolina, said: ``During the time I
was in Brooklyn, at no time did I ever witness two men being shot
in a car, nor any other murder. I would remember a murder if I had
seen one.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she and Garner had walked and hitchhiked from
North Carolina to Brooklyn in June of 1990, arriving in East New
York late in the month. While in Brooklyn, she stayed with Garner
at his grandmother's house, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The murders occurred on June 18. Not only did she not see them,
said Ms. Allen, but Dana Garner never mentioned to her that he had
seen them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allen did not testify at Blake's trial. A spokesman for
Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said he believed
investigators were unable to locate her.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators knew all along that Dana Garner's story was as
shaky as knickknacks in an earthquake. He tried to recant during
the trial but somehow was persuaded to go ahead with his original
account. In April 1993, while Blake was appealing his conviction,
Garner signed a sworn affidavit saying he had never witnessed the
killings, that he arrived in Brooklyn from North Carolina after
they had occurred and that he heard about them from people in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time to tell that story in court, he refused,
saying: ``I would like to plead the Fifth because it might
discriminate (sic) myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake's appeal was turned down. And that happened quietly,
routinely, which tells you something. There was no outcry from the
criminal justice system, no collective gasp at the fact that a man
could be sent to prison for many long years on the uncorroborated
word of an utterly worthless witness.
</P>
<P>
   Garner said that Blake had escaped in a brightly colored van
driven by a man named Tonto. But no van was found and no Tonto was
produced. The Uzi was never found. No corroborating evidence of any
kind was ever found.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Jeffrey Blake, his appeals exhausted, is serving 36
years to life in Green Haven, a maximum security prison in upstate
Dutchess County.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I spoke with Barry Schreiber, a deputy district
attorney in Hynes' office. Referring to Blake and the Legal Aid
lawyers representing him, Schreiber said: ``We haven't said to
them, `You've run out of legal options and we're not interested in
talking to you.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said the DA's office is interested ``if there is reason now
to believe that (Garner's) testimony was not truthful, that his
recantation is a legitimate one.''
</P>
<P>
   A meeting with Blake's lawyers has been scheduled, he said,
adding, ``If, in fact, an injustice was done because he's in fact
innocent, we're as interested in getting to the bottom of it as
they are.'' (BOX)

FOR CLEVELAND WOMEN, A NIGHT BASKETBALL LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ For Yvonne Pointer, the driving force behind the
nation's only women's midnight basketball league, the game is a
lure that has created new opportunities for women from Cleveland's
inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball has magnetism,'' said Ms. Pointer, the director of
Cleveland's Youth at Risk program. ``You just open the door to
these women, and it's like the field of dreams: They come. If you
took away the ball and made this an everyday `let's help you'
program,' you might not get five people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pointer was also instrumental in bringing men's midnight
basketball to Cleveland, in 1991, after she heard about the
program's success in pulling young men off the streets in the prime
time for committing crime and redirecting them to sports and
workshops on education and job training. That program draws a total
of about 180 men to three recreation centers in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pointer attended most of the men's games. When women at the
recreation centers kept asking her whether the city planned to
start a league for them, she realized that the program might work
for women at risk of lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   So the city's division of recreation got two sponsors _ the
Cleveland Rockers of the Women's National Basketball Association
and Nike _ and began to get the word out early this year through
fliers and radio announcements. Women 18 and older are eligible for
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the league had signed up 60 women for six teams
and accumulated 55 names on a waiting list. The teams, playing two
nights a week, recently celebrated the end of their first season
with an awards dinner. The league will resume play next year.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in both men's and women's midnight basketball are
required to attend the hour-long educational and job-related
workshop in the first part of the evening. Some of the men find the
workshops onerous. ``They tell me I make them think too much,'' Ms.
Pointer said.
</P>
<P>
   She has sometimes resorted to the dramatic to grab their
attention. For a workshop about urban violence, she arranged for an
undertaker to arrive in his hearse and explain to the men, in
gruesome detail, what he does to the bullet-pocked corpses that
wind up on his table.
</P>
<P>
   But the women have required no such theatrics to attract them to
the workshops. Many at the dinner said the sessions were their
favorite part of the program.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Traci Ledwell, 32. Even though she had not
played basketball in 12 years, Ms. Ledwell had been urged to join
the league by friends who remembered her glory days in high school.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the season, she was named most valuable player,
not only for her dribbling and driving, but also because the league
organizers thought she exemplified the mission of midnight
basketball. She attended every workshop and, encouraged by one, is
studying for her high school equivalency diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the league have also made positive changes. Two
others are studying for equivalency diplomas, five have found jobs
through networking with other players and four have received full
basketball scholarships.

FACTS WERE NOT BASIS OF THE JOHNSON RUMORS  
 CLEMENS RUMORS SPREAD  
 ALIENATING VAUGHN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Mass.)   (kd) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In light of the feeding frenzy that occurred in the days before
he was traded, Randy Johnson had become the major league-leading
subject of rumors. Johnson's status fueled so many erroneous
reports that it was nearly impossible to tell the players without a
scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like it,'' said Woody Woodward, the
Seattle general manager, who was the only person with firsthand
knowledge of the daily Johnson developments.
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, Woodward saw a glimpse of it earlier in the
season when there were two televised reports within a week in which
it was said that deals involving different players for Johnson had
virtually been completed between the Mariners and the Los Angeles
Dodgers. Fred Claire, who was then the Dodgers' general manager,
said some of the players supposedly being traded hadn't even been
mentioned in his talks with Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's news reports produced head-shaking developments
daily, serving only to confuse the issue of whether the Mariners
would trade their ace pitcher and, if so, to whom.
</P>
<P>
   At midweek, a Seattle newspaper reported that Madison Square
Garden Network had reported, then retracted during the same Yankees
telecast that the Mariners had traded Johnson to the Yankees. But
an MSG spokesman said later that the announcers, in the original
report, were simply quoting a report in a Seattle newspaper and
then had corrected it when the Yankees advised MSG that it wasn't
true.
</P>
<P>
   That same night the announcers on an ESPN telecast of the
Mariners' game with Cleveland declared that if the club didn't
announce a Johnson trade during the game, it would do so
immediately afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Word-of-mouth and newspaper reports were equally misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin, the Texas Rangers' general manager, said one of the
team's coaches received a telephone call from a friend who, he
said, was in position to know these things and that the friend had
said that Johnson and Mike Timlin were going to the Yankees for
Hideki Irabu, Ricky Ledee, Mike Lowell and Homer Bush. In addition,
the Yankees were said to be signing Johnson to a three-year
contract extension at $12 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   A report in a Toronto newspaper had the Blue Jays trading their
closer, Randy Myers, to the Yankees because the Yankees were going
to include their closer, Mariano Rivera, in a package for Johnson.
The Yankees did talk to the Blue Jays briefly about Myers, but that
was just another routine step in the thoroughness with which
General Manager Brian Cashman approached the trade market.
</P>
<P>
   Another newspaper report said the Mariners had given six teams,
including the Yankees, permission to speak with Johnson's agents
about an extension and that all six were believed to have had such
conversations. Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said he
heard that the Yankees had received permission to speak with
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, however, denied having given anyone permission to
speak with Johnson or his agents, and the pitcher's primary agent,
Barry Meister, said he had talked with no club. ``That's
ludicrous,'' Meister said of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but baseball rules also forbid that sort of
communication. The only time a team can gain permission to speak to
a player about a contract or anything else is after that team and
the player's team have reached agreement on a trade. The
commissioner's office then gives the receiving team 72 hours to
talk with the player.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians had generally
been portrayed as the leading contenders in the Johnson pursuit, a
late-week report quoted a source ``with his finger on the pulse of
the Johnson saga'' as saying the Los Angeles Dodgers had made an
offer that exceeded by far the offers those teams had made.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mariners did trade Johnson, just before the Friday
midnight deadline, he went to the Houston Astros, who hadn't
generated any misleading rumors all week. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FOR DODGERS, IT'S `WHAT IF . . .'
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers can only wonder what might have been. They can only
wonder where they might be in the standings now if the Mariners had
accepted one of the three proposals they made for Randy Johnson on
June 1. If the Mariners had said yes to a, b or c, if their
principal owner had not inexplicably yanked Johnson off the market,
the Dodgers could have had his services for two months already, and
they would have had the Johnson who dominates opposing batters, not
the Johnson who has spent the season sulking.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Johnson has finally been traded, executives close to
the talks between the Mariners and the Dodgers have related
previously undisclosed details of those negotiations. The same day
the Dodgers designated Hideo Nomo for assignment because he wanted
to be traded they presented a three-pronged proposal to the
Mariners. Seattle could take one of three pairs of players: Nomo
and Ismael Valdes, another starting pitcher; Nomo and Wilton
Guerrero, a second baseman, who also played the outfield, or Nomo
and Roger Cedeno, an outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Mariners' owner not blocked a Johnson trade, the
Mariners weren't necessarily going to grab one of the pairs of
players. The strategy was to get the Yankees involved and perhaps
extract an even better offer from them. Had that failed, the
Dodgers' deal still looked attractive.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the Mariners nor the Dodgers nor the Yankees got to
play out the scenario. And once the handcuffs were removed, the
Mariners apparently were not able to entice anyone into making the
kind of offer the Dodgers made in June. &QL;
</P>
<P>

CLEMENS RUMORS SPREAD
</P>
<P>
   The status of Roger Clemens created some weird developments last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin, the Texas general manager, said a reporter called
him in the early part of the week and said he understood the
Rangers were talking to the Blue Jays about Clemens. Melvin said
that was not so. But, he said, the report appeared in the newspaper
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said he previously had told his superiors that Clemens
was not available, and after the report appeared, Tom Schieffer,
the club president, called and asked what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Melvin _ and other general managers _ wound up talking
with Gord Ash, their Toronto counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday afternoon, Ash related, Randy Hendricks, Clemens'
agent, called and asked him to explore trade possibilities with
some contending clubs. The Blue Jays weren't going anywhere, and
the pitcher wanted to be with a team that had a chance to win
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result,'' Ash explained, ``we had discussions with a few
specific clubs. But we didn't feel the discussions with those clubs
were leading to anything we felt comfortable with so we elected not
to do anything. We're quite happy to have him here still and he's
happy to be here still, and we hope we can go on and build
something good for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, the Yankees and the Astros were among the teams Ash
contacted. Those conversations generated yet more rumors,
especially concerning the Rangers and the Yankees, but all of the
clubs felt the asking price was too steep. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STILL HITTING, JUST NOT FOR POWER
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez of Texas hit his 10th home run May 23. Since then
Henry Rodriguez of the Chicago Cubs and Alex Rodriguez of Seattle
have hit a total of 31 home runs. But Ivan has hit none. Ivan,
however, continues to hit impressively, batting .338 before
Saturday night's game, which put him only .007 behind league
leaders Bernie Williams of the Yankees and Todd Walker of
Minnesota.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALIENATING VAUGHN
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox seem to be going out of their way to alienate
Mo Vaughn. First they engage in either no negotiations or
acrimonious negotiations for a contract extension and then they
look for someone to take his position.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had been talking with the Florida Marlins about a
trade for Todd Zeile, a third baseman, whom they envisioned playing
at first base, bumping Vaughn to designated hitter, at least in
Reggie Jefferson's absence. The Red Sox didn't get Zeile because
they opted instead to acquire Mike Stanley from Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   So where did Stanley play in his first game for the Red Sox
Friday night? At first base, of course. And where was Vaughn? At
DH, of course.
</P>
<P>
   As for signing Vaughn and keeping him away from free agency, the
Red Sox have not shown the same interest as they had in making sure
that Pedro Martinez remained with them after this season.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Martinez signing is told by players who worked
out with him in the Dominican Republic last December while the Red
Sox were negotiating with his agents.
</P>
<P>
   One day Martinez came to the workout and told his friends he
might get $35 million from the Red Sox. The players were astounded,
but they urged him to sign quickly before the Red Sox change their
mind. Martinez came to the workout the next day and said the team
was offering $50 million. Now the others were incredulous. How is
this happening, they ask. ``My guys,'' Martinez replied, ``are
going in and saying I'm not sure he'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another day or so went by, and Martinez arrived at the workout
with a new tale. The Red Sox, he told his friends, wanted to give
him $75 million. And so it was that the richest contract in
baseball history was achieved. &QL;

NEW YORK BEGINS TO RAID AND CLOSE ADULT BUSINESSES

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Making good on longstanding promises to crack down on
the city's sex industry, police officers raided three topless clubs
late Friday, and building inspectors shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Saturday that the city had
padlocked the clubs in the first of a wave of closings aimed at
wiping out more than two-thirds of the city's sex shops and clubs
over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Uniformed officers burst into the three clubs late Friday and,
with dancers gyrating and patrons ogling, shouted, ``Police! Nobody
move,'' said Steven Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice
coordinator, who was part of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests were made, but dancers and patrons were told to leave
the buildings, which were then padlocked, Fishner said. Orange
stickers saying ``Closed by Court Order'' were posted on the
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The closings are in effect for three days and then can be made
permanent by courts. The clubs were Wiggles, in East Flatbush,
Brooklyn; El Coche, in Hunts Point, the Bronx, and Sharks, in
Midland Beach on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Jobo Salazar, 74, owner of El Coche, said he had thought that
his 27-year-old business complied with the law, and that he should
have been given a chance to correct any violations. ``We run a
clean establishment, and we always have,'' he said. ``Why were we
targeted?''
</P>
<P>
   The raids began just three days after the U.S. Supreme Court
gave Giuliani his final victory in a two-year battle to enforce a
1995 zoning law intended to eliminate pornographic shops, clubs and
theaters from all but a few designated areas, mostly industrial
sections of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The X-rated businesses had proved to be the most elusive target
on the mayor's checklist for a civil city, but he said Saturday
that he now believed he could close several of the businesses each
week until perhaps all but about 20 of the 144 such business in the
city were gone. During his five years in office, the Giuliani has
repeatedly condemned the businesses as ``corrosive institutions''
that destroy neighborhoods and blemish the city.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the city also sought closing orders for three clubs
in Queens and six theaters, bookstores and video stores in
Manhattan. The judges in those cases decided not to take them up
until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer for seven of the businesses
in Manhattan and Queens, said the city was using ``heavy-handed
tactics'' to close places that were attempting to comply with the
new zoning rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's ambition all along has been to stamp out these
adult establishments,'' Fahringer said. ``The inspectors are making
assumptions instead of carrying out meticulous investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishner said the city sought the 12 closing orders after
inspectors observed at least three violations at each of the
establishments. Dancers were seen simulating sexual intercourse at
the three clubs that were closed, Fishner said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They were emptied of the employees and the customers, and the
Police Department and the building inspectors brought down the
shutters and put padlocks on the premises,'' Fishner said. ``If
people are operating adult businesses in violation of the zoning
law, they should close now, because we're out there, we're
inspecting, and we're going to litigate each and every one of these
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that their long reprieve was ending, clubs and shops
throughout the city have begun making changes in an effort to
comply with the law. Some dancers now sport bikinis, and the shops,
which can devote no more than 40 percent of their floor space or
merchandise to sexually oriented material, now display tame videos
prominently up front and hide the racy fare in back.
</P>
<P>
   In Times Square, the neon ``Live Girls'' sign at Fun City is
dark, and the 24-hour shop has a sign saying, ``Closed for
Renovation to Meet City Ordinances.''
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, the mayor said the businesses will have
to ``substantially change the nature of what they're all about'' in
order to stay open.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, they've made big changes,'' he said. ``If they
slip back a month from now, or two or three, which I think is very
likely, then we'll be ready to close them.''
</P>
<P>
   A successful crusade against pornographers would be an important
conservative credential for Giuliani, who has begun speaking to
Republican audiences across the nation. He said Saturday that he
planned trips to New Hampshire and Iowa, which hold two of the more
important nominating contests in the presidential derby.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's political advisers have showed him polls indicating
he would be a popular national candidate, but he would have a rough
road to nomination because of his liberal stands on such issues as
immigration, gun control and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   His action won praise from residents of a five-story apartment
building within sight of El Coche in the Bronx, where a sign saying
``Topless Dancers Every Night'' is surrounded by blue, red and
yellow light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Omayra Camacho, who lives in a nearby apartment building, said
she was glad the bar was closed. ``My kids walk by there to go to
school,'' she said. ``I'm hoping it's closed for good.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar, the owner, said about 10 to 15 customers were in the
bar when 15 officers closed him down at 7:30 p.m. Friday. He said
he did not think he could make it as a regular bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have entertainment,'' he said, ``you die.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MOST IMPORTANT HUDDLE FOR THIS HALL OF FAMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Mike Singletary had put on his Pro Football Hall
of Fame gold jacket at Friday morning's ceremony in the Canton
Civic Center, and now he was walking near the two tables where his
family was sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy,'' called his 4-year-old daughter, Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled when he heard her, but it surprised him. Of his seven
children, Brooke is the quiet one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't get her to talk much,'' said Singletary's wife, Kim.
</P>
<P>
   And as the 24th Chicago Bear in the Hall of Fame, the most of
any team, Mike Singletary doesn't talk that much. With his
spectacles and his stare, he is a quiet one, studious and serious.
As a middle linebacker, his actions always spoke louder than his
words. They still do.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1985 defensive player of the year on the Super Bowl XX
champion Bears, and as an eight-time All-Pro, he was a brutal
tackler.
</P>
<P>
   When Singletary, who is black, married Kim, a white woman, he
got hate mail. Another husband might have hidden her, but he did
not.
</P>
<P>
   At his induction Saturday, Kim was his presenter, the first
woman in Canton history to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my best friend,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Alonzo Spellman could appreciate that. Singletary had been in
the Bears' defensive huddle with Spellman for only the 1992 season,
his last. But once a teammate, always a teammate. And during a
snowstorm last March 9, they suddenly were together again in a much
different huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say it was the most important huddle I've
ever been in,'' Singletary said. ``All those other huddles were in
a game. This huddle was about a man's life. And the Lord was in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Singletary wasn't bragging. He had to be asked to talk
about what happened that day with his 6-foot-4-inch, 292-pound
former teammate after the police had staked out the home of
Spellman's publicist, Nancy Mitchell, in Tower Lakes, Ill., where
Spellman had barricaded himself for eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I'm told, Alonzo began to lose his temper over
having to undergo a steroid test, so his publicist phoned 911,''
Singletary said. ``When the police got there, he wouldn't come out.
He wasn't abusive. He didn't have any weapons. He just didn't want
to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Singletary had heard about the stakeout when a former Bears
teammate, Jim Morrissey, phoned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the Bears, and they confirmed it,'' he said. ``Then
my wife, Kim, said, `You should go over there.' By the time I drove
there, Alonzo was furious and embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The police had surrounded the house, but Singletary went in to
talk to Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have a weapon or anything, but he was frustrated and
angry,'' Singletary said. ``I talked to him for about an hour.
Basically I just told him there were a lot of kids who look up to
him and want him to make the right decision. I told him a lot of
people loved him and cared for him, that he had to get on with his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman emerged quietly, then was hospitalized for psychiatric
care. ``I've gone to the hospital to visit him a few times,''
Singletary said.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Houston, Singletary had seen how his father,
Charles, now 77, a Pentecostal minister who built driveways and
foundations as a self-employed construction worker, talked to
people when a problem arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go with my father; he made me go,'' he said.
``It helped me tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Singletary remembered when the phone would ring in the morning
and his father would answer it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hear him say, `What time did he get in?' and then he'd
say, `Put the coffee on, I'll come over.' He'd tell me, `Let's go
talk to him.' When we got there, my father would get the guy
walking and then put him in the truck and take him to work. He knew
the guy needed a day's pay to feed his family. Even when the guy
would sleep half the day away, my father would give him a full
day's pay.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as his father took him along, Singletary, now a
motivational speaker for corporations and schools, often takes his
older children along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I go out to buy something,'' he said, ``I try to take
12-year-old Kristin and 10-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Jill. I
want them to see what it's like to negotiate, to deal with people,
to communicate, because they're going to have to do it themselves
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in a huddle, with or without the Lord.

   HOCKEY COLUMN: FROM PLAYER TO COACH, BY(lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years, Slava Fetisov was saying, and look how far he has
managed to come. Far enough, come to think of it, that returning to
New Jersey is akin to coming home. Far enough that he could eagerly
rejoin a dressing room where he was once the target of overt ire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players hate me, even before I come,'' Fetisov said.
``They call me Commie, all the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this man they called Commie has come back to coach.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years, Fetisov was saying on the telephone two days after
ending his historic 22-year playing career, is almost a wind chime
when measured against decades of ``the political stuff that poisons
everyone's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   So who would have thought that nine years after Lou Lamoriello
helped Fetisov strike the first blow against the doomed Soviet
sports empire, the Devils' appointment of Fetisov as an assistant
coach last Wednesday would be sparingly presented as an
unintentional yet symbolic footnote to the Goodwill Games?
</P>
<P>
   Former Central Red Army star named National Hockey League
assistant coach. In this context, it is a much bigger story than
the way it was played. Lamoriello and the Devils not only reached
out for one of their own but also demonstrated, again, a political
vision beyond the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   One could argue, I suppose, that the Devils and the teams that
recruited veterans like Fetisov and Igor Larionov from the Soviet
national team at the turn of the last decade were merely mining
another untapped source of superior talent.
</P>
<P>
   But by allowing the 40-year-old Fetisov to make the leap from
player to coach, the Devils are sending a different kind of message
altogether. While Vladislav Tretiak, the great Russian goalie, has
been a part-time instructor for the Chicago Blackhawks, Fetisov has
broken full-time ground. A barrier into management has fallen, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's earned this,'' Lamoriello, the Devils' president and
general manager, said. ``He's overcome so much. I didn't know
Jackie Robinson or Larry Doby, but you need a certain character to
do what Slava did. If there was any one person who had to be the
pioneer, he was the one.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the first African-Americans in major-league baseball
didn't have it bad enough, imagine comparable emotions turned loose
in a hockey rink. Imagine a Soviet defenseman, the embodiment of
the ideological enemy, his back turned, in the corner, with the
onrushing skater seeing red. Imagine the reactions of the North
Americans who worried that more of these inscrutable Russians were
on the way to displace them, like so many Third World factory
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello said he feared the early nights on the road would be
especially cruel, and they were. Fetisov did not know the league or
the language, the cuisine or the customs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pretty miserable time,'' Fetisov said. ``But for fact, we
changed the system, and guys followed.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL, just under 20 percent European the last few years, is a
melting pot that still roils with nationalistic bigotry. By and
large, though, financial success and numerical strength in the
global sports village have made for a more comfortable coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People not from the same neighborhood will always have
problems getting along,'' Doug Brown of the Detroit Red Wings said.
``That's the way human beings are. But if you can take the heat and
find a way to win, you're OK. The Russians have earned their
stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   If they have, then Brown played a role, as a young Devils
forward, a Boston College history major whose parents were teachers
and, he said, taught him to respect those who looked or sounded
different from him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who most helped relieve his early isolation, Fetisov
answered, ``Doug Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   They exchanged few words at first, only knowing smiles. They
lived in the same housing complex. Their families grew close.
Fetisov became godfather to one of Brown's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my teammate and I was his friend,'' Brown said. ``Being
a history major, I was interested in what he had to say about
communists, their system and obviously all the great hockey
experiences he'd had.''
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, where Fetisov and Brown were reunited in 1995 after
they had left the Devils, the man who liked to refer to himself as
Brownov became close with other Russians, like Larionov and Sergei
Fedorov.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered mightily with them following the car crash that
debilitated Vladimir Konstantinov hours after the first of their
two Stanley Cups a little more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that even those in the NHL who still might not like
the Russians respect Fetisov, whom he called ``a communicator who
will be magnificent as a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello said he actually had Fetisov in mind for a
post-playing job as far back as 1995, when the Devils swept Detroit
in the Stanley Cup finals, and Fetisov went out of his way to hug
everyone on his former team.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed, Lamoriello said, as if he were still one of them.

AS NBA UNION DIRECTOR, BILLY HUNTER HOLDS NO PUNCHES

<P>
   Billy Hunter leaned over a conference table in a suite of
Manhattan law offices one day last June and stared at David Stern,
the commissioner of the National Basketball Association. With the
NBA's owners threatening to lock out the players in an increasingly
strained labor dispute, Hunter, the executive director of the
players union, spoke with a provocative bluntness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be shortsighted,'' Hunter said he told Stern. ``We've
got to look and say, `Are we prepared to go down the same road that
baseball went down?''' Hunter said he noted that baseball had not
yet fully recovered from its 1994 players strike and that he told
Stern he was not convinced that the support for basketball was as
great as it was for the national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to say it, but we have a game that's
predominantly black,'' Hunter said he told Stern. ``I don't know if
there is the same kind of fan loyalty and commitment to the game.
Just because of perceptions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, as is his style, had forcefully introduced race into a
labor negotiation, implying that, as he called it, ``white
America'' might simply turn off to basketball if next season were
delayed and jeopardized by a long lockout. The aggressive tactic,
say those who know Hunter well, was hardly atypical for the former
federal prosecutor who had already won a major victory against
Stern and the league this year in his fight on behalf of Latrell
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, the issue was whether David Stern could sell
black basketball to white America,'' Hunter said in a recent
interview. ``He was able to do it. He was able to market the
players, and all of a sudden this thing took off and became bigger
than life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have circumstances changed, so that if we're confronted with a
long lockout and a strike, concerns about player image and conduct
will not be a factor?'' Hunter asked. ``I'm not saying it's for
certain. I'm just saying it's something we have to consider because
of baseball. Baseball is still perceived as not a black game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Hunter concluded, ``sometimes maybe I should
probably keep my mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, for his part, dismissed Hunter's warning as mere
grandstanding. In an interview, he said he did not believe race
would play any role in how fans reacted to a lengthy labor fight.
He recounted the commercial and endorsement success of the league's
black stars over the last decade, mentioning Michael Jordan often.
And he said it was inappropriate for Hunter to inject questions of
race into a negotiating session involving dozens of lawyers and
league officials, saying, ``We don't think that's the time.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a volatile time for the NBA, which is facing the very
real possibility of its first work stoppage. Despite remarkable
growth and success _ the league, for instance, signed a series of
television contracts last fall that totaled $2.6 billion _ team
owners are contending that their profits are in danger. They blame
soaring player salaries _ deals that now quite ordinarily run into
the tens of millions of dollars _ and they point out that many of
the league's perennial all-stars, including Jordan, are preparing
for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   For the players, the standoff is about preserving their right to
earn whatever they can, while underscoring their belief that they,
through their talents, wield the ultimate power in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout is now a month old, and the only negotiations that
have occurred involved the question of when to meet again. The two
sides are expected to hold their first substantive negotiations in
more than a month on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the players have the resolve, if we stand together, the
players are the game,'' Hunter said. ``There is no game without the
players, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Urging Solidarity, Expanding His Base
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, 54, is the union's fourth executive director and
arguably its most ambitious, assertive advocate. In June, he
persuaded 12 of the NBA's young stars to boycott the world
championships in Athens, depriving the league, he argued, of
additional publicity and prestige. He has also reached out to
players in the Women's National Basketball Association, trying to
persuade the women in the nascent league to unionize and join his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who took the job in 1996 _ a year after the union was
attacked as inadequate by the players themselves _ has spent nearly
two years pushing for solidarity and expanding his power base,
attempting to galvanize the often ambivalent, disparate group of
millionaire athletes. For the moment, his effort appears to have
worked, with the players publicly holding firm on their consensus
for confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is a worker who gets out there and unifies people,''
said Patrick Ewing, the Knicks center and president of the players
association. ``We believe in Billy. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' Buck Williams, the union's former president, said:
``You can talk about his background and all his accomplishments and
how they relate to the job. But the best thing about this job and
Billy is he won't capitulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Born George William Hunter in 1943, Hunter was raised by his
mother's grandparents, John and Loretta Holmes, in Cherry Hill,
N.J. For Hunter, issues of race percolated into his life in
different ways throughout his childhood. He was, for example, a
member of the first integrated Little League team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I lived in a segregated community, a lot of my
friends were white,'' he said. ``So I was like the black kid who
got to leave the black neighborhood to go into the white
neighborhood and play with all the guys. My athletic ability opened
a lot of doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter grew up to be a four-sport star, but when the screen door
wasn't slamming and he wasn't sprinting to another game, he spent
time being enthralled by his family's history. His grandfather's
brother, Uncle Ben, regaled him with stories. There was the tale of
William Still, a great-great grandfather who helped run the
underground railroad in Philadelphia. The stories seemed exotic and
exciting, if far removed. Now they are invaluable inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young kid growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, you never
really thought about it,'' Hunter said of the environment his
family survived and the contributions it made. ``Black history
hadn't come into fruition or being. It wasn't taught, so there was
no relevance. No one was promoting black contributions to America.
But then the '60s came along and Alex Haley's `Roots.' It made you
think about your past.''

</P>
<P>
   From Jim Jones to Patty Hearst
</P>
<P>
   Hunter went on to college, where, as a football player at
Syracuse, he helped organize the school's boycott of Southern
schools whose stadiums were segregated. He eventually played as a
defensive back and kick returner in the National Football League,
with the Washington Redskins and the Miami Dolphins, before
injuries curtailed his career. He returned to school and soon had
law degrees from Howard University and the University of California
at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   President Carter appointed him U.S. attorney for Northern
California in 1977, and Hunter helped prosecute a wide range of
criminals _ from surviving members of Jim Jones' People's Temple
cult after the mass suicide in Guyana to members of the Hell's
Angels motorcycle group. Hunter also persuaded Carter to pardon
Patty Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter recalled meeting with Hearst when her pardon was near:
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, I said to her: `I can't believe I'm the one who
makes a recommendation whether you go free. Here I am, a kid who
came from a very poor, black environment. And here you are, on the
opposite end. I mean, your grandfather is William Randolph Hearst.
How do we intersect at this point and time?'
</P>
<P>
   ``She just chuckled,'' Hunter said, ``and said, `That's amazing,
isn't it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In private practice, Hunter specialized in entertainment
litigation and white-collar criminal defense work, earning a
reputation as an aggressive, even physical champion of his clients.
He almost came to blows with Bobby Brown, the recording artist, in
one case. In another, he wrestled with an opposing lawyer who had
used a racial epithet. And always, there were the pro bono cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would take cases of young guys that had recently been
arrested for one thing or another and represent them,'' said Bill
Webster, one of Hunter's former partners. ``They were always
someone's kids he knew or a member of the church. Sometimes, he was
loyal to a fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, his loyalty to his clients remains formidable, even if
the clients, the players of the NBA, are less than indigent and
occasionally less than appealing.
</P>
<P>
   When Latrell Sprewell, who had attacked and choked his coach,
P.J. Carlesimo, was suspended for a year and his contract with the
Golden State Warriors was voided, Hunter took on the league. He
argued that the punishment was too severe, that the league and the
team had improperly acted together. He argued hard, but not
dangerously. He rejected, for instance, any claim that race played
a role in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   And he won. An arbitrator eventually held that the suspension be
reduced and Sprewell's multimillion-dollar contract be honored.
Stern's power had been checked.
</P>
<P>
   Alter Egos on Opposite Ends
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, David and he are somewhat cut from the same
cloth,'' said Dave Bing, the Hall of Fame guard who befriended
Hunter in his freshman year at Syracuse in 1962, and who
recommended him for the job of leading the players union. ``They're
both can-do kind of people. They understand the marketing
possibilities, what the league is and what it can become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if David's met his match, but I do know with both
of them sitting down a deal will eventually be struck. They both
know how much the game means.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is not to say Hunter is unprepared to fight. Hunter has
taken to calling the richest collection of athletes in sports
history ``underdogs,'' urging them on in their game of economic
chicken with the owners. As a result, the players have refused all
proposals regarding phasing out a clause in the collective
bargaining agreement that allows teams to pay their own free agents
whatever they want to retain them _ the so-called Larry Bird
exception rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to revamp it,'' Hunter said of the rule, one that,
for instance, has allowed the Bulls to pay Jordan salaries of $30
million a year. ``They want to fix it so it performs the way they
want it to perform over the next eight to 10 years. So what happens
historically is that when they threaten the lockout or the loss of
the paycheck, the players have capitulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said the only way for the owners ``to get what they
really want is to enforce some pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter thus has related a tale to more than half the league's
players over the last several months, a simple story about resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember when I was a young kid, 10 or 11 years of age,
there were guys in my neighborhood who, if they started something,
said something to my relatives, I would always go in there and
fight,'' he said. ``And many of them I fought because I knew I
could beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as soon as they fought me back, and they had demonstrated
they were willing to fight _ and I wasn't so sure that it was going
to be a slam dunk _ then I was more reluctant to fight. And I
wanted to find some other way we could reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became a negotiator, man. I wanted to befriend them. When I
realized they were throwing punches, too, it wasn't so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, on behalf of the players, is ready to start throwing
punches.

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKEE FANS CAN LIVE WITH THIS OUTFIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Yowls of rage echoed from hillside to hillside,
carried across the gray waters of Puget Sound: That's it? That's
all these blankety-blanks could get for the certified best pitcher
in Mariners history?
</P>
<P>
   There is another cry, new to this rather insular little corner
of the Lower 48: go Astros.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no shrieks of anger from Yankee fans, however.
The Yankees were in the chase for Randy Johnson, but justice was
served, and he went to Houston for nothing that will satisfy this
town. The Yankees, on the other hand, do not need Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday's game, the Yankees had the best record in
the majors _ 76 victories against only 27 losses. This kinder,
gentler era of Yankee fans will surely agree that it would have
been overkill to get Johnson. Why get greedy? Let the Yanks win it
with worthies like Cone and Pettitte and Wells and Hernandez and
Irabu, who pitched so well Friday night knowing he might be sent on
his way in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu became a true Yankee on Friday night by swallowing the
emotions that have caused him so much grief, and concentrating on
beating the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think about myself,'' he said afterward, when the
witching hour had passed, and he could still play for the team he
had pursued so blatantly from 9,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   This bunch should be quite good enough for anybody, even the
owner. He and his general manager, Brian Cashman, have done so well
in accumulating this Yankee team that a Randy Johnson would have
been an intrusive transplant.
</P>
<P>
   There was _ probably still is _ old-fashioned Yankee paranoia
about having to face a very good Cleveland team for the pennant,
only to find the Indians fortified with a Randy Johnson for two
killer starts in a four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   That's not happening, unless further mischief takes place
between now and the trading deadline of Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we face Randy in the World Series, fine with me,'' Manager
Joe Torre said. ``I'll take my chances with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman will undoubtedly be sweating this one out from now until
the Yankees win the World Series. He knows expectations will be
high once the Yankees win game 110, 115, 120 or whatever. He knows
that anything short of a world championship will be construed as
failure, but that is a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Mariners' management, the Yankees look good
by refusing to panic and sending away several good players for
Johnson, whose contract expires after this season, and who is about
to turn 35 with a history of back trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners got two minor leaguers and the proverbial player to
be named later. Weeks ago they could have got Ismael Valdes and
Wilton Guerrero from the Dodgers for Johnson, but ownership
dithered, and did not allow its baseball people to conclude the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, there is the feeling of ownership closing the books
on an investment that had run its course, a rather contemptuous
signal from an organization building a $500 million ball park next
door, on the good will and votes and financial support of the
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have the opposite problem. There is no guarantee
where the team will be playing a few years from now, but for this
year the Yankees are stocked. Sunday, David Cone pitches against
whomever the Mariners can recruit from the legions of the lost
sleeping in doorways down by the docks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised at the deal,'' Cone said Friday night, and
this is a man who does not surprise easily, having been shuttled
from league to league in the interests of summer house cleaning and
budget balancing in this era of eight-digit salaries per season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected something different,'' Cone added, presumably
meaning that Johnson would stay in the American League, maybe even
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Was Cone relieved that team chemistry was not being altered?
``I'm relieved that we don't have to face one of the best pitchers
in the major leagues on Sunday,'' he said. ``We have played very
well, but I don't think anybody on this team would have been upset
at getting Randy.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Irabu might have been upset. He understood the rumors,
said George Rose, the young American-born businessman who has found
a strange new life as Irabu's full-time translator.
</P>
<P>
   Rose accompanied Irabu to the bullpen to warm up before the
game, both knowing that life could change in a couple of hours. It
is a kick for Rose to wear a Yankee jacket above his khaki slacks,
but he knows his language skills are of value to the pitcher,
wherever he may toil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bigger than me,'' Rose said, after the danger had passed.
``His heart is bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu showed immense heart, especially to Torre. The pitcher put
together seven innings, marred only by three homers, and ran his
record to 10 victories and 4 losses, which is about normal on this
club.
</P>
<P>
   The players are having the collective season of their lives.
There is a deep sense of justice that they go into the championship
rounds together.  &QL;

AUTO-RACING COLUMN: SAFER TRACKS WOULD MEAN THOSE WITH BEST SKILLS
WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH SIANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moments before the start of the Indianapolis 500, you can look
out from the front stretch grandstands and see human beings packed
together, hip to hip and dozens of rows high, for at least
three-quarters of a mile to your left and to your right _ to say
nothing of the wall of faces directly across from you.
</P>
<P>
   But when these 300,000 people stand in absolute silence for a
Memorial Day tribute, suddenly you can feel as alone and as
intimate as if standing before a loved one's grave. Like an
asteroid passing Jupiter, at least some part of your emotions must
feel the pull that this great mass of souls exerts.
</P>
<P>
   Then something intrudes. It's a realization: Cleaving the middle
of the multitude of heartbeats _ sometimes just yards away from
them _ is a strip of pavement. And in a few minutes 33 cars will
start moving on that pavement at more than 220 miles an hour, their
tires spinning furiously enough to launch one into the air, where
even the highly skilled men who drive them will be unable to
control them.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone in that crowd who has ever had that unsettling awareness
doesn't want to dwell on it too long. And, after the tragedy last
Sunday at the Michigan International Speedway, everyone in all the
crowds that pack all the speedways around the United States
certainly have to ponder it at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Three spectators were killed last Sunday when a tire from Adrian
Fernandez's race car flew into the Michigan grandstands after a
crash during the U.S. 500 Indy-car race. The term ``freak
accident'' is amorphous, meaningless _ most fatalities I've seen in
motor racing were, in retrospect, preventable with existing
technology; it trivializes the complexities of a tragedy and
insults its victims.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you do have to wonder what could have saved these three
people. How much higher did that debris fence have to be to stop
that tire? Should Penske Speedways, one of the most professional
and fan-conscious track operators, have reasonably been expected to
figure that out and take the necessary precautions?
</P>
<P>
   When Lyle Kurtenbach was killed by a flying tire in the Indy 500
in 1987, lawyers for his widow asked such questions. There was an
out-of-court settlement with the speedway, with an agreement not to
disclose terms.
</P>
<P>
   How do you even define safety? Fans are surely much better
protected than the drivers and even crew members and race
officials. And most tracks aren't nearly as fast as Michigan, Indy,
Daytona, Talladega and the new California Speedway at Fontana _ the
fastest of America's superspeedways _ so the risks from flying
debris, as minuscule as they may in fact be at the biggest tracks,
are even smaller everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lack of reasons for any track owner to take every
possible precaution to protect the customers: Start with a basic
respect for life and work your way down to keeping the insurance
actuaries from putting you out of business.
</P>
<P>
   But are the fans as safe, for instance, as those at baseball and
football games? I once saw a spectator killed at Shea Stadium by a
model airplane during a Jets halftime show, so anything's possible.
But the basic answer is: Obviously not, and they probably can never
be.
</P>
<P>
   There is a leap of faith every racing fan takes upon walking
into a grandstand. On the first line of defense are the skills of
the race drivers themselves. Just as those people who stand a few
yards ahead of each tee at the Masters demonstrate their deepest
faith that Tiger Woods is not going to shank one, so the racing fan
believes that Bobby Rahal and Paul Tracy are not going to let their
wheels touch at 230 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, though, there are concrete walls (the one at Indy
has stood guard immovably) and cable-reinforced debris fences. They
have done a very good job so far, passing the only two tests that
seem to matter: society tolerates the level of risk posed to fans,
and ticket sales keep growing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet everyone in the sport would agree there are too many
grieving relatives and friends in Michigan right now.
</P>
<P>
   One answer is to stop testing the height and strength of those
fences and walls so often. In the last 15 years, whenever I've seen
a hood or a windshield or some other stray part flying into the
seats or ripping a gash in a debris fence, it has usually been at
one of those superfast speedways. So I'd like to suggest that all
the major sanctioning groups impose the following restrictions on
anyone who wants to build a new speedway and get a major race date:
</P>
<P>
   _ No more tracks longer than a mile. Keep them short, for
tighter corners and lower straightaway speeds. Any builder who says
he cannot install enough seats to make a profit can buy two tickets
to a Winston Cup race at the half-mile Bristol Motor Speedway _
assuming, that is, he can find two unsold tickets among the 130,000
for each race.
</P>
<P>
   _ No more high-banked turns. The banking in the turns at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway is 9 degrees. That might not have
seemed like much 90 years ago, when the place was built, but it's
too much now. Six degrees at most should do, or take a cue from
another track that has been around for 90 years and is still
thriving: the Milwaukee Mile. Its turns are virtually flat, and the
Foyts and the Andrettis and the Unsers of this world never had a
problem getting around it. Chip Ganassi, the hottest car owner in
CART right now, will open a track just like Milwaukee outside
Chicago next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ While we're at it, make those turns longer. That way, the
grandstands can be built well back from the track, and fans will
still have a good view of the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   _ No more tri-ovals. Track builders love to put a gentle arc or
a slight dogleg or two in their front straightaway. It makes it
longer, meaning there are more of the highest-priced seats to sell.
But simple geometry says there are 360 degrees in a circle, and if
you spread a few of them out on a straightaway, the two big turns
at each end of an oval are opened up _ and thus faster. From now
on, let straightaways be just that: arrow straight.
</P>
<P>
   Such tracks will force drivers to slow down for the turns and
drive their way out of them. In other words, the best skills, not
just the fastest car, determines the winner. It should be the kind
of racing that draws plenty of fans, all of whom will still be
talking about it when they get home.

SCHOOL OVERCROWDING MAY EASE THANKS TO SLOWING ENROLLMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After seven years of galloping growth, enrollment in
the New York City public school system has suddenly begun to slow
down, puzzling demographers but bringing relief to school
officials, who for years have had to accommodate swelling numbers
of children in cramped and aging schools.
</P>
<P>
   Projections show that this year, enrollment will rise by 3,000
to 4,000 students, roughly one-fifth of the average increase of
19,000 over the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for the slowdown _ and whether it will continue _
is a mystery, though Board of Education officials cite two main
factors: fewer babies being born as baby boomers reach the end of
their childbearing years, and more children leaving the city
schools, some in favor of nearby suburbs, others to return to their
home countries.
</P>
<P>
   Because predicting school enrollment is an inexact science,
educators warn that even if the increase in overall enrollment
slows to a trickle, some neighborhood schools will remain
overcrowded, and a few will continue to see rapid growth. Still,
with the economy booming and city coffers flush, the trend, if it
continues, could offer school officials the first opportunity in
years to repair crumbling buildings, erect new ones and reduce
class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, school enrollment _ because it is based not only
on birth rates but on far-flung wars and crises that draw
immigrants to the city _ has fluctuated wildly.
</P>
<P>
   It grew sharply at the turn of the century with heavy
immigration from Europe, and again in the 1960s when baby boomers
reached the schoolhouse door, peaking in 1971 at 1.1 million
children. In the early 1980s, it dipped to below 920,000, and the
school system sold several buildings, only to see major increases
beginning in 1990 as the children of baby boomers and a new wave of
immigrants started school. Today, nearly one of every two
school-age children in the city is born to an immigrant parent.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, the numbers are expected to flatten out. Then, in what
seems unthinkable at the moment, the New York City school
population is expected to start shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, public school enrollment is not expected to flatten
until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   For years, children in the city's most crowded school districts
have been squeezed into coat rooms, spread out in hallways and
packed into temporary trailers, while city officials bickered over
the extent of overcrowding and how many new schools should be
built. Meanwhile, the School Construction Authority had its budget
slashed and, instead of building new schools, spent its resources
leasing empty warehouses for classrooms _ often at exorbitant
prices _ and repairing crumbling schools.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the slowdown in enrollment growth is likely to raise new
questions about where and how to spend city construction dollars.
Should the city repair the oldest and worst buildings, speed up new
construction, or continue to erect trailers in schoolyards? Should
it seek to change community school district lines to shift students
from more crowded districts to less crowded ones? And how will the
system accommodate today's elementary schoolchildren when they
begin to crowd into high schools in the next few years?
</P>
<P>
   Some education officials say the slowdown in enrollment growth
should not be used to justify delaying school construction and
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, even with the slowdown in enrollment growth and
16,000 new seats _ primarily in trailers and leased buildings _ the
schools will still exceed their capacity by 65,000 students,
according to Board of Education figures.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moreover, as today's elementary school students move up, the
high school population is also expected to grow, forcing school
officials to add space in high schools and the extras that older
students need _ including expensive items like science labs and
gymnasiums.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, new state laws require schools to offer prekindergarten
classes starting this fall and reduce class sizes in the early
grades in the fall of 1999. With slowing enrollment growth, those
mandates may become less difficult to carry out in certain
neighborhood school districts.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that many more students seem to be leaving the
city's public schools, one explanation for the downturn in school
enrollment growth. In the 1996-97 school year, for instance, 44,600
students left, compared with 40,600 the year before and 38,800 the
previous year. According to board figures for the most recent year,
nearly 4,500 moved to New Jersey and 4,800 to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Like children moving to other states, the number of students who
returned to their home countries grew considerably over the last
two years: 2,800 students returned to the Dominican Republic in
1996, compared with 1,800 the year before, while 744 went back to
Mexico in 1996, compared with 487 the year before. School officials
who work with immigrant students say it is not unusual for
immigrant parents to send their children back home when they reach
the troublesome years of adolescence, but did not know whether the
increase would turn out to be a long-term trend.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus from the city schools, others said, could signal a
growing dissatisfaction with the system, especially among
middle-class parents _ both immigrant and native-born _ who can
afford to take their children elsewhere as the students remaining
in the city's public schools become poorer and poorer; last year,
more than 80 percent of elementary and middle school students had
family incomes low enough to qualify for free lunches, compared
with 72 percent in 1990, Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics
and planning at the Wagner School of Public Affairs at New York
University, said.

ON TO KENWOOD CUP WITH NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Hawaii, Mich.)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Driving across the Golden Gate Bridge recently on his way to
work, Paul Cayard gave way to idle reflection. He was an hour
behind schedule at his San Francisco office. And, trying as he is
to begin an America's Cup campaign, each of his calendar hours
looks more like a week of commitments. Not a good time to be
running late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was late,'' the 39-year-old yachtsman said recently.
``But I was thinking, `I'm not in a hurry.' A year ago, I would
have been completely stressed out. But the Whitbread race has put
everything in perspective. Alone in the Southern Ocean, the way we
were, there were those moments where you are really scared. And
that really makes an impression on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The adrenaline-charged reports that Cayard sent by satellite
from the 60-foot EF Language are history now. Regarded at its
finish last May as a stunning victory for a team of mostly
round-the-buoy sailors, the achievement by the EF crew in the
Whitbread Round the World Race was also a personal triumph for
Cayard.
</P>
<P>
   But now it is back to rounding orange inflatable buoys instead
of eerie white icebergs. And the next event on the list is the 11th
biennial Kenwood Cup, which is expected to begin Monday off
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   To get back into day-racing, Cayard has agreed to sail as
tactician on Illbruck-Pinta a One Design 48 being chartered for the
Hawaii series by an aspiring around-the-world team from Germany.
The Germans are so committed to the next equivalent of the
Whitbread in 2001-2002, which will be called the Volvo Ocean Race,
that they purchased EF Language and EF Education, both former
Whitbread competitors _ for training purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In charge of Illbruck-Pinta will be John Kostecki of San
Francisco, the regular Illbruck skipper who also happens to have
signed on with Cayard to participate in his America One 1999-2000
America's Cup campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's John's program,'' Cayard said about the Illbruck. ``I've
got a huge load on my shoulders with America One, and I want to
limit my responsibilities in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cayard is struggling to find the $20 million or more in
corporate sponsorship that he (and most of the other 15 cup
challengers) are still seeking. In addition, Cayard has lost
several key members of his team to competing syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   The first defection came last year when Laurent Esquier,
Cayard's veteran cup manager, took a job with Prada, the Italian
challenger. Last spring, Steve Erickson, a longtime friend and
sailing cohort in the Whitbread Round the World Race, also took a
position with Prada. Then last week, Kimo Worthington left America
One. Worthington is expected to sign on with Young America, the New
York Yacht Club team.
</P>
<P>
   For Kostecki, a vital member of the America One effort who has
remained loyal to Cayard, sailing with his America's Cup boss is a
two-way street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, adding Paul Cayard to our Illbruck-Pinta crew is a
nice bonus for the Kenwood Cup,'' Kostecki said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day Kenwood series includes eight day races: four ocean
triangles and four windward-leeward courses of about 10-12 nautical
miles each. On Friday there will be a 150-mile middle-distance race
from Honolulu to Maui, and on Aug. 11 a 376-mile race from Oahu to
Maui and back.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   America's Cup teams are revving up their intensity now, with
many sailors choosing to hone their skills in the Kenwood Cup. Also
scheduled to race off Hawaii is Peter Gilmour, the intense but
amicable skipper from Australia who has signed on with the Japanese
Nippon team.
</P>
<P>
   Also competing is John Kolius, helmsman for the 1D48 Abracadabra
and skipper for the Aloha Racing Team of Hawaii, and Dawn Riley,
the Detroit sailor who plans to campaign the America True boat in
the 1999-2000 America's Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the One Design 48 yachts have been transported to Hawaii
for the regatta. Their presence is being felt by Ken Morrison,
Kenwood's race director for the last 20 years. Since its inception
as the Clipper Cup in 1978, the biennial regatta has featured team
racing based on handicap rules for differently designed boats.
</P>
<P>
   But that mix is eroding, as is overall participation. A weak
Asian economy this year has reduced the number of handicap entries
from Japan, as well as from Australia and New Zealand. In 1982
there were a record 82 boats; now there are about 30.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, the six 1D48 yachts are not competing in the
long-distance race, because of a tight shipping schedule. That
leaves 24 boats to sail the last and most important race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look very closely at the proliferation of One
Design 48s,'' Morrison said about realistic prospects for a greater
one-design fleet in the Kenwood Cup 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ The Hamptons didn't exactly offer President
Clinton a red carpet and a clamorous ovation this weekend. The
greeting was more confused than that, more complicated, muted.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there were the high-profile parties, being thrown by the
likes of the investment banker Bruce Wasserstein and the actors
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, where the president is expected to
raise some $2 million for the Democratic National Committee. And
there was the hospitality of Steven Spielberg, who offered his
Georgica Pond estate to the president and first lady, arguably as
desirable a place to spend the night as the Lincoln bedroom. But
those were the celebrities and big-money folks who give the
Hamptons their reputation and cachet. The ordinary affluent
weekenders who give the Hamptons their crowds and soaring
real-estate prices, and the year-rounders, who generally can't wait
for September, responded with a more layered enthusiasm. Glamour
and power are no big deal here, after all; they come with the
territory. Hence: no bunting. No yahoos waving flags and wearing
campaign hats.
</P>
<P>
   For a party, The Barefoot Contessa, a gourmet food market in
East Hampton, baked about 80 vanilla cupcakes with American flags
done in marzipan. Amagansett, a smaller town, put on a more
patriotic display, welcoming the president's motorcade Saturday
morning with flags lining Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest welcoming sign was on the side of the Stephen
Talkhouse, a music club in Amagansett, where Jefferson Starship, a
band from the era when Clinton was not inhaling marijuana, played
on Friday night. The enormous sign, on behalf of a 17-year-old chef
at the club, Eiji Shiga, read: ``Welcome Bill and Hillary, Please
help keep our friend, Eiji, out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiga, who is awaiting sentencing for a series of robberies, is
a well-spoken young man who admits he deserves to go to prison but
who hopes for a lenient sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he'll see the sign, say, `What's up with that?' and stop
in,'' Shiga said of the president, with a hopeful grin.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people expressed their lack of interest by not showing
up this weekend at all, fearful, perhaps, of a traffic nightmare or
maybe dissuaded by showers on Friday morning. But whatever the
reason, Route 27, the main east-west road through the South Fork of
Long Island, was uncharacteristically unclogged all day Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was the site of the Basinger-Baldwin and Wasserstein
bashes, as well as the president's weekend radio address,
Amagansett, which is generally sleepy to begin with, never really
woke up. And maybe most amazing, downtown East Hampton and Sag
Harbor, ordinarily mobbed with shoppers, have both been reasonably
navigable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only time I ever got a parking space in front of
the Red Horse Market,'' said Tara Newman, a year-round resident of
Sag Harbor, referring to another gourmet food store in East
Hampton, ``Even in the winter you can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no place is so inured to glitz and indulgence that
the president fails to make an impression. By the time he arrived,
the rumors of where he would eat (the Bridgehampton Cafe?), golf
(the Atlantic Golf Club?) and shop (Newtown Lane?) had been
circulating for days.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, when he arrived at East Hampton Airport by
helicopter from Westhampton (where Air Force One had landed), a
crowd of maybe 200 people had pulled their cars off Route 27 and
waited for a glimpse of him as his motorcade made its way to
Spielberg's house.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was an amused gathering on the side of the road, including
Michael Silberkleit, the publisher of Archie Comics, whose wife,
Nancy, wore an oversized Archie head; Corey Watson, a college
student from California working as a pool man for the summer who
held up a small sign that said ``Legalize Marijuana''; and the
housekeeping and maintenance staff of the financier Ronald
Perelman, whose driveway opens on to the motorcade route. Perelman
himself passed on the parade; he is in Europe, his staff members
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, in restaurants, it was easy to overhear the
conversations about Clinton, his sex life and whether he lied about
it and encouraged others to do so. And here, as elsewhere, there
was both titillation and shame, as people argued over what the
president's strategy should be or would be when he testifies for
the grand jury later this month. Apologize to his wife and family
and the American public and ask for understanding? Or deny, deny,
deny?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said, even if she catches you in bed with the
sheets down, say, `Honey, you got it wrong,' '' said Derek Ford,
who may or may not have been joking. ``It's very hard to say, if
you're a man in a powerful position, to say `no, no, no' to all the
opportunities,'' said Ford, who owns a chain of women's clothing
stores in Canada and was visiting the Hamptons with his wife and
teen-age daughter. ``I've been married four times for that
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Racy speculations over what went on between the president and
Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern, often led to
head-shaking lamentations over the fact that alleged sex acts and a
dress that may have semen stains have become the focus of a special
prosecutor investigating the nation's chief executive, not to
mention the focus of the nation's discourse. And poor Hillary! Poor
Chelsea!
</P>
<P>
   For many the issue is not whether there was sex play in the
White House, but whether it matters. Is Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, a symbol of the democratic system or simply a
zealot?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous, it's sexual McCarthyism,'' said David
Oestreich, a New York City businessman who was a house guest in
East Hampton. ``It occurred to me recently that maybe there's some
entrapment involved here. Why is she keeping all that stuff? Is
that a normal thing?''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite view was expressed on a roadside billboard in front
of the Southampton Full Gospel Church, where each week a line of
scripture is posted for the benefit of weekenders arriving in the
Hamptons on Route 27. This week's selection is from Hebrews:
``Whoremongers and adulterers, God will judge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sign is an indication of the moral quality of our
society,'' said the Rev. Donald Havrilla, the leader of the
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the sign was discourteous to an important visitor,
Havrilla replied: ``We all live on our reputations. Religious
leaders have a responsibility to weigh in on Clinton's behavior,
and from what I've seen I'm not impressed. If the shoe fits, he
should wear it. If not, then it shouldn't bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, perhaps, at the Amagansett Fire House, where the
president delivered his weekly radio address Saturday morning, that
the prevailing local attitude toward the weekend was best
expressed. There, on Friday evening, the department's second
assistant chief, Kent Howie, was placing black patches embroidered
with the company insignia, normally for shirt sleeves, on the
department's red flag. The flag was supposed to hang on the wall
behind the president, but there were stains on it.
</P>
<P>
   Howie couldn't say he was a political supporter of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's still the most powerful man in the world,'' Howie
said. ``And we're glad to have him here.''

 &HT;    When D-Day hit home
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Va. -- What Lucille Boggess remembers most clearly
about D-Day is this: ``The dog howled all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggess was 15 on June 6, 1944, and the radio had been blaring
reports that thousands of Allied troops had stormed the beaches of
Normandy in faraway France.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents began to worry from the moment they learned that the
long-awaited invasion was on. They knew her two eldest brothers,
Bedford, 30, and Raymond Hoback, 24, were in Company A of the 116th
Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division. And in England.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents suspected, Boggess says today, that her brothers
were taking part in the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   They were. What the family wouldn't know until a month after
D-Day was that both had been killed within 15 minutes of hitting
the beach. And so had 19 other Bedford boys in Company A of the
116th, a federalized Virginia National Guard regiment.
</P>
<P>
   Boggess, now 69, believes her family's dog somehow sensed her
parents' fears. Whatever the cause, the plaintive cries certainly
marked an end to her easygoing, fun-loving way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford, then a bucolic village of 3,200 souls nestled beside
the Blue Ridge Mountains, would become synonymous with sacrifice.
Per capita, this picturesque burg lost more men on the beaches of
Normandy on D-Day than any other American village, town or city.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years later, many who remember the invasion have
died, and others have moved in. Yet World War II is still very much
a presence, and so Steven Spielberg's horrific D-Day saga, ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' is particularly resonant.
</P>
<P>
   The movie depicts the chaos and carnage among the 29th Division,
the first wave to hit what was code-named Omaha Beach. For Boggess,
it was hard to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sort of tried to insulate myself,'' she says. ``I
couldn't think of my brothers in something so terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggess, a longtime local tax collector, serves on the board of
the National D-Day Memorial Foundation, created by Congress to
erect a $12 million memorial in Bedford to honor the 1,200
Americans who died in the invasion that day. The foundation relies
on donations; to date only about half the money has been collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the movie raises interest that will help raise money
for the D-Day monument,'' she says. ``I don't like war movies, but
this one may do some good. Spielberg will reach people who never
would have known.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the consensus around Bedford, a town too small
for a movie theater, where people have been talking about ``Private
Ryan'' and in some cases traveling the 30 miles west to Roanoke to
see it.
</P>
<P>
   One who did last Friday, in a special viewing for D-Day vets,
was Ray Nance, 84. As a first lieutenant in Company A, Nance was
wounded three times on Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie will be a good thing,'' he says, showing a visitor
French money and a $5 bill signed by some buddies on his landing
craft. ``The movie was the most realistic I've ever seen, but
still, nothing can come close to the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Stevens, 78, the only other living member of the 116th in
Bedford, went to the movie because he knew he'd be asked about it
and also to ``get people thinking about D-Day, before we're all
gone. People still go to Appomattox, and they should always
remember D-Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' twin brother, Ray, was one of the Bedford boys lost
that day. Stevens found out four days later, when he saw a cross
with dog tags tacked to it in a temporary graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had Ray's name on it,'' he says. ``Losing my twin, that was
terrible. I still think of him, but I don't dote. He's buried over
here at Longwood Cemetery. I don't think about it much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Many D-Day veterans echo that sentiment, but some say it's time
to speak, because their generation is disappearing fast. Of 5,000
men who landed with the 116th Regiment _ the successor to Stonewall
Jackson's fabled Civil War unit _ only about 200 are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Boggess says there are good reasons many WWII vets haven't
talked much about the war. Like the fictional Ryan, they wrestle
with the knowledge that many others died while they were saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of guilt,'' she says. ``So many died.
Those who lived felt funny, no matter how brave they were. And
people who stayed at home felt funny. Especially in Bedford. It
really wasn't until about 1984, the 40th anniversary, that D-Day
began to come into focus in this community, even though we had the
big 10-year anniversary event.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1954, thousands came for the dedication of a modest
D-Day monument made of granite carved from the caves of
Vierville-sur-mer, France, near where Company A went ashore. A
bronze plaque bears the names of the 21 Bedford men of Company A
who died, plus two in other units. The monument's significance is
evident in its prominent location _ directly in front of the town's
Confederate memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Boggess says the community seems split between those who know
about Bedford's sacrifice and those who don't know or don't care.
The reason: For years, it just wasn't discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people, just like the men, felt they had done what they
had to do, what anybody would do. It was only when we had the
anniversaries that people realized what an incredible price this
little tiny town paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the silence, she says, Bedford still hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a generation,'' she says, gesturing toward the 1954
monument. ``You can't take so many young men out of a town the size
of Bedford and not change it. It's hard to comprehend the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother felt that, she says, ``everyone needed to die a
little after losing her two boys. A part of her died when they did.
She sobbed and cried. My dad would go out to the barn and cry
alone. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom didn't want to go on outings again. Our outings
stopped. We stopped having fun. It was almost like she didn't want
life to continue, that it wasn't fair for us to have fun. It's
never been like it was before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Gaston, pastor of Bedford Presbyterian Church,
found out fast that many Bedfordians seem deeply scarred by D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here a few years ago, I knew I needed to understand
the community,'' says Gaston, 39. ``I was sitting there with a
longtime member, and tears started streaming down her face when she
described what it was like when the rash of telegrams started
coming in. It was so terrible to her still, she said the greatest
thing to her was to go to a Presbyterian camp, where there were no
reminders. You could almost sense her own guilt that she felt good
to have a chance to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggess hopes the movie may help with the healing and that the
dedication of the national memorial, planned for June 6, 2000, will
too. Both can help older residents come to terms with the memories.
</P>
<P>
   Both can also educate younger people about the community's
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a generation, mine, that was profoundly affected,''
Boggess says. ``Then we had a generation that grew up in the shadow
of it. And a lot of people in the younger group now don't know much
about it at all. That's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Saunders, a 17-year-old college freshman, complains he
hasn't been taught much about World War II, let alone Bedford's
sacrifice at D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense I have to learn about D-Day in a
movie,'' he says. ``It was talk all my life about Vietnam. My dad's
generation wanted to forget World War II because of Vietnam, to
forget about war.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedford Museum director Ellen Wandrei, 50, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd bet you'd find that most kids here are clueless about
D-Day,'' says the former teacher and mother of two grown sons, one
a member of the 116th.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gross, 61, Bedford's city manager, says there's always been
a kind of gentleman's agreement not to dwell on Bedford's loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some level, it's always been on people's minds,'' he says.
``I don't think Bedford has gotten over it. It's like the red soil,
it's just there _ D-Day. It's like it's just below the surface. It
hurts too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Teass, 75, knew almost all the Bedford boys who died.
As the town's telegraph operator, she got the first word of the
D-Day disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from Roanoke _ `casualties coming.' I don't know how
many it was, maybe five or seven at first. And then they just kept
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggess says she's gotten over the hurt as much as she ever
will, but she'll never forget the dreadful summer of '44.
</P>
<P>
   She was a teenager, anticipating seeing her friends at Sunday
church services, when the county sheriff pulled into the driveway
of her family's farmhouse five weeks after D-Day. The sheriff
delivered the telegram that said her brother Bedford had been
killed at D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, it seemed, all of Center Point Methodist
Church, right across the street, was in our front yard,'' she
recalls. ``Everybody was crying and hugging.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, the sheriff returned. This time he handed her
parents a telegram saying that her brother Raymond had disappeared
at Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some men later told me he was shot,'' she says. ``He got shot
at low tide. They said his wounds weren't mortal, but at high tide
he washed out to sea, and his body was never found.''
</P>
<P>
   She plans to visit brother Bedford's grave in September when
about 40 local folks travel to Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Nance won't be going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll go sometime, by myself, with my family,'' he
ponders, staring at a yard-long faded photo of Company A hanging on
a hallway wall. ``I'd want to see where I went in, where I looked
up at that church steeple. But I don't want to go with a crowd.
It's too personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance's combat career began and ended on D-Day. His wounds, just
below his lip near his throat, in his right foot and his trigger
finger, took months to mend, and the war ended before he could be
shipped to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   He and other surviving members of the 116th Regiment often talk
in the present tense about their experiences, instantly recalling
names of men they haven't seen since 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Nance points to a faded photo in his hallway. ``There, that's
John Wilkes. He was killed. Leslie Abbot there was killed. And
Elmere Wright was killed. John D. Clifton. Frank Draper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's Overstreet. He made it. Jack Powers was killed.
Gillaspie, Nick I think it was, got it. Here I am. I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Stevens, who flies Old Glory in his front yard every day,
hasn't decided if he's going to France with the Bedford group. He
last saw his brother Ray early on D-Day when the two men, both
platoon leaders, headed for separate landing craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray stuck his hand out, wanting me to shake it, and I reminded
him we'd agreed to meet on the beach,'' Stevens said. ``But that
didn't happen. He'd told me a couple of times he didn't think he'd
make it. Maybe he knew. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``A medic told me Ray was shot with machine-gun fire. I didn't
believe it. I couldn't believe it. We'd bought 136 acres and were
going to farm it together. I farm it now, but he never got the
chance. He never had kids and grandkids like me and never had a
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The war ended for Stevens on June 30, when he was hit by
shrapnel a few miles away from the beach at St.-Lo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't complain,'' he says. ``I miss Ray. Always have. But
I'm not bitter like I was. I liked to got killed trying to get
revenge for Ray. But you can't. You just have to go on. Ray and I
had big plans. It just didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom has its cost.''

 &HT;    Not all vets see it like Spielberg
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- With its epic scenes of carnage, ``Saving Private
Ryan'' hits still-raw nerves for many D-Day veterans. But not all
the veterans see the movie the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Bennie Bolgla, 82, of Augusta was in the first wave to hit Omaha
Beach, in the same regiment as the men from Bedford, Va. He says
the blood and gore depicted in the movie aren't exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were arms, heads on the beach,'' says Bolgla. ``Blood in
the water. People were exploding around you. It was scary. I
learned how to pray, and you could hear men over all that noise
mumbling prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie helps teach an important lesson, he says: ``Sometimes
you have to do hard things to protect what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does have some quibbles ``with some of the usual
Hollywood stuff.'' For example, he says, the first wave went in at
low tide and made it to the beach. The drowning depicted in the
film took place later.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Stevens, 78, of Bedford says ``Private Ryan'' is the most
realistic war film he's seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boat was sunk off the beach, and I almost drowned,'' he
says matter-of-factly. ``The fear is there, but you just don't have
time to worry about it. And we had been training for this for two
years, and we wanted to be the first to get a shot at Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Ray Nance, 84, also of Bedford, doesn't
recall seeing blood or body parts. His mind's eye sees D-Day as it
was depicted in the 1961 film ``The Longest Day.'' Blood didn't
spurt from men's bodies in that black-and-white movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of dead people, floating face up or face down. I
didn't see anybody get blown up. The water wasn't red with blood. I
saw one man in front of me go down, but he just dropped over. I
didn't see any guts.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers lying wounded on the beach, watching machine-gun
bullets rip up the sand in his direction, but doesn't recall being
afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Nance remembers crawling 250 yards across the beach. ``My foot
felt like I'd been hit with a hammer. Shrapnel missed my throat by
an inch and got my finger. But you kept going. You didn't want to
stay on that beach.''
</P>
<P>
   A quiet man who spent 40 years after the war delivering mail
around the scenic Peaks of Otter in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Nance
seems to seethe just below the surface when discussing D-Day, angry
still at the Germans, but also, a little, at some Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from this New York reporter, I don't know what
paper,'' he says. ``He wanted to know if we really killed
prisoners. Of course we didn't. I was an officer, and we were the
best-trained unit there was.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance also takes issue with scenes in ``Private Ryan'' showing
Americans with their helmets improperly fastened. Any soldier whose
helmet wasn't tightly buckled would have almost as much to fear
from officers as the Germans, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie might do some good,'' he adds, a bit ruefully,
having to tighten his lip for the first time in a long interview.
``But he (director Steven Spielberg) could have used more advisers
who were there. Just say it was beyond description. The
pandemonium. It is just not possible to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance does venture a bottom line on D-Day, however: ``Our job
was to save the world. And that's what we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a purpose, a mission and a duty to our country. That
scoundrel Hitler was taking our world. If it had failed, I don't
know what would have happened.''

LEAGUE MAY CHECK ENIS' RELIGIOUS GROUP  
 HAMPTON'S PLANS UP IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The story of Chicago Bears running back Curtis Enis has taken
another interesting turn.
</P>
<P>
   The security arm of the National Football League has recently
been asked by at least two teams, the Bears and the Jacksonville
Jaguars, to investigate a religious group with a growing membership
of NFL players, including Enis, according to high-ranking team
executives around the league.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern? That players may be giving an inordinate amount
of money to the group, Champions for Christ. The Bears, those team
executives said, are worried that the group recruited Enis as a way
of raising money, something a spokesman for Champions for Christ
denied. The Jaguars have similar concerns about some of their
high-profile players, team executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said the request for the investigation was in no
way an attempt to interfere with players' religious beliefs.
Rather, there is concern that players could be taken advantage of
financially, they said. The NFL's investigation is in the early
stages, team executives said. An NFL spokesman said the league had
no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Enis' life has been a whirlwind in recent months. He was ruled
ineligible at Penn State after an agent bought him a suit. Enis
fired that agent and hired the respected firm of Casterline, Vines
&AMP; McElroy Team Sports. He was picked fifth over all in the April
draft.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Enis was named in a sexual assault complaint filed by a
woman in Irving, Texas Prosecutors there said this week that they
doubted Enis would be charged because of lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the complaint was filed, people close to Enis noticed
a change in his personality. He became more boisterous about his
religious beliefs. At the NFL rookie symposium in June, Enis asked
the Giants' Tiki Barber how he justifies playing football on
Sunday, traditionally a day of worship for many religions.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Enis married a woman he had dated for nearly a year. The
ceremony was performed by a minister who was a member of Champions
for Christ, people close to Enis said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Enis dropped Casterline, Vines &AMP; McElroy, which had
already begun negotiating his contract, and hired Greg Feste, a
friend of several members of Champions for Christ. The Bears say
the switch set negotiations back weeks because Feste has never
negotiated an NFL contract.
</P>
<P>
   The main snag in talks now appears to be how the signing bonus
is going to be structured, executives with various teams say.
Concerned that Enis may one day give up football because of his
religious beliefs, the Bears want to insert protective language in
the signing bonus, deferring chunks of the money to later years of
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 Bears players belong to Champions for Christ. One,
defensive end Mark Thomas, said the team is wrong to worry that the
group will take advantage of Enis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care about Curtis' money,'' he said. ``They just
care that Curtis is walking with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Feste seeking a comment were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Champions for Christ, based in Austin, Texas, started in 1985,
said a spokesman, Dave Jamerson. It is made up primarily of
athletes, including widely respected figures such as the former Los
Angeles Laker A.C. Green, who is a vice president in the group, and
the Washington Redskins cornerback Darrell Green, a board member.
Jamerson said there are at least 50 pro athletes in the group and
there are chapters on about 20 college campuses. He said the
group's mission is to ``communicate the gospel of Jesus Christ to
youth, college and professional athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said: ``We believe in staying in somebody's life and
being part of a family. That's all Champions is. We're trying to
grow in Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamerson said he was unaware that any member of the group told
another member to donate money.
</P>
<P>
   But several Jaguars players who were interviewed said that
teammates in the group aggressively tried to recruit new members on
the team last year, passing out leaflets. They said the players
asked teammates to donate to Champions for Christ, and would also
express disapproval of players who used alcohol. At times, the
players said, the team was divided between those who were members
of the group and and those who were not.
</P>
<P>
   The possible influence of Champions for Christ on players'
finances, team executives said, led Jaguars management to ask the
NFL to investigate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HAMPTON'S PLANS UP IN THE AIR
</P>
<P>
   Football is not really on the mind of Rodney Hampton these days.
He is practically in semiretirement. Hampton plays a lot of
basketball and spends time with his family in Houston. At 235
pounds, 5 pounds below last year's playing weight, his body is
ready to play football. He just isn't sure he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' career rushing leader said he has had discussions
with the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs to be a
backup, but the contract offers were too low. Hampton is a warrior
who still has a lot of pride, so he is going to wait for the right
opportunity. But if that opportunity does not come, and soon,
Hampton said he will retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't play this year, if I don't sign with a team by
probably September, I'm going to retire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants and Hampton parted ways this past off season, with
little fanfare for one of the top 10 running backs of the 1990s.
Hampton contends he has no bitterness toward his old team. ``I will
always love the Giants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He still talks to players on the team, like linebacker Jessie
Armstead and defensive lineman Michael Strahan.
</P>
<P>
   Anything can happen, but it sounds as if Hampton and the NFL may
have parted ways for good. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AL DAVIS SEEMS TO KNOW BEST
</P>
<P>
   Criticize Al Davis, the Oakland Raiders' owner, about how he has
run his team if you would like, but on certain matters, he is
simply brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said months ago that the cost of the Cleveland franchise
would be over $500 million. He was laughed at. He was also right.
The Browns will probably go for at least $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said the NFL would get the biggest payment ever from
the television networks. He was right about that, too, as pro
football received $17.6 billion in broadcast rights fees.

REAL ESTATE: SPIFFING UP HELENA'S LAST CHANCE GULCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JIM ROBBINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. _ Abandoned since 1954 when the popularity of
train travel was fading, the weed-choked Great Northern rail yard
in this historic capital city is the site of an ambitious $40
million project now under way at the north end of the city's
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, called the Great Northern Town Center, will include
a 150-room hotel with 25,000 square feet for a convention center,
the only one in this city of 40,000 residents; a bank; a
23,000-square-foot office building; up to 120 condominium and
rental apartments; small shops; a 6,000-square-foot, three-story
tented outdoor amphitheater and an enclosed carousel. Rubber
grommets will be built into the streets and parking ramp to allow
tents to be erected for farmer's' markets and other events.
</P>
<P>
   The project has been a catalyst for many other changes on the
city's moribund north end. Carroll College, a four-year Roman
Catholic school that sits on a hill next to the old rail yard, is
building a new student union and a new science complex at a total
cost of $10 million to complement existing structures and is
replacing an existing stadium at a cost of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to reorient the campus to the east to face the new
complex. A local television station is building a $2.5 million
studio on the campus, a 100,000-square-foot federal office building
is to rise next to the town center and the city is to add more
soccer and baseball fields to its outdoor sports complex.
</P>
<P>
   Streets, sewers and other improvements for the town center are
nearing completion and construction of the office building is under
way. The entire project is expected to be done in three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing something communities everywhere ought to be
doing, infilling where there's already infrastructure,'' said Alan
Nicholson, president of Nicholson Inc., which is developing the
project. ``We hope people who would build on the edge of town will
come here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Montana and throughout the West growth usually means strip
development, with fast-food restaurants, car lots and big-box
stores on the edges of town, a pattern that has led to rampant
sprawl, the loss of farms and ranches and traffic congestion. The
town-center developers hope to enhance the density of downtown and
to draw some development back to within city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Helena was born as a free-wheeling mining camp in 1864 when four
prospectors stopped to look for ``color'' along a creek. It was
their last chance to find gold before they headed back to the
thriving goldfields at Alder Gulch, farther south in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, Reginald Stanley, recounted in a letter how he
felt as he washed some gravel. ``Three or four little flat, smooth
nuggets and some fine gold was the result; nuggets that made the
pan ring when dropped into it _ and a very refreshing sound it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Other miners, many of them Civil War veterans, flocked to the
rich diggings and a settlement of hastily constructed log cabins,
tents and dugouts sprang up along ``Last Chance Gulch,'' which is
still the name of the city's main street. In less than a year there
were 3,000 people living on the gulch and 45 stores, 14 saloons,
seven restaurants, and offices for 10 doctors and 16 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Crime became a problem in the boom town, so a secret group of
citizens, primarily Masons, formed a Vigilance Committee to
summarily apprehend, try and hang bandits and other felons. Between
1865 and 1870 at least 13 men were hanged from a large pine tree by
the committee, and a note was often pinned to the body warning
others to mend their ways or suffer a similar fate. The heritage of
the self-appointed posse is still celebrated with a parade down
Last Chance Gulch every May.
</P>
<P>
   In an evolution typical of mining towns, affluence led to
permanent structures to replace wooden stores, saloons and hotels.
And as the silver and gold mining industry grew, the wooden
structures gave way to granite-and-brick office buildings, banks
and retail businesses, all built on top of the now-buried creek
where gold was originally found. Dozens of nuggets, gold dust and
flakes taken from the area are on display in a museum in a Norwest
bank downtown.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Historic photos from the 1880s show Helena as a bustling city,
its streets lined with office buildings and crowded with carriages
at a time when most of the West was still wilderness. At one time
the city had more millionaires per capita than any city in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But mining was dealt a blow by the Silver Panic of 1893 when the
federal government removed silver price supports. The downtown
stopped growing and then entered a slow decline and gambling and
prostitution flourished. The last brothel, called Big Dorothy's,
was raided and closed in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s urban renewal came to Helena and more than 250
historic buildings, some of them architecturally noteworthy, were
demolished. Some development filled in the gaps, but for a long
time the downtown languished.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, Montana's economy has improved. The
scenic downtown, which is nestled at the foot of timber-draped
peaks and less than a 10-minute walk from the surrounding Helena
National Forest's hiking trails, has recovered, with offices
replacing some stores. Retail and office space downtown is in
demand.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of unusual downtown historic buildings remain.
The Great Northern Town Center, for example, is being built behind
the Helena Civic Center, a huge building resembling an Islamic
mosque with a prayer tower that was constructed by the Shriners in
the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   There is some concern by merchants in the existing downtown that
the new development could draw businesses away. ``People are
nervous,'' said Paul Reichert, executive director of the Downtown
Helena Business Improvement District. ``But I think it's positive.
Basically it fills in an eyesore in the heart of our downtown. I
hope people will see downtown as a larger entity.''
</P>
<P>
   The town center will foster a pedestrian scale and incorporate
traffic-calming features. Its main street, Great Northern
Boulevard, is only 24 feet wide, instead of the more traditional 40
feet. The street has 6-inch risers in some places to slow traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The structures in the new development will echo the rest of this
city's 19th-century downtown architecture. ``All of the building
lots are zero lot lines,'' said Mike Dowling, an architect with
Dowling Tintinger in Helena who designed the town center. ``You
have to build your building to the lot line to encourage an urban
fabric. No gaps. That's a historic concept that doesn't exist
today.''
</P>
<P>
   To foster a sense of a traditional downtown and encourage owner
occupancy, covenants require that first floors of all but the
all-office building be retail businesses, second and third floors
be for offices and fourth floors be for homes.
</P>
<P>
   The covenants also encourage the use of brick and stone instead
of metal and glass and require slots for windows rather than walls
of glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be modern buildings, but classical modern buildings,''
said Nicholson.

   Justice Thomas Criticizes His Many Critics
</P>
<P>
   Although his delivery was measured and unemotional, Justice
Clarence Thomas made an extraordinary speech to a large gathering
of black lawyers and judges, a group that included many of his
critics. Until now, Thomas had spoken only before groups carefully
selected to insure their friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   But appearing before a convention of the National Bar
Association, the nation's largest group of black lawyers, he issued
an appeal for understanding. At the same time he harshly criticized
his opponents, saying they are racists because they do not accept
that he has come by his conservative philosophy on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to have my ideas assigned to me as though I am an
intellectual slave because I am black,'' he said, adding that those
who suggest he takes his ideas from the white conservative justices
demean him. ``The stench of racial inferiority still confounds my

   Land Is on the Ballot
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in one of the nation's most ambitious efforts to
preserve vanishing farmland and woodlands, the New Jersey
Legislature passed a ballot measure that would ask voters in
November to approve borrowing $1 billion to protect half of the
state's remaining 2 million acres of undeveloped land over the next
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   After years of unchecked development, done largely to expand
local tax bases, local officials are finding that such growth is
increasing taxes and causing overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' vote is a major political triumph for Gov.
Christie Whitman, who made preserving 1 million acres of open space
the top priority of her second term.

through the Capitol rotunda around the flag-draped coffins of
Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson. President Clinton
said that the two men had ``consecrated this house of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The two officers, who later were buried in separate ceremonies
at Arlington National Cemetery, were killed by a gunman on July 24.

   Neglect at Nursing Homes
</P>
<P>
   For residents of America's 17,000 nursing homes, conditions have
improved since 1987, when Congress set stringent federal standards.
But in two days of hearings, the Senate Special Committee on Aging
heard that the abuse and neglect of patients continue at many
nursing homes. The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm
of Congress, delivered a harsh judgment on homes in California,
nearly one-third of which have been cited for violations that could
cause death or life-threatening harm. Other witnesses said they
believed that similar problems existed elsewhere.

   A Disputed Election

   Cambodians voted with obvious enthusiasm last Sunday, embracing
the chance to choose their new government after years of coups and
bullying by their leaders. International observers pronounced the
election a success, and Stephen Solarz, heading an unofficial
American delegation to monitor the vote, sounded like Muhammad Ali
when he declared that he had witnessed ``the miracle on the
Mekong.''
</P>
<P>
   But questions immediately arose about intimidation and possible
fraud that cast a shadow over the vote. The incumbent leader, Hun
Sen, appeared to have won, but his rivals, Norodom Ranariddh and

   Nigerian peacekeeping troops had been trying to undo his damage
in Sierra Leone, where Sankoh took part in the overthrow of the

followers have been engaged in savage attacks on civilians in the
last six months, human rights groups say. The RUF has been killing
and mutilating men, women and children, deliberately making them

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With each passing day, Grand Central Terminal is
looking better than it ever has. Meanwhile, it is becoming
something it never was.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, New Yorkers may look back at the summer of 1998
as the architectural apogee for the once decrepit landmark.
</P>
<P>
   This pristine moment will not last long, however. GCT Venture,
the development team working for the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, is doing more than rehabilitating a great railway
station, built in 1913. It is creating a Beaux-Arts vessel for an
enormous new commercial enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for public attention with the bejeweled Sky Ceiling
and monumental new east staircase, restaurants will line the
balconies of the Main Concourse. Peter Glazier has already opened
Michael Jordan's-The Steakhouse NYC. Cipriani Dolce, run by the
Cipriani family, and Metrazur, run by Matthew Kenney, will follow
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants and food stands will take over what used to be the
Suburban Concourse on the lower level. (It is now called the Dining
Concourse.) Stores will form an octagonal ring around the old
incoming train room, now Biltmore Hall. Food stalls will line a new
passageway to Lexington Avenue called Grand Central Market. And
seasonal markets will fill Vanderbilt Hall, where long-distance
travelers once waited to board the 20th Century Limited.
</P>
<P>
   No longer the ``Gateway to a Continent,'' Grand Central will be
more like the Gateway to a Caviarteria _ or a hundred other
establishments, among them Banana Republic, Citarella, City Bakery,
Kenneth Cole, the Discovery Channel Store, Junior's, Mike's
Takeaway, J. Peterman, Posman Books, Republic, Rite Aid, Starbucks,
Two Boots Pizza and Zocalo.
</P>
<P>
   While stores and restaurants have always been part of the
terminal, there have never been as many as are being constructed
and planned today. Retail space in the terminal is nearly doubling,
to 170,000 square feet (almost four acres) from 105,000 square
feet, only 75,000 square feet of which was occupied in recent
years. Given tenant demand, the developers believe they could have
leased 100,000 square feet more.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial expansion and the architectural renovation are
intertwined because one is financing the other _ not unlike Faneuil
Hall in Boston in the 1970s and Union Station in Washington in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wanted to save those buildings, but nobody had any
money to do it,'' said Michael Ewing, a retail developer who has
worked on all three projects. His company, Williams Jackson Ewing,
joined with La Salle Partners, a commercial real estate concern, to
form GCT Venture.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost for the MTA was the maintenance of a vital
transportation center, the hub of its Metro-North Railroad
division. The more ambitious rebuilding was made possible by the
sale of bonds, which are to be repaid from the increased rental
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those rents support the bonds which made possible the
architectural restoration,'' said E. Virgil Conway, authority
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all of the capital needs of the MTA, there would have
been eyebrows raised if we had spent $200 million restoring Grand
Central Terminal that could have been spent on buying new cars or
laying tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, the MTA sold $84 million in bonds: $49 million for
public improvements, $35 million for retail-related work. It also
used $109 million of its capital budget and received $4 million
from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $110 million is being spent on a network of
passageways known as North End Access, linking train platforms to
street-level pavilions on 48th Street, near Park Avenue, and 47th
Street, near Madison Avenue, as well as entrances in the Helmsley
Building arcades, between 45th and 46th streets.
</P>
<P>
   All but one short leg of this network is to open in January.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, the Grand Central Market is also scheduled
to open, with 24 food vendors on the ground floor and a restaurant
above.
</P>
<P>
   The market and the northeast balcony of the Main Concourse are
the only significant spaces that are not yet fully leased, Many
stores will not be opening until late fall or beyond, after the
basic reconstruction of the public areas has been finished. As that
work nears an end, the terminal will be formally rededicated in a
ceremony on Oct. 1 at which Gov. George Pataki is expected to
preside.
</P>
<P>
   There will be many other milestones before and after the
rededication. ``Each time you come into the terminal, you'll see
something new,'' said Forrest Taylor, deputy executive director for
operations and chief of staff of the MTA.
</P>
<P>
   All the plans have been subject to approval by the Landmarks
Preservation Commission, as the interior of the terminal was given
landmark status in 1980. Retailing around the Main Concourse is
confined to news dealers, coffee shops and automated teller
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the commission, said she was
optimistic that a detailed master plan governing the esthetics of
storefronts would set clear standards. ``We still have to be
vigilant,'' she said, ``but we've taken an important first step by
being so careful.''

REAL ESTATE: ITS RAVAGED BEACH RESTORED, A VILLAGE REBOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DIANA SHAMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HAMPTON DUNES, N.Y. _ Two years ago, standing in front of
houses ready to plunge into the sea, Gary Vegliante, the mayor of
this tiny barrier-island village west of Westhampton Beach,
predicted that within five years 90 percent of all the houses his
community had lost to storms _ 190 had been lost out of 246 _ would
be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Vegliante's prediction was made on the eve of the commencement
of a beach restoration project that, recently completed by the Army
Corps of Engineers, is now rapidly making the mayor's forecast a
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the greatest coastline success story ever,'' said
Vegliante, who is not known for understatement. ``Not only did we
re-establish our barrier island, but the public has also received a
50-acre beach for free.''
</P>
<P>
   New houses are springing up everywhere, giving the village the
look of a frontier town in the midst of a gold rush. In all, the
village, which has 331 building lots, now numbers 110 houses,
almost double the number of two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen new houses were completed this year, 15 applications for
new construction are in various stages of the approvals process and
30 more houses will probably be completed by the end of the year,
according to Herbert Hoffman, the village building inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Land prices are still relatively low _ an oceanfront lot
recently sold for $155,000, according to Patricia Barile of the
Resort Properties brokerage in Westhampton Beach _ because many
people still have visions of the evening television news showing
houses in West Hampton Dunes tumbling into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are decidedly over. Dune Road, which runs the
2.25-mile length of the village, ending at 296-acre Cupsogue Beach
County Park, was once covered in sand and impassable. It is now a
26-foot wide asphalt thoroughfare elevated 10 feet above sea level,
rebuilt by the village for $300,000. The park, which had been
closed for nine years, reopened in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilt dunes, which line the entire length of the road on
the ocean side, are 15 feet high and 88 feet wide at the base.
Beyond the dunes is up to 300 feet of beach.
</P>
<P>
   The $17 million restoration project was designed to withstand a
50-year storm _ meaning a storm of such intensity that it is likely
to occur only once every 50 years. Officially, it is a so-called
interim project because a study of 83 miles of endangered coastline
on Long Island to be used as the basis for permanent restoration
projects will not be completed until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a 1994 agreement, the Army Corps of Engineers will
replenish whatever sand is lost every three years to make sure the
beach retains its restored level. The 30-year guaranteed
maintenance program is expected to cost another $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only beach in America that's guaranteed,''
Vegliante said, sitting in a trailer that serves as his temporary
village hall and command post. ``Except perhaps for the other one
behind the jetties which is at a 500-year level because those
jetties are much bigger than they had to be and caused all our
problems in the first place,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mention jetties _ more correctly, groins _ in West Hampton Dunes
and tempers are likely to explode among homeowners who lived
through the hard times watching their houses wash away and being
denied access, because of hazardous conditions, to those that
remained.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, 15 groins were built east of the village, then
still an unincorporated area of the Town of Southampton. Seven more
groins reaching to Moriches Inlet were planned but never built.
With the easterly groins catching all the sand, the beach to their
west began eroding; storms began washing away houses, and finally a
1992 winter storm punched a 2,000-foot-long breach next to the last
groin, which temporarily created an island and cost $7 million to
repair.
</P>
<P>
   Owners who had formed the Barrier Beach Preservation Association
and, represented by John J. O'Connell, a New York City lawyer,
filed a class-action suit against federal, state and local agencies
seeking $200 million in damages, won a December 1994 settlement
that pledged to restore the beach and to keep it at its restored
level for the 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The government agreed to pay 70 percent of the estimated $60
million cost for restoration and maintenance, New York State 21
percent and Suffolk County 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement gave the village, which was incorporated in
November 1993, $2 million for emergency costs, including rebuilding
Dune Road. In addition, the association received $2 million from
the state for its legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanfront property owners agreed to place all beachfront
property south of the seaward toe of the new dune _ 50 acres in all
_ into the public domain. Ownership will probably to be deeded to
the state. Seven public walkways from Dune Road all within a
quarter- to a half-mile walk of parking provide access.
</P>
<P>
   Parking is available at Cupsogue County Park, which also has two
miles of beach. The town of Southampton has plans to build
additional parking on land it owns at the east end of the village.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Hampton Dunes enterprise is definitely a success
story,'' said Clifford Jones, project manager at the Army Corps of
Engineer's New York district office.
</P>
<P>
   With beach-restoration plans elsewhere on Long Island awaiting
the results of the study that is due in 2003, this could become the
blueprint for similar projects in areas like Fire Island and
Shinnecock where erosion is already so severe that immediate action
is recommended, Jones said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   But village battles with governmental agencies are far from
over. There was the skirmish with county Health Department
officials over the placement of septic systems. This the village
also won.
</P>
<P>
   And now there is the matter of the threatened Atlantic Coast
Piping Plover, which the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service is
pledged to protect under the Endangered Species Act. West Hampton
Dunes is one of several habitats of the plover, with a population
this year of 26 nesting pairs _ up from zero pairs in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   No construction can occur from March through September if it
affects nesting birds. Property owners have been complying.
</P>
<P>
   The village has spent several thousand dollars removing wild
cats and foxes that preyed on the birds. But in June, cars on Dune
Road ran over five birds _ three adults and two chicks. ``They were
pancaked,'' said Steve Papa, a Fish and Wildlife biologist.
</P>
<P>
   And now in a war of words that may be heading for the courts,
the service wants the village, in compliance with provisions in its
1994 settlement agreement which guaranteed protection for the
birds, to cut the speed limit on Dune Road from 20 miles an hour to
five miles an hour in some sections, and to station monitors at
village expense who would halt traffic should a plover decide to
cross the road.
</P>
<P>
   Too much, said the mayor, painting visions of not only his
residents but also beachgoers to Cupsogue County Park taking a
half-hour or more to crawl through his 2.25-mile long village. He
has fired off protest letters to the secretary of the interior,
Bruce Babbitt, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road is a road, and animals get squished on roads,'' the
mayor said. ``There's nothing anyone can do about that. And I'm not
going to have monitors jump out in front of cars and risk getting
run over or punched by a motorist.''
</P>
<P>
   The majestic serenity of the restored beach and the fervor of
residents, newcomers and old-timers alike belie these intrusions on
the general calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This village is great and will only get better as more people
build and the community becomes stronger,'' said Gary Trimarchi,
the chief operating officer of the Riese Restaurants chain in New
York City who is completing a five-bedroom oceanfront house that,
he said, will cost close to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Developers are also coming in. Edwin Heiberger, owner of Legacy
Development in Plainview, and his son, Andrew, president of Citi
Habitats, a New York City brokerage, are building seven houses on
speculation, and two for themselves, and have options to buy six
additional lots. They have priced their six oceanfront houses from
$695,000 to $745,000, and a bayfront house at $595,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tormey Santolli and his wife, Linda, have lifted the house they
bought 14 years ago out of the sand, placing it on 12-foot high
piles. ``We are thankful for what Gary and others did, because from
a possible terrible experience this turned out great,'' Santolli
said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Lange and his wife, Eileen, who bought their
three-bedroom house in 1973 only to see it wash away in 1993, have
rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got wiped out again, I'd rebuild again because this area
means so much to me,'' Lange said. Now his daughter, Lauren
Nannariello, and her husband, Joe, plan to build a house as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants her four children to enjoy what she had growing
up,'' Lange said.

With each passing day, Grand Central Terminal is looking better
than it ever has. Meanwhile, it is becoming something it never was.
In the renovated Grand Central Terminal, the monumental new east
staircase will compete with restaurants like Michael Jordan's-The
Steakhouse NYC, for public attention. No longer the ``Gateway to a
Continent,'' Grand Central will be more like the Gateway to a
Caviarteria, with retail space in the terminal nearly doubling.

FREE AGENTS BYPASSED IN THE DRAFT CHASE DREAM JOBS AT COWBOYS CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By David A. Markiewicz 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Oh, you can tell who they are all right.
They're the guys who stand three-deep behind the action during
practice sessions at training camp _ waiting for that one chance to
show their stuff.
</P>
<P>
   They're the ones whose photos don't appear in the media guide.
The ones youngsters here call out to with, ``Hey, No. 60, can I get
your autograph?'' The ones who haven't put down a deposit on a
Metroplex apartment.
</P>
<P>
   They include a fullback hopeful who did litigation work after
college until his opportunity came; a European football veteran who
has been pursuing his NFL dream for three years now; and a young
man from Euless who's getting a chance to play alongside the
hometown stars he grew up watching.
</P>
<P>
   They're the free agents of 1998, but most of them might as well
be called the long shots of 1998, so remote is their chance of
making this season's Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them know it deep down, too, but their chances depend
partly on not admitting that likelihood. They are the power of
positive thinking personified; the little running back that could.
Or whatever. They better be.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie and first-year free agents have varied backgrounds, but
they share this: They all went unclaimed in the college draft the
year they completed their college eligibility. Football-wise, that
left them out on the street looking for work, hoping some team
would give them a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys have a history of finding free agents who turned
out to be pretty good for them,'' free-agent running back Bobby
Rodriguez said. ``Like diamonds in the rough, I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I can be one of those diamonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys list 25 rookie and first-year free agents on their
roster and, with veterans and high-round draftees claiming most of
the 53 available regular-season roster spots, their prospects of
making it to Texas Stadium come September seen slimmer than a
wideout's hips.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think about life after football, Earl Scott, a free-agent
offensive lineman from Arkansas, is asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he says. ``But I try not to. I don't think about
getting cut. All I think about is, if we come out here and run 50
plays today, and they say, `Earl, go out there and get that last
(play), I'm going to get that last one as hard as I can. I'm going
to make it so that the next time they give me two plays. That's my
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a philosophy these undrafted rookies share, along with
two-a-days under the brutal summer sun, the dormitory meals, the
constant angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, I told myself I'm going to give it my all,''
says Junior Filikitonga, a defensive tackle out of Abilene
Christian by way of Trinity High School. ``If I mess up, I mess up
100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep your chin up _ that's the attitude _ even when your
helmet's getting knocked off by Darren Woodson. It's the calling
card for Rodriguez, a barrel-chested fullback from Houston trying
to crack a fairly stacked backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my chances right now, they're pretty decent,'' says
Rodriguez, who got a minicamp look-see from the New Orleans Saints
last year but didn't stick around for summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, Rodriguez said, ``brought me in because they liked
my blocking. In the chances I've gotten in goal line and
short-yardage situations, I've impressed the coaches with my
blocking ability. Hopefully, that'll lead to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his fellow undrafted rookies, Rodriguez has
recurring fits of realism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A young guy like me, I've got to get on special teams,'' he
says. ``Anyway I can contribute just helps me. As a free agent,
you're in a position where you're not getting a lot of reps
(practice-play repetitions), and the reps you do get, it's like do
or die. Once you get them, you gotta make the most of them. You're
only getting a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate at times, but that's the chance you got, and
that's all first-year guys like me can ask for is a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Bright, a linebacker out of Georgia, started 43 of 44 games
in college and earned all-Southeastern Conference honors. But that
doesn't mean much when you've got Randall Godfrey, Dexter Coakley
and Fred Strickland taking most of the practice snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make this team just like draft rookies,'' Bright
says, ``but you might not get as many shots. So when you get a
shot, you've got to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   One all-time Cowboys great who knows well the plight of free
agents is Everson Walls, the undrafted cornerback from Grambling
who played with distinction in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Walls doesn't minimize the difference between being a high draft
pick and being a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just think about it,'' Walls says. ``You're not going to give
a free agent _ a guy you signed only because he was still there and
you had to fill out your roster _ the same number of looks in camp
as a guy you gave a $5 million signing bonus to.''
</P>
<P>
   A high draft pick, says Walls, ``is going to be put at the head
of the line when it comes to doing drills.'' When a rookie practice
team is picked, he adds, he will be the first name chosen. The free
agent might not even be considered. ``You may get your only chances
by default,'' Walls says. ``A guy might get hurt, or he might just
look so pitiful that they have to give you a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls has some tips for free agents wanting to catch the eye of
the coaches. Hustle on every play, he advises, and try to match up
against top players in practice. If you're a free-agent defensive
back, he says, try to go against that high-draft-choice wide
receiver, maybe even a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my case, it was Doug Donley,'' says Walls of the No. 2
Cowboys pick in 1981. ``I went up against him as much as I could to
show I could cover who they thought was the best in my class. I
tried to do my best to go against the Drew Pearsons and the Tony
Hills, too. That's what I call hustling. I was so eager. That gets
you a look.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls also recommends that free agents don't think too much
about the reality of their situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be best if they were naive about their chances,'' he
says. ``Then they would actually have optimism in their hearts. If
you have optimism, you're going to try harder, and you'll believe
you can make this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls admits, however, that a free agent's opportunities today
are less than when he first came to camp at the beginning of the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gap is definitely bigger, and it's growing,'' he says.
``Today, there's a lot more money invested in first-round players.
There's less time for free agents. And, the roster size is smaller.
There were 125 rookies when I came out in our camp. Nowadays, you
can only bring in 80 players. That's 45 fewer spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coaches maintain that every player in camp has an
opportunity to impress. Offensive line coach Hudson Houck, for
example, said last week that not every roster spot in his group is
taken.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of encouragement keeps the free agents motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Take offensive lineman Scott. He last played college ball at
Arkansas in 1995 and has since played pro ball for Amsterdam in the
World League and for Tampa and San Jose as an Arena Football League
player. This is his first NFL training camp. It has been a long
pull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the average rookie,'' Scott says. ``I know I can play
on the NFL level, and I'm sure (the coaches) know I can play on the
NFL level. I just have to keep on doing what I'm doing and let the
chips fall where they may.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be 25 August 31st,'' Scott continues. ``I'm young, I've
got some fresh legs, and I'm learning every day. If things don't
work out here, I won't be upset because I've learned more here the
last two weeks than I've learned in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Scott adds, ``I've been trying to prove myself since
1995. I've been working 2 1/2 years to get here, so I'm not going
to let a couple bad days or one bad experience deter me. I'm like
the Energizer bunny _ I keep going and going and going.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the fullback from Houston, will be 26 in November. He
knows all about doing whatever it takes to get that one chance. In
the past year, the political science major did litigation work for
Houston law firms while keeping his eye on the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to pay the bills,'' he says. ``In the mean time, I
stayed in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is confident but aware of a free agent's chances of
making it in the NFL before the clock runs out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The window is very small,'' he acknowledges. ``After a certain
amount of time you have to face reality and say, `You know, I
tried. I gave it my all, and it didn't work out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is proud of his accomplishments so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The percentage of guys who make it from high school to college
and then to the pros is very, very small,'' he says. ``And I'm one
of those guys who did it. I beat the odds just by being here.

COWBOYS OFFENSIVE LINE STARTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Entering training camp, the Cowboys' offense
faced numerous questions. There were concerns about everything from
Emmitt Smith's durability to the health of Daryl Johnston's neck to
Ernie Mills' ability to handle the second wide receiver spot.
</P>
<P>
   But the offensive line outdid them all when it came to
uncertainty. Left tackle Mark Tuinei was gone; standout guard Larry
Allen was moved to tackle from guard to replace him; Nate Newton
was trying to slim down and rebound from a poor season; Clay Shiver
and Erik Williams were hoping for comebacks; and free agent Everett
McIver was trying to find his place as the only newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's preseason opener against the Seattle Seahawks
at Texas Stadium, the line began to answer those concerns and,
initially, at least, the response was positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I feel pretty good about what the offensive line did
on the field, (at least) the first offensive line,'' said coach
Chan Gailey after watching that line lead two six-play,
first-quarter drives, that amassed 76 yards and a touchdown _ that
coming on a 15-yard scamper by Chris Warren off right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we blocked the touchdown run, our line and (tight end)
David LaFleur and (Johnston), it was a thing of beauty. I hope it
was as good looking on film as it was in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey hadn't reviewed game tapes of the 20-19 loss when he
offered those thoughts, but he said, at first glance, ``I was
pleased with some things.''
</P>
<P>
   The trimmed-down Newton, who now forms the left side of the line
with Allen, was a tougher critic, but still gave his linemates a
passing grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a little while to get going,'' Newton said. ``I
think with this being our first live game action with the new
offense, we had a tendency to overrun some plays a little. After
the first series, we got into a groove and were able to feel
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The line's performance was especially impressive, considering
the absence of McIver, who was injured in a dorm incident last
week. He was replaced by second-year man Tony Hutson, who drew
compliments after the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys opened the game with three consecutive runs by Smith
for a first down. Two short completions to Warren and a 5-yard
penalty put them in a passing situation. The line held up, but
Michael Irvin couldn't hold on to Troy Aikman's third-down throw
out of the shotgun, forcing a punt.
</P>
<P>
   On the second drive, the line asserted itself. Warren carried
twice for nine yards, wrapped around a 29-yard pass completion by
Aikman to LaFleur. Both the run blocking and pass protection was
sound. Aikman then fired short completions to Billy Davis and
Irvin, setting up Warren's score against his old team.
</P>
<P>
   Warren said his blockers did ``a good job. Those guys work hard
and don't get enough credit.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disguised by a blond wig and sunglasses, Monica
Lewinsky boarded a flight last Sunday morning in Los Angeles, an
anonymous beginning to a 48-hour odyssey that transformed the legal
and political dynamics of the independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
four-year investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The next day in New York, Ms. Lewinsky met secretly with the
independent counsel's team at an East Side apartment belonging to
Starr's mother-in-law. After a five-hour debriefing and a
late-night drive to Washington, Ms. Lewinsky signed an immunity
deal on Tuesday that freed her from legal peril. But it also
confronted Bill Clinton and his presidency with a new series of
questions that he will face in grand jury testimony at the White
House on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern who turned 25 on July
23, has moved a step closer to a cherished goal. ``For my
birthday,'' Ms. Lewinsky had told her family, ``I want my life
back.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on that birthday morning, Ms. Lewinsky was told by her
new lawyers, Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris, that Starr had called,
breaking weeks of silence and offering to reopen immunity
discussions. That night, her family celebrated at Chez Mimi, a
French restaurant in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Ms. Lewinsky's journey from target to cooperating
witness was culled from more than a dozen interviews last week with
lawyers involved in the investigation, as well as with associates
and friends of the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   A Starr-Lewinsky alliance that seemed unlikely as recently as
last month was put together by a cast of lawyers, some of whom have
received no public attention. Ms. Lewinsky found a mentor in Sydney
Hoffmann, a 46-year-old lawyer in Cacheris' firm. Ms. Hoffmann was
able to establish a bond with Ms. Lewinsky and then lead a critical
round of questioning that bolstered Ms. Lewinsky's credibility with
Starr's team. Sam Dash, the former Senate Watergate counsel who has
advised Starr on ethics issues, also played an important role.
</P>
<P>
   But two of the most pivotal players in the legal drama were a
pair of seasoned criminal defense lawyers, Stein, 73, and Cacheris,
69, who have represented Ms. Lewinsky only since June 2. The two
Washington insiders, who work in different law firms in the same
office building, broke a six-month deadlock of bad blood between
Starr's prosecutors and Ms. Lewinsky's first lawyer, William
Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations opened with an offer from Starr that Ms.
Lewinsky would be ``queen for a day,'' an ironic term of the legal
arts that allowed Ms. Lewinsky to tell her complete story to
prosecutors _ but with a promise that nothing she said could be
used against her if, at the end of the interview, Starr remained
unsatisfied with the level of her cooperation and declined to grant
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the resulting legal coup last week, Stein and Cacheris
are somber, perhaps because like Dash they are veterans of the
Watergate crisis. ``There was nothing to celebrate,'' Stein said in
an interview in his book-lined law office here, facing an etching
of Shakespeare. ``None of this called for a party. This is a
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   On a cold afternoon last January, Ms. Lewinsky was confronted by
agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and lawyers working
for Starr who questioned her for hours. They threatened to
prosecute her for perjury by using her taped confessions to a
friend about an affair with the president _ a relationship that she
had denied in sworn testimony in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers and agents told Ms. Lewinsky that she could avoid
prosecution if she agreed to secretly record her conversations with
Betty Currie, the president's personal secretary, and with the
president himself. Ms. Lewinsky declined.
</P>
<P>
   Later, to defend his client, Ginsburg submitted a proffer _ a
statement of expected testimony _ for Ms. Lewinsky that confirmed a
sexual relationship with the president, said lawyers familiar with
her account. But the proffer did not say that the president or his
allies had encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath in the Jones
case. That account did not satisfy Starr. Ginsburg argued in court
that Starr had offered Ms. Lewinsky immunity, but he lost.
</P>
<P>
   Starr then turned to other matters, spending months in
protracted court battles with the White House. All the while, the
distrust between Ginsburg and Starr's office grew so deep that all
communication ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky herself was instrumental in the ultimate decision
to dismiss Ginsburg, said lawyers familiar with the decision.
Friends recalled that when Ms. Lewinsky's father had first
suggested him back in January, her reaction was immediate: ``Dad,
he's a malpractice lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   She kept Nathaniel Speights, an experienced criminal defense
lawyer and Ginsburg's Washington co-counsel. Ms. Lewinsky was also
relying on advice from a savvy spokeswoman, Judy Smith, who began
to change the landscape of Ms. Lewinsky's insulated world. Ms.
Smith became a new confidante.
</P>
<P>
   It was Marcia Lewis, Ms. Lewinsky's mother, who read about Stein
in a New Yorker magazine profile and suggested approaching him. In
late June, Ms. Smith asked Cacheris whether his firm had any female
lawyers. It had: Sydney Hoffmann, a former assistant U.S. attorney.

 &HT;    Nation's lawyers bestow honor on Atlanta peer
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ An Atlanta lawyer devoted to providing legal help for
the poor was presented Saturday with one of the legal profession's
highest honors.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human
Rights, received the American Bar Association's Thurgood Marshall
Award. The award, named after the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice,
recognizes individuals who have made substantial contributions to
the advancement of civil rights and liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Bright, 49, one of the country's most outspoken opponents of the
death penalty, has headed the Southern Center for 16 years. He has
a staff of 16, including nine lawyers who earn less than $24,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who say there are the 'worthy poor' and
the 'unworthy poor,''' Bright said. ``This speaks very loudly that
is not the case and that it's important to provide representation
to the poorest and most powerless people, even those who have been
accused of or convicted of crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright also teaches courses on capital punishment and criminal
procedure at Emory, Harvard and Yale law schools.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the income he earns from speeches and teaching goes to
the center, where he works without salary.
</P>
<P>
   His office represents as many as 40 death row inmates at a time.
Its lawyers also file lawsuits on behalf of inmates who allege
unconstitutional conditions in jails and prisons. Earlier this
year, Southern Center clients settled with the state of Georgia
over allegations that guards at Hays State Prison in North Georgia
beat and stomped more than a dozen handcuffed inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's career exemplifies the ideals and highest standards of
our profession,'' said James E. Coleman Jr., chairman of the ABA
award committee. ``All of us are honored by his dedication and
selfless commitment.''

 &HT;    Will the buck stop here: Arizona voters will decide lottery's
future
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ After 15 years of growth that has made state-run
gambling the rule rather than the exception, the lottery bucks
could stop here.
</P>
<P>
   While Powerball-happy Arizonans lined up last week for a long
shot at a lot of money, some of their neighbors quietly plotted the
death of the Arizona lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Arizona voters will become the first in any state
to decide whether to kill off their lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gambling activists who have been playing defense for more
than a decade, as legalized gambling spread nationwide, are eager
to play offense for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banner has been raised,'' said Tom Grey of Illinois, a
Methodist minister-turned-anti-gambling crusader who was here last
week to work with anti-lottery forces.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona House Speaker Jeff Groscost, who is spearheading the
kill-the-lottery effort, already has a campaign theme in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good TV ad would comprise maybe a picture of throwing
dollars in the toilet and flushing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But players who queued up for Powerball tickets last week
weren't buying that argument. They see no evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just kind of a fun thing,'' Sun City resident Diana
Vander Molen said as she picked her $3 worth of numbers. ``Even if
you don't win it's fun. People spend money anyway on things they
shouldn't, so what the heck.''
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, player Laura Buenrostro had a simple explanation for
what she likes about lottery and why she will vote to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the Arizona effort is a peculiar coalition of
causes and circumstances. The lottery is in the cross hairs of
folks whose morals tell them it's wrong and lawmakers who don't
like how the revenue is spent.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Lottery also has a history of well-publicized
miscues and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a circumstance that has the lottery industry fearing
this could be the start of something bad, Arizona is among states
with strong economies. As in many states, the lottery came about in
Arizona as a revenue-of-least-resistance when money was tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tax on people who are bad in math,'' said Groscost,
whose opposition to lottery stems from his Mormon upbringing. ``I
was taught when I was young if you want something you go work for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the fray are players who see no sin in
spending small change for a big dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they didn't spend it on lottery, they'd find something else
they can throw it away on,'' said Jim Kane, who sells _ and buys _
lottery tickets at a Sun City gas station.
</P>
<P>
   Also lining up in support of the lottery are officials who spend
the revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dollars from your lottery are being used for important and
useful purposes,'' said The League of Arizona Cities and Towns _
whose members get a piece of the lottery pie _ in a statement. ``We
ask you to continue these projects by voting to continue the
lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate is one that could be echoed around the nation,
according to the chairman of the National Gambling Impact StudyCommission, a panel created by Congress to report on the effects of
the spread of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that, based on the kinds of questions I get
asked as I travel around the country, there are other states that
are asking these same kinds of questions about lotteries,'' said
Kay Cole Jones, dean of the Pat Robertson School of Government at
Regent University in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona election also has drawn the attention of the lottery
industry and its foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a seminal moment. It could be the beginning of
citizens holding lotteries accountable,'' said anti-gambling
evangelist Grey.
</P>
<P>
   David Gale, director of the North American Association of State
and Provincial Lotteries, said the industry is watching as
Arizonans decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, for some reason, it does not pass and that lottery would
close, I think it would be bad for not only our industry but all
the beneficiaries of lottery throughout the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, anti-lottery lawmakers are curious about the Arizona
vote but see no evidence of a repeal effort spreading to their
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are addicted (to the revenue), if the
definition of addiction is we couldn't do without it,'' said state
Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, chairman of the Finance
Committee and a lottery opponent. ``This year would be the perfect
year to do without it. I just don't know whether the public wants
to do without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballot fodder
</P>
<P>
   The November referendum in Arizona resulted from the state's
sunset process. If lawmakers had taken no action, the games
automatically would have shut down last month. Instead of making
the decision, lawmakers put the question on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   A ``yes'' vote continues the lottery until 2003, when it would
come up for sunset review again. A ``no'' vote kills it off next
July.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona voters, who rejected a lottery in 1970, approved it in
1980 by a margin of 51 percent to 49 percent. In most states,
lottery won approval by more than 60 percent of the voters.
Sixty-five percent of Texas voters said yes in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona lottery proceeds _ more than $1 billion since inception
_ are divided among several programs, including transportation,
education, parks acquisition and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1990 referendum put on the ballot by citizen petition,
Arizonans ordered lawmakers to earmark 11 percent of lottery money
for a Heritage Fund to pay for park development and land
acquisition and preservation. The fund has been a target since
then, both from Arizonans not enamored of state land ownership
(only 13 percent of Arizona land is privately owned) and lawmakers
who don't appreciate voters telling them how to spend voters'
money.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix lawyer Andy Gordon, who wrote the measure that
established the Heritage Fund, sees the lottery repeal effort as
another run at gutting the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've successfully defended against every one of those
attempts,'' Gordon, president of the Arizona Heritage Alliance,
said of legislative attacks on the fund. ``They've tried 19 times.
They've failed 19 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost, a hunter, is no tree-hugger. His desk features a can
of ``canned wolf,'' a tourist trinket that pokes fun at an
endangered species. Someone made off with his box of Spotted Owl
Toasties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question any expenditure of the state that doesn't go
through the appropriations process,'' Groscost said of his distaste
for the Heritage Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Also subject to spin is whether the state would miss the lottery
bucks. Last year the games provided $74 million in a $10 billion
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Dee Hull, a lottery opponent, believes finding
replacement money would be a ``big problem,'' according to Francie
Noyes, her press aide. But Hull, a Republican favored to win
re-election in November, is staying out of the lottery fray.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost said replacement money would be easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a drop in the bucket. It's not difficult to come
up with that money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign
</P>
<P>
   For Arizonans such as Warren Downs of Scottsdale, the money is
irrelevant. The retired real estate developer is angered by the
spread of legalized gambling in his state, especially Indian
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery and the casinos are not related in a legal sense.
But Downs, working with the coalition against the lottery, sees a
tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lottery was step one to more and more gambling in the
state,'' said Downs, who thinks his side faces an uphill battle.
``People are so happy with what's going on in the world, it's hard
to jar them loose on a situation of this nature. It is going to
take money.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Phillips, chairman of the Arizona Indian Gaming
Association, which represents tribes that operate 14 casinos, said
his group has made no decision on the lottery repeal question. But
he sees a potential domino effect on the casinos if the lottery
goes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure they are going in that direction,'' he said of
anti-gambling factions' possible ulterior motive. ``I'm pretty sure
there is a direction to do away with Indian gaming down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost, eager to look like the little guy up against Big
Business, says he is in a ``David and Goliath'' fight against
lottery industry interests he expects to bankroll the pro-lottery
campaign. He is convinced a Biblical backdrop is just what's needed
to rally the folks he is counting on for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some big pulpits around here,'' he said, referring to
10,000-member congregations he expects to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition will pitch in with a mailing to 500,000
voters, said Nathan Sproul, executive director of the state
chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost believes out-of-state companies that make money off the
Arizona Lottery will pitch in with campaign money to back the
pro-lottery side. But a spokesman for Gtech, the Rhode Island firm
that operates the Arizona Lottery, says it has no such plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very significant,'' said Gtech spokesman Bob Rendine,
casting off talk that the November vote could be the start of a
national trend.
</P>
<P>
   Lotteries will survive any repeal efforts because they are a
dependable source of revenue and ``the fact that people like to
play,'' Rendine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become an every day or every week experience for millions
of folks,'' he said. ``Conservatives ought to look at themselves
when they talk about taking away individual choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the Heritage Alliance president, said a high-profile
effort by legislative leaders such as Groscost could be fabulously
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could run a campaign simply saying the Legislature wants
to take your lottery away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a state in which the politician credibility gap is a
grand canyon. Two of last four governors left amid scandal. And in
1991, six legislators quit and another was removed from office
after a statehouse sting operation featuring an undercover
informant offering bribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature here is very unpopular,'' Gordon said. ``It is
generally viewed as being made up of bozos and buffoons.''
</P>
<P>
   The history
</P>
<P>
   Groscost said his campaign will ``regurgitate'' the Arizona
Lottery's history, a not-pretty picture that includes six directors
in the past five years, destruction of millions of unsold tickets,
wavering revenue and the firing of a lottery operator seven months
into a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent embarrassment was the June suspension of Pick 3
after officials discovered they held more than a month of drawings
with a computer program that could not select the number nine. More
than $44,000 was refunded to 3,600 players who could prove they had
picked nine.
</P>
<P>
   The game has resumed minus the computer and with used ping-pong
ball machines purchased from California. To rekindle interest,
prizes have been temporarily doubled.
</P>
<P>
   An October 1997 report by Arizona Auditor General Douglas Norton
offered an overall portrait of mismanagement. Per capita, Arizona's
lottery sales ranked 35th out of 38 lotteries in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many factors contribute to poor lottery sales, including high
management turnover, poorly planned or promoted games and
inadequate use of staff,'' Norton reported.
</P>
<P>
   Said Groscost: ``If people actually read the auditor general's
report, you'd be hard-pressed for anyone other than addicted
gambling addicts to vote for this turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Gonsher, the current lottery director, said the report
was on target, but it's nothing on which to base a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a completely different lottery today than it was 10
months ago when I first came on board,'' he said. ``For the first
time, we are operating this public agency as a business.''

 &HT;    Another curse of the scorching heat - a jump in grasshopper
population
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley and Pamela Coleman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas -- With the relentless heat and drought come . . .
the grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has more than 150 species of the little critters. Some of
them, hatched when their eggs escaped a normal drowning from the
rains that didn't come in April and May, have been chewing their
way through Central Texas crop and pasture land since June.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with many of those areas stripped clean by thousands of the
bugs or by the drought, some of the remaining hoppers are moving
into the suburbs, where tasty vegetable and flower gardens await.
</P>
<P>
   The plague isn't of biblical proportions, because only one
generation of grasshoppers is involved. But it's enough to reduce
affected gardeners to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're stripping gardens here and there,'' said John
Dromgoole, host of an Austin radio gardening show and owner of the
Gardenville nursery in southwest Travis County. ``The mockingbirds
are gorged with them. There aren't enough natural predators to keep
them in check.''
</P>
<P>
   The closer a garden is to the edge of a town, the greater the
risk of grasshopper infestation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The countryside is infested with them,'' Dromgoole said. ``We
walk through the fields out here, and they jump all over the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bastrop County, east of Austin, Gary Rassner, a Bastrop
dentist and organic gardener, said the grasshopper population is
the largest he's seen in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got trees protecting my garden site,'' he said. ``It's
worse out in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Donald Sybert, whose family has been farming wheat, corn and
cotton on the same land near Jarrell in Williamson County for more
than a century. This summer reminds Sybert of the mid-1950s, when a
record drought and swarms of grasshoppers ravaged the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take over and defoliate everything,'' Sybert said.
``They've stripped the leaves completely from the corn crop and
left a stick there with an ear of corn on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Corn, sorghum and cotton have been hurt by the grasshoppers, but
the problem, at least for farmers, seems to be abating, said Cliff
Hoelscher, an entomologist with the Texas Agricultural Extension
Service of Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in Central Texas ``have had a tough time in the last
three weeks,'' Hoelscher said. ``But in the last seven to 10 days
we've been seeing lower (grasshopper) populations. Some pockets
still exist, but it's not as widespread as it was six to eight
weeks ago. The continued dry weather is tough on the grasshoppers
like it is on everything else.'' The plague could continue into the
fall unless a hard rain kills the eggs of two common species of
grasshopper, which normally hatch in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``No rain and we'll have a fall population,'' Hoelscher said,
``but it's usually smaller than the spring ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought that brought the grasshopper plague has helped cut
down on some insect pests. Mosquitoes are less prevalent than
usual, as are fire ants.
</P>
<P>
   Hoelscher recommends combating grasshoppers in lawns and gardens
with the insecticides Sevin, malathion and diazinon. The Sevin xlr
formulation, he said, works particularly fast when put out in
little clumps mixed with bran flakes and molasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't bother pets,'' he said. ``It's very safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Rassner, Dromgoole and others, however, caution against relying
on insecticides because of the indiscriminate damage they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spraying malathion,'' Dromgoole said, ``kills all the lady
bugs, the geckos, the other lizards and our toad population. So you
don't only take down the grasshoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   While many gardeners have been putting out a disease-causing
protozoa specific to grasshoppers that is commonly known as nolo,
the remedy can take up to three weeks to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Dromgoole recommends a speedier, old-fashioned idea: flour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You dust it onto the plants being consumed,'' he said. ``The
grasshoppers get a mouthful of flour and no longer can chew.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you could take the advice of veteran farmer Sybert and resign
yourself to the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spray,'' Sybert said. ``But as many as there are,
you're just wasting your time. It's just part of the gamble. When
Mother Nature works against you, there's little you can do about
it.''

WASHINGTON: U.S. attorney. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stein and Cacheris decided to change the tenor of Ms. Lewinsky's
representation. It was time for some diplomacy. In early June, they
paid a courtesy visit to Starr. Once inside the office, Stein
talked in tough but measured terms with Starr. ``I have one good
trial left in me,'' Stein recalled telling Starr, ``and I'm going
to put it at Monica's disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words sent a clear message to Starr's prosecutors: Ms.
Lewinsky was prepared to fight an indictment. And Starr was well
aware that Stein had won the only acquittal in a major Watergate
criminal trial, representing Kenneth Parkinson, a Nixon lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   For Starr, Stein's remark also increased the pressure to work
out a deal with Ms. Lewinsky. Starr knew that if Ms. Lewinsky was
indicted, a trial would most likely delay his final report for a
year or longer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, July 21, Starr telephoned Stein and suggested a
meeting. The next day, Stein and Cacheris met at the independent
counsel's office with Starr and Dash. Afterward, Stein and Cacheris
sent a proffer letter that outlined what Ms. Lewinsky was prepared
to say under oath.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known what other evidence Starr has assembled, but Ms.
Lewinsky could provide testimony that helps prove that the
president lied under oath and tried to obstruct justice. Time was
of the essence, and it was to Starr's advantage to have Ms.
Lewinsky's account first, before he questioned the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, clarified on Saturday
how the president would be questioned by the independent counsel's
office at the White House. Kendall said the testimony would be
carried on a one-way live feed to the grand jury, and recorded on
videotape for any jurors who were absent.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the new proffer was not that different from
the one Ginsburg prepared, but the climate had changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trusted each other,'' Cacheris said, ``and trust had been a
problem in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr responded with his ``queen for a day'' offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted it sooner rather than later,'' Cacheris said of
Ms. Lewinsky's account. Stein and Cacheris told Ms. Lewinsky that
meeting with Starr, given his time pressures, was ``a favorable
development.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed to meet last Monday in New York. Both camps
worried that reporters in Washington would find out about the
secret meeting if held there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had nothing to lose,'' Cacheris said. ``She could say what
she wanted to say, as long as it was the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one thing left to negotiate before the meeting:
the lunch menu. Starr and Stein decided it would be tuna fish
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Ms. Lewinsky said she was anguished over the prospect
of testifying against the president, but an even greater worry
weighed on her. She knew that her mother was also vulnerable to
prosecution by Starr because she had kept her daughter's cocktail
dress with a stain. Lawyers said that Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors
that the stain could provide evidence of a sexual encounter with
the president. The dress is being tested at the FBI crime
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has come to understand that she was going to
assume responsibility for the portion of this that was her fault,
and just tell the truth,'' a friend said. If the presidency is
damaged, the friend said, ``the president has to take
responsibility for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while in Los Angeles last weekend, Ms. Lewinsky asked
friends, ``Am I doing the right thing?'' They encouraged her to do
whatever she believed it would take to put an end to her six-month
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky told Stein and Cacheris that she was ready to talk
to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Although the five-hour meeting last Monday was held in the
midtown Manhattan apartment of Starr's mother-in-law, Starr was not
present. But Cacheris and Stein were pleased to see Dash take a
leading role in organizing that meeting, as he had in setting up
negotiations with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   While Dash raised the comfort levels of Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers,
Ms. Hoffmann, the lawyer in Cacheris' office, had grown close to
Ms. Lewinsky, and she was able to make Ms. Lewinsky feel more at
ease. Ms. Hoffmann started the session by asking Ms. Lewinsky a
series of questions.
</P>
<P>
   After about 30 minutes, Starr's team _ Dash, William Bittman and
Sol Wisenberg _ asked questions of Ms. Lewinsky. ``There was no
rancor,'' Stein said afterward. ``It was congenial, dignified and,
under the circumstances, it was elevated.'' An FBI agent took
notes.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 p.m., Cacheris ended the meeting. Ms. Lewinsky returned
to a friend's apartment. That night, Starr left a message on
Stein's answering machine. Ms. Lewinsky had been deemed credible by
his deputies. There was the basis for a transactional immunity
agreement, which is full and blanket protection from prosecution
unless prosecutors find that Ms. Lewinsky has lied to the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Cacheris and Stein went to Starr's office to pick up
the immunity agreement, which Starr had signed. They brought it
back to their offices, where Ms. Lewinsky signed it just before 2
p.m., when Stein and Cacheris announced it.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement to grant transactional immunity to Ms. Lewinsky's
mother was negotiated by her lawyer, Billy Martin, with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky faces the difficult task of attending daily
debriefings with Starr's prosecutors. She is preparing for her
grand jury testimony. After that, Ms. Lewinsky could be called upon
to testify in public at a hearing before the House Judiciary
Committee if it chooses to hold impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been apprehensive about all of this,'' Stein said.
``She is a bright person and is bright enough to know this is very
serious business.''

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: A CAMBODIAN VILLAGE GUARDS ITS MYSTERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PREK YI HIN, Cambodia _ Time has stood still for the village of
Prek Yi Hin. Gaunt cows graze near rice and corn fields. In the
cool underneath the stilt houses, women cut banana leaves and pigs
nap. Politics also follows a long tradition in Prek Yi Hin, about
20 miles from Phnom Penh. A village leader administers what few
programs reach here and chooses who gets rice when the harvest runs
out.
</P>
<P>
   The conduct of these leaders became a major issue in the debate
over whether Cambodia's elections last week were free and fair. All
village leaders are appointed by the Cambodian People's Party,
which has ruled since 1979 and maintains an efficient, repressive
political machine, especially in the hamlets where most Cambodians
live.
</P>
<P>
   Election observers accuse village leaders of buying votes with
sarongs, rice and money, and threatening opposition supporters.
Fears were so high that ballots from several polling stations were
mixed before counting to keep a village's vote secret. Foreign
election observers and journalists visited hamlets across the
country to try to gauge the extent of these practices.
</P>
<P>
   In a village there is no such thing as a private conversation.
As my translator and I moved from house to house, the curious crowd
following us grew. After a few conversations, 50 people pressed in
on us and the woman we were trying to speak with.
</P>
<P>
   Asking to go into her house could have endangered her. So we
talked to a crowd of giggling adults and naked children, and were
told that everything was fine. If there was intimidation, people
were too intimidated to say.
</P>
<P>
   In another hamlet I had asked a similar throng of people if
their village leader was democratically elected. They chorused yes,
though he had been appointed in 1979. Here in Prek Yi Hin villagers
assured us the election had brought them no threats. They said they
had received no money, only clothing, from the CPP. Perhaps they
had not been told gifts were sensitive. On no subject was there any
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The village chief was at the polling station. Lu Mal, about 50,
wore a sarong and rubber beach sandals. He said the CPP had given
out sarongs and rice, but no money. He was confident the party
would win in the village, as 600 of 650 registered voters were
members.
</P>
<P>
   One woman did invite us into her house. So Eth, 41, urged that I
print her name because her husband, Thong Sophal, who supported the
royalist party Funcinpec, was murdered _ one of scores of political
killings in the past year. None have been seriously investigated,
although her husband's murder was documented by a U.N. human rights
office. She hoped that speaking out would press the government to
find the killers.
</P>
<P>
   She said that her family was forced to join the CPP and that
before the election members got food, clothes and a dollar. Her
house was one room, with a small, curtained sleeping area. The bare
floor held only straw sleeping mats and a small, ancient
television. A few of her seven children sat next to her as she wept
softly.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband registered to be a Funcinpec observer, she
said, village officials summoned him. He became afraid and wanted
to quit. He vanished June 16.
</P>
<P>
   His body was found 12 days later, with his eyes gouged out, all
his fingers severed and his legs stripped of flesh. The district
police inspector suggested to the United Nations that he committed
suicide.

REAL ESTATE: THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In times past, residents met in the town square to exchange
ideas, information and the experiences that defined their lives. In
the last couple of years, however, a new town meeting place has
emerged on home computer screens. It is in the form of electronic
bulletin boards, which provide a focal point for neighborhoods
ranging in size from the area around a strip mall to communities
defined not by physical boundaries but by the bonds of common
interests and ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the virtual town center of the global virtual village
known as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing now flies in the face of what everyone
thought computers were going to do to us,'' said Kenny Greenberg,
the creator of LICWeb (www.licweb.com), an Internet site that
provides information and interaction for residents of Long Island
City, Queens. ``People thought computers were going to isolate us.
But the ability to communicate with my neighbors electronically
over the Internet has made my life richer instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the free services provided by the site are links to the
Long Island City Virtual Mall, where local artists and musicians
can post notices of future appearances and businesses and
professionals can tack up electronic business cards. There are also
online tours of Socrates Sculpture Park and of Long Island City by
Jack Eichenbaum, a local historian.
</P>
<P>
   While the informational portion of the site is clearly useful to
residents, Greenberg said, what was surprising to him was the way
local residents immediately responded to the electronic bulletin
boards accessible through the site. ``I figured the boards would be
popular,'' Greenberg said. ``But they seem to be expanding at an
alarming rate.'' He pointed out that in July alone the site logged
more than 30,000 ``hits'' _ the term used to indicate the number of
times visitors visit the site.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular bulletin board _ for Queens West, the huge
waterfront development site _ accounted for nearly 75 percent of
the total visits to the site. Others include a board named
``Astoria, Sunnyside, etc.,'' and one called ``Citylights,'' a
board within the Queens West board that is accessible, by means of
a password, only to tenants of the first apartment tower on the
Queens West site.
</P>
<P>
   Another community site accessible from LICWeb via a hyperlink is
GoSteinway-Street (www.gosteinway.com), a site dedicated to a
neighborhood surrounding a strip mall in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mall itself is seven blocks long but the neighborhood is
17 blocks square,'' said Zarrar Sheikh, an Astoria, Queens,
resident who helped create the site along with Cyberpoint, an
Astoria web-design company. Zarrar said he was in the process of
creating a bulletin board for interaction among residents.
``Somebody had to represent the area sooner or later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum is ``HV/Net'' (www.hvnet.com),
a Web site that provides a wide range of information about the
towns and hamlets that make up the Hudson Valley, from Westchester
to Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``HV/Net is a huge site,'' said Ed Szamborski, president of
American Digital, the online service provider that hosts the site
on its computers. ``It has more than 8,000 pages that cover just
about every town in the Hudson Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting from the HV/Net ``front page,'' visitors can link to
pages about historic points of interest in towns along the Hudson
River; take virtual tours of Hudson Valley wineries and make
reservations in hundreds of hotels, motels, bed-and-breakfasts and
small inns throughout the area. In addition to such visitor-type
information, the site also provides minutely-detailed information
about towns and villages in the valley.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other sites that area residents might find useful include the
TownLink Network (www.townlink.net), which provides information
about community organizations and municipal services in most
Westchester County towns; and Westchester In Touch
(www.co.westchester.ny.us), a site hosted by the Westchester County
government itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Westchester didn't have many town centers even in the old
days,'' said Norman Jacknis, chief information officer for the
county and webmaster for the site. ``So we've made arrangements
with the Westchester library system to use their Internet service
to make as much information available to the public as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The link to the library site provides schedules for local flea
markets, farmers' markets, arts and crafts fairs and historic
events, Jacknis said. It also contains information about government
services available to county residents.
</P>
<P>
   And soon, Jacknis said, the Westchester In Touch site is
expected to provide visitors with access to important documents
drafted by the county's Board of Legislators; geographical
information, including location and condition of area watersheds
and tens of thousands of deeds, mortgages and related documents
filed in county offices. ``It's the modern way of providing a
community service,'' Jacknis said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of commercial sites offer community services to
individuals and groups registered with the site. For example,
Interclubs (www.interclubs.com) allows individuals with similar
interests to form their own ``clubs'' and then invite others to
join. The site allows for either public or private clubs, with the
latter being accessible by a special password given only to those
who have been invited to join.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, Koz (www.koz.com), also offers public and private
``mini-networks,'' but with an emphasis on community-based
information and services. The site allows groups of 50 or less to
set up their own ``Koz community'' free of charge. Larger groups
pay a fee for the service.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites that provide varying combinations of services to
groups _ services like homepage publishing kits, e-mail, chat
rooms, bulletin boards, calendar services and online space for
group information _ include Xoom (www.xoom.com), GeoCities
(www.geocities.com), and a New York Times web site, New York Today
(www.nytoday.com).
</P>
<P>
   New York Today provides noncommercial groups the ability to
publish events in an online calendar, and is testing a service that
would allow community groups to establish mini-networks on the site
on which information would be posted that would be accessible only
to members.
</P>
<P>
   America On-Line (www.aol.com) is also developing plans for a
service it calls Hometown AOL, aimed at members with common
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in finding out whether there are Internet sites
that provide information or community services for residents in
their area should enter the name of their county, town or
neighborhood _ perhaps adding modifying phrases like ``community,''
or ``local government services'' _ to limit the number of ``hits''
returned.
</P>
<P>
   The results might be surprising.

A CORNER TYSON CALLS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CATSKILL, N.Y. _ Camille Ewald's house, as wide and stately as
Tara, stands at the end of a dirt road, shrouded by bushes and
shade trees. Still, Mike Tyson gawkers manage to find it. They come
all the time when the boxer is far away from the news, and,
especially, when he is in it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ewald, Tyson's 93-year-old ``adopted mother,'' is used to
the curiosity-seekers, though she minds them, too. The more brazen
ones pull up to the driveway and stare at the back door, as if the
boxer, who spent his formative training years here, might appear at
any moment. Which, as anyone in Catskill knows, is not all that
far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-room Victorian where Tyson came to live when he was 12 to
learn his sport from the trainer Cus D'Amato, Ms. Ewald's
companion, is still the place, 20 years later, that the boxer calls
his ``real home.''
</P>
<P>
   To visit Ms. Ewald is to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Her house, which she shares with Jay Bright, a 40-year-old
boxing trainer who came to live here when he was orphaned at 14, is
open to all her ``sons'': dozens of former amateur and professional
boxers who have lived here for a spell during the nearly 25 years
that D'Amato ran his Catskill gym.
</P>
<P>
   Many call and visit regularly. But Tyson, who stayed after
D'Amato died in 1985 and lived here until his first marriage, in
1988 at age 22, clearly enjoys a special devotion. There are
pictures of him and his children sprinkled through Ms. Ewald's
antique-filled rooms, early trophies on the mantel in the living
room and scrapbooks on a shelf behind the sofa in the den.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who had the house restored for Ms. Ewald when he hit it
big, still keeps pigeons in a two-story coop that he helped build
in the back yard, overlooking the Hudson, when he was a teen-ager.
(A hand-painted wood sign on the front of it reads ``Tyson's
Corner.'') Ms. Ewald keeps his second-floor bedroom ready for him.
He comes up regularly, to celebrate birthdays, bring the kids, duck
the spotlight. It's a sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The boxer's troubles have long overshadowed his triumph at
becoming the youngest heavyweight champion in history, at age 20.
His outburst last week during a hearing about a New Jersey boxing
license, where he was supposed to show he was reformed _ sorry
about the rape, sorry about biting off a piece of Evander
Holyfield's ear _ gave more ammunition to those who say he is
irredeemable. Still, whatever one thinks of the boxer, it would be
hard not to soften a bit, or at least to not admire his taste in
mothers, after spending time with his beloved Camille.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ewald, who speaks with a slight Ukrainian accent, is quick
to laugh, tells only the sweet Mike Tyson anecdotes and relishes
showing off ``the grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, here are the kids, so cute, with Monica, who is a
wonderful, nice person, and very pretty, too,'' Ms. Ewald said the
other day, displaying snapshots of Tyson's family. They'd been
taken on a recent Sunday, when the boxer's wife, Dr. Monica Tyson,
a pediatrician, came to visit with their two toddlers and Tyson's
7-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, an occasion that
prompted Ms. Ewald to cook a Thanksgiving-like feast.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ewald, like Cus D'Amato when he was alive, has taken heat
from critics for defending Tyson no matter what. But she makes no
apologies for it. ``They act like he's a machine,'' she said, ``not
a person with a soul!''
</P>
<P>
   Both she and Bright, who graduated from Bard College with a
theater degree and stayed here to look after Ms. Ewald after Cus
D'Amato died, are fiercely private and protective of the boxer.
(They almost never give interviews and agreed to this one only at
the urging of a friend.) Questions about his worst episodes are off
limits, but they obviously believe that they are among a very few
people who truly know the fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Bright said that when Tyson came here as a parolee from an
upstate juvenile prison, he worked to fit in. ``Camille and Cus had
rules that everybody had to follow,'' Bright said. ``Mike had to
follow them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There were usually eight to 10 young fighters living in the
house at any time, and they all had troubled backgrounds, Ms. Ewald
said. ``People would say, `How can you control those boys?' They
were just boys!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Camille taught one of the fighters to read and write,'' said
Bright, a soft-spoken man who has trained Tyson in several
professional bouts and considers him a brother. ``She taught a
bunch of them how to use a knife and fork. These were guys from the
streets. Camille taught us how to cook and clean and do our
laundry.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Tyson had his tribulations. ``The first
year, he ran away three times,'' Ms. Ewald said. The third time,
she said, he called and said he wanted to come back but was scared.
He was told to come back, and when he did, he received a stern
lecture from D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike started to cry,'' Ms. Ewald said. ``And Cus felt so bad
that he had made him so upset, that he hugged him and kissed him.
Afterwards, Mike came to me and said, `Camille, Cus hugged me and
kissed me!' He was so happy.''

SIR JAMES LIGHTHILL, 74, INNOVATIVE MATHEMATICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By FORD BURKHART    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir James Lighthill, an innovative British mathematician whose
ideas about aerodynamics influenced the design of the supersonic
Concorde, died on July 17 while he was trying to swim around the
Isle of Sark in the English Channel. He was 74 and lived in London.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was heart failure, said a colleague, Dr.
Grigory Isaakovich Barenblatt, professor of mathematics at the
University of California in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Lighthill was trying to repeat a swim he first made 25 years
earlier, for which he applied a scientific approach using a
``two-arm, two-leg backstroke, thrusting with arms and legs
alternately.'' His body was found in rough seas off Sark.
</P>
<P>
   Lighthill, who was the Provost of University College, London,
from 1979 to 1989 and who held the Lucasian Chair of Applied
Mathematics at Cambridge University in the 1970s, a position in
which he preceded Stephen Hawking, made early discoveries in
mathematical modeling of how creatures swim, fly and move about.
</P>
<P>
   He published his first scholarly paper when he was 19 and just a
year out of Cambridge University. It concerned supersonic airfoil
theory, and led to his innovative work in aerodynamics, which
influenced the development of jet aircraft. His work on a
dart-shaped supersonic aircraft was central to development of the
Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s he carried out research in aerodynamics at the
National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, England.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Oxford University Press published his collected
papers, four volumes embracing topics like reducing noise from jet
planes and nonlinear fluid mechanical acoustics, a science he
founded with a single scholarly paper written at age 32.
</P>
<P>
   He held the Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics at the University
of Manchester and was director of the Royal Aircraft Establishment
at Farnborough from 1959 to 1964. He was knighted in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Lighthill is survived by his wife, the former Nancy Dumaresq;
their four daughters; and a son.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The N.Y. Times said in an editorial Aug. 2:
</P>
<P>
   His favorite programs, including restoration of the Everglades
and the repair of the national parks, are getting hammered by the
appropriations committees in Congress. His reputation in Washington
is clouded by an investigation into allegations that contributions
to the Democratic Party influenced his decision on an Indian casino
license. Yet far from treading water, Bruce Babbitt is charging
around the country doing what a secretary of the interior ought to
be doing: spreading a gospel of stewardship and using the inherent
powers of his office to put in place environmental strategies that,
with any luck, will outlive his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has been at this for a while. Occasionally he has
overreached and sometimes the White House has let him down. His
efforts to reform destructive grazing and mining practices have
largely been thwarted by Congress. Other projects have fared
better. He has engineered important land swaps that have enlarged
protected wilderness, and he has tried to improve the workings of
the Endangered Species Act by persuading landowners, developers and
local governments to negotiate agreements protecting entire
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he has taken on an even more ambitious target, the
country's vast network of public and private dams. In so doing, he
has also challenged 70 years of accepted public policy, which holds
that dams are by definition a good thing. Babbitt is pressing a
different philosophy _ that while some dams are good, others are
environmentally destructive, ruining watersheds and fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 75,000 large dams in the United States, about
2,000 are privately owned hydroelectric dams, and the Federal
licenses of 250 of these will be up for renewal in the next decade.
Some of these dams have already been denied licenses, and when the
wrecking ball appears _ as it has so far in Wisconsin, Maine, North
Carolina and California _ so, too, does Babbitt, pressing a
philosophy that he hopes will inform federal decision-making in the
years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dams are not like the pyramids of Egypt that stand for
eternity,'' he said recently as he took a sledgehammer to the
McPherrin Dam on California's Butte Creek, once a major salmon run.
``They are instruments that should be judged by the health of the
rivers to which they belong.'' This is fairly ambitious stuff, at
least as radical by Washington's standards as the efforts of Mike
Dombeck, the Forest Service chief, to change the culture of an
agency that has long promoted the harvesting of national forests at
the expense of natural values.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether Congress will provide the money to
dismantle federal and private dams that have outlived their
usefulness as power generators, and to change the operations of
others to make them more friendly to the environment. The key
player here is Sen. Slade Gorton, the Washington Republican who
controls Interior Department spending. Gorton has been holding up
the funds for a carefully crafted agreement to remove two dams on
the Elwha River in his home state until he receives assurances that
the federal government will not modify any other dam in the Pacific
Northwest without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   The senator says he is merely reflecting the views of working
people who depend on cheap water and power from the Columbia and
Snake River dams. Babbitt is trying to persuade Gorton that after
all these years, the environment deserves a voice too.

SINGLETARY TACKLES LIFE THE SAME WAY HE DID FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The eyes are a window to the soul, and when NFL quarterbacks
stood opposite middle linebacker Mike Singletary, perhaps that is
what bothered them most.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of battle, Singletary's eyes took on a
wounded-animal glare that was almost subhuman in its intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could literally feel his presence on the field,'' recalls
former Cowboys quarterback Danny White, who played several times
against Singletary's Chicago Bears in the 1980s. ``And as a
quarterback, you always wanted to know where he was.''
</P>
<P>
   In a violent sport, such intensity helped Singletary, 39, to a
legendary career honored yesterday with his induction into the Pro
Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But he also turned that steely focus upon himself. Because he
was driven to self-improvement and not content simply to disrupt
offenses and crack helmets, Singletary has become much more than
just a famous ex-football player.
</P>
<P>
   Once a motivator to teammates, he now travels the country to
give motivational speeches to businesses, and he is a devoted
family man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike is one of the finest people on the face of the earth,''
said his college mentor, former Baylor coach Grant Teaff.
</P>
<P>
   Taeff remembered the Singletary who arrived at Baylor from
Houston's Worthing High School in 1977 as an introverted and
inarticulate kid. But as Teaff would soon discover, he was also
ambitious and goal-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary once said that the first speech he heard Teaff make
to the team forever changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him bring people together, make a difference,''
Singletary said. ``I knew that was what I wanted to do in my life.
So it became something I worked on.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasted no time. On the first day of freshman classes, Teaff
received a phone call from a distinguished English professor. Teaff
groaned. Bad news, his experience told him. But the professor
wanted to relay to Teaff what Singletary had stayed after class to
tell her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike wanted to know if she would teach him the proper English
he should be using the rest of his life, verbally and written,''
Teaff recalls. ``Talk about lighting somebody's fuse. She was on
fire for that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, Singletary was developing those talents and
putting them to use. As a captain, he would address the Baylor
squad every Friday night before games. Walter Abercrombie, a former
teammate, still thinks of Singletary's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, they were profound,'' Abercrombie said. ``He would
talk about life, how football played a role in life, and the
importance of giving it all you have.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a sophomore or junior in college. Somebody that young
is not supposed to talk that profoundly. But we all listened to him
like E. F. Hutton had walked in the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Singletary is still saying and writing the right things, in
proper English, no less.
</P>
<P>
   He is a corporate consultant who has made motivational
presentations to AT&AMP;T, Wal-Mart, Bayer, UPS and Ralston-Purina,
among other Fortune 500 corporations. Next January, he will speak
to the American Football Coaches Association, an organization
headed by Teaff.
</P>
<P>
   His third book is titled ``Daddy's Home at Last'', whose topics
of family responsibility and overcoming obstacles are themes he
often hits hard in his speeches, which usually have religious
overtones.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance to his suburban Chicago home hangs a family
mission statement: ``This is the home of champions. As Singletarys,
we will always strive to do our very best in all we do. We will
strive to be honest and respect each other's feelings, property,
and time. We will always pray for one another, fight for one
another and encourage one another. For our trust be not in our
home, nor our money or status or knowledge, but in each other, and
above all, in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Singletary's father, a Pentecostal minister, left the family
when Singletary was 12, and his older brother, Grady, was killed by
a drunk driver six months later.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary has been married to his wife, Kim, for more than a
dozen years and has seven children.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I strive to tell corporate America is if you have to be
the best you can be, go for it, but don't stop there,'' Singletary
recently told the ``Chicago Tribune''. ``Be the best dad, the best
husband, the best wife. That's not going to come easily, but there
can be a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   His impact has been felt in other ways, too.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Singletary heard a news report that Bears defensive
lineman Alonzo Spellman had barricaded himself inside a Tower
Lakes, Ill., home and was surrounded by a SWAT team. Singletary
drove to the site, walked into the home, and emerged peacefully
with Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, No. 50 was a hero in Chicago long before that.
</P>
<P>
   During his 12-year career with the Bears, Singletary was an
eight-time All-Pro selection and made 885 unassisted tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bears defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan credits Singletary
with saying - or shouting -the right thing during a 1984 slump, and
turning around the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the middle of the year, and we'd lost three games in a
row,'' said Ryan, who now lives on a farm in Lawrenceburg, Ky. ``He
was one of three guys out front leading calisthenics. Suddenly he
started screaming at the top of his lungs, over and over: `I refuse
to go home early this year!'
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt kind of embarrassed for him, and I started walking the
other way. But then Dan Hampton yelled out, `I hear you, Samurai!'
And Walter Payton was hollering, `I'm with you, Mike!' All of a
sudden, it went through the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears regained focus and began winning again. The next
season, Singletary anchored the fearsome defense that led them to a
15-1 regular-season record and Super Bowl XX championship, with his
own pregame focus so thorough he bought a tape machine identical to
the one at Bears headquarters to watch game films at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed that one guy can make a difference,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Teaff saw the same attributes at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   As a raw freshman, Singletary would flame out during practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his intensity, he was always moving his feet and his eyes
were glaring from the time he stepped onto the practice field, in
drills and warmups and calisthenics,'' Teaff said. ``He would flat
wear himself out. By the time he got two-thirds of the way into
practice, he was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy, but one of the first things we had to teach
him was to control that energy level and let it explode when ball
was snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Singletary became a two-time All-American at Baylor, yet
sometimes he still exploded early. He occasionally became so worked
up before games that he would hyperventilate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be a mild-mannered guy, and then it was like you turned
on a light, and he became this wild, crazed animal,'' Abercrombie
said. ``He'd be giving you 110 percent on every single play to the
point where he'd almost pass out.''
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie, a running back who later played for the Pittsburgh
Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles, also said Singletary mastered the
art of what ex-Steelers coach Chuck Noll used to call the
``three-inch rising blow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike could hit the hardest in the shortest distance of anybody
I ever played with,'' Abercrombie said. ``He had that knack of
knowing how to hit and making it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played against him twice. You tried to dodge that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than anything else, Abercrombie remembers
Singletary as someone destined to become successful at more than
causing a close-range headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always had the feeling Mike would be someone special,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In football terms, that was officially recognized at yesterday's
Hall of Fame ceremony in Canton, Ohio. Singletary, inducted in his
first year of eligibility, was presented by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mike called to tell me he had been elected, I told him
that's not what I'm proudest of him for,'' Teaff said. ``I said the
most important thing is the kind of man you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the finest human beings I've ever known. He's one
of the finest husbands and fathers I know. He had desire on the
football field, but he had that same desire to become educated. And
he is making a tremendous contribution to society.''

<P>
   The N.Y. Times said in an editorial Aug. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Fear of chaos in the world's computer systems in the year 2000
may be hard for most people to take seriously. The temptation is to
assume that since technicians created the problem, technicians can
solve it. But with only 516 days until the fateful turnover, it is
clear that the United States is not moving fast enough to fix its
computers or prepare for significant disruptions. Instead of
addressing a potential crisis, many leaders in business and
government are complacent, declining to act for fear of lawsuits or
engaging in political fights. Their lack of attention could be
crippling.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called millennium bug arises from chips and software
coded to mark the years with only two digits. If not adjusted by
Jan. 1, 2000, myriad systems will ``roll over like the odometer on
an old Chevy,'' as Wired magazine put it, effectively thinking they
had just jumped back to the year 1900. No one is sure what will
happen. The breakdowns could be minor, or they could disable
everything from air traffic control systems to financial networks,
power grids, hospitals and home appliances. Some economists warn of
a global recession.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to prepare for the worst. The federal government
has made progress but is far behind in upgrading air traffic
systems, Medicare, the Pentagon and other sectors. In addition, a
petty budget dispute between the House and Senate has blocked $3
billion in emergency funds to speed up the process. A major problem
is that even if the federal government is in perfect shape, its
systems could become impaired by interacting with state and local
governments, where potential problems are rampant. Similarly, big
businesses could fix their own systems only to have them break down
by contact with noncompliant customers, clients and suppliers at
home and overseas. The Securities and Exchange Commission is
actively monitoring efforts to root out problems throughout the
financial industry, but much more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has belatedly stepped up the federal campaign
to increase public awareness by establishing a Council on Year 2000
Conversion, but he and Al Gore, the First Technophile, should do
even more. They and sympathetic members of Congress should win
passage of legislation to encourage companies to share information
with one another, disclose problems to the public and move more
aggressively to correct them. At present, many businesses are
afraid to act out of fear that any corrective efforts that fell
short would simply invite lawsuits charging that they knew their
systems were flawed.
</P>
<P>
   If the millennium bug problem were simply a matter of software,
it would be bad enough. But experts say the most dangerous aspect
of the problem is that so many systems _ from missiles to
natural-gas pipelines to hospital equipment _ rely on billions of
tiny chips embedded where they would have to be found by engineers
and reprogrammed or replaced. Congress should consider tax
incentives or subsidies to encourage businesses to identify
vulnerabilities and recruit professionals, including retired
people.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be that all these problems can be managed. But
experts recommend that employees ask their bosses about what is
being done to get ready. If the answer is that there is nothing to
worry about, it is time to start worrying. It will cost billions to
fix potential problems. But that is nothing compared to what it
will cost if the fears of many experts prove correct. &QL;

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In a darkened office at Colonial Country
Club, Dick McHargue closed the hand-tooled leather cover protecting
a half-inch stack of bound documents. He popped a video cassette
into a tape player.
</P>
<P>
   The room filled with the familiar voice of Pat Summerall. But
this time, Summerall wasn't playing straight man to John Madden on
an NFL telecast or hawking hardware supplies. He was extolling the
virtues of Colonial as host for the weeklong 2003 Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Other voices joined in the chorus, from golf legend Byron Nelson
to Gov. George W. Bush to Red Steagall, the official cowboy poet of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of 15 minutes and two videotapes, viewers received a
three-dimensional, computer-generated tour of Colonial's proposed
corporate area in Forest Park and the Fort Worth Zoo. They sampled
some of Steagall's work. And they learned of Colonial's innovative
ideas for the competition, from an Olympics-style opening ceremony
to nightly fireworks displays at the conclusion of play.
</P>
<P>
   McHargue, chairman of Colonial's Ryder Cup Committee, chuckled
as he turned off the final videotape, which served as the
centerpiece of the club's May 15 presentation to PGA of America
officials in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. He reflected on a
conversation with Jim Awtrey, PGA chief executive officer and the
man who will announce the 2003 Ryder Cup site at some point between
the PGA Championship (Aug. 10-16) and the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim asked us to think out of the box on this one, and we
definitely did that,'' said McHargue, whose committee has spent
$225,000 in quest of the Ryder Cup, including $75,000 for the 3-D
video. ``We hit them with a lot of new ideas. I really believe that
if they come here ... they'll look back at what we did to make
their event bigger and better and make that the standard for future
Ryder Cups in this country. Our event could be the prototype for
the next 100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, future Ryder Cups will be filled with ancillary events
such as parades, fireworks displays and welcoming ceremonies.
Because the PGA of America caps ticket sales for the Ryder Cup at
30,000 daily admissions, club officials sought a way to elicit more
fan involvement.
</P>
<P>
   That led to the idea of two separate-ticket events to raise
money for local charities. One would be a welcoming ceremony at
Alliance Airport, with an aerial show by the Blue Angels or
Thunderbirds preceding the arrival of both teams' charter planes.
The other would be an Olympics-style opening ceremony at TCU's Amon
Carter Stadium, preceded by a parade down University Drive.
</P>
<P>
   McHargue estimated that $1 million in charitable donations would
be ``very realistic'' from the ceremonies, which club officials
expect to attract a combined 100,000 fans. Under terms of the
proposal, the PGA of America could set whatever price it desired on
tickets to the events and would receive the tax benefit of the
charitable contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Both ideas, said McHargue, met with enthusiastic responses from
PGA of America officials, who have never held grand-scale opening
ceremonies in conjunction with past Ryder Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Cramped for corporate space on club property, Colonial officials
received permission to use facilities at Forest Park and the Fort
Worth Zoo to set up more than 100 corporate chalets, as well as a
40,000-square-foot merchandise tent. A 90-bus shuttle system has
been established to transport Ryder Cup spectators to the course
from 23,000 parking spaces in a variety of public lots within four
miles of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial officials used 22 color-coded maps or drawings to
outline their logistical plans for PGA of America officials. To
give their presentation a Western flair, McHargue enlisted Steagall
to write a poem titled ``The Ryder Comes to Texas'' and had Joey
Jemison, a Fort Worth saddle maker, hand-tool leather covers for
each of the 10 proposals they left with PGA officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll promise you, they've never been courted like we've
courted them,'' said McHargue, whose committee has tapped funds
from club coffers and local businesses during a quest that began in
February 1996. ``From the beginning, we knew if we were going to be
seriously considered, we had to go above and beyond what other
people did. We made sure nobody can outproposal us.''
</P>
<P>
   Such aggressive thinking, said Colonial president Clark Martin,
has helped Colonial clear its two biggest hurdles _ concerns about
parking and corporate space _ and move from ``nowhere to a
contender ... with about a 50-50 shot'' of playing host to the 2003
Ryder Cup, based on feedback from industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Wadkins, 1995 Ryder Cup captain, has identified Colonial
and Pinehurst (N.C.) Country Club as the probable front-runners in
the race to land the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be my guess, based on what I'm hearing'' from PGA
officials, Wadkins said. Other clubs bidding to hold the event are
Medinah (Ill.) Country Club; Congressional Country Club in
Bethesda, Md.; Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, Calif., and
Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Citing company policy, PGA of America officials declined to
discuss the merits of sites. They did confirm that Colonial was the
first club to make a detailed, formal presentation in its quest to
land the Ryder Cup and suggested such a step might set the standard
for future suitors.
</P>
<P>
   How much weight Colonial's proposal will carry during site
deliberations is unclear. But there was no denying the presentation
was well-received in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was spontaneous applause when we finished,'' Martin
said. ``It kind of surprised us.''
</P>
<P>
   The warm reception convinced Colonial officials that their
$225,000 outlay could prime the pump for a financial bonanza for
Fort Worth-Dallas. Officials from Rochester, N.Y., site of the last
Ryder Cup held in the United States, estimated an economic impact
between $30 million and $50 million from having the 1995 event at
Oak Hill Country Club. Since that time, the Ryder Cup has
mushroomed in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr, who accompanied Colonial
officials to their final presentation in May, said a Ryder Cup at
Colonial would give Fort Worth ``a world visibility that we don't
have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great showcase for Colonial and for golf, which
is very important in Texas,'' Barr said. ``It would be a great
economic generator for us. There's no question, if they get the
event, we will commit whatever resources we need to make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, at this stage, is getting it. Only those inside
the PGA of America know the exact pecking order of clubs vying to
hold the event. And they're not sharing that information.
</P>
<P>
   Like PGA officials, Barr said he was taken aback by the
thoroughness and quality of Colonial's proposal, which he termed
``awesome.'' Club officials, he said, played every card in the deck
to sell a Texas-based Ryder Cup to PGA officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get it, I think it would be because of politics
within the organization itself,'' Barr said. ``We've given them
every reason to choose Fort Worth that we possibly could.''
</P>
<P>
   McHargue concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how they can tell us, `No.' It just makes too much
sense to me,'' McHargue said. ``I've convinced myself that we're
going to get the thing. I don't know what more we could do, quite
frankly.''

YANKS BEAT MARINERS, 5-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Teammates are greeting Hideki Irabu, Ramiro Mendoza
and Homer Bush with mock surprise, feigning shock that any of them
are still with the Yankees after the trade deadline. But the
Yankees are intact, and they continue to play that way.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells pitched a complete game to earn his 13th victory,
and Tino Martinez and Derek Jeter hit home runs on Saturday as the
Yankees beat the Mariners, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have beaten Seattle, demoralized in the aftermath of
the Randy Johnson trade, in the first two games of this series, and
have won four of the first five games of their 10-game West Coast
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are once again in step with the 1902 Pirates: like
that team, the Yankees have won 77 of their first 104 games, the
best 104-game records of the century. They are 50 games over .500
for the first time since the end of the 1961 season. If the Yankees
win just half of their remaining 58 games, they will finish the
year with 106 victories, the most since 1961. The Yankees' magic
number for clinching a playoff spot is 36.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu, a central figure in the Yankees' weeklong trade talks for
Johnson, walked into the clubhouse restroom just about the same
time Joe Torre did. Torre asked Irabu if he was happy to still be a
Yankee. Irabu nodded and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   The trade deadline passed at midnight Friday, Eastern time, and
with it went a certain amount of uncertainty for players such as
Irabu. He will be with the Yankees in the playoffs this fall, and
in all likelihood, so will Bush, the backup infielder and
pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez almost surely will move to the bullpen for the
playoffs, if Jeff Nelson's back doesn't heal.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, this is the unit with which the Yankees
must win the World Series. There is a remote possibility they could
sneak through a trade, but it's highly unlikely any deal would
involve players of consequence, who would have to clear waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees must rely on their farm system to fill needs, and it
just so happened that 12 hours after the Yankees chose not to pay a
high price for one of the few good pitchers available, a Yankees
reliever went on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Holmes underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan
Saturday morning, and according to Torre, Holmes' diagnosis was
similar to that given to Nelson: a bulging disc that will require
complete rest. Now there is doubt about whether Holmes will pitch
again this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' bullpen has performed terrifically of late,
allowing just one run in the last 34 innings going into Saturday's
game. But without Nelson and Holmes, the sinkerball pitcher Mike
Buddie must adapt to a more meaningful role, and Joe Borowski _ the
reliever expected to be called up from Class AAA to replace Holmes
_ will pitch in long relief. The Yankees' depth is in jeopardy of
wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees are so far ahead _ 15 games in front of Boston
in the American League East _ that such problems really won't
manifest themselves until the post-season. It doesn't hurt, either,
that the Yankees' starting pitching has dominated.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte threw seven shutout innings Thursday, Irabu
pitched seven strong innings Friday to become the fourth Yankees
pitcher with 10 or more victories. Saturday, Wells kept his chances
of winning 20 games alive with a solid effort against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Wells started slowly, giving up a lead-off single to Joey Cora
in the bottom of the first inning. He then tried to fire a high
fastball past Alex Rodriguez, and the Seattle shortstop whalloped a
two-run homer. Wells just turned and looked away, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when Wells starts slowly, his interest begins to wane
and his performance disintegrates.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Mariners Saturday, he bore down, shutting out
Seattle for six innings and giving the Yankees' offense time to
score against the left-hander Jamie Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez walked and Tim Raines singled to lead off the
second for the Yankees, and Jorge Posada grounded a single through
the left side of the infield, scoring Martinez and cutting the
Seattle lead to 2-1. When Chad Curtis drove a fly deep to right,
Posada ran to second with his head down, glanced at the right
fielder Jay Buhner and determined the ball was going to fall in.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, however, caught the ball easily, and Posada, after
nearly passing Raines on the base path halfway to third base, was
doubled off first base easily; a disgusted Torre slumped in the
Yankees' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hit a solo home run into the Kingdome's third deck in
the fourth inning, tying the score at 2-2. Jeter broke the tie
leading off the fifth inning with his third home run in five days,
and his 14th of the year. The Yankees scored two runs in the eighth
inning.

 &HT;    Braves stymie McGwire
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Everyone knows the Braves have the best rotation in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It's been the case for years so sometimes it isn't fully
appreciated. Take, for instance, the last 48 hours at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time that Mark McGwire went two straight games
without getting the ball out of the infield?
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Greg Maddux did the job and in Saturday's 3-1
come-from-behind win over the Cardinals it was Tom Glavine and
reliever Rudy Seanez that tamed Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine didn't get a win, leaving after seven innings as the
Braves offense didn't wake up until the eighth when they scored
three runs. But Glavine faced McGwire three times, striking him out
once and getting him to foul out in the infield twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the one to give up the home runs to him
though there are 50,000 in this park that want to see him hit a
homer,'' Glavine said. ``I look at it as a challenge not to let it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire brought his show to Atlanta having hit a home run every
7.3 at-bats, his homer total at 45. He has walked up to the plate
eight times now here, striking out four times, getting
intentionally walked once and the three balls he hit never made it
into the outfield. He still has yet to hit a homer at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom was just up there not trying to making a mistake,''
catcher Javier Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. Glavine's strategy was to make McGwire conscious of
the fact that he would throw inside, something most other pitchers
will not dare try. That way McGwire couldn't narrow down the
outside part of the plate. On the first at-bat, Glavine got McGwire
on a pitch inside. The next time it was a fastball away. Then he
came back with a slider inside. In the eighth, McGwire struck out
on a Seanez forkball that broke away from him.
</P>
<P>
   Said manager Bobby Cox about pitching to McGwire, ``You just
knock on wood and cross your fingers that he misses one once in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Braves won Saturday despite the fact that they
didn't hit a ball hard all day, going quitely to starter Ken
Bottenfield. But Bottenfield was gone after seven, the Braves
taking advantage of a bad Cardinals bullpen as Lopez drilled a
one-out hit and Keith Lockhart pushed a two-out hit up the middle
to score two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't hit the ball good all day,'' Cox said. ``Keith
didn't hit that one good but it got through.''

 &HT;    Braves: No more on Wohlers
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For now Mark Wohlers will remain with the major
league club.
</P>
<P>
   Despite walking 14 hitters in 3 2/3 innings, he refuses to go to
the minors and it has left management shaking their heads. It has
also left them not talking about the situation anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was disappointed that Wohlers wouldn't take the
club's advice and return to the minors, general manager John
Schuerholz said, ``I'm not going to comment on it publicly. It
serves us no purpose. Hopefully, it will turn out good. But it
doesn't do us any good talking about it anymore. It is what it
is.'' Privately, though, the Braves feel Wohlers should do what is
good for the team and head to the minors. So do some of his
teammates. But the Braves' hands remain tied because Wohlers can
refuse any minor-league assignment. He could go on the disabled
list, which is where he may land if he continues to pitch poorly.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Mac
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire will not take batting practice today as the
Cardinals don't plan on doing any pregame work. Still, the Turner
Field gates will open early at 10:30 a.m. ... Everyone knows that
if a fan catches a McGwire homer _ or anyone else's for that matter
_ at Coca-Cola Skyfield, it's worth $1 million. But what if McGwire
would've hit a homer there during batting practice? Company
marketing guru Steve Koonin said it would have been worth $10,000.
``We will just take $10,000 right out of the cooler and give it to
them,'' Koonin said before Saturday's game. Speaking of the
see-through cooler with a million bucks in it, it is returned to
the Wells Fargo vault each night and will go back into the
companies' bank account after today's game. It has been heavily
guarded and said Koonin, ``We're even watching the undercover guys
who are watching the guards standing by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers game
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux's loss to the Cards Friday night was his first to
them in his last eight games against them, a streak dating back to
1994.

 &HT;    On deck: St. Louis Cardinals
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS; WSB 750-AM
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Kevin Millwood (11-6, 4.39, 0-0,
5.06 ERA lifetime against St. Louis) vs. RHP Bobby Witt (1-2, 3.91;
0-1, 3.18 lifetime against Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Millwood is coming off one of his worst starts of the
season, going three innings and allowing five runs (four earned) in
a loss to the Reds, his ERA shooting up to 4.39. He faced the
Cardinals back on May 14 in St. Louis, going 5 1/3 innings and
allowing three runs. Millwood has lost four of his last six
decisions. The Cardinals, who have had to move around their
rotation with the trade of Todd Stottlemyre, will go with the
veteran Witt, acquired from Texas on June 22. Witt is working both
in the rotation and out of the bullpen and this will be his third
start for the Cardinals. He has spent most of his career in the
American League, but did pitch for the Marlins in 1995 and was 0-1
against the Braves with a 3.18 ERA in two starts.

 &HT;    Mark McGwire: Bat Man
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Hours before Saturday's game against the Braves, Mark
McGwire walked up to teammate Brian Jordan in the visitor's
clubhouse, stuck out his hand, said ``welcome back,'' and started
humming the theme from ``Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Who says all this home-run-record hype has the redheaded giant
known as Big Mac tied in knots?
</P>
<P>
   Out from under the microscope, this Bunyan with a bat is just a
big ol' good-natured teammate. And this was kind of an in-joke.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, the former Atlanta Falcons defensive back who now plays
right field for the Cardinals, has been the subject of trade rumors
for a couple of weeks. McGwire, who in prior years has been in that
position himself, wouldn't let Jordan forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He teased me all week long,'' Jordan said. ``He was humming
the Jeopardy song all day yesterday. We had fun with it, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of kidding Jordan has come to expect from Big Mac,
who apparently is a rare commodity in the self-centered world of
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   This superstar's as nice as he is gifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the guy, he's great,'' Jordan said. ``He has a great
personality. He's fun to play with. Before he came to the ballclub,
I thought a guy like that would probably be conceited, arrogant.
But when I finally got to meet him, as a teammate the guy's been
great. Down to earth. Fun to be with.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's glimpse of McGwire is that of a dedicated hitter
who sends baseballs into orbit with his short, explosive batting
stroke that has him running way ahead of Roger Maris' pace in 1961,
the year he hit a record 61 homers. They've heard of the media
crush that follows McGwire's every move and the mass interviews
he's granted the last six weeks, as the home runs and the interest
have mounted.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McGwire has been sort of puzzled by all the
attention. It's not as if he's suddenly emerged from a cave with a
home run swing. He hit 58 homers last season, and a record 49 as a
rookie _ and that was 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that amazes me is I've been doing it for so long,
and all of a sudden it's a big story,'' McGwire said Saturday. ``It
made me think: `What happened to the previous 11 years?'''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the 35-year-old McGwire is not one to bask in individual
accomplishments. In fact, he's the quintessential team player,
which makes him almost abnormal in this me-me-me era of
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire would much rather discuss his team than his own
flirtation with immortality, but there aren't a whole lot of
journalists out there (or fans outside of St. Louis) who are
clamoring for information about the Cardinals, who are seven games
below .500 and out of the National League playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
   But Big Mac's home-run pace _ he was blasting one every
7-point-something times at bat before this series with the Braves,
which continues today _ has captured the nation's imagination.
Cardinals batting practice has become as big a show as the game
itself. Reporters have even started keeping stats on McGwire's
practice swings. (For the record, he took 16 swings Saturday, and
12 landed in the deep seats; Friday night he homered on 12 of 19
mighty swings). Even opposing players stay out to watch the
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night was an absolute happening, with camera bulbs
flashing at every pitch delivered to McGwire. The Braves were booed
when they walked him intentionally his first time up. Saturday,
50,137 people cheered as McGwire went a mortal 0-for-4, striking
out twice.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of fans headed for the exits following McGwire's
eighth-innining strikeout, sure he wouldn't get another swing this
day. Never mind that the game was a nail-biter. It took Allen
McGlynn, an attorney from Lawrenceville who is orginally from St.
Louis, two days and eight hours of waiting to land McGwire's
autograph, which is worth serious money, and will be worth a lot
more if Big Mac ever hits 62 homers in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is I'm a kid in a 32-year-old man's body,''
McGlynn said. ``So when he looks at me he may be thinking I'm in it
for the money. I'm not. I've always admired the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He failed Friday in his first autograph-scoring attempt. ``But
he talked to me,'' McGlynn said, ``and that will stay with me
forever. Anybody can hold up a ball and say I caught this ball from
Mark McGwire and you don't know if they're telling the truth or
not. But I spoke to him. It's not like he's some superhuman, I just
think he's a class act.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gibson, 17, of Columbia, S.C., can hold up a ball and
say it was from McGwire, and prove it. Friday, Michael, his
brother, David, 22, and their dad were just finishing dinner in the
outside dining area of the 755 Club at Turner Field _ way out there
in deep left-centerfield _ when McGwire launched one of his
practice rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother said, `Here it comes, look out!''' Michael said.
``As it was coming this way, I'm thinking, `Oh my gosh, how did he
hit it this far?' It bounced on the rail and I just reached down
and picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gibsons traveled to Cleveland last year because Michael is a
big McGwire fan. And what do you know, the Gibsons and McGwire end
up eating in the same restaurant. Michael had the nerve to go up
and ask for an autograph, and McGwire gave it graciously.
</P>
<P>
   Michael might not be as lucky this season, because McGwire has
become more protective of his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't go to the mall anymore,'' said Cardinals catcher Tom
Lampkin, one of McGwire's best friends on the team. ``He gets
mobbed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin said he's proud to be part of history, even just
potentially.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're however many games back, but we're filling stadiums,''
Lampkin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gonna probably have to deal with it a little bit more if
he ends up with 50-55 around September. You can't function day to
day with all the press he's getting unless you find a way to go
out, limit (the press conferences) to one day per series. `Here's
my one day to answer the questions, and then I'm going to play.'''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has shown his teammates he's a normal, fun-loving guy
who just happens to hit home runs _ and makes $8.3 million a year
to do it. He likes comedy clubs and laughs so loud he carries a
towel with him to hide his high-pitched cackle. He donates a huge
chunk of his income to his own charitable foundation to fight child
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work to be done,'' McGwire said. ``We're
doing research on maybe doing a documentary on sexual abuse.
Nothing's ever been done and there's a good reason why. People
don't want to fess up to it, they want to run away from it. People
don't want to admit it but the sad thing is it happens in every
walk of life. Hopefully, we'll do something about it in the future.
People will be educated, but it goes on every day.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which goes to explain why very few people, inside the
game or out of it, are rooting against Big Mac.

 &HT;    HR chase creates own sideshow
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Great Traveling Freak Show has hit town, and I
never saw so many goose bumps raised around here for any kind of
game, short of the Olympics. It's the first time ever I heard
play-by-play of batting practice. No, I'm not calling Mark McGwire
a freak, just the atmosphere he creates. It's pure carnival,
including the poor saps gathered a cab ride away on the left-field
roof expecting to field a home run. The odds are better in the
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impossible,'' says McGwire, and I consider him an authority.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is indeed a big, strong man. A red-bearded Bluto (Popeye
fans, attention!) ``Not only stronger but better,'' says his
manager, Tony La Russa, who had 35 hits as a major league player,
none a home run. Mark is not even the biggest McGwire. His brother,
a quarterback for two NFL teams, is 6-8. If size determined how
many home runs a guy hit, Frank Howard would have led the world.
Babe Ruth was fairly large for his time, but Henry Aaron was a
44-regular.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa also had McGwire for eight seasons in Oakland, so they
were separated only a couple of seasons before the Cardinals traded
for him _ surrendering three whatever-became-ofs, T.J. Mathews,
Eric Ludwick and Blake Stein. He has hit 50 home runs before in A's
clothes, so this is nothing new to him. What is new is that this
has become the Year of the Home Run Deluge.
</P>
<P>
   I refer here to headlines, not necessarily numbers. There is
congestion around the top. In the past, when Ruth's or Roger Maris'
season record was the target, it was usually a one-man show. When
Jimmie Foxx and Hank Greenberg made their run at Ruth's 60, nobody
else was close. When Maris hit 61, Mickey Mantle was seven home
runs back. This time there is a mass charge with Sammy Sosa, Junior
Griffey and Greg Vaughn all making noises. By the end of the
season, there may be as many as 20 players with 30 home runs, maybe
a dozen with 40, as many as four with 50.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire? Well, it is later than you think. When St. Louis leaves
town, he'll have just 51 games in which to hit whatever he needs to
tie Maris. Maris hit his 61st in his 163rd game. Ruth hit his 60th
in his 154th game, and he might have made it 65 with Maris'
schedule. It's a new brand of baseball, and not necessarily a
better one, unless you like pitcher-slaughter. There has to be
reasons for this offensive deluge, and you have the privilege of
choosing between (1) diluted pitching, (2) juiced-up ball and/or
(3) El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question major league pitching is pretty awful. The
earned-run average in both leagues is hideous, 4.62 in the
American, 4.20 in the National, about the same as last year in
both. Worst of all must have been the National League in 1930,
4.97, when the league as a whole hit .303. But even in times such
as these, a batter can be pitched to, any batter. Everybody talks
about pitching to McGwire and nearly everybody you talk to has a
different spin.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Leo Mazzone, the Braves doctor of hurling. ``Throw your
best pitch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what if that's the pitch he likes to hit?'' I said.
``Satchel Paige said the best pitch in baseball was a hard fastball
at the belt buckle. I like jamming him, right on the fists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree,'' said Mazzone. ``You can't get him with one
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if there's a particular pitcher who has McGwire's
number. Players don't see that much of each other with this
gerrymandered scheduling and interleague games. A little nub of a
left-hander drove Ruth crazy. Hub Pruett won only 29 games in the
major leagues, but Ruth couldn't hit him with a paddle, and that
was enough to keep Pruett's career going.
</P>
<P>
   With all the longball mania, there probably won't be as many
home runs hit this season as last. American League sluggers hit
2,477 and National Leaguers hit 2,163. Going into the weekend,
Americans had hit l,636, Nationals in the lead, strangely, at
1,651. Record for the American is 2,742 and in the National 2,220,
both in 1996. This season doesn't look as if the new franchises in
Arizona and Tampa Bay will make a great lot of difference.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of old figures here just to jostle your curiosity. The
year Ruth hit 60 home runs, high in the National League was 30, by
Hack Wilson and Cy Williams. When Greenberg and Foxx made their run
in 1938, Mel Ott led the National League with 36. Yet, the all-time
home run king is of the National League, Aaron's 755. You hear
nobody talk about McGwire threatening that one, for to do so, he'd
have to average about 50 home runs the next seven seasons. That's
as tall an order as reaching the Coca-Cola target in left field.

 &HT;    Falcons acquit themselves well against Jags
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ The Atlanta Falcons came down here Friday
night hoping to accomplish several things. Chiefly, they wanted to
allay the boredom that comes with practicing against each other 13
times in eight days and see if all the technique coaches have been
teaching has taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   They accomplished what they set out to and then some Saturday,
despite a boatload of rain in the morning and a couple of injuries
that complicated matters in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The primary bonus to come out of two two-hour practices at the
Jacksonville Jaguars' facility at Alltel Stadium was mental. True,
the Falcons finished the season on a 6-2 run last year, but the
Jags have made back-to-back appearances in the playoffs, and they
were 11-5 last year.
</P>
<P>
   So here were the Falcons taking a shot of sorts at one of the
NFL's big dogs. No, there was no tackling, but there was plenty of
hitting. And if it's possible to evaluate such things, the Falcons
did well, especially in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 fans braved the rain to cheer at the drop of a
football, but Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin was not among the
pleased. He blistered his players when they came out of the morning
quagmire, telling them they lacked intensity and were wasting their
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, meanwhile, thought the opposite of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for our guys, even guys who are new to the team,
to see that we can compete with other teams this good,'' said
Falcons coach Dan Reeves. ``The intensity level was good, and it
helped to see a bunch of schemes that you haven't been seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Terance Mathis said, ``Today was very, very, very good
for the receivers. We got a chance to show what we have learned in
the last week of training camp. It was very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   On the down side, the Falcons ended up perilously thin at
cornerback. Starter Ronnie Bradford missed his eighth straight
practice with a bum hamstring, and reserve Randy Fuller (ankle) his
ninth. They were back in Atlanta about the time rookie Elijah
Williams rolled an ankle in the morning muck, leaving four corners.
And that was Williams' good ankle.
</P>
<P>
   That meant undrafted rookie free-agent safety Brad Trout of
Valdosta State had to take some reps at corner. With the Falcons'
preseason opener scheduled for Friday at the Georgia Dome against
Tennessee, somebody needs to get well quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thin right now at corner,'' Reeves said. ``That's a
concern. We had some other guys get hurt, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had about eight players get hurt overall, but the
only player other than Williams to miss the afternoon practice was
receiver Mercury Hayes, who strained a hamstring.

 &HT;    Salaam grows into role
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Atlanta Falcons have told Ephraim Salaam he needs
to eat more, and they're throwing all the grub he can handle at him
during training camp. But when camp ends, the rookie will have to
feed himself. That could be trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7, 295-pound right tackle was drafted as late as the
middle of the seventh _ and final _ round of the NFL draft for a
reason: he had a reputation for indifference and inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dispute it because I know I was lazy. In college, I
just used athletic ability and didn't lift weights or anything,''
he said. ``I just went about it like, `Whatever!' Now, it's a job.
I got to eat. If I don't try to get better every day, they'll cut
me. I'll be at home, working at a gas station.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaam has come a long way in a short time. He's backing up
Corey Louchiey, whom the Falcons signed as a free agent after four
nondescript years in Buffalo. It's possible Salaam could play early
if he keeps progressing and gains weight. He weighed 290 when he
was drafted, and has been as high as 300. The Falcons would like
him at 310.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to get stronger; he needs more muscle mass,'' said
offensive line coach Art Shell. ``But he works hard. Compared to
what I heard about him, it's like night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Salaam has an excuse. He was so good in school he skipped
two grades and enrolled at San Diego State at 16. He also was
gifted athletically, good enough that he played college basketball,
too. But while his body was mature, his mind wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   That eventually drove crazy one of his best friends, New Orleans
rookie tackle Kyle Turley. The two were almost inseparable at SDSU,
right up until before the draft, when both players were No. 7s.
Turley, though, was the seventh player and first tackle taken in
the entire draft. He got a multimillion-dollar signing bonus and
will earn about $1 million more in salary.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam almost didn't get drafted. He ended up the 18th tackle
drafted, the 199th pick overall, and got a $26,000 signing bonus as
a seventh-rounder. He'll make $145,000 _ $1,000 more than the NFL
minimum. He'll make just a little more in a season than Turley will
in one paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like brothers from different mothers,'' Salaam said of
Turley. ``But he got angry, and wouldn't talk to me until after the
draft because he could see what I was doing. He saw me being lazy,
and not working like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaam is working, he and Turley are speaking, and Shell is
dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has great athletic ability, long arms, good feet, desire to
learn, and he's smart,'' Shell said. ``I asked if he knew why he
lasted so long. He told me, and I said, `If we push the right
buttons, maybe you can be something.' He said, `Coach, you already
pushed the right button; you drafted me.' ''

 &HT;    Number of injuries slowly piling up
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- With the Falcons' first preseason game five days
away, the injury situation is on the verge of becoming problematic.
There appeared to be no serious injuries in two Saturday practices
against the Jaguars, but a few will merit further attention and
might cause players to miss practices this week.
</P>
<P>
   There was no tackling all day, and half of each practice was
merely group drill work. But rookie cornerback Elijah Williams
rolled an ankle in the morning one-on-one drills and did not
practice in the afternoon, and receiver Mercury Hayes strained a
hamstring and was out in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   That pushed to 31 the number of practice sessions missed by
injured players, led by reserve cornerback Randy Fuller, who has
missed nine straight with a bad ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller stayed in Atlanta Saturday, as did starting right
cornerback Ronnie Bradford (hamstring), defensive end Barry
Mitchell (quad), and receiver Keith Crawford (hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   With Bradford out, second-year cornerback Michael Booker has
been working at his corner spot, opposite Ray Buchanan. Crawford's
absence meant Todd Kinchen was working at number three receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes' absence meant the second group of receivers usually was
rookie Jammi German, Kevin Thornal, who was on the practice squad
last year, and rookie Tim Dwight. Free agent signee Van Johnson,
and undrafted rookies Octavus Barnes and Corey Allen usually
rounded out the third group.
</P>
<P>
   Other injuries: LB David Brandon (foot), DE John Burrough
(groin), DE Chuck Smith (groin), RT Corey Louchiey (groin), LB
Ruffin Hamilton (hamstring), German (hand/groin).
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Ron Medlin will re-evaluate injured players this morning
at 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will be off today, other than evening meetings, and
will practice twice Monday in Suwanee, at 9 a.m., and 3 p.m. The
team also will practice twice Tuesday in prepartion for the
preseason opener Friday in the Georgia Dome at 7:30 p.m. against
the Tennessee Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Turning up the heat
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves got upset a few times Saturday, nearly
coming out of his shirt when reserve running back Harold Green lost
fumbles on consecutive plays in 9-on-9 drills in the afternoon.
Also, on the very first snap of these drills, starting left guard
Calvin Collins jumped offsides, causing Reeves to bark, ``Come on
Calvin! Listen to the snap count!''
</P>
<P>
   QB watch
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at what's going on with the quarterbacks:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler _ Threw all the passes with the No. 1 unit, and
threw well. Hit two of four in the hurry-up drill at the end of
afternoon practice, with one incompletion that was knocked out of
the hands of Tony Martin in the end zone. He also was intercepted
by Jacksonville safety Chris Hudson as he attempted a long pass
down the left sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graziani _ Made all the throws with the No. 2 unit, and
threw fairly well throughout, making better decisions about whom he
should throw to. Hit one of three in the hurry-up drill, a
30-yarder to running back Gary Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg _ Threw all the passes with the No. 3 offense.
Threw OK.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brennan _ Used only in drills.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad and ugly
</P>
<P>
   Good: Third-string left guard Jeremy Akers, a member of last
year's practice squad after playing at Notre Dame, looked good in
several one-on-one drills, particularly against Jacksonville
starting tackle John Jurkovic.
</P>
<P>
   Bad: Reserve running back Green lost fumbles on consecutive
carries in the afternoon while running in 9-on-9 drills. Reeves was
20 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Ugly: Thornal got in what was believed to be the only fight of
the day, and even it wasn't much. Jacksonville cornerback Kevin
Devine grabbed his face mask at the end of a play, and Thornal
returned the favor. The fight was broken up, though, before it
really became a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Zebras on the loose
</P>
<P>
   Training camp is not just for players and coaches to work out
the kinks. Officials have to get their timing back, too, and a crew
was working various parts of Saturday's scrimmage. No man stuck out
more than referee Jerry Markbreit, a veteran of four Super Bowls
who will begin his 23rd season in the NFL. ``Training camp is
terrific for officials,'' said Markbreit, who flew in from his home
in Skokie, Ill., for four days of camp in Jacksonville. ``It gives
us the only real look we get at game situations before the season
starts. Before the preseason, there's no simulating football. You
can look at all the film in the world, but it's not the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin said, ``They have explained the
rules changes, and in practices they show our players how they are
going to make the calls. For example, we've always had the
five-yard contact rule between the receiver and the defensive back
and it's never been enforced. But now, it's going to be enforced
and we need to know exactly what the enforcement is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Falcons cornerback Juran Bolden, in fact, got a warning on this
from one official in the morning practice after he rode Keenan
McCardell a little too far downfield.
</P>
<P>
   What he said
</P>
<P>
   ``Look where I am, and look where you are.'' _ Rookie cornerback
Elijah Williams, upon being heckled through the fence by a
Jacksonville fan.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get out of here
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous players in Jaguars history returned to
Jacksonville as Falcons kicker Morten Andersen revisited the scene
of one of the most ignoble moments of his career. In the last game
of 1996, Atlanta trailed the Jags 19-17 when Andersen had a
30-yarder to win it with three seconds left. He missed, pushing
Jacksonville to 9-7 and giving the team a playoff berth in the
second season in franchise history. For all the heroics in his
16-year career, including 25 game-winning field goals and an NFL
record 33 field goals of 50 or more yards, Andersen never forgets
the kick that left that Falcons team at 3-13. It was coach June
Jones' last game.
</P>
<P>
   Musical chairs
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defensive tackle Henry Slay alternated between tackle and
defensive end with the third team, a necessity since Mitchell's
injury left only five healthy ends. The undersized Slay (6-1, 290)
made a few plays, though, one time blowing past Jaguars rookie
tackle Pierre Brillant (6-7, 320) to stop backup quarterback
Jonathan Quinn. ... Rookie backup right tackle Ephraim Salaam got
some snaps in the afternoon at left tackle, where he says he's more
comfortable. Third-string right tackle Jose Portilla, another
rookie, got some snaps at left guard. ... Salaam, who is 6-7, also
logged some time on the field goal block unit. ... Louchiey
struggled from time to time at right tackle.

FIRST AMERICAN IN SPACE REMEMBERED AS A GENUINE HERO

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Family and friends of the late Alan B. Shepard Jr.,
recalled America's first space traveler as a man of courage who was
eager to risk his life for a cause he believed in as they gathered
on Saturday for a memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, one of NASA's original Mercury astronauts and the fifth
of 12 men to walk on the moon, died July 21 in a Monterey, Calif.,
hospital after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's gathering at NASA's Johnson Space Center was the
first in which friends, colleagues as well as the public could
gather to mourn the loss. Among the nearly 900 who attended were
the astronaut's widow, Louise; and the couple's three daughters,
Julie, Laura and Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Like Shepard's trailblazing 15-minute ride into space on May 5,
1961, the service was brief, emotional and uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Shepard was many things _ a patriot, a leader. He was a
fierce competitor. He was a hero, and most important to us he was a
close friend,'' said U. S. Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. Among the four
surviving Mercury astronauts who attended the gathering, Glenn
followed his colleague into space the following year as the first
American in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott, Gordo, Wally and I have lost more than a friend,'' said
Glenn, who is training for a return to orbit in late October aboard
the space shuttle Discovery at the age of 77. ``We have lost
another brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper and Wally Schirra each in their
turn recalled the moment in 1959 when they were designated
America's first astronauts. They formed the strongest of bonds as
they teamed up to confront the risks of spaceflight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brotherhood we have will endure forever,'' said Schirra,
who became emotional as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Each praised their late colleague for helping to lift America
from a low point in the country's long Cold War with the former
Soviet Union. Had not the Redstone missile that lofted him on his
suborbital hop not required last minute modifications, Shepard
might have been the first in space.
</P>
<P>
   As it was the distinction went to Yuri Gagarin, a young Soviet
cosmonaut who successfully circled the Earth on April 12, 1961,
after a clandestine launch.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Shepard's achievement was enough to demonstrate
openly that a human could survive spacefight. Within three weeks,
then-President John F. Kennedy committed the United States to
sending the first explorers to the moon, a risky venture that
demonstrated American technical prowess to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Grounded by an inner-ear ailment, Shepard took on a desk job as
NASA's chief astronaut until he could obtain a surgical cure.
</P>
<P>
   When he soared again, it was as commander of Apollo 14. Shepard
became the fifth human to walk on the moon. He was the second of
his three-man crew to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever it is that astronauts and explorers go when we depart
this realm, one day we will all be together again,'' said Edgar
Mitchell, the Apollo 14 crew's lone survivor. Stuart Roosa died
Dec. 12, 1994, of pancreatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's resolve has made him NASA's mind, body and soul, NASA
administrator Dan Goldin told those gathered for Saturday's
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Mercury 7 was named not too many people really knew
about our space program in America or the world,'' Goldin recalled.
``NASA was around but we were really a bunch of nerdy engineers and
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Alan Shepard and the other Mercury astronauts came along,
they were intense, determined and willing to risk their lives to
open the space frontier,'' said Goldin. ``They gave America's space
program a real face. They gave our nation what all nations, what
all people need _ heroes. Genuine heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's service concluded with a tree-planting ceremony in a
memorial grove at Johnson as well as a fly over by NASA jets in the
missing-man formation.
</P>
<P>
   A live oak for Shepard joins those planted previously for 27
other astronauts, including the late Mercury astronauts Gus Grisson
and Deke Slayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He represented the best this country has to offer,'' said
George Abbey, Johnson's director who presided over the planting
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Shepard has been and always will be a part of each step
we take in space,'' said Abbey.

Cowboys' make over underway
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
When the Cowboys' offense made its debut during Friday night's
preseason game against Seattle at Texas Stadium, Troy Aikman handed
off to Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   On the second play, it was Aikman to Smith again.
</P>
<P>
   On third down, it was yet another combination by the veteran
duo.
</P>
<P>
   But while the results might have been familiar _ three rushing
plays for an eventual first down _ the looks were increasingly
unfamiliar. Nearly every time the Cowboys lined up during their
first possession in a 20-19 loss to the Seahawks, they were in a
new formation, signaling a clear departure from the predictable
offense that had become synonymous with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used about half of our playbook,'' said new coach Chan
Gailey, who arrived in Dallas with a playbook the size of the
Metroplex phone book.
</P>
<P>
   It took only until their second possession before the Cowboys
found their way into the end zone, which they didn't see much last
year. The key plays were anything but vintage Cowboys. Aikman
connected with tight end David LaFleur for 26 yards on a
second-down pass. He found Michael Irvin for eight yards on a
third-down attempt out of the shotgun. Chris Warren took it the
rest of the way on two runs of four yards and a touchdown run of 15
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with the way our first-team offense moved the
ball,'' Gailey said. ``We had some administrative and
organizational breakdowns, and we weren't crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 2 receiver spot is just as up for grabs as before the
first exhibition game. Jeff Ogden caught four balls for 60 yards.
The rookie out of Eastern Washington is trying to make the team as
a free agent. Billy Davis, one of the favorites for that spot,
caught two balls for nine yards. Ernie Mills, who got the start,
didn't catch a pass. Macey Brooks, a preseason standout last year
before a season-ending injury, didn't play after having surgery on
his groin area Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, whom the Cowboys hope to free from double coverage with
their new offensive schemes, was constantly moved in the different
formations, lining up on both sides of the center and even playing
the slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a freshman in college,'' Irvin said. ``I was at
home looking at the playbook and trying to make sure I knew where I
was going on every play.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the offense got the most attention, the Cowboys'
defense also showed signs of improvement even though there were no
interceptions and only one sack (rookie K.D. Williams), the two
areas in which the Cowboys were most lacking last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the first-team defense was able to limit Seahawks running
back Ricky Watters to only 19 yards on seven carries for an average
gain of only 2.7 yards per attempt. The first-team defense also
limited Seattle to only two first downs and 35 yards total offense
until a Dallas fumble turned the ball over at the Cowboys' 11 late
in the quarter. The Seahawks then were able to score as rookie
running back Ahman Green eluded cornerback Kevin Mathis to take it
the entire 11 yards. Mathis started in place of Deion Sanders, who
was kept out as a precautionary measure because of an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a unit, I think we were all swarming pretty well,'' Cowboys
linebacker Dexter Coakley said. ``We had a lot of hats on the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the game got sloppier once the starters went to the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw some really nice things by the first-team offense and
defense,'' Gailey said. ``We picked up the speed of the game well
on both sides of the ball. I was disappointed we didn't win. We got
a lot of nice things to teach from on film.''
</P>
<P>
   One disappointment for the Cowboys had to be penalties. Dallas
was penalized 11 times for 97 yards. On three occasions, the
Cowboys had too many men on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will have two opportunities this week to test their
new looks against an opponent. They scrimmage the Oakland Raiders
on Thursday at El Paso and then host the Raiders in an exhibition
game Saturday night at Texas Stadium.

GORDON, THE TOP GUN, WINS RACE OF THE BONUS MARCHERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ After winning the Brickyard 400, Jeff Gordon's
stock car was followed around the track by an armored truck,
symbolizing the $1 million bonus he was about to receive from
Winston. It was the only vehicle Gordon did not run away from
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, his sixth this season, was worth an estimated
$1,637,625, the biggest payout for a single race in American motor
sports history. It also propelled him past Bill Elliott and into
second place on Nascar's career earnings list. Gordon's total
swelled to $20,297,547, behind Dale Earnhardt's $32,401,950.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win this race twice, and the million dollars, and to do it
with Mark Martin on my tail was just amazing,'' said Gordon, who
won for the second time this week. ``I don't know if I can take it
all in right now. This just blows me away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who became the first two-time winner of the
five-year-old race, crossed the finish line at an excruciatingly
slow 65 miles an hour, concluding Nascar's second-biggest race of
the year in a most anticlimactic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It ended under caution because of a multicar crash on the
second-to-last lap, which guaranteed Gordon, who won the inaugural
Brickyard 400 in 1994, the checkered flag. The caution, the ninth
of the day and a record for the race, robbed Mark Martin of any
chance at victory. Martin was relegated to a second-place finish
after closing in on Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we brought some serious horsepower this week,'' said
Gordon, who is from nearby Pittsboro, Ind. ``It was the most we've
ever had. But having Mark behind me, I knew he was going to be real
tough in the corners, and he was. But on the restarts, our car was
really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin made several runs at Gordon, but every time he got near,
the leader pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might catch him,'' Martin said. ``I was gaining. I
just did not have enough car. We threw everything at him that we
had, and it wasn't enough. He had the lead of the race, and he had
the fastest car. It's hard to beat a man when he's got that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's winnings Saturday were bolstered by the $1 million
bonus he received from Winston, the circuit's main sponsor. He
became the first driver to win the award, given to a driver who
wins one of five select races _ Daytona 500, Southern 500, Winston
500, Coca-Cola 600 and Brickyard 400 _ after finishing in the top
five in the previous race in the group. Gordon won the Coca-Cola
600 and therefore was eligible to win Saturday's bonus. And just so
he would not forget about the prospect of winning it, there was a
silver dollar sign glued to his passenger-side window.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's victory, which came just six days after he won the
Pennsylvania 500, extended Gordon's lead in the series to 72 points
over Martin, who is second. Dale Jarrett is a distant third, 193
points behind Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett might have had the fastest car Saturday, but a mistake
by his pit crew cost him any chance at winning. Apparently, Jarrett
was trying to earn Gatorade's $10,000 bonus for leading the race at
its midway point when his Taurus ran out of gas. In the time it
took for Jarrett's car to coast into pit lane, he lost four laps to
Gordon and Martin. Making the miscalculation even more costly:
Jarrett was also eligible for the million-dollar bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive the race car,'' said Jarrett, who finished 16th. ``I
come in when they tell me to come in. That's all I do. We had a
super race car.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yates, the owner of Jarrett's car, said: ``Nothing has to
be said on Monday morning. The guys that worked on that car are
smart enough to get a car that good, they are certainly smart
enough to figure out not to let that happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a tough day for the hometown favorite, Kenny Irwin,
who finished 38th out of 43 cars after qualifying fourth fastest
last Thursday. Irwin, a rookie, had been coming to the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway since he was 6 and was racing at the hallowed track
for the first time. On Lap 117, he got bumped by Earnhardt's black
Monte Carlo. Irwin lost control of the Texaco Taurus and hit the
wall hard, ending his day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a top-five car,'' Irwin said. ``I just wish we could
have done better for my team.''
</P>
<P>
   After the huge amount of money he won Saturday, the most
memorable moment for Gordon came when he stood atop his car in
victory lane. Instead of giving him the common mixture of cheers
and boos that he gets at most tracks, the crowd of more than
300,000 applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to come here and have that many people pulling
for you,'' Gordon said. ``To have that feeling is great. It's
important to get cheers even though you try not to think about it.
It makes winning here even better.''

   East
</P>
<P>
   Umpires never change their minds, but official scorers do. In a
recent game in Oakland between the A's and Red Sox, Boston's Darren
Lewis hit a three-run inside-the-park homer that initially was
scored a four-base error, meaning no home run and no RBIs for
Lewis. But the scorer went into the A's clubhouse after the game
and spoke with right fielder Ben Grieve, who said there was no way
he could have caught the ball. So the call was changed.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Baltimore's catching tandem of Chris Hoiles and Lenny
Webster is hot. Hoiles is hitting .385 with six homers and 19 RBIs
in his last 21 games; Webster is hitting .352 with four homers and
12 RBIs in his last 10 games. ... Yankees starter David Wells is
8-0 in New York (7-0 at Yankee Stadium, 1-0 at Shea). ... The
Orioles have won of 17 of 21 since the All-Star break. ... The Red
Sox dropped Nomar Garciaparra in the cleanup spot Wednesday, and he
responded with three hits, three runs, two RBIs and a homer. ...
Tampa Bay's Fred McGriff moved into 50th place on the all-time
home-run list with 349. ``There are a lot of guys who have played
the game who aren't in the top 50, so that means something to me,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' David Justice, the subject of trade talk, is used
to such rumors. His biggest concern has been his left knee, which
still bothers him occasionally. ``After the surgery,'' he said,
``they told me I'd have good days and bad days with the knee all
season.'' He has 17 hits in his last 48 at-bats but had just two
homers in nearly a two-month span before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: With little fanfare, Chicago's Albert Belle set a
major-league record for home runs in July with 16. ... One of the
hottest closers in baseball has been Cleveland's Mike Jackson, who
has 27 saves and hasn't blown one since May 12, giving him 17
straight. ... After Indians right-hander Paul Shuey hit Detroit's
Geronimo Berroa with a pitch, he said, ``The pitch I hit him with,
he normally swings at.'' ... Minnesota's Eric Milton, acquired from
the Yankees for Chuck Knoblauch, has three wins against the Royals
this year. ... Tigers reliever Doug Brocail is tired of being part
of trade rumors. ``If I was traded, I'd like for it to be for a
player to be named later, and I'd be the player.'' ... The Royals
are 35-34 when Hal Morris hits third in the lineup. When he
doesn't, they're 13-26. ... Frank Thomas is in a 3-for-27 slump,
and his average is down to .258. He hit .347 last year.
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr.'s sense of humor is getting better. While in the
on-deck circle for a recent game, he grabbed the live ground mike
used by the team's flagship channel and blurted to the team's
play-by-play man, Dave Niehaus: ``Dave, you know if I hit a home
run, you have to give up those bright blue pants.'' The next night,
Niehaus was wearing gray.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The hamstring injury to Juan Gonzalez has hurt his
pursuit of Hack Wilson's RBI record. Gonzalez has 116 RBIs through
108 games; in 1930, Wilson had 120 through the same number of games
on his way to 190. ... What a month for Anaheim's Garret Anderson,
who went 44-for-107 in July. He has a 28-game hitting streak. ...
The Rangers won't trade top outfielder prospect Ruben Mateo for a
big-name starter because center fielder Tom Goodwin has a bad
elbow. ... Oakland's Blake Stein struck out four Tampa Bay hitters
in an inning Monday night to become the 29th player to do so. Stein
is the first since teammate Wilson Alvarez did it when he was with
the White Sox last July. In the inning, Mike DiFelice struck out
but reached first on a wild pitch. ... Griffey has only two home
runs in his last 14 games.

 &HT;    Bullpen able to silence Cards, critics
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- No doubt as the clock edged closer to midnight, Kerry
Ligtenberg started to wonder if his job as closer was about to turn
into a pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-throwing right-hander the Braves acquired for a few
bats and balls two years ago heard the talk on radio and
television. He'd read in the papers that without acquiring a solid
relief help, Atlanta's title hopes would disappear like Arsenio
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve o'clock came and went. No moves were made. Ligtenberg
awoke Saturday with some job security _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought entered my mind a little bit,'' Ligtenberg said.
``But I couldn't put too much stress on myself, worrying ...if they
were going to make a move or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the ninth inning with a popping-fresh 3-1 lead Saturday
against the St. Louis Cardinals, the 27-year-old Ligtenberg stepped
on the mound giving critics their first chance to take a jab at the
front office's inability to strike a deal
</P>
<P>
   After surrendering a leadoff single to Eli Marrero and a
subsequent stolen base, Ligtenberg mowed down the next three
batters he faced, striking out Placido Polanco to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been almost perfect for a long time,'' Braves manager
Bobby Cox said about Ligtenberg, who recorded his 15 save of the
season, the ninth in his last nine opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg wouldn't have been afforded the opportunity had it
not been for a brilliant performance by Braves starter Tom Glavine,
who got nothing for pitching seven strong innings, allowing one run
on four hits.
</P>
<P>
   The win fell on the right arm of reliever Rudy Seanez, who
started the year in Richmond, but has established himself as one of
the Braves' most reliable set-up men. Seanez is 4-0 with a 1.86 ERA
after pitching a scoreless eighth. Left-handed hitter Ray Lankford
singled to start the inning but no worry, even if Mark McGwire was
the next hitter. Big Mac took a hack and fell victim to the
forkball for Seanez's 26th strikeout in 19 1/3 innings this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel all right. We feel we can do the job out there,''
Seanez said about the bullpen. ``(But) it ain't over yet. We have a
long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz is well aware of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've stayed with the guys we have because we have great
confidence in them,'' Schuerholz said. ``If there is an opportunity
to get a player to help our ballclub in the next month we'll
certainly do it if we can, but we don't feel it's necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Hear the sound. At least for one day there is silence about the
shortcomings of the Braves bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, if Mark (Wohlers) can get things straightened out,
we'll have a real solid pen,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I feel like I've
been throwing the ball well lately. All I can do is go out there
and help the team win and that's what I've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun right now.''
</P>
<P>
   If only the Braves' scoreboard has his name spelled correctly
too. As many of the 50,137 fans exited Turner Field, they saw that
``LIGTENBER'' was given credit for the save.

 &HT;    Academic casualties thin ranks of signees
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Auburn and Florida State football progams have
taken the biggest hits since National Signing Day, but Mississippi
and Mississippi State have received their share of hard knocks.
</P>
<P>
   Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden and son Terry at Auburn have lost
at least a combined 12 football signees for this season because of
academic shortcomings. The younger Bowden, already under scrutiny
after the conviction of star wide receiver Robert Baker on drug
charges, as well as other off-the-field troubles, suffered the most
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the Tigers' signees failed to qualify, including prep
All-America defensive lineman Robert Malone, linebacker Don Page,
defensive back Stanford Simmons and wide receiver Ronney Daniels,
all of whom were expected to help this season.
</P>
<P>
   Malone will enroll as a partial qualifier this fall, meaning he
can practice at Auburn but can't play, while Page and Daniels hope
to enroll in January. Simmons failed to qualify for the second
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole deal is just like one big airplane, and it's got 85
seats on it,'' Terry Bowden said. ``Sometimes we've got to ask a
guy to get off for free tickets later. We signed 27 players. That
means two have to go. We're going to sign some knowing that they're
going somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State didn't suffer as much in quantity but probably did
in quality. All-America defensive lineman Kevin Emanuel of Waco,
Texas, won't enroll until at least January, while tailback Quinton
Callum, who could have provided depth behind starter Travis Minor,
won't be in Tallahassee for at least two more seasons after
enrolling at Jones (Miss.) Junior College.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State lost highly regarded wide receiver Marco Minor
and is still awaiting word on heralded running back Justin
Griffith. Griffith is petitioning to retake a standardized test but
will enroll as a partial qualifier at least. The Bulldogs got a big
boost, though, when wide receiver Harold Lindsey of Marietta High
qualified during summer school.

   Kentucky lost two of its biggest offensive signees, tight end
Bobby Blizzard of Hampton, Va., and wide receiver C.J. Lofton of
Lowndes County High. Lofton, who had 56 catches for 854 yards and
seven touchdowns as a senior, will attend Hargrave (Va.) Military
Academy. Lofton said Friday that he'll probably re-sign with the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, (Kentucky quarterback) Tim Couch will stay for
another season,'' Lofton said.

 &HT;    Braves' inactivity a mystery
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The player who opened the season as their closer but
now can't find the plate refuses to go to the minors. Their center
fielder has been fined so many times his manager says he is about
to go broke. The second baseman has a bad shoulder, the shortstop
has an ailing left quadriceps, and the bullpen has no leader and
few dependable arms.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves let the trading deadline pass quietly, heading
into the regular-season stretch and postseason much like they did
last season with a young bullpen and their biggest move being the
addition of bench player Greg Colbrunn.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's sitting on its hand was one of the biggest surprises
of anything that happened on Friday. Many felt the Braves needed to
add an experienced closer to move into the same class as the
Yankees, or even the Padres, who are a more balanced club with
closer Trevor Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Braves have another problem.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Even Braves third baseman Chipper Jones admits, ``I think those
were gulps you heard around midnight Friday from Atlanta, San Diego
and Chicago. Picking up Johnson has to make Houston the favorite.
In a (seven-game) series you are going to have to face Randy at
least twice, which means you may have to win four games against
pitchers like (Mike) Hampton and (Shane) Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys could be No. 1 starters on a lot of other teams and
winning four games against them will be putting a lot of pressure
on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Braves will likely open the playoffs with
either Houston or Chicago, meaning that there is a good possibility
that in the best-of-five set they will either have to face the Big
Unit or Kerry Wood in Games 1 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, so much for having the league's best record.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz said he was very close to deal
but it depended on another team making another move and it didn't
happen. Schuerholz would not say whom the deal was for but it might
have involved Johnson since the Braves were interested in bringing
him here as a reliever. Also, obviously Schuerholz felt the price
was too high, not wanting to mortgage part of the future and move
such young players as George Lombard and Bruce Chen.
</P>
<P>
   But what is strange about that is even if the Braves depleted
their minor-league organization for a run at a championship this
year, they always will have the money to spend on free agents to
fill such holes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are left with a Kerry Ligtenberg as their closer. Not
that Ligtenberg has pitched poorly _ the Braves have converted 26
of their last 30 save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if our relievers had three or four years of
experience, people wouldn't even be talking about the bullpen,''
Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   But remember that come postseason, the runs typically don't come
as frequently, meaning more close games and less margin for error.
This can prove harmful to a team without a proven closer and deep
bullpen, such as the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any way the Braves can now improve themselves?
</P>
<P>
   They might be able to pull off a small deal, but any big ones
would likely be blocked by a club. Players now must first go
through the waiver process to be moved. Last August, the Braves
were blocked time after time.
</P>
<P>
   But Schuerholz doesn't seemed concerned, saying, ``I like our
team, the way we are playing. I think the only issue is the bullpen
and their inexperience.''
</P>
<P>
   That inexperience, however, may be too much to overcome.

   A few good linemen would help offenses
</P>
<P>
   By Len Pasquarelli
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   At the Miami Dolphins' camp last week, coach Jimmy Johnson
extolled the virtues of his new offense, in which the four-wide
receiver package has been scrapped, tight end Troy Drayton will
stay on the field for third down and Dan Marino won't work from a
shotgun set.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Dallas Cowboys rookie coach Chan Gailey talked
of the advantages of putting Troy Aikman in the shotgun with four-
and five-wideout looks.
</P>
<P>
   Different strokes for different folks, certainly, but both men
agreed that the key element in every offense, especially in this
era of free agency, is the line. ``No area is more critical to a
team,'' Johnson said. ``It's the place where, as a league, we've
really slipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has mandated a stronger running game and charged line
coach Larry Beightol with creating a more physical mindset. But it
doesn't speak well for the Dolphins that the club signed free agent
Anthony Redmon a day into camp and, despite his mediocre resume, he
immediately challenged for the starting job at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gailey, he might be forced to resort to smoke and mirrors
to move the ball behind a unit that saw Mark Tuinei retire, Pro
Bowl right guard Larry Allen move to left tackle and journeyman
Everett McIver slide in at right guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it's like having five new starters, because they're
all learning a new offense,'' Dallas line coach Hudson Houck said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, coaches have said the declining quality
of the NFL is directly related to the lack of cohesion free agency
has meant for offensive lines.
</P>
<P>
   Only four teams figure to open '98 with the same offensive lines
that started a year ago. Nine teams, including the Super Bowl
champion Denver Broncos, could have at least three new line
starters. Denver must replace All-Pro left tackle Gary Zimmerman
(retired), right guard Brian Habib (free agency) and the man
scheduled to start at right guard, David Diaz-Infante (injury).
</P>
<P>
   ``People wonder why the (defensive) tackles have become so
dominant,'' Cowboys assistant head coach Jim Bates said. ``Part of
it is the drop-off in interior (offensive-line) talent around the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   How much is Wads-worth?
</P>
<P>
   Unsigned first-round pick Andre Wadsworth hasn't turned up the
heat on the Arizona Cardinals yet. But if negotiations continue at
the current pace, no one should be surprised if the former FSU
defensive end requests a trade. League rules stipulate that
Wadsworth would have to be dealt by this Friday, and few teams
could absorb the impact on their salary cap. Cardinals vice
president Bob Ferguson might have his hands tied in negotiations by
owner Bill Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis deal
</P>
<P>
   The nine-year, $51.9 million contract signed by Denver tailback
Terrell Davis is structured more like a four- or five-year deal
worth about $5 million annually. The former Georgia player got an
$11 million signing bonus, but it is doled out in four payments _
$1.833 million each 1998-2000 and $5.501 million in 2001. Davis'
base salaries are $500,000 in 1998, $900,000 in 1999, $1.3 million
in 2000, $5.8 million in 2001, $4.7 million each in 2002 and 2003,
with a $1 million roster bonus both years, and $7 million each in
2004-2006. If Davis isn't among the NFL's top nine rushers in those
final three years, the base salary is reduced by half.
</P>
<P>
   The profitable son
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Archie Manning signed a five-year, $420,000 contract
with John Mecom Jr., then the owner of the Saints. He received a
signing bonus of $170,000 and a first-year base salary of $30,000.
On Tuesday, son Peyton Manning signed a six-year deal with the
Indianapolis Colts worth at least $38 million. In his first five
seasons, he will make $28.5 million. The younger Manning got a
signing bonus of $11.6 million _ more than twice the $5.5 million
his father made in 14 NFL seasons. ... When Peyton Manning's
contract voids after three seasons, the Colts can ``buy back''
three more years by paying a second signing bonus of $8.4 million.
His base salaries then escalate to $3.2 million in 2001, $4.76
million in 2002 and $9.5 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring confidence
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants coach Jim Fassel proved on the opening day of
camp that he's a pretty good amateur psychologist. On the first
snap of the initial practice, Fassel called for a deep pass to Ike
Hilliard and the second-year wideout torched corner Phillippi
Sparks to grab a 40-yarder from Danny Kanell. The significance:
Hilliard, the Giants' top pick in '97, missed most of his rookie
season after neck surgery. Fassel wanted to get the talented former
Florida star beyond any remaining mental hurdles and establish that
he is fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In the fine print
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked last week when commissioner Paul Tagliabue released
the plan for stocking the roster of the new Cleveland Browns was a
provision that prohibits the franchise from trading draft choices
``to acquire rights to, sign or obtain the contractual release of
any non-player personnel.'' The provision probably removes current
Green Bay coach Mike Holmgren from consideration. Although Packers
president Bob Harlan and general manager Ron Wolf restructured
Holmgren's contract to make it easier for him to leave the team
after this season, the club still would seek draft-pick
compensation from any team that wants to hire him. If the Al Lerner
group wins the Cleveland franchise, look for former 49ers president
Carmen Policy to consider George Seifert in Cleveland. The most
likely landing spots for Holmgren remain Seattle or San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Before he strained a hamstring in last Sunday's scrimmage,
first-round tailback John Avery was getting most of the ink in
Dolphins camp. But it was second-round corner Patrick Surtain whom
Johnson called ``the best pick we've made in three years here.''
... The Bengals, loaded with young first-round linebackers Reinard
Wilson, Takeo Spikes and Brian Simmons, could jettison an old
first-rounder. James Francis, a No. 1 pick in '90, drew the ire of
coach Bruce Coslet by reporting 20 pounds overweight. Francis blew
offseason workout bonuses of $250,000 each of the last two years.
... Chicago second-round free safety Tony Parrish has bumped
veteran John Mangum from the starting job. ... An injury to
starting fullback Marc Edwards has given former Auburn star Fred
Beasley, a sixth-round pick, the chance to make a strong impression
in San Francisco. ... Randy Moss has performed well and rehabbed
from a spring ankle sprain, but Vikings coach Dennis Green seems to
have lowered expectations already on his No. 1 draft pick. Perhaps
trying to create a built-in excuse in case Moss struggles, Green
last week suggested that the wideout might not be healthy all
season.
</P>
<P>
   The last word(s)
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, on what he plans to do with his money once he signs a
contract: ``I don't know, but I thought I might go to Las Vegas and
see those guys Sigmund and Freud.''

   One has to wonder why the Phillies would spend so much on their
top draft choice, Pat Burrell, when they could have had their first
pick last year, J.D. Drew, for about the same money. Drew is a much
better player, yet Burrell got a guaranteed $8 million. The
Phillies apparently feared a public-relations backlash if they
didn't sign Burrell, and they continue to maintain that Drew never
wanted to play in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Call it the two faces of Kevin Millwood. At home, the
Braves' fifth starter is 7-3 with a 2.88 ERA, and opponents are
hitting just .208. On the road, he is 4-3 with an ERA of 7.08 and
an opponent batting average of .305. ... In a 23-hour span last
week, Marlins catcher Mike Redmond caught 31 innings, in a
doubleheader and an extra-inning game. ... Mets reliever Dennis
Cook on his club: ``I think everybody knows we're at a turning
point, and it's time to get it in gear. We have been talking about
it the whole first half, we just haven't done it.'' ... Scott Rolen
is one of the best young players in the game, but the Phillies
third baseman struggles with the bases loaded. He is 1-for-22 in
his career
</P>
<P>
   Central
</P>
<P>
   In early June, Pirates starter Jason Schmidt was 8-1 but threw
out this warning: ``I'm 8-1 now, but I know how things work in this
game. I could easily go from 8-1 to 8-8.'' Check Schmidt's record
now. He is 8-8 and has gone 10 starts without a victory. ``Earlier
this year I was winning some games that maybe I didn't deserve to
win,'' he said. ``Now I'm losing games I don't deserve to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Cubs rookie Kerry Wood is 8-0 with a 2.10 ERA at Wrigley
Field this year. ... After not hitting a grand slam among his first
246 home runs, Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa hit them in consecutive
games, something that Mike Piazza did earlier this year. But no
player, not even Lou Gehrig, hit slams three games in a row... The
Astros will get closer Billy Wagner back soon. Hit on the head with
a line drive on July 15, Wagner is on a rehab assignment at Class
AA Jackson and is expected to rejoin the Astros on Monday. ...
Milwaukee's Bob Hamelin has hit a team-record three pinch homers
this season. ... Mark McGwire has been walked intentionally 24
times this season. Nine have come from the Giants, who used to
complain about all the times Barry Bonds was walked.
</P>
<P>
   West
</P>
<P>
   After an unusual midsummer slump, San Diego's Tony Gwynn has 11
hits in his last four games to raise his average from .304 to .323.
Gwynn says he'll ``roll with the punches. I'd be concerned if we
weren't playing well. But an offense is like a machine. Some parts
are always running better than others.'' Gwynn came into the season
averaging .368 the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Three players led the league in hitting last week.
Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall was followed by Colorado's Dante
Bichette and Rockies teammate Larry Walker. ... Colorado starter
Pedro Astacio has allowed more runs (107) than anyone in the majors
this season. Greg Maddux has given up just 40. ... Arizona keeps
running into bad luck. Pitcher Brian Anderson ended up with a sore
elbow after a 25-minute cab ride in San Diego during which he
rested his arm on the top of the back seat. ... The Rockies expect
to target Cardinals center fielder Brian Jordan as their top
priority after the season. Jordan can become a free agent and may
not want to return to St. Louis. ... Anyone who knows Darren
Driefort's background should be unsurprised that the Dodgers
pitcher hit a 435-foot homer. In college at Wichita State, he was
the designated hitter when he wasn't pitching and hit 25 homers in
314 career at-bats.

 &HT;    Rose's thorn
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAINBRIDGE, Pa. -- The cornstalks are bending slightly in the
early-morning wind, towering above the man who planted them. The
part of his face not hidden by the scruffy beard is sun-burned, his
hands rough from long days of farm work.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing jeans and a dirty T-shirt, Gene Garber smiles when he
thinks back to Aug. 1, 1978, the memorable evening in Atlanta when
he stopped Pete Rose's run at history.
</P>
<P>
   But then Garber's expression changes. His lips droop; his eyes
turn away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched a long time in the major leagues, got a lot of
saves,'' he says. ``Despite having a pretty good career, I thought
I never got credit for it. The thing I am remembered for is
stopping Pete Rose's streak. `Hey, there's Gene Garber; that's the
guy who stopped Rose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, about 225 miles away, in the baseball mecca of
Cooperstown, a statue of Babe Ruth towers over Pete Rose, who is
sitting at a table at a collector's shop on Main Street wearing
shorts and a Nike T-shirt. His face is sun-burned, his hands tired
from signing autographs for $25 each. For $75, the collector can
get an autographed bat. On this day, the line is long. Fans are
clamoring to see the smiling face of the Hall-of-Fame-caliber
player who has been banned from baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Just as suddenly, Rose's expression also changes to deadly
serious. His tone changes; his dark eyes grow piercing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to see that streak come to an end, hated it,'' Rose
says. ``I probably said some pretty rough things about Gene after
that game, about him taking it so seriously. To be honest, I didn't
know I was on live television at the time. But people have to
realize just how big that streak was to me. I was having fun and
helping a lot of people and helping the game at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 20 years ago this weekend that Rose's 44-game hitting
streak came to an end. While playing for the Cincinnati Reds, the
37-year-old Rose had captured the baseball nation's attention in
his pursuit of Joe DiMaggio's 56-game streak. He had tied the
National League record, set by Wee Willie Keeler in 1897, the night
before in Atlanta. But on a muggy night in Atlanta-Fulton County
Stadium, it came to an end against a Gene Garber change-up.
</P>
<P>
   Rose swung and missed badly; Garber leaped off the mound; Rose
turned away in disgust. And the two, joined at a historic baseball
moment, went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   Garber played 10 more years in a distinguished career, then
returned to his farm. He finished with 218 saves, which ranked 17th
on the all-time list at the start of the 1998 season, and 94
victories, tied for seventh all-time among relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Rose proceeded to break Ty Cobb's all-time hits record before
retiring in 1986. He managed the Reds 1984-89 and became entangled
in one of the biggest controversies in baseball. He was accused of
gambling on the game and was banned for life.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, Garber is happy to be on his farm, totally
away from baseball. And Rose is trying desperately to get back in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rose is having fun signing autographs down on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you don't remember my name?'' a woman asks.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Bet.' That's not a good word around me,'' Rose says. ``I
don't bet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I met you in your restaurant in Florida,'' the woman says.
``You said you'd never forget me. Come on, Pete; I know you know
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, it's Susan,'' Rose says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong,'' the woman says. ``But I'll be back down at your
restaurant and maybe you'll remember it by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, memories are in the eye of the beholder. Rose's
campaign for baseball reinstatement is built around his
contributions to the sport. Baseball recognizes those contributions
but isn't listening to his pleas. Most baseball people give little
chance to his recent application to Bud Selig, baseball's new
commissioner, for reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   So Rose spends most of his time at autograph shows and running
his two restaurants in south Florida. He makes big money at
collectors' shows. He recently signed more than 50 items for $2,500
in one show, splitting the take with the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not about to give up trying to get into the Hall,'' he
said. ``And if they let me in after I'm dead, then I'll come back
to pick up the plaque. Look, I was good for the game. They all
liked me, the fans, the media. I think I belong in the Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly seemed to be his destiny when he came to Atlanta
in August 1978. Everyone was following the streak, and Rose was
feeding on the attention from a World Series-like media contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really helped me out was 25 of those games were before
the All-Star streak, and nobody really paid much attention to it,''
Rose said of the streak, which began in Chicago on June 14. ``I did
get a hit in the All-Star Game. Then we resumed, and I tied the
modern day (NL) record (of 37), set by Tommy Holmes (in 1945 for
the Boston Braves). Holmes worked for the Mets, and it just so
happened that I broke it there. He came down to first base and
presented me the ball. Tommy looked at me and said, `Thanks for
making me famous again.' I will never forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose said the most memorable hit leading into the Atlanta game
came on July 19 in Philadelphia with the streak at 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in the eighth inning off Tug McGraw,'' Rose said.
``But then we batted around in the ninth, and I got a bunt base
hit. Batted around in the ninth _ can you believe that? And then
the next week we were playing the Phillies in Cincinnati, and I
remember the first time I came up that Mike Schmidt was behind the
bag at third. Schmidt was my buddy, and (manager Danny) Ozark
started yelling at him, 'Get in _ you want Rose to bunt on you
again?' He came in, and I hit a line drive by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose faced Phil Niekro in the opener in Atlanta in front of the
biggest crowd of the season, 45,007. Niekro, pitching for the
last-place Braves, walked Rose in the first inning and was booed in
his own home park. ``I felt like I was a villain out there
tonight,'' Niekro said. He was. Rose singled in the sixth to tie
the NL mark at 44.
</P>
<P>
   Garber has worked on a farm since he was a little boy. His
father was a farmer in this rich Pennsylvania valley located a
short distance from Three Mile Island. It was natural for Garber to
return to the farm every offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Now he farms more than 350 acres with help from his two sons. He
also has two other tracts of land that someone else farms for him.
They grow corn, barley, some soybean. It's going to be a good crop,
and Garber will make a little money on it this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think growing up on a farm and coming home here in the
offseason made me appreciate things better than others,'' he said.
``Baseball was great. It wasn't reality. Reality was when I came
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Garber needs the money. He made plenty when he played.
He also made history, joining the Braves less than two months
before Rose's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Reds came into Atlanta, I told my wife before the
series even started that I was going to get a chance to stop Pete's
streak,'' Garber said. ``I told her I was going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A father and his young son approach Rose in Cooperstown. The
father pulls out his U.S. Army identification card. It's
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete, this is my son, and I really don't have $25 for an
autograph,'' the father says. ``My sons really like you, Pete; can
we please get an autograph? I just don't have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, kid, come here,'' Rose says.
</P>
<P>
   Rose signs a ball and takes a picture with the young boy. The
scene brings tears to the eyes of Rose's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Rose had no such humanitarian thoughts when he stepped into the
batter's box against Larry McWilliams on Aug. 1, 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Rose smashed a first-pitch fastball back at McWilliams, who made
a brilliant catch _ falling to his right _ and robbed Rose of a
sure hit up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Forty minutes later, Rose faced Williams again. On an 0-2 count,
he grounded to short for an easy out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you, in those days, Ted Turner was rooting for me
to get a hit so he could have 35,000 in that park,'' Rose said.
``When the streak ended, I was disappointed for the Atlanta Braves.
The next night, what was the attendance?''
</P>
<P>
   It was 26,812.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his crops, Garber also raises emus, a large
Australian bird related to the ostrich. A local restaurant serves
the meat, which is supposed to be healthy red meat, low in
cholesterol. He has more than 50 on his farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people around here can't make a living if their farm
isn't real big,'' he said. ``So we're trying to figure out other
ways for people to bring in income on a small farm. So I'm trying
emus. It's good. We get about 40 pounds off each bird. We hope
someday that people around here can take an 80-acre farm and raise
thousands of these. It'll bring some good money to these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber seems millions of miles away from the 1978 moment.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought into the game in the seventh inning by Braves
manager Bobby Cox with Atlanta leading 7-4. Rose lashed a Garber
fastball to the left side, but the line drive hit Braves third
baseman Bob Horner in the chest. Horner held on.
</P>
<P>
   The final at-bat came in the ninth. Garber, who struck out the
two previous hitters, fell behind 2-1 in the count.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that was going through my mind at the time, and the
thing that still goes through my mind, was how scared I was of
walking him,'' Garber said. ``I don't think people have ever felt
the pressure I did to throw a strike. We were down to a situation
where this was his last at-bat, and if the streak was going to be
stopped, you certainly can't stop it on a walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no doubt what I needed to throw, and that was
change-ups, because that's what I went for when I needed a strike.
I threw a great change-up on 2-1 and he fouled it off. No way I
wanted to go 3-2. When I released the 2-2 pitch _ I knew when a
change-up was leaving my hand whether it was a good one or not _ I
thought, 'Oh, no.' Then it was, 'Oh, no _ yeah,' because he swung
and missed. It was up there in the strike zone and didn't move the
way my pitches move, but somehow he didn't hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose ripped Garber in the ensuing press conference, complaining
that he didn't throw a strike. Garber was asked to join Rose but
decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in my clubhouse to gather my thoughts for a few
minutes,'' Garber said. ``I was in our TV room when I saw them
interviewing Pete, and a lot of what he was saying was directed at
me. I decided not to do that interview, because it was
anticlimactic at that point. It would have been a rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete made the comment after the game that I was pitching like
it was the last pitch of the last inning of the World Series. That
was the best compliment he could have ever given me. That is
exactly the way Pete Rose played. He played his whole career that
way. People have to remember that I had been traded from the
first-place Phillies to the last-place Braves. It wasn't very fun
playing for the Braves. So that's probably why I jumped so high
when he struck out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People sort of misread what I said about Garber,'' Rose said.
``First of all, I like Gene Garber; he's a great competitor. But
what I said when I went up to bat that last time, the score was
16-4 and there were two outs in the ninth and no one was on. If I
went up there with no bat, I would have walked on four pitches. And
the last pitch was that much outside. So all I said (was) I thought
he would come at me more, instead of nibbling. Not that he was
supposed to lay it down the middle for me to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose had four hits against the Braves on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   It's lunch time on the farm. The corn will be harvested in late
September, and the emus are a lot of work. Garber, 50, has been to
one game since he retired almost 10 years ago. He says he thinks
about baseball from time to time, but this is his home now. He's a
farmer; it's in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in his house, there's a box of letters he received
after stopping Rose's streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some hate mail,'' he said. ``There's one guy I'll
never forget. He said, 'I hope the next time you go into your
windup you just screw yourself right into the ground.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rose's autograph session in Cooperstown is almost over. But he
has important duty remaining. His 8-year-old daughter has given him
a list of Beanie Babies she wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a lot of the big ones,'' Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, 57, is interrupted by another autograph-buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope one day we come up here for a ceremony for you,'' the
man says.
</P>
<P>
   Rose laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a good crowd there,'' he said.

 &HT;    Donnan cool toward Fulmer
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The top coaching feud in the SEC is no longer
Florida's Steve Spurrier and Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer. It's now
Fulmer and Georgia's Jim Donnan.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan has made no secret of his intense desire to beat
Tennessee after last year's loss at Knoxville. With Tennessee
holding a comfortable lead in the fourth quarter, Fulmer put Peyton
Manning back in the game to get his 300 yards passing. After the
game, Donnan had some well-chosen words for the Tennessee coach.
That's how it started.
</P>
<P>
   Then Donnan added some fuel to the fire and got a measure of
revenge after the season when he hired Rodney Garner, Tennessee's
best recruiter. Donnan caught some heat for the timing of the move,
but Georgia went on to have a nationally ranked recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about it last week at preseason SEC football meetings
in Birmingham, neither man was willing to delve deeply into the
relationship. But it is clear that they won't be exchanging
Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with Jim Donnan, and I hope he doesn't
have a problem with me,'' Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Another incentive for Donnan: Tennessee has beaten Georgia five
straight games, and a win by the Bulldogs would represent the next
major step in Donnan's rebuilding of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a credibility standpoint, it's a big game for us,''
Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   We'll see Oct. 10, when the teams meet in Athens in a nationally
televised game (3:30 p.m., CBS).
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy Dubose
</P>
<P>
   Alabama coach Mike DuBose is not happy about his 1998 schedule.
The problem is not who Alabama plays, but when. The Crimson Tide
opens the season with games on Sept. 5 and 12, takes a week off,
and then plays nine weeks in a row to close out the season.
</P>
<P>
   DuBose thinks that's too many consecutive games and wasn't
bashful about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people were out to get us and they got us,'' said DuBose.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, coach, would that someone be the SEC office, which makes the
schedule?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can write that, but I didn't say it,'' DuBose said.
</P>
<P>
   Bet DuBose wouldn't trade places with South Carolina. The
Gamecocks have to play nine straight weeks before they finally get
an open date on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Football stays at 85
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the NCAA Division I Management Council did not
support a recommendation to cut football scholarships from 85 to
75. The proposal came before the council at last week's meeting in
Philadelphia. The intent was to free resources to help schools
provide more opportunities for women and better comply with Title
IX regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just wasn't any support for the idea and that's what we
expected,'' said Florida athletics director Jeremy Foley, a member
of the council. ``We must provide more opportunities for women, but
we have to find a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   Auburn football coach Terry Bowden is 25 pounds lighter after
going on a protein diet during the offseason. Bowden, who is
5-foot-6, looked in great shape during last week's SEC preseason
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the weight I gained at Auburn,'' Bowden said. ``So,
I'm giving it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back Sean Key has returned to the Florida State
football team after sitting out last season because of an arrest in
an on-campus incident. Key pleaded no-contest to an aggravated
battery charge and was suspended from the team. He spent 28 days in
the Leon County jail. Key had to complete a series of requirements
by the school's student judicial committee before he could be
reinstated to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Those folks who are waiting for a playoff in Division I football
might be waiting a very long time, said Roy Kramer, the
commissioner of the SEC. For all the talk of the demise of the bowl
system, it is doing pretty well. Ten of the 14 non-Alliance bowls
increased their attendance last year, and five broke their
attendance records, according to Kramer.Spurrier said he will
discourage future Florida signees from playing in high school
all-star games. The Gators had two players injured this summer,
including receiver John Capel, who dislocated an elbow while
practicing for the Georgia-Florida All-Star game. Running back
Chuck Marks suffered knee-ligament damage playing in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Worth quoting
</P>
<P>
   LSU coach Gerry DiNardo on how college football has changed in
the 1990s: ``You go into a home recruiting, and a parent asks you
why their son's name is spelled wrong on the Internet. And you have
to tell them you can't even use self-serve gas, much less a
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Spurrier on whether he will ever go to the NFL: ``I
really believe they are going to quit seeing if I'm interested. I
think the word on me now is, `He'll listen to you, but he's not
leaving.' They've quit calling. Life is just very good at Florida.
Now, if down the road, life is not so good, like if we're losing,
and they want to make a change, then maybe something happens. But
it couldn't be much better than where I am right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's Bowden on fans who want him to run the ball more:
``Auburn fans would rather go 8-3 running the ball than 9-2 passing
it. If we beat Alabama, of course.''

 &HT;    Eldredge goes out gold
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Eldredge took the Goodwill Games gold medal
Friday night and skated off into the next phase of his career while
17-year-old Timothy Goebel quadrupled his chances of becoming the
next great U.S. male skater.
</P>
<P>
   Goebel is still the only American to successfully perform a quad
jump in competition. He did a quadruple salchow that felt so good
he tried a quad toe, but popped out of it on the first rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of thinking, 'One down, one to go,'' said Goebel,
of Rolling Meadows, Ill., who missed last year's U.S. nationals,
the Olympic selection competition, because of a hip injury. ``I
think (the quads) will definitely raise the bar to the other men.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Urmanov of Russia, the 1994 Olympic champion who has been
hampered by a groin injury, placed second, followed by teammate
Evgeni Plushenko of Russia, 15, who two-footed a quad toe attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Weiss of the U.S. two-footed a quad toe in one of his
best performances to place fourth. While the judges gave him the
nod over Goebel, who was fifth, Goebel got a standing ovation from
the crowd of 5,790 at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Goebel did his first _ and only other _ quadruple salchow at a
Junior Champions Series event in Lausanne, Switzerland, in March.
Eldredge also got a standing ovation after doing eight triples,
including two triple-triples and one triple-double in the first 1
minute and 10 seconds. He retired his ``First Night'' program,
which has served him well and won $75,000 here, but captured only
fourth place in Nagano. An Olympic medal is all that's missing in
Eldredge's storied career. He competed in his first Olympics in
1992 and was 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Eldredge has vowed not to compete at the U.S. nationals or
Worlds, but will remain eligible for the 2002 Games. ``Tonight was
a goodbye to the Goodwill Games ... who knows what will happen in
the next four years,`` said Eldredge, who will be 27 this month.
</P>
<P>
   In pairs, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Skiharulidze of Russia, the
Olympic silver medalists, defeated their teammates, Nagano gold
medalists Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev.

<P>
   While the FIBA World Championship of Basketball is taking center
stage and the NBA lockout prohibits teams from conducting personnel
matters, Phoenix free agent Antonio McDyess is the most logical
free agent for the Rockets to pursue when the work stoppage ends.
</P>
<P>
   Before the lockout July 1, the Rockets had established their
list of prospective free agents. It included, among others,
McDyess, Scottie Pippen, Tom Gugliotta and Rod Strickland. All of
them have indicated a willingness to come to Houston, which figures
to have between $7 million and $10 million to spend on free agents
once the labor dispute is over.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets can't comment on players during the lockout. They
also are technically not supposed to have contact with players or
their agents. But that doesn't mean teams can't plot strategy. And
when the Rockets look at the free-agent board, there are many
reasons the 6-10 McDyess makes the most sense.
</P>
<P>
   NBA insiders have said they expect the Rockets to make a strong
run at McDyess, especially if Phoenix reels in Chicago's Pippen, as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, 23, has just finished his initial three-year rookie
contract he signed after being drafted No. 2 overall by Denver in
1995. He was traded by the Nuggets to Phoenix before last season.
The Alabama product averaged 15.1 points and 7.6 rebounds in 81
games for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason McDyess is considered by many NBA contacts as
the No. 1 option for the Rockets is because of his youth. He
probably will sign a six- or seven-year contract before the
upcoming season. He would provide a solid bridge for the Rockets,
who must embark on the difficult task of replacing Hakeem Olajuwon,
Barkley and the recently retired Clyde Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has two years left on his contract. Barkley is a free
agent but is expected to re-sign for at least one more season and
perhaps two.
</P>
<P>
   In McDyess, the Rockets would get a player who would help them
remain a threat to win the championship in one of Olajuwon's final
two years. And they have at least one McDyess supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess is young, runs, blocks shots and dunks,''
Olajuwon said last week. ``That is the way they should be
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess also has the sort of potential star status that could
ease the transition when the Rockets' stars move on. In two years,
the Rockets would have a lure in McDyess, who could help draw other
free agents to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Such a situation would allow the Rockets to avoid any serious
valleys in terms of wins and losses. Most teams _ Boston,
Philadelphia and Detroit in particular _ have enjoyed great success
in past years, only to become lottery fodder for several seasons
after their heydays. The Rockets' goal is to maximize Olajuwon's
final seasons, and steer clear of fan-alienating 20- and 30-win
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Because McDyess is a power forward, the Rockets could justify
paying him a huge contract and bill him as a cornerstone for taking
the franchise into the 21st century. It is tougher to build such a
nucleus around a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   That's the drawback in considering a player such as Washington's
Strickland. The Rockets have not had a dominant point guard since
John Lucas. But Strickland will enter the autumn of his career in
the next couple of seasons and he would not have the drawing power
among other future free agents that McDyess would.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Pippen and Minnesota's Gugliotta come off injuries
that required surgery. The Rockets would have to be convinced
Pippen's back and Gugliotta's foot are healed before taking them
on. And for Pippen, 33, age is a factor. He has more mileage on his
legs than most other NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves McDyess as the logical choice for the
Rockets. The Suns would be able to offer McDyess more money, but it
is believed he has a fondness for Houston. He owns a house in the
suburbs and his down-to-earth personality would seem to fit nicely
with that of coach Rudy Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lockout, Tomjanovich cannot comment on specific
players. But he said before the freeze on NBA activity that he
feels blessed that numerous free agents have listed the Rockets as
a possible destination. In that respect, McDyess would have the
opportunity to play with a future Hall of Fame center in Olajuwon
and likely would be the starting power forward.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow Barkley to come off the bench and minimize his
minutes during the regular season. All three could be on the court
with McDyess swinging over to small forward.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, the baton would be handed to McDyess as it becomes
his team to lead, along with whichever marquee free agent is
available.
</P>
<P>
   All of these arguments mean that when the NBA gets back to work,
the pursuit of McDyess likely will be the Rockets' first order of
business. &QL;

 &HT;    Gordon's right at home in Indy win
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Jeff Gordon's midas touch on a steering wheel
paid dividends in the millions Saturday as the 26-year-old
wunderkind outran the field in his Monte Carlo, winning his second
Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   With his victory, No. 6 of the season, Gordon reaped $1-million
from the No Bull Five program and $637,625 of the $5,506.,581
Brickyard purse.
</P>
<P>
   And he had to work harder than usual over the final ever over
the final 20 laps as caution after caution bunched the field each
time.,
</P>
<P>
   There were nine of those cautions for 34 laps and Gordon's
margin of victory was 3:09 seconds over Mark Martin, who led only
once for six laps, but never too far that Martin couldn't see him
from his rear view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon led only four times for 97 laps. Only pole sitter Ernie
Irvan, with 25, and Dale Jarrett, with 27, reached double figures
with Gordon. There were only 24 cars on the lead lap at the end,
and nine cautions for 34 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it feels like to win this race one time,'' Gordon
said. ``The inaugural was an awesome feeling. This one just blows
me away. I don't think I can take it all in right now. It's still
trying to sink it. Brooke and I are going away to relax for a few
days and celebrate my birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had things his way most of the long afternoon, slowed by
five accidents, the last two bring out cautions, giving Gordon an
easy ride to the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have enough car,'' Martin said.''When you're
leading the race and you've got the fastest car, man, you know,
it's your's to give it up and I tried to frustrate him, but I
didn't have enough to put the squeeze on him. They were hooked
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else came close. Jarrett ran out of gas and went down
four laps. Though he fought to get back on the lead lap, he had too
far to go and not enough time to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good being out front,'' Gordon said. ``I didn't want to
see too many cautions and have too many restarts. Dale Jarrett was
the only car I really saw that could pass anybody that was close to
his speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was tough on him getting his lap back each time he
got behind. He kept coming, but ran out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Martin with the final cautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw everything we had at him, but it wasn't enough,''
Martin said. ``I thought I might catch him after the final caution.
It looked like I was gaining on him, and I didn't know how much he
was playing with me. But, he wasn't playing at all. I was going as
hard as I could to try and reel him in.''

Wide-open World Championship still anybody's tournament
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ His U.S. squad is one-third of the way through the
FIBA World Championship of Basketball, and so far, one theme has
been constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said Saturday, ``is a
crazy tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Crazy in the sense that Spain _ a team the United States whacked
by 18 points in an exhibition two weeks ago _ is cruising along at
3-0; Australia, which won the silver medal at the Goodwill Games
last weekend, barely survived the first round at 1-2.
</P>
<P>
   Crazy in that Lithuania can knock off the United States and then
turn around and need a last-ditch rally to beat Brazil, which the
Americans had strummed by 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   And crazy in that the second round opens today with no fewer
than 10 teams in legitimate contention for a medal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will start the second round tonight against
Argentina. The teams are both 2-1 after the preliminaries.
Argentina finished second in Group D after losing an overtime game
Friday to Spain. The United States was second in Group C behind
Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he's concerned about the Argentines as well as
the emotional status of his team,
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an easy win (over South Korea on Friday) and Argentina
had a disappointing loss, so psychology-wise, we're feeling pretty
good about ourselves and they're a little mad,'' Tomjanovich said.
``We can't let that be a factor. And that happens a lot in these
tournaments. I think you saw a little bit of it in the
Lithuania-Brazil game, where they had a letdown because they had an
emotional win over us. It took them a long time to get that wake-up
call and take care of business. It could have cost them a game.
Those are the things you're always dealing with, especially when
you play three games in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he has driven home the point with his team that
the competitive bar will be raised in this round. But human nature
is not easy to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a pretty motivated team, generally,'' he said.
``But they're human, too. We had won four games in a row, counting
the exhibitions. We played a team that was really fired up to play
us and it was like a boulder coming down the mountain. It's hard to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Momentum in either direction is difficult to halt. The
Lithuanians know that all too well. They are 3-0 going into the
second round and need only one win to assure themselves a spot in
the medal round. Going 3-0 in the second round would make them the
No. 1 seed from the combined C-D group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you'd have told us we would be 2-1 after the first round,
we would have been thrilled,'' said Donn Nelson, assistant coach
for the Lithuanians and an assistant with the Dallas Mavericks.
``Going 3-0 was beyond our wildest dreams. Right now, we feel like
we can beat anybody in this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   But numerous other teams feel the same way. The Americans' group
for the next three days will be Lithuania (3-0), Spain (3-0),
Argentina, Brazil (1-2) and Australia (1-2). The other side of the
bracket has Yugoslavia (3-0), Greece (3-0), Russia (2-1), Italy
(2-1), Puerto Rico (1-2) and Canada (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Del Harris, one of Tomjanovich's assistants in this tournament,
believes the World Championship is wide-open now that first-round
play has weeded out four pretenders _ Senegal, Japan, South Korea
and Nigeria. Harris said the fact Spain is 3-0 is proof any team
could emerge from the remaining 12, with the exception of Canada
and Brazil, which remain long shots to reach the final eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had played Spain in the exhibition and thought that they
were solidly in the bottom half of the teams,'' Harris said. ``But
they've done surprisingly well. And Australia, which had gone to
the finals of the Goodwill Games, came here and lost two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it means, I think, is that you're looking at a very
balanced field now that the NBA players are out of the mix. It
should make for a really exciting playoff-type tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a very competitive situation. And it puts a lot of
pressure on each game. We feel like this first game is very
critical to us. If we can win that, it gives us a 3-1 record and
with two teams already having two losses in our group, it would
really put us in a good momentum situation to go ahead and get into
that medal round where the good hardware is distributed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tomjanovich said he was not surprised by the way Spain has
played.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were solid when we played them in the exhibition,'' he
said. ``We played a good game against them in Monaco. I could see
them doing that (going 3-0). We played very well in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Australia losing two games _ when on tapes I saw they
really looked like they were clicking _ is a little surprising.''

 &HT;    Brickyard Notebook
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Steve Park was having the time of his life
Saturday, racing for the first time since breaking a leg six months
ago in Atlanta, and feeling like he'd never been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   That euphoria lasted until reality crashed in the form of a
blown right rear tire with only 10 laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looked like Ricky (Rudd) might have cut a tire, and when he
did he went high in the turn,'' said Park, who would finish 35th.
''I came through the corner and and slid around a little bit and
cut down the right rear.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had really been running great and hoping for a top 10
finish. It's really disappointing with 10 laps to go to have
something like that happen. We didn't finish good.''
</P>
<P>
   Park ran in the top 10 early, as high as eighth during one long
stretch, and was beginning to make a move when he and Rudd got
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter how well you run all day long. It's how you
finish,'' he said. ''At least we showed what kind of team this is,
and that Steve Park is back.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt had his first top five finish, a fifth, since
Martinsville 11 races ago, where he was fourth. And he threw all
the credit to his pit crew. ''They kept working on it and getting
it better every time we came in,'' said Earnhardt, who started
28th. ''It was a good race for us.'' Indeed. He and teammate Mike
Skinner now are qualified for the next No Bull Five race at
Darlington Sept. 6. ''That's what it's all about. Getting better,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's ride
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd startled last year's field in winning the Brickyard
400 and extending his winning streak. Saturday, he experienced the
Brickyard downside. He had a tire go down with eight laps to go,
then became part of the final two lap fiasco and finished 31st. ''I
couldn't tell you how it happened. It got all stacked up. It was
way in front of me, but I still got into some of it.'' He's now
28th in points with only one top five finish.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip's ride
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip made the most of his first race with a new team.
He started 43rd and finished 17th. ''That's 30 cars we passed and
that's a pretty good day,'' he said. ''Am I surprised? I'm
thrilled. We were thinking if we came here and got a top 25, we'd
be happy. We fell like we just climbed a mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record
</P>
<P>
   With his victory, Jeff Gordon raised his Winston Cup career
earnings to $20,297,547, second only to Dale Earnhardt on the
all-time list . . . Bill Elliott's streak of finishing in the top
10 in every Brickyard 400 ended with his 12th place finish
Saturday.

Gordon strikes it rich at Brickyard
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ It was clear toward the end of the Brickyard 400
that someone was going to win a $1 million bonus and take home the
biggest paycheck in motor sports history.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers in the top three spots were among the five who had a
shot at the bonus money. The only question the 300,000 spectators
at Indianapolis Motor Speedway needed answered was which man would
get it.
</P>
<P>
   The claim to that juicy check was in doubt until a caution flag
with two laps to go enabled Jeff Gordon to win the race in the
DuPont Chevrolet without the final shootout that Mark Martin and
Bobby Labonte needed to get a chance at the seven-figure purse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' Gordon said. ``It's incredible. Indy
already is such a special race, but to put that extra million on it
makes it even bigger. I don't know what to say, but I guess when
it's meant to be, it's meant to be. My team did a great job in the
pits today. This is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon took home a check for $1,637,625, including the $1
million Winston No Bull 5 bonus. The drivers who finished in the
top five spots in the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, N.C., on May 24
earned a shot at the bonus money.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in less than a year that Gordon has
pocketed a $1 million bonus. He was the second and final winner of
the Winston Million bonus last September when he won at Darlington,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also became the first two-time winner of the Brickyard
400, including the inaugural race in 1994 at one of the few places
on the Winston Cup circuit where he receives more cheers than boos.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who turns 27 Tuesday, spent his teen years only 15 miles
from the storied speedway in Pittsboro, Ind., after his family
moved from California so he could race sprint cars at age 13.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Saturday's race was going to be a sprint to the
finish for Gordon, Martin and Labonte when a caution flag came out
with 10 laps to go, enabling Martin and Labonte to pull right
behind Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow pit stop, Martin fell to 13th with 37 laps to go.
But he worked his way through the field and passed Labonte for
second place with 16 laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Mark coming and there was nothing I could do,'' said
Labonte, who drives the Interstate Batteries Pontiac. ``I figured I
would follow him and maybe learn something if he passed Jeff.''
</P>
<P>
   That lesson didn't come. Martin had to settle for second place
in the Valvoline Ford for the third consecutive race. The last two
runner-up finishes have come while looking at Gordon's bumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still losing points to Gordon, but that's the best we
can do,'' Martin said. ``This was a good run, but not good enough.
We were awful close. I gave them what I had, and it wasn't enough.
It's hard to catch a guy who is faster than you.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're on a roll, and they have us beat in a couple of areas.
I knew it was going to take a mistake for me to get by him.''
</P>
<P>
   The race was restarted with seven laps left, but Martin couldn't
catch Gordon before another yellow flag came two laps later when
Jimmy Spencer hit the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Track officials quickly cleared the track for one last restart
with three laps to go, but five cars in the middle of the pack were
involved in an accident as the green flag waved.
</P>
<P>
   The cars in the front raced back to the start-finish line to
take the caution flag, but Gordon managed to stay in front. The
last two laps were finished under the yellow flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark made a great effort,'' Gordon said. ``He tried to get on
my rear bumper and I didn't know if I could get away from him. It
never seemed like we had it in hand until the last caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who won for the sixth time this season, increased his
season points lead to 72 points over Martin and 193 points over
Dale Jarrett, who appeared to be the one man who could have beaten
Gordon on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett got the $10,000 bonus for leading at the halfway point
on lap 80, but that decision by his team might have cost him more
than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett led for 36 laps, but he ran out of fuel on the
backstretch of lap 81 and starting coasting toward pit row. The
Quality Care Ford stopped just inside the pit entrance, at least
500 yards from his pit slot.
</P>
<P>
   As his pit crew ran down pit row to reach Jarrett, members of
each pit crew would push the car a few feet so it wouldn't block
their pit area. Finally, Jarrett reached the pit area of teammate
Kenny Irwin Jr., and the Texaco crew joined Jarrett's crew to push
him to his pit.
</P>
<P>
   But all that wasted time caused Jarrett to go four laps down to
the leaders. Despite that costly mistake, Jarrett was able to work
his way back to the lead lap with 32 laps remaining. He finished
16th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just drive the car and come in when they tell me to come
in,'' Jarrett said. ``We had a great race car, but we just ran out
of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gordon admits things might have turned out differently had
Jarrett's crew not miscalculated on the fuel mileage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Dale been behind me at the end, I would have been a little
more worried,'' Gordon said. ``It's weird how things work out
sometimes. Today it seemed like we couldn't do anything wrong. This
one just blows me away.''

LASORDA LOOKS LIKE REAL DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The long day was nearly over and Tom Lasorda was
heading to Little Italy when the car phone rang one last time.
</P>
<P>
   It was the New York Yankees, who for some reason were thinking
about Antonio Osuna at 11:30 at night. They were offering infielder
Homer Bush, but Lasorda wasn't interested. He already had done what
he set out to do upon taking over for Fred Claire as Dodgers
general manager almost six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring left-hander Carlos Perez and infielder Mark
Grudzielanek on Friday night, Lasorda also proved what many critics
thought he could never do. That he was the right man to be GM.
</P>
<P>
   He has been unconventional. From the behind-the-scenes posturing
with Fox to the firing of some longtime and loyal coaches, Lasorda
did the one thing his predecessor Fred Claire could not: breathe
life into a team that just couldn't seem to get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   No one worked harder than Claire, but he never created a team
you wanted to root for. Last winter his hands were tied on many
decisions by Peter O'Malley, who was selling the team to Fox. But
Claire could only bring the team so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers needed something new. Gulp. They needed their old
manager back.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Dodgers players aren't exactly sure what manager
Glenn Hoffman is doing here. They figure Lasorda does everything
from filling out the lineup card to making pitching changes in the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't care. There still are no true leaders on this
team, so they are happy to let Lasorda do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   During his final years as manager, Lasorda appeared tired and
his players did not respond. But the bulldog he displayed for most
of those 20 years has returned as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy who didn't have a telephone answering machine in his
home until last year, he looked pretty natural handling a cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Perez-Grudzielanek deal appeared dead at 2 p.m. Friday, but
Lasorda stayed on it, shuffling prospects, insisting that Wilton
Guerrero be part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called them or they called us maybe 25 times (Friday),'' he
said. ``We needed this deal for now and for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain whether Lasorda will be the GM beyond this year.
Much depends on the showing the Dodgers make in the next two
months. Baltimore's Pat Gillick probably will be available. He's an
L.A. guy with two World Series titles in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   But for this summer, Lasorda did the job.
</P>
<P>
   NO DEAL FOR IRABU : One of the most intriguing sights Friday
night was the Yankees' Hideki Irabu pitching in Seattle against the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was part of the Yankees package in return for Randy
Johnson, except for one small point. When the Yankees acquired the
rights to Irabu last season from San Diego, he came with a no-trade
clause.
</P>
<P>
   That was forgotten until early Friday. No one in the Yankees
organization wanted to tamper with their record season except owner
George Steinbrenner. He actually didn't want Johnson as much as he
wanted Johnson not to go to the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees people convinced Steinbrenner to keep the team
intact, and when the Mariners proposed promising right-hander
Ramiro Mendoza, it was easier to say no.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu pitched seven innings Friday, allowing five hits and three
runs to raise his record to 10-4. After leading the American League
in ERA much of the first half, he is up to a still-impressive 3.23,
but many in the organization think he will never be the dominant
pitcher they thought they got from the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my name mentioned a lot,'' Irabu said after Friday's
victory gave the Yankees a 76-27 record. ``I know it was a complex
situation, but in any situation I try to do my best. This is a
strong team and I wanted to be part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were pleased Johnson was traded to Houston and out
of the American League. They offered the Mariners prospects Ricky
Ledee and Mike Lowell. Cleveland was offering outfielder Brian
Giles, right-hander Dave Burba, infielder Enrique Wilson and a
minor-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle wanted Mendoza and was willing to throw in reliever Mike
Timlin. When the deal fell through, Yankees GM Brian Cashman got on
the car phone with Lasorda to try and get Osuna.
</P>
<P>
   Houston gave up infielder Carlos Guillen and pitching prospect
Freddy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to face Randy now, it will be in the World
Series,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``That's a good sign for
me. I'll take my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   LIGHTENBERG THE CLOSER: With Mark Wohlers unable to throw
strikes, the Atlanta Braves appeared certain to pick up some relief
help at the deadline. Instead, they will go with Kerry Lightenberg,
who has 14 saves, as their closer.
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult week for Lightenberg, who kept hearing on the
clubhouse television that the Braves won't get to the World Series
with him in that role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not necessarily irritated, but I don't want to hear ESPN
cutting me down,'' he said. ``I feel I've been doing a good enough
job. The biggest thing is the inexperience. Everybody feels the
Braves need to get a proven closer or a proven lefty for playoff
time. Hopefully, I can prove everybody wrong if I'm given the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think it matters what happens between now and the
end of the season. If I don't blow a save between now and October,
I don't think it will matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightenberg has built a solid case to remain the closer. He's
blown two saves in 16 opportunities, has a 3.26 ERA and has limited
opposing hitters to a .206 batting average. If it weren't for his
relative lack of experience, there wouldn't be any question who
will be the October closer.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year reliever started to answer the experience
question in two scoreless appearances against the Marlins in the
National League Championship Series last October and says he enjoys
pressure situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for me to say now that October won't be any
different, but every game matters in the postseason,'' he said. ``I
don't get rattled. I think I'll be more focused at playoff time.
I'm just kind of proving my case that I can get the job done. But
if they think they have to go out to get more experience, that's
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   WHERE ARE THEY NOW?Friday also was the one-year anniversary of
the big trade between the Chicago White Sox and San Francisco
Giants. The White Sox were ripped for giving up front-line pitchers
Wilson Alvarez and Roberto Hernandez for six minor-leaguers when
they were still very much in the AL Central race.
</P>
<P>
   Well, history has been kind to Chicago. Alvarez and Hernandez
became free agents and moved on. And the kids the White Sox got in
return have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those six (Mike Caruso, Keith Foulke and Bob Howry) are
on the Sox team now. Another, right-hander Lorenzo Barcelo, is on
the 40-man roster, and left-hander Ken Vining is likely to be added
to the roster next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Barcelo and Caruso were considered the big pickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd never trade Barcelo or Caruso,'' said Giants GM
Brian Sabean, who won the West. ``They were on the untouchable
list. But given our situation and what our team needed, we had to
bite the bullet. That's the thrill of it: We addressed what we
needed to do, and they addressed what they needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   While Caruso has been hitting over .300 as the White Sox
shortstop, Barcelo has pitched very little this year. He reached
Double-A at age 19 last year but had arthroscopic surgery on his
elbow in spring training and only recently began to pitch in the
Arizona League.
</P>
<P>
   But the future is bright. ``His stuff is filthy, hard, nasty,''
said Oakland catcher A.J. Hinch, who has faced him in the minors.
``It's like he places the ball in the strike zone; you could almost
shake hands with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Caruso jumped to the big leagues from Single A last year. He has
had the low points that mark most rookie seasons, committing 23
errors and drawing only five walks thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time he's 24, I think we'll forget about his rookie
season,'' said White Sox scouting director Duane Shaffer. ``He'll
learn the hitters and he'll know when to throw the ball hard and
when to finesse it. When Robin (Ventura) started, he kicked a lot
of balls.'' Ventura committed 25 errors as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez went on to sign with expansion Tampa Bay, a curious
move since he didn't expect to get many save opportunities this
year. Instead, Hernandez has been the one struggling, blowing his
seventh save chance last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays went on to win, but Hernandez's mechanics are
very flawed right now, leaning too far forward on the rubber in his
throwing motion. It also happened earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's similar to what he was doing before,'' manager
Larry Rothschild said. ``But from time to time, closers are going
to go through it. You just don't want to see it three or four times
in a season,'' Rothschild said.
</P>
<P>
   STILL DEALING: Controversial closer Jose Mesa threw a scoreless
inning the day he joined the Giants last week from Cleveland. Mesa
then struck out the side in the 10th inning the next day, getting a
win on Jeff Kent's leadoff homer in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, he was the closer after Robb Nen pitched the previous
two innings. ``I was surprised,'' Mesa said. ``Nen is the man here.
But he (Baker) needed Nen to pitch two innings, and it worked out
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa, who struggled last year in Cleveland after facing a charge
of sexual assault, was happy to hear cheers instead of the
customary jeers he encountered at Jacobs Field. ``It was good, but
the fans didn't bother me in Cleveland _ the way I was pitching
bothered me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser, a former Cleveland teammate who gave Mesa a
strong recommendation, added: ``Robb is the man in San Francisco,
and Jose knows it. But it's outstanding to have a man of
(ITAL)that(END ITAL)! quality backing up a man of (ital)that(END
ITAL) quality.''

FORMER COACHES BACK FOR VISIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Former Angels catcher and manager Buck Rodgers and
former second baseman and coach Bobby Knoop took in Saturday's game
at Edison Field after taking part in pregame ceremonies honoring
Jim Fregosi, who had his number retired.
</P>
<P>
   It was Knoop's first visit to Anaheim Stadium/Edison Field since
he was fired after the 1996 season. For Rodgers, the visit was his
first as a guest of the Angels since he was fired as manager during
the 1994 season. He had been here as a scout with the Phillies
since his firing.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, who received a $25 million settlement as a result of
the 1992 bus crash, said he holds no bitter feelings towards the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me, I don't have bad feelings, he said. ``It
was never was a point that I wanted to manage forever. It was just
the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his firing, Rodgers blamed then-team president
Richard Brown, calling him a cancer in the organization. Rodgers
later learned that the firing was totally general manager Bill
Bavasi's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers also said the current organization under Disney is
nothing like the Angels of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't mean it's bad, he said. ``I think the change is
for the good. Not only on the field but money-making potential,
everything else. Times change.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you also have to be careful not to run too fast. You still
have to think about the individual fan. Don't just snub him. He's
still the backbone. Go with the flow, but don't forget where you
came from.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels retired uniform No. 11 in a ceremony before
Saturday's game in honor of Fregosi, the former Angels shortstop
and manager.
</P>
<P>
   Fregosi played with the original Angels in 1961 and remained
with the team through 1971 when he was traded to the Mets in a deal
for Nolan Ryan. In his 18-year playing career, Fregosi hit .265,
and he managed the Angels to their first division title in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize what is means to a player to have their
number retired, Fregosi said. ``No matter what happens, I can have
my children and grandchildren come to the stadium see my number up
there. I'll always have special place in my heart for the Angels
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The other numbers retired by the Angels are 30 (Ryan), 50
(Jimmie Reese), 26 (Gene Autry), 29 (Rod Carew) and 42 (Jackie
Robinson).
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson's club-record hitting streak came to an end
Saturday with a 0-for-4 performance. He went 0-for-3 against Pedro
Martinez and 0-for-1 against reliever Derek Lowe. Anderson struck
out, grounded to second, flied to left and grounded to the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter, Anderson said. ``I'm not upset by anything.
It just didn't happen today. You move on to the next day. That's
how I've been approaching it all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real proud of the way he went about the streak, manager
Terry Collins said. ``He got a lot of hits, but the way he came to
play was as important as the streak. I told him to go out and start
another one tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The streak is the longest in the majors this season and is tied
for fifth longest in 10 years. The only hitting streaks longer than
28 since 1988 are 30 by Jerome Walton (1989), Nomar Garciaparra
(1997) and Sandy Alomar (1997), and 29 by Hal Morris (1996).
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Matt Walbeck left after Saturday's game to join his wife
Stephenie in Sacramento. The couple is expecting their first child.
Walbeck will miss today's game against the Red Sox, meaning utility
infielder Paco Martin will serve as a backup catcher to Phil Nevin.
Martin has never caught in a game at any level before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be fine, he's got good hands, said Collins, who then
added, ``But the chances are he'll never catch.
</P>

THOMAS RYAN, 97, CHICAGO'S IRISH ICON  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They played ``Danny Boy'' for Tommie Ryan the other day, and how
could they not? In the three-quarters of a century since he arrived
in Chicago with his fiddle, a wiry 22-year-old refugee from the
Irish nationalist rebellion and 14 months in a British prison camp,
Thomas F. Ryan had played the same sad strains in sunshine and in
shadow at more than 1,000 funerals.
</P>
<P>
   And when Ryan, long Chicago's best known and most beloved Irish
icon, died on July 26 at 97 at his son Tom's home in suburban Park
Ridge, the only question was whether the violin strains at his own
funeral on Thursday would be drowned out by the skirl of bagpipes.
</P>
<P>
   For as Ryan often recalled, he had not been in Chicago four
years before he and two friends had founded the Shannon Rovers, a
bagpipe marching band that has since become one of Chicago's most
famous musical groups, not to mention something akin to the house
orchestra for the local Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Rovers have played for every president
from Franklin D. Roosevelt on, and they lead Chicago's annual St.
Patrick's Day Parade, which, not surprisingly, is another of Ryan's
legacies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, dismayed that Chicago had not celebrated St. Patrick's
Day properly since 1898, Ryan organized a parade through his West
Side neighborhood. Four years later, after a similar parade had
been started on the South Side, Mayor Richard A. Daley brought them
together downtown, and the Rovers have led the parade ever since,
with Ryan marching at the fore into his 80s.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Ryan taught many of the band members to play the
bagpipes, no mean feat for a man who mastered the fiddle as a
youngster but had to wait until he became a streetcar conductor in
Chicago to learn to play the bagpipes _ from an accommodating
Scotsman who had formed a similar band.
</P>
<P>
   As Ryan never tired of recalling, bagpipes had long been banned
in Ireland by British rulers who had learned the hard way that the
music could stir the blood and spur rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's personal rebellion began, by his own account, when the
Black and Tans, the British force sent in to suppress the 1919
nationalist revolt, beat up his mother in her farmhouse in
Limerick. Ryan joined the Flying Column of Middle Limerick of the
Irish Republican Army, and he recalled blowing up bridges and
felling trees to block the path of advancing troops as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   After his capture, the British took him on a long boat ride
around Ireland, gave him one grim night in the Dublin jail, where
the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising had been slain, then sent him
to the Curragh prison camp in County Kildare, where Ryan, ever the
optimist, promptly joined a group of prisoners who spent 10 months
digging an escape tunnel with knives and forks.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 prisoners escaped, Ryan said, but on the night he was
to have made his crawl to freedom, a heavyset prisoner got stuck in
the tunnel ahead of him, and by the time he was pulled out, ``the
game was up.''
</P>
<P>
   Released after the treaty that created the Irish Free State in
1922, Ryan, following an older brother, went to Chicago and began
making his legend. After 20 years as a streetcar conductor and bus
driver, plum jobs that earned him more than policemen and firemen
got, he recalled, he operated a popular tavern for a few years in
the 1940s. He sold that and began a suburban phase, building a
house on 25 acres in Wooddale, in part to be close to his new job
as a state snowplow operator.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who later returned to Chicago, never held a party position
higher than volunteer precinct captain, but under the patronage
system operated by the original Daley, or ``His Lordship,'' as Ryan
styled him, he never had to look far for a job, either. When he
retired in 1969 to become a private building contractor, his title
was stationary engineer for the Metropolitan Water Reclamation
District.
</P>
<P>
   As he grew older, Ryan became an increasingly popular figure,
one whose sense of humor never flagged. At a cemetery after a
funeral not long ago, when a friend said he was 92, Ryan replied,
``You might as well stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   After the death of his wife, Julia, in 1987, he lived alone for
a while, but Ryan, the last of 10 children, loved company so much
he later divided his time among various of his seven children:
Sheila Wisniewski, Marie Auer and Bob, Tom, John, Jerry and Ed
Ryan. All of them live in or around Chicago, as do most of his 21
grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to say good-bye to the man who had played
``Danny Boy'' at more than 1,000 funerals, it was a son, John, and
a grandson, Robert Emmett Ryan, who joined in a violin duet at St.
Juliana Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Not that his Shannon Rovers were denied. They were out in kilted
force, piping Ryan's coffin into and out of the church and later to
his grave at a cemetery in suburban Hillside.

GORDON TURNS BRICKS TO GOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Jeff Gordon says it is hard for him to put a
proper historical perspective on his second Brickyard 400 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good about covers it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it feels like to win it one time,'' said Gordon,
who won the inaugural NASCAR Winston Cup race at the 2.5-mile
Indianapolis Motor Speedway in August 1994, and became its first
repeat champion yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inaugural race was awesome. This one blows me away,'' said
Gordon, who added to his Winston Cup points lead and Swiss bank
account at the expense of championship rivals Mark Martin and Dale
Jarrett. ``Funny how you just get that feeling sometimes. We had
the same type of combination this time we had in 1994 _ good
horsepower and a good handling car. It's amazing how when it's your
day, it's your day.''
</P>
<P>
   Or in Gordon's case, another day in the life.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when he led the race's most laps (97), Gordon confessed
that he and crew chief Ray Evernham were a couple of nervous
wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when title contender Jeremy Mayfield had worked into
second place, he blew a tire and smacked the Turn 1 wall.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Jarrett arguably had the fastest hot rod on the
track, he inexplicably ran out of fuel after building a four-second
lead over Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Martin had Gordon in his gunsights, he could not
use two late-race restarts after cautions to barge into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that God was looking over me again,'' Gordon said,
``because it seems like everything was just like clockwork. The
guys we had to beat kept having problems, and it was an incredible
day.''
</P>
<P>
   And incredibly profitable. In addition to his race-winnings of
$637,625 from the record purse of $5,506,581, Gordon also became
the first driver to claim the $1 million Winston No Bull 5 bonus.
Gordon's total of $1,637,625 is an all-time motorsports record
single-day payout. The previous record was $1,568,150 pocketed by
Arie Luyendyk for winning the 1997 Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who has 35 career Cup victories, also raised his career
Cup earnings to $20,297,547, second only to seven-time champion
Dale Earnhardt's $32,401,950.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, Gordon's series-leading sixth of the year, was his
second in a row and third in four races. It allowed him to add 10
points to his lead over Martin in the driver's championship, worth
another $2 million at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe days like today become reality,'' said Gordon,
who won the race under a yellow flag after Jimmy Spencer's crash
between turns 1 and 2 brought out the record ninth and final
caution on lap 156 of 160. The race had boiled down to a one-on-one
between Gordon and Martin, who had whittled Gordon's lead to 2.273
seconds when 1997 Brickyard winner Ricky Rudd and rookie Steve Park
brought out a caution on lap 149.
</P>
<P>
   When the race went green on a single-file restart on lap 154,
Gordon, Martin and Bobby Labonte _ all eligible for the $1 million
bonus _ were bumper-to-bumper. But Gordon's restart was flawless
and he was stretching his lead when Spencer crashed, courtesy of
contact from the car of Jeff Green.
</P>
<P>
   It took two laps to clean the debris, leaving Gordon and Martin
to deal with another single-file restart on lap 158. But as the
field picked up steam down the Speedway's long front straight, a
crash involving Rudd, Chad Little, Green, Joe Nemechek and Jerry
Nadeau broke out in mid-pack. Gordon and Martin knew they would be
racing back to the yard of bricks at the start/finish line for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's tough,'' said Gordon, driver of the No. 24 DuPont
Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``He really made a run
for me coming into Turn 2. I saw him driving into Turn 2 deeper
than anybody had been driving in there all week long. He got right
on my bumper. I didn't want to look in my mirror because I wanted
to focus on what was going on in front of me. I could feel him
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we came off the corner, I could see him in my mirror and
saw how he faded back.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who began the day trailing Gordon by 62 points and ended
it 72 back after 19 of 33 events, said he threw everything he had
at the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we wound up second,'' said Martin, driver of the No. 6
Valvoline Ford Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Jeff's car was faster than ours on fresh tires,
cool tires _ and probably hot tires,'' said Martin, who has
finished second in three consecutive races. ``I tried to frustrate
him, but I just didn't have enough to put the squeeze on him. It
looked like I was gaining, but I don't know how much he was playing
with me. It's hard to beat a man who's got a faster car and the
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who ran third in the No. 18 Interstate Batteries
Pontiac Grand Prix, cryptically chimed in: ``I think (Gordon) had a
faster car than me on pit road, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That especially was true during a stop on lap 119 under yellow.
Gordon's crew needed only 16.6 seconds to change four tires and
refuel. Martin's stop went awry, however, when a lug nut glued onto
the right front tire fell off _ keeping him in the pits for 21.6
exasperating seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a deficit even the tenacious Martin was not about to make
up on this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so overwhelmed right now,'' Gordon said. ``Every day seems
to get better.''

NEW RANGERS ELATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Todd Zeile has referred to his recent trade
to the Rangers as ``the light at the end of the tunnel.'' For Royce
Clayton and Todd Stottlemyre, being traded to the Rangers is a
chance to get out of the shadows of a home-run chase and get into a
heated pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   The three newest Rangers, acquired Friday before baseball's
nonwaiver trade deadline, reported yesterday to The Ballpark in
Arlington and slowly soaked up the feeling of being on a team that
is battling for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be part of an organization that is trying to
better itself,'' said Clayton, the new starting shortstop. ``This
team showed they will do what it takes to help the ballclub _ not
to say they needed help, because I personally felt like Texas had a
great team to start with.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton and Stottlemyre came to the Rangers from St. Louis for
third baseman Fernando Tatis and pitcher Darren Oliver. The
Cardinals might have the game's biggest road show with Mark
McGwire's pursuit of Roger Maris' home-run record. But for
Stottlemyre, the trade offered excitement, considering that the
Rangers are battling Anaheim for first place in the American League
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go from a club that was 131/2 games out to a club that's in
the pennant race,'' Stottlemyre said. ``From that standpoint it's
pretty exciting. For the next two months, going out and pitching
with that kind of pressure, it's what every player wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, a right-hander, will get his first start Tuesday
against Toronto, while Clayton and third baseman Zeile stepped into
the lineup last night and filled the left side of the Rangers'
infield. They made an immediate impact, as Clayton singled in the
first inning, stole second and scored the Rangers' first run on a
single by Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile _ who singled again to score Rusty Greer and later homered
_ showed that he's ready to get in this pennant chase after a long,
interesting season. Earlier this season, after buying a home in Los
Angeles, Zeile was traded from the Dodgers to the Florida Marlins
in the Mike Piazza deal. He continued to be the subject of trade
rumors until Friday, when he was sent to the seventh team of a
big-league career that began in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the original trade happened, I was obviously
disappointed,'' Zeile said. ``But the goal apparently was to turn
around and trade me, so I felt there was a chance I would end up in
a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of rumors, but this place always seemed like
the best choice for me.''

EDWARD F. EDINGER, 75, LEADING JUNGIAN ANALYST  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Edward F. Edinger, a leading Jungian analyst
whose books on the interplay between symbols and psychology carried
the concepts of Carl Jung to a new generation of American analysts,
died on July 17 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was bladder cancer, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said he was the most influential Jungian analyst in
the United States from the 1950s until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Edinger believed that many neuroses were associated with the
decline of religion and the dominance of science. He thought it was
important for the afflicted to grasp elements of religion,
philosophy, literature and even alchemy to heal and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He taught that the goal in analysis was for the ego to
establish contact with a greater personality within the psyche, to
strengthen the ego-self axis,'' said Dr. George R. Elder, a friend
and therapist in Ocean Ridge, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Edinger taught that people with neuroses or psychoses could
benefit from an awareness of their spiritual and creative
dimensions and from thinking in terms of the archetypes that
artists and sages use. For Jungians, the term archetype refers to
categories within the collective unconscious that often appear as
literary or religious images of, for example, the Great Mother or
the Spiritual Father.
</P>
<P>
   Edinger looked ahead to an age when the ideas of Jung would heal
a broken world, and once said, ``Jung's psychology offers not only
a method for the psychological healing of individuals but also a
new world view for Western man which holds out the possibility for
healing the split in the contemporary collective psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Edinger predicted that the world would one day turn to
Jung for a hopeful view of things after an impending eruption of
``chaos in vast proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Edinger gave Jung's writings _ done ``in a German-Swiss flavor''
_ an American accent, using ``Moby Dick,'' for example, to show the
need for healing the split between the ego and the self.
</P>
<P>
   His final work, to be published in 1999 by Open Court Publishing
Company and edited by Elder, analyzes the Book of Revelation as a
psychological text.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other books were ``Ego and Archetype: Individuation
and the Religious Function of the Psyche'' (1972), ``Anatomy of the
Psyche: Alchemical Symbolism in Psychotherapy'' (1968) and
``Creation of Consciousness'' (1995), all published by C.G. Jung
Foundation Books.
</P>
<P>
   Edinger was a supervising psychiatrist at Rockland State
Hospital in Orangeburg, N.Y., and later was a founding member of
the C.G. Jung Foundation, in Manhattan, and the C.G. Jung Institute
of New York. He was the institute's president from 1968 to 1979,
when he moved to Los Angeles. There, he continued his practice for
19 years and became a senior analyst at the C.G. Jung Institute of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and received his B.A. in
chemistry at Indiana University and his M.D. from Yale University
in 1946. He was a medical officer in the U.S. Army in Panama. In
1951 in New York, he began analysis with M. Esther Harding, who had
been an associate of Jung.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Frances McCarthy ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Dianne D. Cordic; a brother, Robert
F. Edinger, of Bedford, Ind.; two children from his first marriage,
Clara Jendrowski, of Lockport, N.Y., and Dr. Bruce Edinger, of
Salem, W.Va.; and two grandchildren.

Hall of Famer Singletary pays tribute to those who shaped his life
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CANTON, Ohio _ While he sat on the stage with his fellow enshrinees
moments before Saturday's induction ceremonies at the Pro Football
Hall of Fame, Mike Singletary thought about one of the most
important days of his life.
</P>
<P>
   As he listened to induction speeches by Tommy McDonald, Paul
Krause, Anthony Munoz and Dwight Stephenson, Singletary remembered
a day 27 years ago when he was growing up in Houston, the youngest
of 10 children.
</P>
<P>
   Two older brothers had died, and his parents had divorced.
Singletary was 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a ghetto boy trying to figure out who I was and where I
would go,'' Singletary said. ``I had no confidence or self-esteem.
I'd been listening to everyone in the neighborhood tell me that no
one got out, and I wouldn't, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day, my mom sat me down and told me what I needed to
hear. She said, `Son, there's greatness in you, and you have to
find it and bring it out.' She introduced me to my Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ. She told me that all things are possible if you take
God with you. And on that day, my mom asked me if I could become
the man of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in my room and wrote down my goals. I wanted to get a
college scholarship, become an All-American, earn my degree and get
drafted by an NFL team so I could buy my mom a house and take care
of her for the rest of her life. That's the day my life began.''
</P>
<P>
   From a 12-year-old standing at a crossroads in a Houston ghetto,
Singletary went on to become the greatest player in Baylor
University history and one of the greatest for the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Now 39 and a father of seven, Singletary stepped to the podium
at 2121 George Halas Drive on Saturday, and in the audience were
his mother, father, brothers and sisters, all of whom patiently
encouraged him as a child and wildly cheered him as he was
immortalized with the greatest players in pro football history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out I had made the Hall of Fame, I said a selfish
prayer,'' Singletary said. ``I asked God to allow my mom and dad to
be at my induction. They went through some hard times, but they've
given me so much. I'm here because of a tremendous investment by so
many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Singletary became the first wife to present her husband
before thousands of fans and a national television audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I retired, I was asked in an interview that if, in five
years, I made the Hall of Fame, who would be my presenter?''
Singletary said. ``I thought about those who had played such an
important role in my career, coaches like Grant Teaff, Buddy Ryan
and Mike Ditka. But they saw me at my best all the time. I wanted
to pick someone who knew me at my best and worst and still loved
me. That someone would be my mom or my wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I couldn't have my mom go to the podium. She's more
emotional than me, and the other guys wouldn't even get a chance to
speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Singletary thanked those who played such an important role in
his life and career. He made special mention of his coaches and
teachers at Worthing; Grant Teaff and Corky Nelson, his head coach
and defensive coordinator at Baylor; and his coaches in Chicago _
Ditka, Ryan and Vince Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary also credited the late Tom Williams, who owned
restaurants and a fitness and rehabilitation business in Houston.
Williams also served as Singletary's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Williams taught me how to stand up and prepare for life,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming the first three-time All-America selection in
Baylor history, Singletary played 12 years for Chicago. He earned
10 trips to the Pro Bowl, won a Super Bowl ring with the 1985
Bears, was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1985 and 1988
and NFL Man of the Year in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best experiences of my life was going to Baylor,''
he said. ``I learned so much from coach Teaff. He took me under his
wing and taught me to be a student-athlete and a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing for coach Ditka in Chicago meant there was something
exciting every day. The thing I appreciate about him was his
consistency. You always knew where you stood with him. He read
books on how to relax, but he couldn't do it. He tried to be nice,
but he couldn't do that, either. But you always knew where you
stood.''
</P>
<P>
   During his induction speech, Singletary looked to the tent where
previous enshrinees sat. He mentioned one player in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young boy in Houston, I'd turn on the television and
watch Willie Lanier,'' he said about the Kansas City great who was
the first black middle linebacker in the NFL. ``He was my role
model. I thought I'd love to hit like him because he brings the
whole house.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Krause, Munoz and Stephenson, Singletary got more than he
expected Saturday when McDonald, the Philadelphia Eagles receiver
who was recommended by the veterans committee and voted in after a
24-year wait, put on the wildest induction performance in history.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, still super-hyper at 64, has been on cloud nine ever
since he found out he had made it. He carried a briefcase to the
podium, pulled out a tape player and played ``Staying Alive'' over
the speaker system as he danced around the stage. Then, he asked
the other enshrinees to join him at the podium, where he jumped and
bumped chests with each of them.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, at 5-9 and 172 pounds, became the smallest player to
be enshrined. He walked over to his bronze bust, which weighs 25
pounds, tossed it into the air twice and caught it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supposed to have good hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The moment that produced the most tears Saturday occurred with
Krause at the podium. He played his first four seasons with
Washington and the last 12 with Minnesota. The free safety played
in four Super Bowls with the Vikings and is the NFL's career
interception leader with 81.
</P>
<P>
   About 2{ years ago, Krause's wife of 35 years, Pam, was
seriously injured in a automobile wreck. She was in a coma 5{
months after suffering a brain-stem injury. Although she has made
tremendous progress, she must use a wheelchair and has trouble
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   As Krause talked about members of his family who were present,
he asked them to stand. As they stood, Pam Krause struggled to
stand, too, and she did briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors told us she wouldn't live,'' Krause said. ``When
Pam could talk, she said God wanted her to live so she could be
part of this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Krause looked down at his wife in the audience and said,
``Honey, you were right.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a dry eye in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz, the Cincinnati offensive tackle who became the first
player voted to 11 consecutive Pro Bowls, was presented by his son,
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Munoz turned 17 Friday. He is entering his junior year
at Moeller High School in Cincinnati. Like his father, he plays
left tackle, but there is one difference: His father played at 6-6
and 290 pounds. His son already is 6-7, 320.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, Michael's farther along than I was as a sophomore
in college,'' Munoz said.

Astros' Lima foils Pirates 2-1
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PITTSBURGH _ To label Jose Lima as emotional would be like accusing
the Pope of being Catholic. Some things just go without saying.
</P>
<P>
   But Lima was wound tighter than usual Saturday afternoon when he
stood on the mound at Three Rivers Stadium. Nonetheless, he
delivered a message that he hoped the Astros' coaching staff and
front office would receive loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   The high-strung righthander tossed his second complete game in a
row and willed the Astros to a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh
Pirates on the eve of Randy Johnson's Astros debut.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret one of the current starters will lose his spot in
the rotation when Johnson arrives on the scene, and Lima wants to
be sure he's not the one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed what kind of a starting pitcher I am,'' Lima said.
``I know Randy Johnson is coming here, and I'm glad he's coming.
But I hope I sent a message out there. I hope they don't move me
(to the bullpen).''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are Lima dodged that bullet with a five-hit performance
that came on the heels of a six-hitter in his previous outing.
Pirates starter Jason Schmidt was stingy, too, but he wasn't able
to outlast Lima on a day when Lima refused to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Lima (10-6) gave up his only run in the second inning, and
Schmidt allowed his lone run in the fifth. The Astros broke the
stalemate in the eighth when Pirates reliever Ricardo Rincon walked
pinch hitter Ricky Gutierrez with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky had a good at-bat against Rincon, and that's not easy to
do,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``Rincon is tough because
he makes good pitches and doesn't throw the ball right over the
plate. Ricky was able to be patient, and we ended up getting the
winning run out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   With a one-run lead to protect and Lima's pitch count rising,
Dierker ordered Scott Elarton and Trever Miller to start working in
the bullpen. The mere sight of that seemed to motivate Lima, who
got a visit on the mound from Dierker after Turner Ward reached on
a two-out double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there because (catcher) Brad (Ausmus) had looked
over to the dugout, and I thought his body language was signaling
that Jose was losing it,'' Dierker said. ``But once I got out
there, Brad told me that he was just reminding Jose to relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Fine.' No one had hit the ball hard against him, so I
decided to let him stay out there. He was getting close to 120
pitches, and he hadn't gone past that this year, so I was a little
concerned, but not much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing his lease was getting shorter, Lima turned up his focus
and recorded an inning-ending strikeout against Mark Smith. The
25-year-old Dominican pitcher showed his excitement by making a
celebratory gesture while facing the Pirates' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got out of that inning, there was no stopping him,''
Astros shortstop Tim Bogar said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the Pirates and opposing teams feel Lima is
showing them up when he displays emotion on the mound, Bogar didn't
hesitate with his answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they do,'' he said. ``But that's just the way he is,
and you don't understand it unless you play with him. It's just
pure emotion. He doesn't mean any harm; he's just happy about what
he's doing. He's the kind of guy you love to hate when you're
playing against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Astros, Lima was on their side Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lima retired 27 of the 34 batters he faced and had 10
strikeouts, one shy of his career high. He only allowed two batters
to reach base after the third inning, and Ward was the only one who
moved into scoring position. Lima sat down all four batters he
faced after Dierker's visit to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had everything going,'' said Lima, who joined Shane Reynolds
(12) and Sean Bergman (10) as Astros pitchers to reach double
figures in wins this season. ``I just felt so good. Brad settled me
down after the second inning, and from there I just felt great. My
slider and my changeup were really working for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Dierker) came out there, I told him that I was going to
finish the game. I told him I wanted to finish what I had started.
After they scored that run in the second, I was able to relax and
keep my team in the game, and that's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Pirates right fielder Jose Guillen led off the second with a
single and scored on Lou Collier's double to left. The Astros put
runners in scoring position in three of the first four innings but
didn't get on the board until Derek Bell singled home Craig Biggio
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they were both pitching, you had to figure it was
going to be a close game,'' said Bell, who had two hits and raised
his batting average to .328. ``After a while, you could tell that
whoever got a lead was probably going to stay on top. We were able
to break through, and Lima kept them off balance. Those are the
kinds of games you have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the way Lima approached it, even if he had other
motives in mind.

SWIMMER FINDS MOTIVATION _ AND A WORLD RECORD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ In 1996 in Atlanta, Penny Heyns became the
first female swimmer to win both breast-stroke gold medals in one
Olympics. Last January in Perth, Australia, no longer unbeatable,
she finished fifth and sixth in the same races in the world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is back to her Olympic heights. Here, in the Goodwill
Games, she won her six breast-stroke races. In Saturday night's
100-meter breast-stroke, she swam the first 50 meters in 30.95
seconds, the first world record that will be recognized for 50
meters and the first world record in swimming of these Goodwill
Games.
</P>
<P>
   The International Swimming Federation decided in January to
recognize 50-meter records for the breast-stroke, backstroke and
butterfly for the first time, if they bettered the previous
best-ever times. The previous best for the 50-meter breast-stroke
was 31.58 seconds by Silke Hoerner of East Germany in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Heyns, a 23-year-old South African, and how she
overcame it, is a lesson in how roadblocks strike even the best
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Penelope Heyns (pronounced haines) is 5 feet 7 inches, 139
pounds, disciplined and gifted. At the University of Nebraska, she
was coached by an assistant, Jan Bidrmann, a Czech defector who had
swum and coached in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After her Olympic triumphs, the foundation collapsed. Bidrmann
moved to Calgary, Alberta, as head coach at Canada's main training
complex for swimmers. Heyns, with no remaining eligibility, kept
training at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a different coach,'' she said, ``and tried a lot of
different things. It was difficult for him because it was his first
season as a coach. Sometimes it was a case of me making too many
decisions. And a lot of the time, I was in South Africa, always
stopping and starting. I thought I could do things on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she changed her training regimen. ``A lot of
guesswork was involved,'' she said, ``and when I got to Perth, I
was second-guessing everything. When I got on the block, I was
hoping what I did would work. That doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Lincoln, Neb., determined to be a winner again.
She hit a dead end. ``I would go to the pool every day,'' she said.
``I would put on my suit, and I couldn't get into the water. I
would be out on the deck and watch everyone else work and then I
would go home. I was real tired mentally. I couldn't find a reason
why I should carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, she said, she found a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started praying about it,'' she said. ``I wanted to hear,
`You can go home and get on with your business.' But the Lord told
me to go to Calgary. I went home and took eight weeks off. I didn't
go near the pool. If doors had opened to me to do something, I
would have done it. They didn't, and I realized I had to go to
Calgary. After Easter, I went back to Lincoln, then drove to
Calgary and started swimming again with Jan.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she lives and trains in Calgary and competes often. ``I'm
very happy,'' she said. ``In college, if I swam well I was happy,
and if I didn't I was unhappy. Today, I feel my life isn't about
swimming. Life is more than that.''

AFTER KWAN'S VICTORY, THE ONLY THING CERTAIN IS MORE CHANGE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Michelle Kwan's victory Saturday night at the
Goodwill Games marked the end of the figure skating season and the
beginning of the annual summer square dance of changing partners,
coaches, rules and career paths.
</P>
<P>
   Although she fell on a triple loop, Kwan skated with the
enthusiasm she lacked at the Olympics, easily won the long program
with marks of 5.9 for presentation, and received a standing ovation
from the 10,558 at Nassau Coliseum, including the former President
Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalyn. Maria Butyrskaya of Russia
finished second and Victoria Volchkova of Russia finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sport's attention turns to the International Skating
Union's efforts to extend its control and to stop the flight of its
stars from the Olympic ranks before they are even old enough to get
a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   The last two women's Olympic champions, Oksana Baiul and Tara
Lipinski, renounced their Olympic eligibility at ages 16 and 15,
respectively. To prevent this, the ISU has proposed a two-track
career path that would allow Olympic-style skaters to perform in
more pro-am events without losing their Olympic eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   One path consists of Olympic-style competitions such as Skate
America, the national championships and the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   The second path consists of 8 to 10 pro-am events that would
limit the number of jumps and contain a long program with an
emphasis on artistry and musical interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   This could potentially create regular matchups between
Olympic-style skaters like Kwan and so-called professionals like
Lipinski, Baiul and Kristi Yamaguchi. The pro-ams would also
satisfy the television networks' desire for more legitimate
professional competitions following declining ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic-style skaters would be free to compete on both career
tracks at the same time. Kwan and Todd Eldredge could,
theoretically, avoid the pounding of Olympic-style competition for
three years and then return in 2002 and be eligible to compete in
the Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The money on both paths is about the same, with the top skaters
earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. But the ISU has
still not sanctioned a group of professional events as pro-ams, and
the next season begins in a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the professional circuit is not under ISU control.
And it remains to be seen how willingly professionals like
Lipinski, Yamaguchi and Brian Boitano will accede to the ISU's
demands to use its own judges, which the international federation
believes is necessary to preserve the integrity of any competition.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Burg, who is Lipinski's agent, said the pro-am competitions
would not have legitimacy unless they offered prize money instead
of appearance fees. He questioned whether ISU judges would favor
Olympic-eligible skaters over Olympic-ineligible skaters. He also
said he was concerned about a conflict of interest involving the
International Management Group, which is the marketing arm for the
ISU but also controls professional events and serves as the agent
for such skaters as Yamaguchi, Scott Hamilton and Eldredge.
</P>
<P>
   Burg said that the ISU and International Management Group seem
more concerned with control and with protecting their
self-interests than with improving the sport. ``They are trying to
get rid of professional skating as it is known for control
purposes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ISU, meanwhile, complains that Burg prematurely persuaded
Lipinski to turn professional so that she could participate in
events created or controlled by himself and his associates.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski is committed to an exclusive prime-time deal with CBS
this season for two professional competitions. Both she and Kwan
are under contract to compete in a pro-am in Daytona, Fla., in
October. Kwan intends to retain her Olympic eligibility, but has
committed only to the October pro-am next season.
</P>
<P>
   Burg said that once other pro-am competitions are arranged, he
would entertain offers that do not conflict with Lipinski's
obligations to CBS. ``If the right event is there to compete
against Michelle, I'm sure she'd do it,'' Burg said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact reasons for the breakup between Lipinski and her
coach, Richard Callaghan, remain unclear. ``I always got along
great with Tara,'' Callaghan said. ``I'm really proud she
accomplished her goal. After the Olympics, our logic of skating was
different, our ideas were different. It seemed better to go our
separate ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Lipinski's decision to turn professional, Callaghan
said, ``I felt she probably should have waited a little longer to
make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As for competing against Kwan, he said: ``I don't think Tara
ever had a problem competing against whoever. I think there were
decisions made for her that she went along with.''

FUELISH MISTAKE FOR JARRETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Dale Jarrett's Ford won the 1996 Brickyard 400
with Robert Yates' trademark horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   That same horsepower carried Jarrett into the lead of NASCAR's
richest Winston Cup race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
yesterday, before an embarrassing fuel-mileage miscalculation ended
his shot at a second victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett saw a lead that grew to as much as 4.232 seconds over
eventual winner Jeff Gordon evaporate like the inside of his
22-gallon fuel cell just past the halfway mark of the 160-lap
event. Jarrett's disabled car limped onto pit road, where it was
met by members of his crew, and teammate Kenny Irwin Jr.'s, on the
dead run.
</P>
<P>
   By time the winded crewmen pushed the No. 88 Quality Care
Service//Ford Credit Taurus into Jarrett's pit for fuel and tires,
he had gone four laps down. Jarrett gathered himself and used track
position on a series of yellow flags to get back onto the lead lap
by the end of the day. But a 16th-place finish was small
consolation, considering that Jarrett was one of five drivers
eligible to win the first Winston No Bull 5 $1 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   That cash went to Gordon, who also stretched his championship
points lead over third-place Jarrett to 121 after 19 of 33 races.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett stated the obvious before quickly exiting Gasoline
Alley: He had a great race car. It ran out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to expand on the miscue, Jarrett said, ``I drive the race
car. I come in when they tell me to come in and that's all that I
do. We ran out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation crew chief Todd Parrott purposely had
stretched Jarrett's run past the 80-lap mark so he could collect
the $10,000 check awarded to the halfway leader. Yates said that
while that money is nice, Parrott never would chance running out of
fuel to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing in any of those guys steps,'' Yates said,
defensively. ``They've won a lot of races and I'm sure they're
kicking themselves a hell of a lot more than I'm going to kick them
Monday morning. I'm not going to kick them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys that worked on that car are smart enough to get a car
that good, they're certainly smart enough to figure out not to let
that happen again.'' TIRES DOOM MAYFIELD, WALLACE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Penske-Kranefuss teammates Jeremy Mayfield and Rusty Wallace saw
their victory hopes shredded by two blown right front Goodyear
Eagle radial tires. Ironically, they ended up swapping positions in
the points chase.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield dropped from fourth to fifth in the driver's
championship after recording a season-worst 42nd-place finish.
Mayfield was running second to Gordon when a right front tire blew
running through Turn 1, sending Mayfield hard into the wall.
Mayfield's No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford suffered extensive right-side damage
and was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty tough,'' said Mayfield, who fell 68 points behind
teammate Wallace and 361 behind leader Gordon. ``It would have been
different if I was running 30th and couldn't keep up. But we're
sitting there running second and biding our time and then fall
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace rallied for an eighth-place finish after limping into
the pits on lap 62 with a flat right front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tight all day long. We were tearing up inside edges of
right front tires,'' said Wallace, driver of the No. 2 Miller Lite
Ford. ``Too tight. That was killing my speed off the corner, and
that's the reason we fell back to eighth. But I really feel like we
had a good top-three, four or five car.'' THRILL RETURNS FOR
WALTRIP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Cup champion Darrell Waltrip is stuck in 13th _ but
hardly complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Making his debut for team owner Tim Beverley of Texas, Waltrip
recorded his fourth consecutive 13th-place finish yesterday.
Waltrip, who completed his run as substitute driver for injured
rookie Steve Park at Pocono Raceway last Sunday, genuinely was
pleased with his debut effort in the No. 35 Tabasco Chevrolet Monte
Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 43rd to 13th, that's 30 cars we passed and that's a
pretty good day,'' said Waltrip, who used his past champion's
provisional to make the field. ``Traffic was the big thing. The car
was a little pushy in traffic, but when I got clear I could really
mow.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip said crew chief Phil Hammer gave him an excellent car.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we had some pretty good pit stops,'' said Waltrip, who
sold his team to Beverley in March. ``We had good pit strategy. I'm
thrilled. We were thinking if we came here and just had a top-25
we'd be happy. You can imagine how we feel right now.'' &QL; 
NUTS AND BOLTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Indianapolis 500 champion Arie Luyendyk was released
from Methodist Hospital yesterday morning after overnight
observation for a concussion suffered during the International Race
of Champions finale Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cup driver Jimmy Spencer spent last night at Methodist Hospital
for observation after suffering a concussion in a crash on lap 155.
He was listed in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Pole sitter Ernie Irvan was the lone driver of a Pontiac Grand
Prix to lead the race. He paced 25 laps en route to a sixth-place
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's winning average speed of 126.770 mph is the slowest in
event history. The previous low was Ricky Rudd's 130.828 mph last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon led four times for 97 laps, an event record. He set the
previous record by leading 93 laps en route to victory in 1994.
Gordon led the final 34 laps yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin scored his 10th consecutive top-10 finish. He has
finished sixth or better in the past four Brickyard 400s.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elliott and Ken Schrader are the only drivers to have
finished all 160 laps of each of the five Brickyards.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one cars were running at the finish, an event-record 24
of them on the lead lap. The previous record was 23 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last-place finisher Kenny Wallace completed 65 laps, an event
record for futility. The previous record was 17 by Elton Sawyer in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The 34 laps run under caution is an event record, topping the
previous total of 25 in 1994 and 1997.

CLINTON TRIES TO CONTROL HIS PARALLEL PRESIDENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for quotes, new dateline, updating)   (See also CLINTON-HAMPTONS)  
(HLW) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ As President Clinton travels the country
these days talking policy and politics and raising money, it is as
if there are parallel presidencies under way: the stormy one
portrayed in news accounts, which is clouded by talk of DNA testing
on a party dress and of possible impeachment proceedings, and the
sunny one that Clinton publicly inhabits, which Saturday was all
health-care politicking, golf and fund-raising among the
well-heeled of the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Through more than five years in office, Clinton has seemed to
travel in his own climatic zone, regardless of what bad news was
thundering nearby. But never has that zone seemed quite so small,
and so starkly at variance with the prevailing system, as it does
now.
</P>
<P>
   The bags under his eyes look as overpacked as ever, but Clinton
never seems other than calm and confident in public. Some of his
aides, however, betray a little uncertainty about which presidency
will ultimately carry the day this time. They excoriate reporters
as having already made up their minds that Clinton has not been
honest in denying a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky; but
they simultaneously take comfort in polls showing that while most
people think Clinton lied about the relationship, they do not much
care.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton travels, many of the people who come into contact
with him share, or at least adopt, his sunny outlook. Crowds still
go wild for him: one woman who shook his hand at the Westhampton
airport called it ``the experience of my life.'' At a fund-raiser
on Friday night in East Hampton, Bruce Wasserstein, the investment
banker, raised a toast to the Clintons for a ``remarkable
achievement,'' saying, ``This is obviously a wonderful time for all
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   For a president seeking comfort or inspiration, things could
only look wonderful from Cranberry Dune, Wasserstein's ocean-front
estate, where Clinton dined with Billy Joel, Quincy Jones and
others. The home, with 14,000 square feet, was built around a
transplanted 16th-century Scottish barn, and is set in rolling
lawns, pine trees and gardens of day lilies, hollyhocks and
black-eyed Susans on 25 acres. In similar splendor, the Clintons
are staying at the estate of the filmmaker Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's own fund-raising remarks, which are largely
extemporaneous, underscore how separate the parallel presidencies
appear to be in his own mind. ``I care a lot about this country's
history,'' he said at Wasserstein's house. ``I've spent a lot of
time reading and studying it, trying to feel it in the White House,
in every room.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Lewinsky investigation is clearly not far from anyone's
thoughts. After playing 18 holes with Clinton at the Atlantic Golf
Club in Bridgehampton, Fred Mack, a real estate developer, made one
apparent allusion: ``Given the pressures of the whole situation,
it's nice to see the president be able to spend some time out of
the glaring spotlight,'' Mack said, adding that Clinton had played
very well.
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser at his house here in East Hampton Saturday
evening, Jonathan Sheffer, founder of the Eos orchestra, was more
direct in introducing Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay men and lesbians know what it's like to be vilified, to be
stereotyped, to be persecuted,'' Sheffer said, adding, ``I want you
to know that today you are among friends,'' as an audience of about
100 applauded loudly.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping to the lectern, Clinton obliquely referred to the
same subject, saying that the changes he had made in the country
were guaranteed to provoke a political reaction, but ``I didn't
know it would be quite as profound as it has been, this reaction.''
He also said that were it not for the 22nd Amendment, he would run
again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has generally made no direct mention in his remarks of
his troubles in Washington, instead laying out a list of goals as
if his presidency were as fresh as it was in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He calls for ``progress over partisanship,'' often at the same
time as he is scoring a few partisan points. And he lays out his
chief policy goals, including securing Social Security and
Medicare, improving primary and secondary education, protecting the
environment and combating ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say the perception that Clinton has continued to work hard
at his job sustains his high approval ratings. He cannot afford to
slack off, they say, and has no desire to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Clinton delivered his weekly radio address live from a
fire station in Amagansett. He devoted it to promoting his
``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' a series of protections for people in
managed-care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton is as steadfast as her husband in
publicly ignoring the other presidency. At Wasserstein's house, she
spoke before the president, praising his accomplishments and his
vision for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take great pride in introducing someone who I know very
well,'' she said, before pausing to note that it was ``a little
strange'' to introduce one's spouse. ``Depending upon the kind of
day you had, you know, you might give a different sort of
introduction.''

RANGERS' NEW PITCHER WELL-RESTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS and]J. DOUGLAS FOSTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Pitcher Todd Stottlemyre, who was obtained in
a trade Friday from the St. Louis Cardinals along with shortstop
Royce Clayton, is scheduled to make his first start for the Rangers
on Tuesday against Toronto at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   He should be rested, perhaps more than he would prefer.
Stottlemyre, who formerly pitched in the American League for
Toronto and Oakland, missed a scheduled start for St. Louis on
Wednesday because of soreness in his back and
</P>
<P>
   right rib cage. He hasn't worked with more than five days' rest
all year, but now he hasn't pitched since July 24, when he lasted a
season-low two innings against Colorado.
Missed opportunity Juan Gonzalez, still bothered by a strained
right hamstring, missed his fifth consecutive start last night.
</P>
<P>
   This one really hurt. Gonzalez has a career .800 batting average
against White Sox starter Mike Sirotka: four singles in five
at-bats.
Off and running Ivan Rodriguez started at designated hitter last
night for only the sixth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago seized upon Rodriguez's absence behind the plate, going
2-for-2 in steal attempts in the first three innings against
substitute Rangers catcher Bill Haselman. Then again, Rodriguez had
given up an uncharacteristic eight stolen bases in 10 attempts
during his past six games behind the plate, although his 56.4
percentage rate for throwing out runners still leads the American
League.
Order shuffle Clayton, the Rangers' new shortstop, debuted last
night in the second spot in the batting order behind Mark McLemore,
who occasionally leads off against left-handed pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile, who was obtained in a trade from the
Florida Marlins, batted fifth last night. But Tom Goodwin will
knock him down a notch in the batting order when he hits in the
leadoff spot against right-handers. Zeile will drop another peg in
the order when Gonzalez returns, and possibly also when Lee Stevens
is the designated hitter.
Fresh numbers In the statistical categories, National League
imports Clayton, Stottlemyre and Zeile get fresh starts with the
Rangers. And for Clayton and Stottlemyre, the numbers on their
backs changed, too.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton is wearing uniform No. 18 with Texas. He wore No. 11
with St. Louis, but that number is already being worn here by
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre will wear No. 44 for the Rangers. He was No. 30 in
St. Louis, the same number as Rangers pitcher Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile gets to keep the No. 27 he wore in Florida. The last
Rangers player with that number was pitcher Matt Whiteside, who was
released during spring training.
Hello, old friend The three new members of the Rangers saw some
familiar faces upon their arrival to The Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile was welcomed by reserve catcher Haselman, a college
teammate of his at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to have him here,'' Haselman said. ``He's the kind
of guy who drives in runs every year. He drives in big runs. That's
the name of the game _ producing runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton was also reunited with an old teammate; first baseman
Will Clark was a teammate in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll give us a lot more range at shortstop and a lot more
speed in the lineup,'' Clark said. ``I'm very excited about what
we've done \Rwith the trades\S.''
Valuable experience With Friday's trades, the Rangers picked up
three players who all have playoff experience _ which may prove
vital in the chase for the AL West title.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre has pitched in six different league playoff series
and two World Series (while at Toronto). Clayton played in the 1996
playoffs for the Cardinals and hit .350 against the Braves in the
League Championship Series. Zeile played for Baltimore in the 1996
playoffs and hit .364 in the AL Championship Series against New
York.
2 million and counting The Rangers reached the 2-million mark in
home attendance last night in their 55th game, the third shortest
time to reach that mark in team history behind 1994 (first year in
The Ballpark, 50th date) and 1997 (53rd date). This is the ninth
time in the past 10 years the Rangers have surpassed the 2-million
mark, and they are the sixth team to reach that number this year.
Farm report Triple-A Oklahoma (Pacific Coast League): The Redhawks
(56-51) lost to Tacoma (Wash.), 9-4, Friday, their fourth
consecutive defeat. Brandon Knight got the loss, going five innings
and allowing four earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Double-A Tulsa (Texas League): The Drillers (32-12 second half)
allowed five runs in the fourth and fifth innings in a 13-5 loss
Friday to Jackson (Miss.). Jose Martinez (2-2, 7.60 earned-run
average) picked up the loss after giving up all 10 of those runs in
4 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Charlotte (Florida State League): Gabe Sollecito (5-2,
0.79 ERA) gave up an unearned run to break a 4-4 tie in the seventh
as the Rangers (19-16 second half) lost, 5-4, Friday. It was
Charlotte's first loss in seven games against Tampa this season.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Savannah (South Atlantic League): The Sand Gnats (18-24
second half) dropped a 3-2, 10-inning decision Friday to Piedmont
(S.C.). Chris Tynan went seven innings, allowing only one run on
three hits, but Anthony Shourds gave up three runs to take the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Pulaski (Appalachian League, rookie): Pulaski (16-25) pounded
out 16 hits and all nine starters hit safely in an 11-7 victory
Friday against Danville (Va.).
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Coast (Gulf Coast League, rookie): The Rangers (20-16)
scored two runs in the ninth inning in a 7-5 victory Friday against
the Red Sox. Cody Nowlin was 2-for-3 with a home run, his sixth.

METS BEAT DODGERS, 2-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Earlier last week, Matt Franco pointed out to Lenny
Harris that none of the current Mets had a pinch-hit home run this
season. Since Franco and Harris are the Mets' top two
pinch-hitters, Franco told Harris something should be done to
remove the goose egg.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night at Shea Stadium, Franco went out and did just
that. He belted a one-ball, no-strike offering from the Los Angeles
Dodgers' Jeff Shaw into the right-field stands with one out in the
bottom of the ninth inning, tying the score at 1-1 and saving Rick
Reed from an undeserved defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, by causing Shaw to blow his first save in 10 tries
with the Dodgers, Franco's blast might have helped out Luis Lopez
even more. When Edgardo Alfonzo doubled home Todd Hundley from
first base one out later for the winning run in a 2-1 victory at
Shea Stadium, it was hard to tell which Met was happier, Lopez or
Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's two-out error in the top of the eighth had led to an
unearned run, the only run the Dodgers would score off Reed (12-7),
who pitched nine strong innings.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who he thought was happier, Reed said: ``We're
probably running a big race right now. But probably Luis. I really
felt bad for him. He was pretty upset about that. He was really
down. When Todd scored, he hugged me. I hugged him. You'd have
thought we won the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Mets had done was turn the tables on the Dodgers and
their closer, one night after Los Angeles had rallied for a
ninth-inning victory against John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Reed was exceptional, Matt Franco was better with one
swing, and Fonzie rose to the occasion,'' Manager Bobby Valentine
said. ``One little miscue and they put a run on the board. But in
the ninth inning, there weren't any heads hanging in that dugout.
And there could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The game marked the Met debut of Tony Phillips, who was acquired
from Toronto on Friday. Phillips started in left field and hit in
the lead-off spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had passed on Phillips during spring training, when
they could not come to terms on a contract with the 16-year
veteran. So Phillips bided his time until he was ready to play
again, spending most of his summer playing golf in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, the 39-year-old utilityman decided the time was
right to try again and signed with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had followed the Mets, and was aware of their
struggles in the lead-off spot, Phillips said: ``Not really. Well,
I'm lying. Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Phillips responded the way he did when Mets General
Manager Steve Phillips spoke to him on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he would be adding something to the offense that we
haven't had the whole year,'' Phillips said. ``We really haven't
had a lead-off guy. And he said, `Don't think I haven't noticed
that.' I said, `You're probably saying I told you so.'''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips went 0 for 4 with a walk Saturday night and heard some
boos. Mike Piazza went 0 for 3 and heard a lot more boos. And then
Lopez made the error.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets did not give up. Valentine laughed about Matt
Franco, who had said during batting practice that he was going to
work on a home run swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I like your line drives. There's nothing wrong
with that,''' Valentine said. ``It just shows you he doesn't listen
to me. I've never seen that exact thing happen before. Especially
on a pinch-hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Franco, who actually hit a ball over the fence before
batting practice on a soft-toss swing: ``Lenny and I have been
teasing each other, saying we can hit them out in batting practice,
so let's go. It was a good time to hit my first one out.''

Astros players ecstatic over trade
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PITTSBURGH _ The clock had rushed past midnight, so forgive some of
the Astros if they couldn't believe what they were hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Unit in an Astros uniform?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you a lot of guys weren't able to sleep (Friday
night),'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   At least they knew they weren't dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the Astros felt their chances of reaching the World
Series for the first time in franchise history had improved late
Friday night when the club traded two minor leaguers and a player
to be named to Seattle for former American League Cy Young winner
Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard we were going after him, I felt like they were
just putting our name out there to give them something to talk
about on SportsCenter,'' said Astros pitcher Mike Hampton, who
played with Johnson briefly in Seattle. ``But when they made the
move, I was shell shocked that they pulled the trigger. It's good
to see that. It sends a message to us and to the fans of Houston
that we're committed to winning this thing, and that we're going to
do whatever it takes to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a guy now who can shut you out on any given day. When
he's on, you're not going to be able to do anything against him.
When you think that someone might have to face him three times in
the postseason, it's a great move for us. He's definitely an impact
player; the kind that only comes around every so often. This
improves our chances 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade surprised the players as much as it surprised baseball
observers around the country. In previous years, some players have
been privately frustrated that the club didn't make a significant
trade for the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, they didn't think 1998 would be any different.
Owner Drayton McLane and general manager Gerry Hunsicker were
getting kudos all over the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerry and Drayton did their jobs,'' Biggio said. ``They
stepped up at the right time. Last year it was a little bit
difficult to make a deal, but this year we worked it out, and there
are a lot of guys in here who are thankful that those guys stepped
up and helped us out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty excited about playing behind Randy (today). This is
like getting a guy like Nolan Ryan, and it's pretty exciting to
have a guy like that on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly better than having to face Johnson as an opposing
hitter. Asked how he thought other contending clubs reacted to the
Astros' trade for Johnson, outfielder Carl Everett said: ``I'm sure
there were a few swear words directed at us.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Jeff Bagwell was winding down from Friday's game
at a downtown watering hole when he heard about the Johnson trade.
He was so excited he bought a round of drinks for everyone in the
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made some minor moves before, but this is not a little
move,'' Bagwell said. ``We've never done anything like this that
could change the complexion of the club. Randy's going to give up
some runs every once in a while. But his presence and his track
record of pitching in big games will definitely add something to
the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a statement to the players and the fans that we want
to win; not just get to the playoffs, but go all the way. If
there's ever been a time to get excited about baseball in Houston,
this is the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Seattle, the mood wasn't so chipper. Johnson's
former teammates knew he would be traded, but they had hoped to get
in return players who were a little more recognizable than Freddy
Garcia and Carlos Guillen, both of whom were playing for the
Astros' Class AAA team in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically gave (Johnson) away,'' Mariners first baseman
David Segui said of the team's front office. ``Not to take anything
away from the two guys that we got, but that was a lousy trade. We
thought that if we were going to lose him, we would at least get
someone who could help us right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros hadn't expected Garcia and Guillen to reach the
majors until 2000 at the earliest, but Johnson is someone they
believe can help them reach the World Series this year.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any negative vibes among Astros players, it
stemmed from the fact one of the starting pitchers will lose his
spot in the rotation _ and possibly on the team _ as a result of
the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker said Shane Reynolds and Mike Hampton are
the only pitchers who are locked into the rotation along with
Johnson. That means Pete Schourek, Sean Bergman and Jose Lima will
have to sweat out a decision, although Lima no doubt helped his
case Saturday with his second complete game in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Hampton said. ``I know it's going through all of
their minds because they don't know what's going to happen. You
feel for those guys, but at the same time we're trying to win a
World Series, and this is the best move we could have made to
improve our team.''

Column: The Great Seattle Hunsicker Heist
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The phone was ringing. It was Seattle calling. And boy was
Seattle mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst trade in history,'' the voice on the line
said, before it said hello.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to be consoling. I told the voice it could be the steal
of the century for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   But here late in the 20th, Randy Johnson's coming to the Astros
for the price of a few kids most fans in Houston barely have heard
of should be called the Hunsicker Heist. Seattle's general manager,
Woody Woodward, comes off looking like Woody Woodpecker. He burns
in effigy as we speak.
</P>
<P>
   At the last possible moment Friday night, Astros GM Gerry
Hunsicker was able to rent a guy who gives them a chance to play in
their first World Series. The Mariners, in the opinion of their
outraged followers, bought the farm by waiting until the 11th hour
to peddle the miserably unhappy free-agent-to-be known as the Big
Unit, a 6-10 nightmare for anyone who swings a Louisville Slugger
for a living.
</P>
<P>
   And to think, in large part because of Johnson, Seattle was one
of baseball's leading up-and-coming franchises only a couple of
years ago, when the Astros weren't even sure they would keep their
Houston mailing address.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, things can change in a hurry. With a payroll that's
still way below the average of the other contending club's _
Johnson's pro-rated paycheck will cost the Astros a couple of
million extra bucks the rest of the way _ their roster compares
favorably with anyone's except perhaps the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees we'll worry about in October. The idea is to
just get that so-long-in-coming shot at New York, or whomever the
American League wants to send to the Fall Classic. After 36
shortfall seasons, it was time for the Astros to make a serious
statement about their intent. With all those sluggers, they were
one power pitcher shy of being a real worry for the Braves and the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   If ever the budget had to be tweaked, it was now. Drayton McLane
Jr. talks a lot about striving to be a champion. By giving
Hunsicker permission to participate in the Johnson sweepstakes, he
put what was left of his money where his mouth is. Hunsicker, ol'
Houston Slim, took care of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   With help from, among others, the Yankees, who can afford
anybody they deign to afford. Money wasn't the issue with them.
They simply didn't feel a compelling need to hoard more high-dollar
talent, at the expense of losing a younger stud such as Hideki
Irabu. When you are rocking along about 50 games over .500, it's
easy to stay above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't allow yourself to say, `I want him so nobody else
can have him,''' manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, the Dodgers were reported to have offered Ismael
Valdes and Wilton Guerrero. Woodward turned up his nose. He wanted
to play a couple of more hands. So he showed up at Saturday's
Mariners game wearing only a barrel. A bulletproof one, though.
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Garcia and Carlos Guillen are hot prospects, to be sure.
At some date, Seattle is going to love having them. But they aren't
nearly as far along the development curve as Scott Elarton and
Richard Hidalgo, the two young Astros who appeared certain to be
goners if a Johnson or a Roger Clemens was a comer.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros got off light, assuming Johnson's beanpole body and
boggled mind are right. His 4.33 ERA raises questions, but he has
been his old self of late, throwing back-to-back shutouts a couple
of starts back, and his 213 strikeouts did lead the AL. NL hitters
unfamiliar with him aren't going to enjoy the experience of
deciphering his stuff in the heat of a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   The only downside to the deal is Johnson's likely
just-passing-through status. Whatever he accomplishes the rest of
the way, short of pitching a seventh-game victory in the World
Series, it's improbable the Astros can come close to meeting his
price for an extended stay.
</P>
<P>
   He's just a talent temporary, the world's tallest hired gun _
but most definitely an eager-beaver one.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson arrived in Pittsburgh late Saturday, famous snarl fixed
on his face, his wild mane tangled, and insisted upon starting
against the Pirates today, to keep on his work schedule. This is a
man bubbling over with incentive.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to make Woodward look as dumb as possible _ although,
in the short term, Woody has about bottomed out _ by winning as
many games as possible so he can assure himself as fat a contract
for '99 and beyond as possible.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking Greg Maddux money, by the way, as in upwards of
$10 million per year. That's why you had better catch him while you
can. When Garcia and Guillen are starring for the Mariners, Johnson
will be just a fading memory for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But a most fond one, too, hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate you in Seattle,'' the voice said.

Comets run out of gas, lose to Rockers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
As the victories mounted to record proportions, there was cause for
a feeling of accomplishment among the Comets and, in the case of
coach Van Chancellor, reason to fret.
</P>
<P>
   All of those emotions ran together Saturday when the Comets came
back from their largest deficit of the season (13 points), then
lost 74-71 in overtime to the Cleveland Rockers, who had all the
right answers for snapping the defending WNBA champions' record
15-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockers (13-9) forced the Comets into 20 turnovers, coaxed
them into poor shot selection most of the game and beat them on the
backboards to also end the record 10-game winning streak at Compaq
Center. In so doing, the Rockers might have removed a heavy burden
from the backs of Chancellor and the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a monkey on my back in the first place,''
Chancellor said. ``Everybody seemed to think I did. I was enjoying
the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I thought some of the things we were doing were going to
catch up with us. We (dribbled) the ball too much on offense and
not rebounding on defense I thought would catch up with us, and it
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere were those flaws more glaring or more telling than in
the five-minute overtime. The Comets turned the ball over twice,
and Monica Lamb's three-point play 11 seconds in was all the
offense generated.
</P>
<P>
   When the game is on the line, it's usually the time for Cynthia
Cooper to flash the form that carried her to last season's Most
Valuable Player award. But an exhausted Cooper, who was on the
floor for the full 45 minutes, couldn't deliver. Not completely,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half as the Comets played lethargically, Cooper
struggled for seven points, matching Sheryl Swoopes. After the
Comets fell behind 42-29 early in the second half, Cooper scored
six points in the final 2:37 of regulation. Her layup with 15
seconds left tied the score at 68 and forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But in the OT, Cooper missed five shots, including a desperation
3-pointer at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have been fatigued,'' said Cooper, who was held to 16
points, seven below her league-leading average, and turned the ball
over seven times. ``It was a difficult game the entire game for me,
personally. I was up and down. It wasn't one of my best games. It's
unfortunate it had to happen tonight. But luckily, it happened
tonight rather than in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets have clinched a berth in the playoffs. The Rockers,
who are in second place in the Eastern Conference, remain in a
battle with New York, Detroit and Phoenix to determine the rest of
the playoff field.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the way they played Saturday, the Rockers are capable
of doing whatever is necessary to stay alive. With 6-5 Isabelle
Fijalkowski, 6-3 Janice Braxton and even 5-9 Merlakia Jones
conducting a clinic on the proper method to box out an opponent,
Cleveland never let the Comets become a factor on the boards. Jones
came off the bench to grab a career- and game-high 10 rebounds as
the Rockers obliterated the Comets 37-25.
</P>
<P>
   She also scored 10 points, one of five Rockers to reach double
figures. Fijalkowski led all scorers with 19 points, 11 in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets shot 25-for-61 from the field and missed six of seven
in the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overtime was a mirror of the whole game for us,''
Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   When Lamb (12 points, eight rebounds) completed her three-point
play, the Comets enjoyed their biggest lead at 71-68.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Nemcova then found the range for Cleveland. Each team would
miss two field goals and turn the ball over twice before Jones
dropped in two free throws, giving the Rockers a 72-71 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper missed a layup, Lamb couldn't connect on the follow and
Michelle Edwards, making her first start of the season for
Cleveland, rebounded. On the other end, Jones completed the fast
break with a layup, but three seconds remained on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Following a timeout, the Comets inbounded the ball from midcourt
and Cooper's 3-point try missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to look at this like it's a major deal,'' Cooper
said. ``It was a loss. But if we were 17-5, nobody would be worried
about the one loss. It ended the streak, it ended a streak at home.
It happens. It happens to the best of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson, who had 11 points and only two rebounds while
shadowing Fijalkowski, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two losses, that's OK,'' she said. ``We're still very
positive. Last year we had 10 and we won a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to lose games. No one ever said we were never
going to lose. We came out and played hard against everyone,
knowing that there could be a night like this.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cleveland coach Linda Hill-MacDonald, the victory meant a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge win for our franchise,'' she said. ``Houston
is a quality team, but we played as a team and did what we wanted
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There won't be time for the Comets to dissect the loss or dwell
on shortcomings. At 3 p.m. today at Compaq Center, the Comets host
the Sacramento Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never good to lose,'' said Swoopes, who led the Comets
with 18 points, seven rebounds and a career-high six steals. ``But
this is a loss that I don't think is going to hurt us. It's only
our second loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definitely things we can learn from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as how to rebound properly, how not to turn the ball over
or spend too much time dribbling.
</P>
<P>
   The little things that caused a coach to fret, even in the
throes of success.

GRUDZIELANEK HOPES MOVE PAYS OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Saturday's game, Mark Grudzielanek was the
happiest guy in the room.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' new shortstop arrived at Shea Stadium around 6 p.m.
after flying in from Montreal with left-hander Carlos Perez and
definitely seemed ready to put nearly four years with the
cost-cutting Expos behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a frustrating situation to see all the great players
leave year after year,'' said Grudzielanek. ``You look around this
clubhouse and see all the talent they have assembled and it is
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, 28, thought he was coming to the Dodgers last
winter following the November expansion draft, but the club went
with Jose Vizcaino, who has missed six weeks with a sprained right
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek went back to the Expos, whom he claims had offered
him a multi-year contract. Instead, Montreal gave him $350,000.
After this season, Grudzielanek will be eligible for salary
arbitration and will receive a substantial increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people say it's not about the money, but it
was not about the money,'' he said. ``You just wanted them to build
something. They had so much talent, but they kept getting rid of
it. They could have won the World Series in 1994 if it hadn't been
for the strike and suddenly all that was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Grudzielanek tied a major-league record for
shortstops with 54 doubles. In 1996, he became just the second
shortstop this century to hit .300, collect 200 hits and steal 30
bases in one season. Hall of Famer Honus Wagner was the other.
</P>
<P>
   He also led the National League in errors the past two seasons.
Saturday night, he made a slick defensive play to save a run in the
third but committed an error in the eighth that nearly tied the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to my left and came up with it,'' Grudzielanek said
after the Dodgers' 2-1 loss. ``On the error, I tried to turn two
and didn't get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino is not expected to play for another 2{ weeks because of
the severely sprained right ankle that has sidelined him since June
20. When he returns, Grudzielanek probably will move to third in
place of rookie Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   No Judd: Dodgers rookie right-hander Mike Judd was scheduled to
pitch Saturday until the club acquired Perez on Friday. Even then
Judd didn't know he was out until 6:15 p.m. when Perez informed
manager Glenn Hoffman he could pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all right, I prepared for whatever might happen,'' said
Judd, who would have made his first major-league start. ``You knew
they were going to make a trade so I guess it was only a matter of
time. I wanted to pitch, believe me, but I kind of knew this could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Young at bat: Eric Young is on a tear since he returned from the
disabled list Friday night. He had three hits and doubled home the
Dodgers' only run Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back from the (strained left thigh) before, I
tried to ease my way back at the plate and I was lost,'' Young
said. ``This time I took a lot of batting practice before I came
back. I was going to be ready. I didn't want to go through that
again.''

HEART ATTACK KILLS SERB ON TRIAL FOR GENOCIDE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A former Bosnian Serb official who played a key role in
organizing three notorious prison camps during the Bosnian war died
on Saturday, apparently of a heart attack, in his cell at The Hague
where he was standing trial for genocide.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the international war-crimes tribunal conducting
the trial said the Serb, Dr. Milan Kovacevic, 57, died shortly
after 9 a.m., despite efforts by a prison guard to revive him. Jail
officials had summoned a doctor, but Kovacevic was dead when the
doctor arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The death is a new setback for the tribunal; Kovacevic is the
third person held and indicted by the tribunal to have died. On
June 29, Slavko Dokmanovic, a Serb and the former mayor of Vukovar,
Croatia, hanged himself in his cell using two neckties. In 1996
another accused man, Djordje Djukic, was allowed to leave the
tribunal prison because he was terminally ill with cancer; he died
soon after returning home.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Kovacevic was considered especially significant
because he was the first individual to be brought to trial in The
Hague on charges of genocide. The charges rose out of testimony
that in 1992 he was a key member of the nationalist Serbian
Democratic Party staff in Prijedor, Bosnia, that helped coordinate
``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   His indictment said he was responsible for three camps in the
Prijedor area _ at Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje _ that became
notorious when journalists discovered them and circulated images of
starved and mistreated prisoners. All three sides in the war
operated prison camps, but treatment in those three reportedly was
particularly brutal.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Kovacevic, an anesthesiologist and director of
the Prijedor clinic, said genocide charges were called for because
the camps' staff members tried to destroy the Bosnian Muslim and
Croat peoples as national, ethnic or religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacevic had pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers
argued that as a civilian he was not responsible for any actions by
the police or the army.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacevic's trial opened on July 6, and in the first days
evidence was heard from witnesses describing the political scene in
Prijedor in 1992. During the first two weeks, Kovacevic usually sat
quietly, sometimes taking notes, often holding his head. On several
days he appeared tired. His last appearance was on July 17, when
the trial was suspended until September.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal spokesman, Christian Chartier, said the death of
Kovacevic, while closing the case, would not end the investigation
into the events at Prijedor in 1992. Among the 26 prisoners in
custody, four have been charged with abuse of prisoners in the
three camps.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacevic was arrested by British troops in July 1997 and taken
to The Hague. Officials were aware that he was under the care of a
cardiologist. He was transferred to the prison hospital on several
occasions and suffered at least one stroke in detention, according
to Chartier. Kovacevic's lawyers also warned the tribunal about his
health.
</P>
<P>
   Chartier said that between 3 and 5 a.m. Saturday, a doctor spent
two hours with Kovacevic because he appeared to be suffering a
kidney crisis. After taking pain killers and other medication, he
fell asleep. He awoke around 8:30, the spokesman continued,
complaining again that he was feeling ill. As his condition
deteriorated, a prison guard gave him first aid.
</P>
<P>
   Chartier said the deaths of Kovacevic and Dokmanovic were a
reminder ``that we are not dealing with common detainees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our prisoners are people who have been through war with
the accompanying stresses and traumas,'' he said. ``This evidently
had an impact on their psychological and physical health.''

OUTDOORS: HANGING BY A ROPE IN COSTA RICA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are countries made for hiking, and some made for fishing.
But in Costa Rica, the paradigm of an ecologically concerned
nation, you can scamper over the jungle treetops tethered to the
world's highest clothesline.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of this Central American country is
protected by law from harvesting or cutting or otherwise insulting
the land. So what do you do about the cloud forest, which
perpetually hides most of the sky? Simple _ at least to Rodrigo
Carazo, one of this country's former Presidents.
</P>
<P>
   He constructed a sort of sky-hiking among the treetops in that
verdant place. You look at, and travel over, the land from above.
It is called a Canopy Adventure, and you are part of the panorama.
This is not a passive activity. You are working the rope, and you
are controlling your speed.
</P>
<P>
   It combines the adventure of mountain climbing with the surreal.
You are safely hooked to the substantial overhead cable, and
gravity propels you from tree to tree. And while you travel along
this clothesline, you're alone among the birds, the branches and
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   We're no kids, my wife and I. But we are adventurous. We flew
from San Jose, the capital, to Los Angeles Norte de San Ramon on
the central Pacific coast in a four-seater. I sat next to the
pilot, who put his arm around me when he noticed I was clutching
the armrest. Dangling in the cockpit u _ and this is no joke _ was
a sign suspended from a hook. It read, ``Tips are not mandatory,
but are welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   When we landed, I gave the pilot a $10 tip. He took it.
</P>
<P>
   We could have traveled there the way most people do: by bus or
taxi or private car, a lovely two-and-a-half-hour ride from San
Jose. We stayed at Hotel Villablanca, in one of Don Rodrigo's
nature-conscious casitas, little bungalows built along the line of
turn-of-the-century workers' houses. The Canopy Adventure is $35.
The rooms are under $100 a day per couple; three meals add up to
about $35 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Don Rodrigo has owned this working farm for more than 30 years.
He was president of Costa Rica from 1978 to 1982. But when he was a
National Assemblyman back in the '60s, he says, he realized that
the natural resources were being depleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained to the logging industry,'' he said, ```If you cut
down a tree, you've sold it once. But if you keep it for people to
look at, you're selling it millions of times.'''
</P>
<P>
   So under legislation he drafted, Costa Rica embarked on a
program of preserving its rain forests and cloud forests, its
waters, its flowers, its mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say we became interested in nature when we realized
we were destroying the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Rodrigo's cloud forest, which is part of his estate, is
3,800 feet high. The clouds move in routinely, fed by the
confluence of winds from the Pacific meeting up with those from the
Caribbean, to the east. You take a 15-minute course in the ecology
of the area and a guide explains what you'll see up above.
</P>
<P>
   It seems daunting, at first. You look up and between the thick
branches and leaves you see a cable somewhere up there _ in fact,
10 stories up there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you can quite easily mount a platform, through a series of
ramps and steps, to get among the top of the 80-foot-high trees.
You wear a helmet, and you are strapped to a hefty climber's rope,
which is then hooked onto the overhead cable.
</P>
<P>
   And then you jump out of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   You are tethered, of course, and gravity then propels you to the
next tree 100 yards away. You stay there awhile, looking for birds.
Perhaps you might spot one of the area's 27 species of
hummingbirds. Then, you take off for the next tree. In all, you
glide among four trees.
</P>
<P>
   You arrive at the last platform, and you may well ask, ``Where
are the steps?''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any. You descend the 80 feet to the jungle floor by
rope. It looks like rappelling and feels as if you're actually
scaling. Someone on the ground is holding the line and helping you
feed it.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you are concerned about doing this by yourself,
or if you have a limiting physical problem such as a lack of hand
strength, you and a guide can make the tour together. It is as much
fun as going solo.
</P>
<P>
   For further information, there is a toll-free fax: (888)
851-4418. To call Villablanca, the number in Costa Rica is:
011-506-228-4004.

MAN ACCUSED OF NAZI ROLE FACES TRIAL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Jack Reimer, a retired businessman from Carmel,
N.Y., was questioned by Justice Department lawyers last year about
his role in the mass execution of 50 to 60 Jews in Poland during
World War II, he offered a resolute denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall not kill _ Sixth Commandment,'' Reimer said, adding
that he had been a prisoner of the Nazis himself.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, the Justice Department plans to ask a federal
judge in Manhattan to revoke Reimer's citizenship, as the first
step to his deportation. The government asserts that Reimer, now
79, lied about his past when he entered the United States and that
he is a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to strip Reimer of his citizenship is the first such
case to fall in the jurisdiction of federal district court in
Manhattan, prosecutors said on Friday, although such prosecutions
have taken place in Brooklyn and on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Reimer, who was born in Ukraine,
never told American authorities that he was part of a feared SS
unit made up mostly of former Soviet prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   The unit trained in a special camp at Trawniki, Poland, and was
involved in the extermination of Jews throughout Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they have evidence of Reimer's participation in
the liquidation of Jewish ghettos in Poland, including those in
Warsaw, Lublin and Czestochowa. They say they will also offer Judge
Lawrence McKenna evidence of the incident in which they say Reimer
helped other SS men execute 50 to 60 Jews in a ravine near
Trawniki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trawniki was the training school for murder,'' said Neal Sher,
a private lawyer who ran the Office of Special Investigation in the
Justice Department when it first filed the case against Reimer in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the likes of the Trawniki men,'' Sher added, ``the
Holocaust would never have been as ruthlessly efficient as it was.
They were the instruments of death.''
</P>
<P>
   In the six years it has taken for Reimer's case to come to
trial, he has not denied that he was in the Trawniki SS camp, but
has asserted that he was taken there by the Germans with other
prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my entire time at Trawniki,'' he said in court papers
filed in 1995, ``I considered myself a prisoner of war and I was
treated like a prisoner with no rights who could be executed at
will.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement is one of a series of sometimes conflicting
accounts Reimer has given in court papers, interviews with the news
media and two formal sessions with Government lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Justice Department's special investigative office was
created in 1979, 59 people accused of being Nazi criminals have had
their citizenship revoked, said the office's current director, Eli
Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rosenbaum and federal prosecutors in Manhattan would
not discuss the case against Reimer, court records show that
Holocaust survivors and historians are among those likely to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   The government plans to offer an account taken from Nikolaj
Semenovich Leont'ev, who said he worked under Reimer in the
Trawniki unit and described him as directing the shooting of
hundreds of ``fear-crazed'' Jews during the ghetto clearing
operation in Lublin in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   But the most powerful evidence against Reimer may be a series of
admissions he made in 1992 during five hours of interrogation by
the Office of Special Investigation without a lawyer accompanying
him.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer acknowledged, for example, that he shot his rifle at one
man in a group of Jewish civilians who had been herded for
execution into the mass grave near Trawniki in the winter of
1941-42.
</P>
<P>
   ``You finished him off?'' one prosecutor asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid so,'' Reimer replied.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer has since vigorously contested the admissibility _ and
the accuracy _ of his statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bullied and threatened for hours,'' he told McKenna in
court papers. ``I felt coerced to say more than I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Reimer's lawyers, Ramsey Clark, a former attorney general in the
Johnson administration, and Lawrence Schilling, tried
unsuccessfully to have his 1992 statements suppressed before trial.
McKenna left open the possibility, however, that they could renew
their attempts after the trial begins.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers declined to comment on Friday, while Reimer
could not be reached for comment by phone.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times in 1992, after he was
first accused of concealing his past, he said: ``I was not involved
in any atrocities.'' He said that he had not killed Jews, and was
being found ``guilty by association.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he denied to New York magazine that he was even present
at the execution of the 50 to 60 Jews in the ravine at Trawniki,
asserting that he was back in his SS bunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you will find this hard to believe _ I overslept,'' he
said. ``I only went over there when the SS man in charge sent
someone to look for me. By then the killing happened. They were all
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued to offer varying accounts: In his 1997 deposition,
taken with a lawyer present, he said that he had fired toward the
ravine, but apparently not to kill Jews. ``I did not fire at
anybody,'' he said. ``To me that was a no-no.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he said: ``God hates liars _ Ninth
Commandment. Believe me, I could not kill anybody or lie.''
</P>
<P>
   In his court papers, Reimer also denies lying to immigration
authorities when he entered the United States in 1952 and when he
was granted his citizenship in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``I answered all questions and concealed nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Reimer lived in Carmel, N.Y. (He has said in
court papers that he has since moved to a location he did not
disclose because of harassment.) He once owned a Wise potato chip
franchise in Brooklyn, he said in court papers, and later worked
for a Schrafft's restaurant, eventually becoming an owner.
</P>
<P>
   As in earlier proceedings involving accused Nazi war criminals,
Reimer's case was pieced together by Justice Department
investigators from thousands of pages of records from German and
Russian archives, immigration manifests and interviews with
witnesses who were in the camps or guarding prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the government says that in 1941, Reimer, who
had been a soldier in the Soviet army, was taken prisoner by the
Germans. Eventually, the government says, he was sent to the SS
training camp in Trawniki.
</P>
<P>
   He served there until 1945, prosecutors say, and was promoted to
1st Sergeant. While at the camp, prosecutors say, he trained new
recruits and led missions to kill Jews.
</P>
<P>
   For example, prosecutors said, in 1942 in Czestochowa, Reimer
helped round up tens of thousands of Jewish men, women and
children, who were then transported to Treblinka and other Nazi
death camps.
</P>
<P>
   They said that in 1943, he helped suppress the resistance in the
Warsaw Ghetto, and assisted in the liquidation of the Ghetto,
operations in which thousands of Jews died and more than 50,000
were arrested and sent to death camps.
</P>
<P>
   He denied any role in roundups or liquidation actions, and says
in court papers that he has lived a model life in New York since
his arrival: he has gotten married, raised two sons and never been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always supported myself,'' he said, adding that he has
``been very happy in the United States.''

Johnson brings live arm, disposition to Astros
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Moments after learning he was traded from the moribund Seattle
Mariners to the division-leading Astros, Randy Johnson was in no
mood to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters crowding around his clubhouse stall late Friday night
were met by a menacing glare from a 6-10, 225-pound Visigoth-shaggy
man whose wiry muscles can fling a baseball 97 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get away from my locker,'' Johnson said. ``Take that as a
warning.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be taken as a yet another sign that while Johnson
brings extraordinary heat to the mound, he also takes a combustible
personality to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves the Mariners under a cloud, the size of which Seattle,
even as rainy as it is, has rarely seen. A 20-game winner last year
and Cy Young Award winner in 1995, Johnson has stirred varying
emotions in the nation's northwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   This summer he has frozen out the media and scuffled with a
teammate, first baseman David Segui, amid clubhouse mutterings that
he wasn't giving his best effort because of resentment over his
lingering transitional status.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson came to training camp in Arizona in a sour mood that
became increasingly vinegary. When the Mariners refused to extend
his contract or trade him, he said, ``That's like me telling my
wife I want a divorce and then not leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   He was so grumpy during the spring that Ken Griffey Jr. felt
compelled to reassure him that he was not being ``a distraction to
us.'' Of course, whenever ballplayers start talking about something
not being a distraction, it's a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson sulkathon continued into the season, and it showed
in his performance. He pitched so poorly that he drew a gentle
rebuke from manager Lou Piniella, who said, ``I know he's had a lot
of problems over his contract, but you have to put those things
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did seem to rally around the All-Star break, and his
statistics have recovered somewhat, to a 9-10 record and a 4.33
ERA. There's no question about the strength of his soon-to-be
35-year-old left arm. Before his interleague trade, he had 213
strikeouts and was well on his way to a fifth American League
strikeout crown.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Baseball America poll of managers, Johnson's
fastball was ranked No. 3 in the AL (behind Cleveland's Bartolo
Colon and Anaheim's Troy Percival) and his slider also No. 3
(behind the Yankees' David Cone and Tampa Bay's Rolando Arrojo).
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners' front office has always wondered if Johnson's
extraordinary height _ he's the tallest player in major-league
history _ makes him vulnerable to back strain and other injuries.
He underwent back surgery _ against management's wishes _ in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During one of his occasional periods of media interaction,
Johnson pointed out that back soreness has cost him only one start
in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an operation I needed, and my back has been fine ever
since,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they were sure his back is on track, the Mariners would
have been reluctant to raise their payroll of $53 million. Astros
owner Drayton McLane Jr., starting this season with $10 million
less in payroll and slightly higher revenues, had room to stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Houston, few reporters knew Astros general manager Gerry
Hunsicker was ensconced in his office all day Friday, never
breaking for lunch or dinner while in negotiations for the most
intimidating pitcher of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's quirky, hyperactive omnipresence on the mound _ the
way he talks to himself, the way his lanky sidearm windup unreels
and his stringy mop of hair frames his scowling face, the way his
fastballs often sail into batters _ all these things make opponents
nervous while contributing to his box-office appeal. The Mariners
drew 10,000 more fans on days he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle there's an air of disappointment about the city
losing part of its identity. Only the long, tall Space Needle was
more of a Seattle landmark than the long, tall lefthander who
attended the University of Southern California on a basketball
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Times columnist Steve Kelley faulted Johnson for his
``petulance and unprofessionalism'' and for showing ``the emotional
equilibrium of a cork bobbing in high seas.'' But he noted that
Johnson ``gave the city almost a decade of indelible moments.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the 1990 no-hitter against Detroit, and there were 130
wins and more than 2,100 strikeouts. Most of all, there was his
heroic 1995 postseason campaign, when he started on short rest and
even pitched in relief to lead the team into the AL Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   What rankles Mariners players and fans is that their team didn't
get more for Johnson than minor leaguers Freddy Garcia, Carlos
Guillen and a prospect to be named _ who, Hunsicker said, won't be
Class AAA slugger Daryle Ward.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, though hardly Johnson's biggest booster, said the
Mariners ``basically gave him away for nothing. Not knocking the
two guys we got, but that was a lousy trade. We're deathly
disappointed. For a player of Randy's caliber, you should get more
than prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners general manager Woody Woodward had lined up a trade in
June of Johnson to the Los Angeles Dodgers for starting pitcher
Ismael Valdes as well as young, promising talent: infielder Wilton
Guerrero and lefthander Ted Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was set, but one of the Mariners' owners exercised his
veto right, believing the Mariners still had a shot at the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   As the trading deadline approached and it was obvious the
Mariners were hopelessly adrift, Woodward vowed he wouldn't give up
Johnson without receiving a big-league starting pitcher in return.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Mariners found the semi-resurgent Dodgers unwilling
to part with Valdes or Darren Dreifort. Meanwhile, the New York
Yankees were holding tightly to Ramiro Mendoza and Hideki Irabu,
and the Cleveland Indians wouldn't budge on Dave Burba.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees decided that since they were having one of their
greatest seasons ever, it made little sense to risk clubhouse
chemistry by mixing in the volatile Johnson, especially when the
Indians, the defending AL champions, were backing off him.
</P>
<P>
   As Woodward turned to Houston, one of 27 teams that had
indicated interest in Johnson, it was apparent the pitcher's value
had been marked down over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Concern had grown about Johnson's emotional stability,
especially when he charged across the clubhouse two weeks ago to
fight Segui, who later said he had no idea why the attack occurred.
</P>
<P>
   While McLane's financial commitment to Johnson is only about $2
million _ the remainder of this season's contract _ this trade
doesn't come without risk. Johnson brings tremendous upside
potential, but there is a downside besides the back question.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are one of the more peaceful teams in the major
leagues, and it will be interesting to see if Johnson finds
serenity here or if he creates turmoil, as he did in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   This year he has periodically launched into rants about being
``treated like a piece of meat.'' So how will he like being
``rented'' with no promise of an invitation to return next year?
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Astros might try to re-sign Johnson in the
offseason, Hunsicker said, ``It's not fair to Randy to look beyond
this year. We don't know if he's gonna like Houston; we don't know
if we're gonna like him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hunsicker is closing no doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Drayton's philosophy is we're gonna look at every
opportunity from both a business and a baseball viewpoint,'' the GM
said, ``and if both of them make sense, we'll try to make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, however, questions will swirl around Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Without the security of a 1999 contract, will he be willing to
push himself in the postseason as he did in 1995?
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker claims he's not worried about Johnson's desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked with enough people to feel confident that this is
the fiercest competitor playing baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with Johnson by telephone at 1 a.m. Saturday,
Hunsicker sensed the Big Unit was eager for a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's mentally exhausted from everything that's
happened, and there's a lot of emotion going on, with his wife
being from Seattle,'' Hunsicker said. ``He had absolutely no
expectation of going to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even with all that, one of the first things he said to me
was, `I want to be on the plane to Pittsburgh today, and I want to
pitch Sunday afternoon.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me there's only one reason he's playing this game and
that is to put a (World Series) ring on his finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a lot of distractions hanging over his head,''
Hunsicker said, ``but his last several starts indicate he's
throwing with the velocity he usually has. And his breaking ball is
still sharp. I have every reason to think changing leagues gives
the pitcher the advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are other questions, some of which Hunsicker
brought up himself.
</P>
<P>
   How will Johnson like Houston? He was born in California, and
having played almost his entire career in the American League, he's
largely unfamiliar with this city. He's a highly intelligent,
complex man who might not be easy to satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer whose work has won praise from critics, Johnson
may miss the scenic fog-swathed bay and hills of Seattle. A rock
music aficionado who not only marches to his own beat but plays
drums on the day he pitches, he may miss the noted grunge scene of
his former home of almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Astros should guide him through the Ansel Adams
photography exhibit at the Natural Science Museum. Maybe they
should take him on a tour of the local rock 'n' roll clubs. Or
maybe they should just stay out of his way.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson is to be the springboard into Houston's first World
Series, the Astros will need to find a way to make their immensely
talented but temperamental ace happy he's here. Because if he's not
happy, he's not one to hide his feelings and make the best of the
situation.
