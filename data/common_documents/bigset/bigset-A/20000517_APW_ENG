Fed Hikes Interest Rate a Half Point
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates Tuesday by a
bold half point, pushing a key rate to its highest level in nine years. Fed
policy-makers signaled they were prepared to move even more aggressively if
needed to fight inflation. The central bank raised its target for the federal
funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, to 6.5 percent. It was
the sixth time the Fed has increased the funds rate since last June but the
first half-point move. All the other rate changes were smaller quarter-point
increases.

Clintons Together for Nomination
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In a supporting role on the sideline, President Clinton
applauded Tuesday night as New York Democrats nominated his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, as their candidate for the Senate. Clinton walked hand in hand with the
first lady as she was introduced on stage at a downtown arena before an audience
of more than 11,000 people. After a few waves and without a word, the president
stepped back as Mrs. Clinton moved to the microphone and accepted the unanimous
nomination from the 352 delegates to the State Democratic Party convention.

   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Five adventurers -- including the aviation legend
Dick Rutan -- were rescued from the North Pole after their biplane broke through
the ice and sank more than 13,000 feet to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. An
airplane dispatched from Canada picked up the men Monday night after they had
spent 12 hours at the top of the world. They were not injured.

Dalai Lama Ready for Autonomy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The Dalai Lama said Tuesday he was seeking autonomy
and not independence for Tibet, but that officially atheistic China must not
have control over spiritual issues. ''China maintains strict control over all
aspects, including cultural and spiritual,'' the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
said. ''Those fields that we in Tibet can manage, we should manage.'' The 1989
Nobel Peace Prize winner was making his first stop on a swing through
Scandinavia. He was to meet Wednesday with Prime Minister Goeran Persson despite
objections by China, which controls Tibet and sees the Dalai Lama as a rallying
point for pro-independence forces.

Senior Democrat OKs China Trade Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to grant permanent trade benefits to China won
what could be a crucial endorsement Tuesday from Rep. Charles Rangel, the senior
Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. ''It makes sense for the United
States to have normal trade relations with all countries,'' the New York
congressman said in announcing his long-awaited decision. Rangel's choice was
important because other wavering Democrats on the committee, which takes up the
trade bill tomorrow, were looking to him for guidance in the election-year
debate over trade with China.

House Nixes Budget Overhaul Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Tuesday emphatically rejected a bill aimed at
overhauling the federal budget process. Among the proposals defeated were a
switch to a two-year budget and ending the possibility of year-end government
shutdowns. The legislation, defeated 250-166, would also have gotten the
president involved in budget negotiations earlier in the year to prevent
end-of-session deadlocks, created a rainy-day reserve fund for emergencies and
ensured that spending cuts in one area of the budget not be used to boost
spending elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Longtime senator gives farewell to party brethren  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Daniel Patrick Moynihan bid farewell to his
fellow New York state Democrats with a brief address to a
convention dominated by the woman Democrats want to succeed him in
the U.S. Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to go,'' Moynihan told some 10,000 people Tuesday
night as his wife Liz, manager of his four successful campaigns for
Senate, stood by his side on the podium at the Pepsi Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, 73, is retiring at the end of 2000 to spend more time
writing and with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan spoke for just eight minutes as he recounted a
half-century-long career in government and politics which began in
1953, when he worked on the New York City mayoral campaign of
Robert F. Wagner Jr. His first state Democratic convention,
Moynihan remembered, came a year later when party leaders met at
the 69th Division Armory in New York City to nominate W. Averell
Harriman for governor.
</P>
<P>
   He also met Elizabeth Brennan, his future wife, at that
convention, Moynihan reminisced.
</P>
<P>
   He said the threat of nuclear war hung over the world for
virtually all his governmental career, with the globe at the brink
during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came close by accident many times more than people know,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton's election to the Senate would be in keeping
with New York's tradition of firsts involving women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year for the first time in history a first lady is going
to be elected to the United States Senate,'' he said to the cheers
of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Then he bowed out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we say goodbye,'' he said. ''We thank the party and the
people of our state for a great run. Good night.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his speech, a video tribute was shown consisting
exclusively of Moynihan's appearances over the years on ''Meet the
Press'' and his sometimes prescient comments on domestic issues and
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In one clip from the mid-1980s he criticized Republican Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas for misrepresenting his record on defense
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're in (the Senate) one year, fella,'' Moynihan said. ''You
don't do that to another senator.''
</P>
<P>
   The acclaim of the convention was just one of several honors
Moynihan is receiving as his political career winds down. On
Monday, the House of Representatives unanimously gave final
approval to a bill renaming the federal courthouse in Manhattan
after Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Moynihan is one of the ''wisest'' public servants
in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't a person in the party, in the state or the nation
who is not in his debt,'' Clinton said. ''And I am at the top of
that list.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello called Moynihan an ''icon of our
party,'' state Comptroller H. Carl McCall said he is a ''great
visionary'' and state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said Moynihan
is ''one of the great hearts and minds of our age.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to becoming senator in 1976, Moynihan had a long career in
cabinet-or sub-cabinet-level posts under Presidents Kennedy,
Johnson, Nixon and Ford. He was U.S. ambassador to India from
1973-75 and U.S. representative to the United Nations in 1975 and
1976.
</P>
<P>
   While in Washington, Moynihan often drew as much attention for
his scholarly writing as his politicking. Noted works detailed his
visions for reforming welfare and keeping the Social Security
system solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan also largely avoided the nitty-gritty of state party
politics, campaigning only selectively for other state Democrats.
He cited his antipathy toward having to raise money for another
campaign as a factor in his decision to retire this year.
</P>
<P>
   During one now-famous appearance before the 1988 state
Democratic convention, Moynihan was to have spoken on Republican
mishandling of upstate New York's economy. Instead, at the last
moment, he scrapped that address and spoke about the threat to
world peace that Pakistan and India posed by both holding nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, Moynihan formed an unlikely duo in the Senate with
New York's other representative in that chamber, Republican Alfonse
D'Amato. D'Amato reveled in his reputation as ''Senator Pothole'' --
a legislator focused on local projects and winning federal aid for
his state -- while Moynihan seemed to prefer national and global
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences in party and style, the two men
generally worked well together.

<HEADLINE> 3M Phasing Out Some Chemicals  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- 3M Co. said Tuesday it is phasing out some of
its Scotchgard stain-repellent products because of environmental
concerns about a chemical used in their production.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it does not believe the products pose a risk to
human health or the environment. Tests have shown the
perfluorooctanyl chemistry used in the products can be detected at
extremely low levels in the environment and in people, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Customers need to know they can continue to use what they
have'' of the products being phased out, spokesman Chris Welsh
said. ''There's a possibility that some of these products may be
reformulated. That's not exactly clear yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The affected products include firefighting foams and coatings
that repel soil, oil, water and grease. They represent about 2
percent of 3M's nearly $16 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Most production will be phased out by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''While this chemistry has been used effectively for more than
40 years and our products are safe, our decision to phase out
production is based on our principles of responsible environmental
management,'' said Dr. Charles Reich, a 3M executive vice
president.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 6, Cubs 5  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers didn't just take on the
Chicago Cubs, they fought their fans, too.
</P>
<P>
   Several Dodgers went into the Wrigley Field crowd after a fan
stole Chad Kreuter's cap and ran off with it in the ninth inning of
Los Angeles' 6-5 victory. The game was delayed for nine minutes
while some Dodgers and fans tussled before order was restored.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was worried. I'm down there trying to get my guys out of
there, and I'm getting beer thrown on me,'' Dodgers manager Dave
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter was in the bullpen area, which is just over a small,
chest-high wall from the fans, when pinch-hitter Julio Zuleta had
an RBI double to cut the Dodgers' lead to 6-5 with one out. A fan
apparently grabbed Kreuter's cap and hit him, and then took off
running.
</P>
<P>
   ''A fan came down and hit one of our guys in the back of the
head,'' Todd Hundley said. ''Literally punched him in the back of
the head when he wasn't looking. And he took his hat -- that's how
the whole thing started.''
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter didn't want to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game was on the field. Todd Hundley was the hero,''
Kreuter said. ''I've been told there's no side right now. The game
was on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley hit a three-run homer in the eighth inning to lead Los
Angeles. It was his fourth homer in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   A few Dodgers chased the fan with Kreuter's cap into the crowd,
and the rest of the bullpen gathered along the first-base wall. Los
Angeles' dugout emptied, and several Dodgers were seen tussling
with fans.
</P>
<P>
   It took security several minutes -- and several tries -- to
finally restore order. Cubs manager Don Baylor and bench coach Rene
Lachemann also came over to plead with fans to calm down.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was part of the problem. It kept going on and no one
showed up. There were no uniformed personnel,'' Dodgers general
manager Kevin Malone said. ''It looked like it was out of control
and there weren't any control measures in place.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers have to take some of the blame, Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just know that when pitchers go into the stands, you're
taking big risks,'' Baylor said. ''The next thing you know, you
have their general manager standing next to me on the field. He
shouldn't have been there, either. You can't go into the stands. No
matter what they throw.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Wrigley Field fans have gotten out of
control at a night game. A game against the Colorado Rockies in May
1999 had to be delayed in the eighth inning when fans, upset over
an umpire's call, pelted the field with baseballs, bottles, coins
and cups of beer. Colorado center fielder Darryl Hamilton said one
fan threw a Jack Daniels bottle onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five people were ejected, but there were no arrests. The
Cubs restricted beer sales and added security after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not very proud of that. Not very proud of our hometown
fans,'' said Hundley, whose father, Randy, played for the Cubs.
''It's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers regrouped after the brawl, though. Jeff Shaw retired
Eric Young and Ricky Gutierrez on popouts, ending the game and
getting his ninth save. Alan Mills (1-1) pitched a perfect seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Tapani (1-5) gave up six runs and nine hits in eight
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has homered in seven of his last eight starts. His homer
to center also bailed out Kevin Brown, who gave up a season-high
four runs -- three of them earned -- and four hits in six innings.
Brown, who'd given up just one run in each of his last four starts,
also tied his season high for earned runs allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green hit a two-run homer for the Dodgers, and Adrian
Beltre added a solo shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez hit a two-run homer for the Cubs, and Glenallen
Hill added a solo shot. Sammy Sosa drove in Chicago's other run on
a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Dodgers are 7-0 in games after a day off. ... Young,
who left the Dodgers on less-than-good terms with manager Davey
Johnson, went 2-for-4 with two runs scored. He also stole a base.
... Henry Rodriguez bruised his right knee fouling off a pitch in
the third inning. He is day to day. ... Karros extended his hitting
streak to 10 games.

<HEADLINE> Suns Tie Playoff Futility Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns, facing elimination from the
NBA playoffs, tied a playoff record for futility in a half Tuesday
night, scoring 23 points against the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, who scored 71 points in the first half in beating the
Lakers 117-98 in Phoenix on Sunday to force a fifth game, trailed
49-23 at halftime Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 23 points matched the mark set by the Utah Jazz in the
second half of a 96-54 loss to Chicago Bulls on June 7, 1998. The
54 points are the playoff record for a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns also tied the playoff record for futility in a second
quarter, when they scored nine points to the Lakers' 28.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix shot 2-of-17 in the second quarter (11.8 percent), and
8-of-37 in the half (21.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson led the Suns in scoring in the half with five
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers entered the game with a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven
Western Conference semifinals and in need of one win to put them in
the conference finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had two 10-0 spurts in the second quarter to give
them a 40-23 lead. Phoenix didn't have a field goal for over six
minutes while being outscored 17-3 at the end of the first quarter
and start of the second.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA record for fewest points in a half in a regular season
game is 19 by the Los Angeles Clippers against the Lakers last Dec.
14.

<HEADLINE> Niagara Mohawk remolding itself again for new competitive era  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Niagara Mohawk turns 50 this year and
change is the reason for its historical staying power, according to
Chairman William E. Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 begins a new era for Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc.,
which has changed its name and is completing the transition from a
power producer to an energy provider.
</P>
<P>
   Davis on Tuesday recounted Niagara Mohawk's history of change
for about 100 shareholders as he outlined the company's path of
progress for the future. It was a small crowd compared to past
annual meetings, some of which drew as many as 2,000 stockholders,
often to complain about mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The theme of responding to and leading change echoes
throughout our company's history,'' Davis told the sparse crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have inherited the responsibility to continue the
transformation of the energy industry. Our company will always be a
work in progress,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Although its predecessor companies go back to the late 19th
century, Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. formed in 1950 out of three
operating companies -- Buffalo Niagara Electric, Central New York
Power and New York Power and Light -- and began building and
expanding an upstate empire of fossil fuel generating plants, hydro
stations and nuclear plants. Before deregulation, Niagara Mohawk
provided gas and electric service to 2 million customers and
employed 15,000 people. Today, it has 7,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Davis told shareholders today's Niagara Mohawk has nearly
completed selling off all its generating plants as it moves in
other business directions. Last week, Niagara Mohawk completed the
sale of the Albany Steam Station and it has a pending sales
agreement for the Roseton plant in Newburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk has changed course on the sale of its nuclear
plants on Lake Ontario, Davis said. The utility had reached a
tentative agreement to sell its share of the plants for $163
million to AmerGen, a Philadelphia-based international power
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see there is now a better market than when we first put the
plants up for sale. There are more people interested in buying
nuclear plants these days,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the plants will be sold at a competitive auction. No
date has been set but Davis said the process is moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   As Niagara Mohawk sheds itself of its power producing plants, it
has begun investing in unregulated energy service businesses and
other areas through a wholly owned subsidiary, Opinac NA. Its
biggest investment has been in Telergy, a rapidly rising regional
telecommunications company, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Mohawk lost $35 million in 1999 and its stock
performance was down 13 percent (still 6 percent better than the
industry average). But the company's financial stability improved
as it paid off more than $1.1 billion in debt, saving itself $85
million in annual interest costs, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs of regained fiscal health, he said.
Revenues grew by 2.3 percent, net earnings rose $270 million and
cash flow increased to $488 million in 1999 from $311 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Faced with this confusion, it is a natural reaction to ask if
we're still on the right course. I believe strongly that we are,''
Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Hits Central Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A moderate earthquake struck central
Taiwan on Wednesday, seismologists said. No damage or injuries were
immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.3-magnitude quake's epicenter was about 25 miles northeast
of the Sun Moon Lake resort area, the island's largest natural
lake, the Central Weather Bureau said. Sun Moon Lake is about 95
miles south of the capital, Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   A larger quake of 7.6 magnitude that hit Taiwan on Sept. 21
killed about 2,400 people and caused severe damage in the resort
area. Lakefront hotels collapsed and several landmark structures
were ruined. Since then, more than 12,000 aftershocks and tremors
have rattled the island.
</P>
<P>
   Located along the earthquake-prone Pacific Rim and crisscrossed
by 51 fault lines, scores of earthquakes hit Taiwan each year, most
of them harmless.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- CarsDirect.com Inc., which sells cars and
related products over the Internet, has filed for an initial public
offering of stock.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Culver City, said it will use the $135.5
million it expects to clear from the offering on advertising,
operations and to reduce debt.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1998 and had a net loss of $72.3
million in 1999, according to documents filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The company had a net loss of $43.1
million in the first three months of this year on revenues of $98.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   CarsDirect.com said it has sold 12,885 cars online since its
inception, including 6,255 in the first three months of this year.
The average price of the cars sold was $22,815, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   In its registration statement, the company said it expects
losses ''for the foreseeable future'' and that a large number of
risk factors would affect its ''new and unproven business model.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has powerful backers, including the Pasadena-based
venture capital firm, idealab!, which controls about 66 percent of
the company, according to the SEC filing. Last November,
CarsDirect.com raised $280 million from private investors and
investment banks.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose slightly Wednesday morning after
a hike in a key U.S. interest rate boosted confidence that U.S.
officials will control inflation. The dollar edged higher against

trading. On Tuesday, the average closed up 237.57 points, or 1.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 109.52 yen in late morning, up 0.58 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
109.44 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started higher after the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board Open Market Committee on Tuesday raised
its target for the federal funds rate -- the interest that banks
charge each other on overnight loans -- from 6 percent to 6.50
percent, the highest level in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei average then moved into negative territory as some
investors locked in profits, but posted slight gains toward the
morning close, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Fed action, which was widely anticipated in
financial markets, stocks in New York rose on hopes Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan will win his fight to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroichi Nishi, a deputy general manager at Nikko Securities,
said the Fed's rate increase decision, coupled with higher
overnight futures prices in Chicago, was supporting an early rise
in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 126.79 points
to 10,934.57 at Tuesday's close. The Nasdaq composite index rose
109.92 points to 3,717.57 points.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.32 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,648.39
points. The TOPIX closed up 15.72 points, or 0.96 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened against the yen
following the Fed's decision. Higher interest rates tend to make a
nation's currency more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Also, tension between Taiwan and mainland China ahead of
Saturday's inauguration of Taiwan President-elect Chen Shui-bian
provided added support for the greenback, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar is sometimes regarded as a safe haven in times of
international unrest.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 98.77 yen, down from
99.02 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond
stood at 1.7450 percent, unchanged from Tuesday's finish. Its price
remained unchanged at 100.47.

<HEADLINE> Md. Court Rejects Smokers' Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- In a major victory for cigarette makers,
the state's highest court ruled Tuesday that Maryland smokers
seeking damages from the nation's tobacco companies cannot join
together in a class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In a 4-3 decision, the state Court of Appeals nullified a
January 1998 court order by a Baltimore Circuit Court judge that
united plaintiffs united in a statewide lawsuit against the
nation's top cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The individual issues in this case would necessitate
potentially hundreds of thousands of somewhat extensive trials,''
the opinion said. ''Such a trial plan hardly promotes judicial
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision echoed those by several federal and state courts.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling leaves the ongoing lawsuit in Florida as the only
case in the U.S. where a statewide class-action suit on behalf of
individuals seeking damages for smoking-related illnesses has been
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   William S. Ohlemeyer, Philip Morris general counsel, said, ''We
are pleased that the Maryland Court of Appeals, like some two dozen
other federal and state courts, has concluded that class actions
are simply inappropriate for litigating smoking and health cases.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit, covering Maryland residents with smoking-related
diseases or who are addicted to nicotine, is separate from the $4.6
billion settlement the state is set to receive to cover
smoking-related health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Both are being litigated by a legal team headed by Baltimore
attorney Peter G. Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   John C. M. Angelos, an attorney who works for Peter Angelos,
said the firm would have no comment until attorneys read the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The order issued by the top court bypasses the usual judicial
procedure of trial and appeal. One of the reasons given in the
opinion for the unusual order is the inordinate size of the class --
potentially, tens of thousands of Maryland residents who would jam
state courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The waste of judicial and other resources, should the circuit
court's class certification order be overturned on appeal, would be
without precedent in the state,'' wrote Judge Irma S. Raker for the
four-judge majority.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit asserted that tobacco manufacturers
researched, designed, produced and marketed cigarettes to state
residents with the knowledge that the products are addictive and
hazardous to human health. The suit also alleged that the tobacco
companies fraudulently withheld information about the risks of
smoking and denied a link between tobacco and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Opening statements begin next week in the penalty phase of the
Florida case, where the jury has already sided with an estimated
500,000 sick Florida smokers by deciding the industry conspired to
produce a deadly product and should pay $12.7 million to three
representative smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation for the rest of the class must now be determined.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for an estimated 500,000 sick smokers said he may
seek more than $100 billion in damages from five major tobacco
companies. Tobacco companies seeking to have damages capped at 10
percent of the industry's value, which the jury must determine.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds, Brown &AMP;
Williamson, Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett and the industry's
Council for Tobacco Research and Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Court: Man can't sue despite medical examiner's misconduct  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York City is shielded from a suit by a
man who said his life was ruined because a city medical examiner
didn't tell police his son died of natural causes after first
deciding the boy was slain.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the seven Court of Appeals judges Tuesday wrote sharp
dissents in which they argued that Edward Lauer should get the
chance to convince a jury about the merits of his $10 million suit.
</P>
<P>
   Lauer said his wife divorced him and he had to move out of his
neighborhood in Queens because he was being harassed by people who
thought he was responsible for killing his 3-year-old son Andrew in
August 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eddy Lilavois, a medical examiner for the city, had
initially ruled Andrew's death a homicide due to blunt injuries to
the boy's neck and brain. After further investigation, however,
Lilavois determined two months later that the Lauer child died of a
natural cause, a ruptured brain aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   Lilavois, however, did not change the cause of death on Andrew's
death certificate from his initial finding nor did he notify police
of the change. For nearly two years, until the New York Daily News
reported Lilavois' change, police and the people close to Lauer
considered him a suspect in his son's death, according to court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   As Judge George Bundy Smith said in his dissent, ''His wife
divorced him. His family, friends and neighbors shunned him. For
close to two years, plaintiff (Lauer) needlessly lived under a
cloud of suspicion, allegedly enduring depression and loss of
weight caused by the nightmare he lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilavois resigned after the Daily News' report, the court noted.
</P>
<P>
   Though acknowledging the difficult circumstances of the Lauer
case, the five judges in the majority Tuesday nevertheless said
laws do not allow him to sue the city for the actions of the
medical examiner. To do so, Lauer would have to show that the
medical examiner owed a special ''duty'' to him and Lauer had not
demonstrated that, Chief Judge Judith Kaye wrote for the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing Lauer to sue, Kaye wrote, would be tantamount to
''radically enlarging both the responsibility of the Office of
Chief Medical Examiner and the potential liability of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The court has frequently ruled on matters of governmental
immunity from suits by citizens, and generally found that concepts
of sovereign immunity bar such litigation. Kaye said Tuesday that
such cases have ''likely divided this court more than any other
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and the other dissenter, Joseph Bellacosa, said Lauer did
show that a special duty existed between Lilavois and Lauer and
that Lauer should get his day in court.
</P>
<P>
   Barring Lauer's suit would ''reward government agents who hide
the truth and sweep wrongdoings under a rug'' of impunity,
Bellacosa wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lilavois' actions were ''grossly indifferent'' and not letting
Lauer sue ''seals an undeniable miscarriage of justice,'' Bellacosa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lauer's lawyer, Peter James Johnson Jr., said Kaye's decision
gets lost in the ''wilderness of arcane language and concepts''
about government's responsibilities toward its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the majority opinion suggests a 19th century solution
to a 20th and 21st century problem because it puts pursestrings
ahead of people,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the Court of Appeals was the final step for Lauer's
appeal. There are no federal constitutional issues that would
warrant taking the case to federal courts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Kalkstein, an assistant New York City corporation
counsel, said the majority of the court was cautious about imposing
additional liability burdens on municipalities. He ackowledged that
the Lauer case was a ''tragic'' one.
</P>
<P>
   In other rulings Tuesday by the Court of Appeals:
</P>
<P>
   IMPAIRED FIREFIGHTER
</P>
<P>
   The court upheld the dismissal of a White Plains firefighter for
testing positive on the job for a cocaine derivative called
benzoylecgonine. Ian Scott Wilson had argued that the evidence
which helped trigger the blood and urine tests -- an anonymous
letter -- was not sufficient to warrant the testing.
</P>
<P>
   The court said, however, that Wilson's bosses had other evidence
to suggest that Wilson was a substance abuser, including excessive
absences from work and the fact his co-workers had come to nickname
him ''Scotch'' Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   DORM TAXES
</P>
<P>
   The judges sided with Hobart and William and Smith colleges in
its dispute with the city of Geneva over property tax assessments
on a dormitory built on college land in 1996 under a leaseback
arrangement with a private developer.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva had argued that the colleges should pay taxes on the
dormitory building because the developer primarily owns it while
the colleges acquire equity over 40 years in the lease-back deal.
But the court ruled Tuesday that the building is college property
and its property tax exemption as an educational institution
stands.

<HEADLINE> Cuomo, McCall insist they are not running -- yet  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and federal
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo -- the two New York Democrats most
interested in running for governor in 2002 -- say they are not yet
vying against one another.
</P>
<P>
   The two men shook delegates' hands at their party's state
convention Tuesday and spoke at the convention at which Hillary
Rodham Clinton was nominated for Senate. Both said their only focus
now is getting Clinton and Al Gore elected this November.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the only black ever elected to statewide office in New
York, got a warmer reception with his speech, saying, ''We are a
party that brings in inclusion and diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, some members of the audience began chanting ''Run,
Carl, Run,'' to which he replied, ''We're gonna get to that. My
turn will come.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall also received a standing ovation in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo focused largely on issues his party advocates, drawing
applause when he called for equal pay for women, cost-of-living
adjustments for pensions of retired state workers and economic
boosts for upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo also alluded to the 2002 governor's race in his remarks,
saying that ''in 2002, it's the governor's mansion'' that the
Democrats want to take over. He didn't say whether he'd like to be
the Democrat to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after his speech, Cuomo said it is still
''way premature'' to discuss gubernatorial nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to engage in a 2002 race today, which could
divide the Democratic Party. We have plenty of time to worry about
2002,'' Cuomo said. ''It's important to focus on the here and now.
We need to win the presidential and the senatorial (races) and we
need to stay united to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Both McCall and Cuomo had reportedly been dueling to be the one
to nominate the first lady at the convention, but Clinton's camp
solved that dilemma by giving the honor to U.S. Sen. Charles
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, the eldest son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, has said he is
considering a run for the post his father held for three terms
before being defeated by Republican George Pataki in 1994. The
younger Cuomo said it was too early to be campaigning for governor
but added that he would not rule out a primary against McCall.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has privately told supporters that he will seek the
governorship in 2002, but said he will not make any public decision
until after the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with WROW-AM in Albany Tuesday morning, McCall
said friction between Cuomo and himself over nominating Clinton
''was really generated by the media.'' However, he said that after
November, it is ''quite possible'' that he and Cuomo will emerge as
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''But believe me, not before then,'' the comptroller said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall has been working for several months at lining up support
for a possible gubernatorial nomination and so far has gained the
support of state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, state Assembly
Majority Leader Michael Bragman and former Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine.
</P>
<P>
   McCall was one of the hosts of a post-convention reception at an
Albany hotel sponsored by the state Democratic Party. Cuomo, on the
other hand, was a prominent guest at a reception aboard a Hudson
River cruise boat featuring singer Tony Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   If both men decide to run, they seem likely to encounter Pataki.
The governor gave his strongest signal to date Monday about his
plans for 2002, when he said running for governor is ''the most
likely scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   A statewide poll conducted by Marist College's Institute of
Public Opinion in April showed Pataki ahead of Cuomo, 50 percent to
40 percent and leading McCall, 52 percent to 33 percent.

<HEADLINE> Navy's presence in Vieques protested at convention  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- When 18-year-old Carlos Rossy-Lozada votes
for the first time in November, the tiny Puerto Rican island of
Vieques will be on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue will determine a lot for me,'' Rossy-Lozada said
outside the New York state Democratic convention Tuesday. He, and
about two dozen others, gathered outside the convention to protest
the Navy's use of Vieques for military practices.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Bronx Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez called for convention
delegates to pass a resolution today that would demand that the
Navy's use of the island cease immediately. His supporters in the
crowd chanted ''Vieques si (yes), Marina (Navy) No!''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am calling on you, the heart and soul of the New York state
Democratic Party ... to restore peace to the island of Vieques,''
Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   He defended his use of the convention as a forum for the issue
saying, ''There is never a wrong forum, a wrong time, or a wrong
place when the lives of 10,000 people are at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy controls two-thirds of Vieques and uses it for weapons
storage and military exercises. Protesters say that the more than
six decades of training on the island -- which has included bombing
exercises -- has harmed the health of residents, stunted tourism,
and harmed the environment.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, President Clinton agreed to order the Navy out by
May 2003 if the island's 9,400 residents vote in a referendum to
expel it.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of island residents taken in February found that 84
percent would vote evict the military.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's resolution calls for an immediate referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Puerto Ricans are loyal American citizens and have let the
military use their island to prepare during World War II, Vietnam
and the Gulf War,'' said Kenneth Agosto, a Bronx young Democrat.
''It's time they get a little bit back before it's totally
uninhabitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Agosto said that Hillary Clinton's support of an end to the
Navy's practices in Vieques has led to ''one of the biggest moral
imperatives that we (Hispanic voters) vote for her.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll released in April found that Hispanic voters in New York
support the first lady 73 percent to 17 percent over Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not only Vieques,'' Agosto said. ''She (Clinton) follows
our views and listens to us about problems like police brutality
and asthma.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also supports an end to military maneuvers on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the convention, a small group of protesters gathered,
shouting ''No more bullets, no more guns. Look at what the Navy's
done.''
</P>
<P>
   When a motorcade suspected of carrying Presidents Clinton drove
past, the protesters yelled: ''Clinton send the Navy out. Everybody
scream and shout.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a Democrat, but that doesn't matter,'' said Efrain Dones
of Albany who was protesting Tuesday. ''That is beside the point
because I'm an American citizen like them, and I don't believe
citizens should be exposed to things like bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This catches my attention because I've been to the island and
I've seen the devastation,'' Rossy-Lozada said. ''This issue is
crucial.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Waver on Becoming Wealthy  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Americans may want to be wealthy but they
don't necessarily want to act wealthy, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released Tuesday by AARP at its biennial convention
found contradictory feelings about becoming wealthy. The survey
pool consisted of people of all ages, races, income and education
levels.
</P>
<P>
   While almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they would like
to be wealthy, three-fourths said wealth promotes insensitivity in
others.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not a lot of Scrooge McDucks out there,'' said Hugh
Delehanty, editor-in-chief of AARP's Modern Maturity magazine,
referring to the Disney cartoon character known for flaunting his
avarice.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the booming economy, a lot of people struggle to keep
their heads above water. Seventeen percent of those surveyed felt
they were below average financially.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, a quarter of those surveyed do not save or
invest for the future and two-fifths said they carry over credit
card debt from month to month.
</P>
<P>
   The Baby Boom generation lives beyond its means more than other
age groups, but Asian Americans report lower credit card debt than
other ethnic groups, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's other findings:
</P>
<P>
   -- At least seven out of 10 people have altered one important
aspect of their lives, such as going to college, because they
didn't have enough money. Blacks and Hispanics reported more such
limitations than other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   -- Two-thirds of nonretirees believe they will have enough money
to retire by age 65. Less than a third want to keep working past
65.
</P>
<P>
   -- Age and income matter a great deal in measuring a desire for
wealth: The younger and richer a person, the more likely the desire
to be wealthy. Asian Americans expressed a greater desire for
wealth than other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 2,366 people was conducted last winter for AARP,
the advocacy group for retirees, by Belden Russonello &AMP; Stewart and
Research Strategy Management. It had a margin of error of 2.5
percent.

<HEADLINE> EPA Cites Cancer Risks From Dioxin  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency in a draft
report concludes that the cancer risk from exposure to dioxins is
significantly greater than previously estimated, agency sources
said late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which is expected to generated widespread
controversy and has not yet been scientifically peer reviewed, has
been in the works for years and is to be released next month,
officials said. It is based on an extensive review of dioxin
findings in the scientific literature and not original research.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that at least one form of dioxin -- the most
potent form known as TCDD -- should be classified as a definite
human carcinogen. Other dioxin-like compounds were considered by
the EPA reviewers as ''likely'' carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin, a chlorine byproduct that is produced through a number
of chemical processes including combustion, enters the food chain
and can accumulate in humans over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA report projects a relatively high risk of cancer from
exposure to dioxin for a small segment of the population who eat
large amounts of fatty meats and dairy products that may be
relatively high with dioxin contamination.
</P>
<P>
   For these individuals, the report concludes, the risk of
developing cancer from dioxin exposure may be as high as 1 in 100,
or 10 times greater than in previous projections, according to an
official familiar with the findings.
</P>
<P>
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the new
projections stemmed from new evidence of cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA findings were first reported by the Washington Post
which said it had obtained a copy of the draft report.
</P>
<P>
   The report, according to the EPA sources, also links exposure to
dioxin to a variety of other health problems, including diabetes,
developmental problems and irregularities in the immune system. And
it concludes that children's intake of dioxin is greater than those
of adults because the chemical is often present in dairy products
and even breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials emphasized, however, that the draft report's
conclusions should not dissuade people from eating a well balanced
diet, including lowfat foods, dairy products and vegetables that
may contain some dioxin residues. And officials said the benefits
of breast feeding continue to outweigh the risks from dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   One agency official noted that industrial emissions of dioxins
have been reduced by about 80 percent since the 1980s and are
expected to be cut even further in coming years. The EPA in recent
years has either issued of plans to issue tougher smokestack
regulations on a number of dioxin sources including municipal,
medical and hazardous waste incinerators and the pulp and paper
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxins have been closely studied for over 20 years with
hundreds of articles in the scientific literature. Still, the
health effects of dioxin on humans remains somewhat uncertain. For
example, dioxins have been found to cause birth defects in mice,
but no such causation has been established in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA draft report reflects an intense review of the
scientific literature, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials acknowledged that its findings will prompt
extensive debate. Industry groups as well as some scientists over
the years have accused the EPA of exaggerating the dangers of
dioxins.

<HEADLINE> 25 Convicted for Aceh Massacre  </HEADLINE>
By MUHARRAM M. NUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) -- A landmark human rights tribunal
convicted 24 Indonesian soldiers and one civilian on Wednesday of
massacring 57 villagers during an anti-rebel operation last year in
Aceh's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants were sentenced to terms ranging from 8{ to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings by a joint civilian-military tribunal came after
prosecutors dropped demands for the death penalty, saying the
defendants had only been following orders from military commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented trial was seen as a sign of the determination
of the new reformist government of President Abdurrahman Wahid to
crack down on human rights abuses by the Indonesian army, which has
been waging a war against separatist rebels in Aceh for the past 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government and rebels agreed in Switzerland to
start the first formal cease-fire in the conflict. It will begin
June 2 and last for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ruslan Dahlan announced the guilty verdicts after calling
an unscheduled session of the court proceedings on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the defendants have been guilty of murder,'' Ruslan said
during the hour-long session.
</P>
<P>
   He sentenced 10 soldiers and one civilian to 8{ years in jail.
Thirteen other soldiers received nine-year sentences, and another
was sentenced to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-ranking defendant, Capt. Anton Yuliantoro, was among
those sentenced to 8{ years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of armed soldiers and policemen were deployed around
the court building and in surrounding streets during the court
session. After the verdicts were announced, the five judges were
driven in an armored personnel carrier to the airport and flown out
of the province.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers and their civilian guide were found guilty of
murdering 56 students and one teacher from an Islamic boarding
school in the village of Beutong Ateuh in central Aceh in June.
Some of the victims were executed in a field near the school after
the military tried to capture the teacher, Teungku Bantaqiah, a
well-known activist for the separatist Free Aceh Movement.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 people have been killed in the fighting in Aceh
in the last decade, including 350 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Embittered by perceived economic exploitation and an Indonesian
military crackdown, the rebels are fighting not only for
independence, but also for a greater share of the profits from
their oil-rich region, and the right to impose Islamic religious
laws on the Acehnese people.

<HEADLINE> Two Dead in Ballpark Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OZARK, Ala. (AP) -- A man walked into a baseball park Tuesday
night and shot to death his ex-wife and her boyfriend in front of
hundreds of children and their parents, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The man then shot and critically wounded himself.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Tony Spivey said the shooting stemmed from a
custody dispute. He said at least 200 people witnessed the shooting
at the Fuqua ballpark in Ozark, 75 miles southeast of Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect used a 12-gauge shotgun and fired 10 shots at the
victims, WFSA-TV reported. When the shotgun jammed, he pulled out a
.22-caliber pistol and shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''We bring our kids to the ball field, ball is a big thing in
Ozark,'' witness Theresa Moates told the television station. ''It's
just scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was listed in critical condition late Tuesday.
Several bystanders were treated for shock at a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were withholding the names of the victims and the
gunman.

<HEADLINE> Dominicans Vote for President  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Left-leaning populist
Hipolito Mejia declared himself a winner Wednesday on early results
in presidential elections marked by heavy voter turnout and
frustration with the government's inability to reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
   With 27.7 percent of polling stations counted, Mejia's
opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party and its allies had 49
percent, or 373,368 votes, to 26.7 percent, or 203,356 votes, for
former President Joaquin Balaguer of the conservative Social
Christian Reformist party. Free-market advocate Danilo Medina of
the incumbent Dominican Liberation Party trailed with 23.67
percent, or 180,254 votes. Smaller parties split the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia needs more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off
election on June 30. Final results were expected Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reported lack of the needed 1 percent, Mejia
declared victory at his campaign headquarters, where supporters
cheered wildly as he assured: ''We have gotten more than the 50
percent and we continue to increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Police reported two deaths that appeared to be related to the
elections, but voting was otherwise peaceful and turnout was
massive throughout the Caribbean nation of 8 million people. In
Santo Domingo, guards scuffled with reporters covering 93-year-old
Balaguer as he cast his own vote in his quest for an eighth term as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4.3 million Dominicans were registered to vote, with women
casting ballots in the morning and men in the afternoon under a
system designed to prevent repeat voting.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters saw the election as a chance to spread the wealth of
a four-year economic boom under President Leonel Fernandez, who by
law couldn't seek a consecutive term. The economy grew by almost 40
percent under Fernandez, but the median per capita income is just
$2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This government is good, I suppose -- but for the poor people,
nothing has happened,'' said Rosa Nereda Garcia, 49, as she waited
to vote at the Socorro Sanchez School in Santo Domingo's Villa
Duarte neighborhood. The voter line wrapped around the block and
zigzagged through the school grounds as police and soldiers, armed
with rifles, stood watch.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, 59, the owner of an agrochemical business, capitalized on
popular resentment, promising social programs and small
community-level public works projects to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Medina, a 48-year-old career technocrat, ran a lackluster
campaign, insisting with little passion that benefits eventually
will trickle down.
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer, considered a master political strategist despite his
years and frail health, offered to ''govern as I have always
governed'' -- which critics say means a return to authoritarian
control and patronage.
</P>
<P>
   A scuffle erupted when Balaguer's car pulled up to a voting
station and was immediately surrounded by news media. Guards toting
rifles and nightsticks shoved reporters away as elections officials
delivered a ballot and ballot box to the car; a hand inside the car
took the ballot and passed it back moments later.
</P>
<P>
   ''Balaguer! We need you!'' a man screamed as Balaguer's car
quickly pulled away. Several people were splashed with red ink from
a bottle used to mark voters' fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Balaguer was forced from power under pressure from the United
States after international observers accused him of stealing the
1994 election. In 1996, he threw his weight behind Fernandez to
prevent a victory for his longtime foes in the Revolutionary Party
-- an alliance local analysts say would recur in a second round this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported that a man was shot and killed Tuesday during an
argument with a rival party supporter in the southwestern town of
San Juan de la Maguana. A 76-year-old woman died of a heart attack,
apparently after being shoved by a guard at a polling station in a
Santo Domingo neighborhood, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents reported confusion at some polling stations, with
elections officials reporting about 100,000 voters had not picked
up their voter cards by election day.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Baker arrived at one Santo Domingo voting station with her
3-year-old son at 5 a.m., cast her ballot, then was prohibited from
leaving because her name didn't appear on the rolls. ''This is
chaos,'' she grumbled.

<HEADLINE> Prince Reclaims His Name  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget the symbol, erase the acronym. The artist
formerly known as Prince announced Tuesday that he will be, now and
forever, known again as Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Dec. 31, 1999, my publishing contract with Warner-Chappell
expired, thus emancipating the name I was given before birth --
Prince -- from all long-term restrictive documents,'' the
freshly-minted Prince told a crowded news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will now go back to using my name instead of the symbol I
adopted to free myself from all undesirable relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   That was easy, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Prince's re-renaming kicked off a quirky, hour-long news
conference where the Minneapolis rocker -- whose real name is Prince
Rogers Nelson -- made an assortment of announcements -- including a
weeklong party in his hometown dubbed ''Prince: A Celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the event, his Paisley Park recording studio will be
opened for tours June 7-13, with a special Prince concert set for
June 13 at Northrop Auditorium. A new Prince song, ''Cybersingle,''
will also be available on his Web site, as will be a modified
version of his last album, titled ''Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic.'
</P>
<P>
   The return to the Prince name ends a seven-year battle between
the performer and Warner Bros. Records, which had Prince under
contract through the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Prince, charging that Warner Bros. exercised too much control
over his music, switched his name to a symbol in 1993. With the
contract now over, Prince said he's confident there are no new
names in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will I be changing my name ever again?'' the 41-year-old
diminutive rocker mused. ''No, I won't have to, because I won't be
under any restrictive long-term contract again.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter addressed him as Prince, he interrupted: ''Hi,
Prince. That sounds great. I haven't heard that in a while.''

Putin's Pick for Premier Questioned
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian lawmakers questioned President Vladimir Putin's
nominee for prime minister Tuesday, a day before a parliamentary vote on the
appointment that he appeared certain to win. Nearly all parties in the
centrist-dominated lower house of parliament, the State Duma, said they would
support the candidacy of Mikhail Kasyanov, a pro-reform politician expected to
focus on the economy. The vote was scheduled for Wednesday. Kasyanov has
effectively led the Cabinet since early January, when Putin -- then both acting
president and prime minister -- made him first deputy prime minister.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Thousands of Metallica fans booted by the online music
sharing software company Napster for allegedly swapping the heavy metal band's
music want their access restored. Napster Inc. said Tuesday it received notice
from more than 30,000 MusicShare software users claiming they were misidentified
as people who had illegally traded Metallica's copyrighted songs in the popular
MP3 digital format. If Metallica does not take legal action against individual
users within 10 days of Tuesday's notice, Napster will restore those blocked

Fed Hikes Interest Rate a Half Point

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates Tuesday by a
bold half point, pushing a key rate to its highest level in nine years. Fed
policy-makers signaled they were prepared to move even more aggressively if
needed to fight inflation. The central bank raised its target for the federal
funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, to 6.5 percent. It was
the sixth time the Fed has increased the funds rate since last June but the
first half-point move. All the other rate changes were smaller quarter-point
increases.

first lady as she was introduced on stage at a downtown arena before an audience

stepped back as Mrs. Clinton moved to the microphone and accepted the unanimous

Dalai Lama Ready for Autonomy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The Dalai Lama said Tuesday he was seeking autonomy
and not independence for Tibet, but that officially atheistic China must not
have control over spiritual issues. ''China maintains strict control over all
aspects, including cultural and spiritual,'' the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader
said. ''Those fields that we in Tibet can manage, we should manage.'' The 1989
Nobel Peace Prize winner was making his first stop on a swing through
Scandinavia. He was to meet Wednesday with Prime Minister Goeran Persson despite
objections by China, which controls Tibet and sees the Dalai Lama as a rallying

congressman said in announcing his long-awaited decision. Rangel's choice was

trade bill tomorrow, were looking to him for guidance in the election-year

<HEADLINE> Pimlico Owners File Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Less than a week before the running of the
Preakness, the owners of Pimlico Race Course have filed a lawsuit
against the track's insurance company, trying to force it to pay
for damage from an electrical fire and power outage on the day of
the race two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The fire cast a pall over the running of the Preakness in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, by Maryland Jockey Club of Baltimore City Inc. and
Pimlico Racing Association Inc. against American Casualty Co. of
Reading, Pa., was filed Monday in Baltimore Circuit Court and seeks
damages ''in excess of $467,763.89.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the insurance company were not immediately
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Real Quiet won the Preakness in 1998, a transformer
serving Pimlico's grandstand blew, causing an outage that crippled
the air-conditioning system, closed pari-mutuel windows and
darkened stairwells.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Jockey Club, which owns Pimlico, and Pimlico Racing
Association, which owns Maryland Jockey Club, applied for
reimbursement for losses, but American Casualty refused to pay, the
suit says.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter in August, the insurance company said it would not
pay the claim because Pimlico's policy covers loss of damage by
fire, and not electrical current, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that a fire in an electrical transformer in
the track's parking lot led to the outage.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in March before the city Planning Commission,
Pimlico representatives outlined a five-year, multimillion-dollar
improvement plan for the track, which was built in 1870 and
received its only major refurbishing in 1954. They said at the time
that they would spend $1 million to remedy fire-code violations
found by city inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 4, Angels 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Scott Erickson won for the first time
since elbow surgery, and Albert Belle and Mike Bordick homered as
the Baltimore Orioles beat the Anaheim Angels 4-3 Tuesday night to
stop a seven-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson (1-1) allowed three runs and nine hits in seven innings
in his third start since bone chips were removed from his right
elbow on March 3. In his previous two outings, he allowed 12 earned
runs in 8 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson improved to 16-4 against the Angels, becoming the first
Orioles starter to win in 15 games since Mike Mussina's complete
game against Texas on April 29. Mike Timlin got three outs for his
third save.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Conine nearly homered in the eighth, but left fielder Darin
Erstad leaped above the fence in left-center to pull it back.
Delino DeShields scored after doubling and crossing to third on
Belle's fly to right, a ball that Tim Salmon stopped from becoming
a home run when he ran it down at the short fence near the foul
pole.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Bottenfield (3-4) gave up four runs and seven hits in 7 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Conine's sacrifice fly, on reliever Mark Petkovsek's first pitch
of the game, marked the first of 16 inherited runner this season
that Petkovsek has allowed to score.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who opened the scoring in the second inning on
Belle's leadoff homer, tied the score at 3 in the sixth when Brady
Anderson led off with a single and Bordick followed with a drive
into the left-field bullpen for his eighth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Belle opened the scoring with his fifth homer, leading off the
second. But he committed his first fielding error in 34 starts in
right field this season during the Angels' two-run fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After one-out singles by Bengie Molina and Benji Gil, Erstad
lined a single to right. Molina was held at third by coach Ron
Roenicke, but continued home when Belle bobbled the ball. Gil
tagged up and advanced to third on Adam Kennedy's fly to right,
then scored Anaheim's third run on Mo Vaughn's single under the
glove of Conine at first.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tuesday marked four years since The Walt Disney Co. became
managing partner of the Angels, following more than 35 years of
ownership by Gene Autry. Since then, their record is 309-339. ...
Cal Ripken Jr. was noncommittal when asked if his current back
problem would have ended his consecutive game playing streak, had
it occurred before he had a chance to break Lou Gehrig's record.
''There are different levels of pain,'' said Ripken, whose streak
of 2,632 games ended on Sept. 20, 1998. ''The reason I stopped
playing then was that I couldn't play. The reason I had surgery
(last September) was that I had to have it, and the reason why I
haven't played the last four days was because I couldn't.'' ...
With Ripken in town, it should be noted that no Angels player ever
appeared in more than 648 consecutive games. That record belongs to
Sandy Alomar Sr., who began his streak exactly 31 years ago
Tuesday. ... Belle, who has five homers and 20 RBIs, is trying to
join Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx and as the only major leaguers with at
least nine consecutive seasons of 30 or more home runs and 100 or
more RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Hornacek Gets Kudos From Everyone  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Utah Jazz will miss his dead-on
jumpers. And even opposing fans, as it turns out, will miss the
competitive desire of Jeff Hornacek.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Hornacek talks himself out of retirement, the 6-foot-4
shooting guard played the final game of his 14-year career Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''This organization has been great to me and my family, and I've
had a long career that I never anticipated,'' Hornacek said after
the Jazz were eliminated from the playoffs by the Portland Trail
Blazers, 81-79.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Garden fans, roaring amid flying confetti, took a few
moments to salute Hornacek when the public-address announcer said
Hornacek had played his final game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be tough not seeing 14 out there,'' said
teammate Karl Malone, who teamed with Hornacek and John Stockton to
lead the Jazz to the NBA Finals in 1997 and '98, when they lost to
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next year, it'll be 12,'' Malone said, referring to the jersey
number of Stockton, then his own. ''Then, who knows? It'll be 32.
All great careers come to an end. We understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek undoubtedly could play at least another season, but
anyone who wonders why he's hanging it up only needed to see his
three children near him at the postgame interview table. Hornacek
had said a silent hello to them every time he stepped to the
free-throw line when he wiped the side of his face before taking a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is sad that I won't be out there anymore,'' he said. ''It
will give me a chance to spend more time with these guys and my
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek, a former walk-on at Iowa State, played his first six
seasons with Phoenix before going to Philadelphia in the Charles
Barkley trade. He was traded to Utah in 1994. His best year
statistically was his last with the Suns, when he averaged 20.1
points.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek, who turned 37 earlier this month, went out strong with
one of his best seasons. He finished second in the NBA in 3-point
shooting (.478) and led the league in free-throw percentage (.950).
Only Calvin Murphy (.958, in 1980-81) and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (.956
in 1993-94) had a better year at the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my opinion, he goes down as one of the best shotmakers of
all time,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said. ''I've been known to
play a good game of HORSE, but he'd be the best guy around.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek was tenacious, resourceful and anything but flashy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, people waited until this year to recognize what
a great player he is,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. ''It seems
they are more preoccupied with who makes the slam dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek said he wore the blue-collar label with pride.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always played as hard as I could to be successful,'' he
said. ''The hard work paid off, and I stuck around 14 years.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers 87, Suns 65  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers rediscovered their
defense Tuesday night. They found a killer instinct, too.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal had 15 points, 21 rebounds and three blocked
shots despite sitting out the fourth quarter as the Lakers
humiliated the Phoenix Suns 87-65 to win the best-of-seven Western
Conference semifinals in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who won an NBA-high 67 games during the regular
season, face Portland in the best-of-seven conference finals,
starting Saturday at Staples Center. The Trail Blazers eliminated
the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night, also in five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were a beaten team by late in the second quarter, and
it showed in their body language after they continued to miss shot
after shot, many unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had two 10-0 runs in the period on their way to a
49-23 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 23 points tied the playoff record for futility in a half set
by Utah in the second half of a 96-54 loss to Chicago Bulls on June
7, 1998 in the NBA Finals. The 54 points are the playoff record low
for a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns, who had 71 points at halftime of the Game 4 victory,
also tied the playoff record for futility in a second quarter, when
they scored nine to the Lakers' 28.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix shot 2-of-17 in the second quarter (11.8 percent), and
8-of-37 in the half (21.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant scored 17 points and Glen Rice added 14 for the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Day led the Suns with 10 points, all but two in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd, who had 22 points, 10 rebounds and 16 assists for
his first playoff triple-double in Game 4, was held to eight
points, seven rebounds and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson and Anfernee Hardaway, Phoenix's other big guns,
each scored eight points.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns forced a fifth game by beating the Lakers 117-98 in
Phoenix on Sunday. The 117 points are a season-high for a Los
Angeles opponent this season, and the Suns led at halftime 71-48.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the loss prompted veteran Los Angeles guard Ron
Harper, a member of three championship teams with the Bulls, to say
the Lakers played absolutely no defense in Game 4, and lacked a
killer instinct.
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly a different story Tuesday night in both
departments.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led 68-40 entering the fourth quarter, and reserves
played much of the final period for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant scored five straight points, and Rice followed with a
3-point shot to give the Lakers a 14-6 lead, and they were on top
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   At one point early in the second quarter, in apparent
frustration, Kidd threw up a jump shot several seconds after a foul
had been called. Appropriately, he missed.
</P>
<P>
   As the score mounted, the Suns committed several unforced
turnovers in continuing to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson picked up his third foul three minutes into the second
quarter, and sat out the remainder of the half. Nevertheless, his
five points in the opening 24 minutes were a team high.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The NBA record for fewest points in a half in a regular
season game is 19 by the Los Angeles Clippers against the Lakers
last Dec. 14. The Lakers big three of O'Neal, Bryant and Rice
scored their team's first 18 points. No other Laker scored until
Harper made a layup with 50 seconds left in the first quarter. ...
The Lakers finished the season with an 8-1 record against the Suns.
... The Lakers are 6-0 in playoff games at Staples Center, and have
won 23 of 24 home games since a 95-91 loss to Portland on Jan. 22.
... The Suns' previous playoff low for a game was 70 points in a
15-points loss at San Antonio last month. ... The Lakers and Trail
Blazers were 2-2 against each other this season, with each team
going 1-1 on its home court. ... Robinson surpassed his playoff
career high twice in this series with a 30-point effort in Game 2
and a 32-point performance in Game 4. He was never a factor in Game
5, shooting 3-of-11.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 9, Twins 5  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Jay Buhner hit a two-run homer and Edgar Martinez
drove in three runs in the Seattle Mariners' 9-5 victory over the
Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Meche struck out a career-high eight batters to pick up his
first victory of the season for the Mariners, who have outscored
the Twins 23-5 in the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner, off to a strong start after two injury-filled seasons,
hit his eighth homer in the first inning off Sean Bergman (2-2)
after Martinez hit a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Meche (1-4), who won eight games for Seattle last season after
being called up in July, pitched 6 2-3 innings, allowed three runs
on six hits and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman, who got hit on the left shin by Alex Rodriguez's hard
grounder in the first, went 3 1-3 innings and gave up nine runs on
eight hits and five walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins scored their first run in the third when Cristian
Guzman walked and Jay Canizaro hit a double. Guzman scored on Matt
Lawton's sacrifice fly to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the third, Martinez had an RBI single, giving
him eight RBIs in two nights. He had two homers and five RBIs in a
14-0 victory Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, David Bell hit a two-run double and Rodriguez hit
a two-run single to give Seattle a 9-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey and Jacque Jones each hit doubles to lead off the
seventh for Minnesota's second run. Pinch-hitter Denny Hocking
singled off Arthur Rhodes for the Twins' third run.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Ron Coomer, who went 3-for-5, homered off Jose
Paniagua in the eighth, and added an RBI single off Jose Mesa in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Buhner hit his 28th homer against Minnesota, his
second-highest career total against one team. He has 29 against
Oakland. ... The Mariners sent 10 men to the plate in the fourth,
the second time they batted around in two games. ... Bell has hit
safely in seven of his last eight, all multihit games. ...
Rodriguez has a 12-game hitting streak. His career-best hitting
streak is 20, set in 1996. ... John Olerud walked four times. ...
The Twins have issued 16 walks in the first two games of the
series. ... Seattle moved back into first place in the AL West,
while Minnesota suffered its fourth straight loss. ... The crowd of
25,672 was the second lowest at Safeco Field.

<HEADLINE> Rowland announces grant for business development  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- Million-dollar development projects
like Hartford's Adriaen's Landing may draw people to the cities,
but corporate and civic leaders say strengthening smaller
businesses is necessary to keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland on Tuesday announced a $5 million grant to
help small businesses, part of a revitalization strategy for the
state's five largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the big type of project that commands headlines, said
Ken Decko, president of the Connecticut Business and Industry
Association, a business trade association with 10,000 members.
''But it's the type that if successfully implemented, will provide
jobs and help the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment under 3 percent and hundreds of new companies
moving into the state in the last two to three years, ''We are in
the most perfect position to revitalize the cities,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the program provides incentives for investment in
inner-city business and services for small business owners. Jobs
training focuses not just on getting workers ready for an initial
position, but on preparing them to move into executive roles and
one day start businesses of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The program also calls for inner-city businesses to form
''clusters'' to share operating costs, information and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide initiatives are designed to complement plans
tailored for each city by corporate, government and civic leaders.
In Hartford, corporations and businesses schools are joining to
coordinate support services for inner-city entrepreneurs.
Manufacturers in both Bridgeport and Waterbury have partnered to
address modernization, shrinking markets and a shortage of skilled
workers.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven's plan focuses on using the city's university and
research facilities to create a presence in the biotechnology and
information technology fields. New Britain plans to establish a
health care training center to provide staff for local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The state funding is just a boost to the revitalization effort,
officials said. The strategy relies heavily on contributions of
time and money from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone complains about the condition of the cities -- the
high taxes, the traffic, the young people not coming back,''
Rowland said. ''Our complaining days are behind us. We're into the
productive days now.''

<HEADLINE> State Supreme Court to consider Millstone appeals  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Connecticut Supreme Court will review disputes between
environmental groups and the operator of the Millstone nuclear
power complex.
</P>
<P>
   The high court took from the state Appellate Court three cases
that allege the nuclear reactors emit illegal pollution discharges
and are damaging the Long Island Sound fishery.
</P>
<P>
   Lower courts ruled in favor of Northeast Utilities, the operator
of the three-reactor complex in Waterford.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups from Connecticut and Long Island, N.Y. aim
to shut down the reactors or curb their operation during fish
spawning season.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Burton, a lawyer for Fish Unlimited and other
environmental groups bringing the claims, said she is pleased the
Supreme Court is taking up the cases. Three hours of arguments are
scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The spotlight shines brighter on the Supreme Court,'' Burton
said.
</P>
<P>
   NU spokesman Joe Pillittere said the Berlin-based utility looks
forward to arguing the merits of the cases in court. The company
declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Television Network, which is a Connecticut
version of the cable TV channel C-SPAN, has applied to cover the
arguments for broadcast. The Supreme Court will review any
objections to the broadcast before deciding whether to allow a
camera in its chamber.
</P>
<P>
   One case involves a 1998 settlement between NU and the state
Department of Environmental Protection over alleged violations of
Millstone's water discharge permit. The $1.2 million settlement
included a $700,000 fine and a $500,000 donation to environmental
causes, including Mystic Marinelife Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Fish Unlimited claims the settlement violates public policy and
amounts to collusion between NU and the DEP. The group also claims
the aquarium is an improper beneficiary of settlement funds.
</P>
<P>
   A second appeal relates to allegations that Millstone Unit 2's
cooling system is damaging the winter flounder fishery in Niantic
Bay and Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit by Fish Unlimited sought to shut down the plant until
a cooling system was installed that would recirculate water from
the sound instead of drawing in fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   NU has said that its nuclear plant cooling systems have a
negligible impact on the fish population.
</P>
<P>
   A Hartford Superior Court judge last year blamed overfishing --
and not the plant -- for the drop in fish and allowed the plant to
restart.
</P>
<P>
   The third appeal deals with allegations that the DEP has issued
an improper wastewater discharge permit to the Millstone complex.
The environmental groups claim the permit is invalid since the
complex was idled for months because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   NU has said it has the proper permits. Millstone Unit 1 is being
decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   Other parties to the appeals include the Green Party of
Connecticut; Don't Waste Connecticut; Standing For the Truth About
Radiation of East Hampton, N.Y.; the North Fork Environmental
Coalition of Mattituck, N.Y.; New York State Assemblyman Fred
Thiele of Long Island and the town of East Hampton, N.Y.

<HEADLINE> You can call him Prince ... and this time, he means it  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was a simple greeting from a reporter: ''Hi,
Prince.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That sounds great,'' the artist once again known as Prince
replied Tuesday at a Manhattan news conference. ''I haven't heard
that in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, to be exact, when he swapped his given name of
Prince Rogers Nelson for an unpronounceable symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget the symbol and erase his acronym (TAFKAP). The
artist says he will, now and forever, spell his name P-R-I-N-C-E.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Dec. 31, 1999, my publishing contract with Warner-Chappell
expired, thus emancipating the name I was given before birth --
Prince -- from all long-term restrictive documents,'' the
freshly-minted Prince told the crowded press event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will now go back to using my name instead of the symbol I
adopted to free myself from all undesirable relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   That was easy, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Prince's re-renaming kicked off a quirky, hour-long news
conference where the Minneapolis rocker made an assortment of
announcements -- including plans for a weeklong party dubbed
''Prince: A Celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the event, his Paisley Park studio will be opened for
tours between June 7-13, with a special Prince concert set for June
13 at Northrup Auditorium in Minneapolis. A new Prince song,
''Cybersingle,'' will also be available at his web site, as will a
modified version of his last album, titled ''Rave In2 the Joy
Fantastic.'
</P>
<P>
   The return to the Prince name ends a 7-year battle between the
performer and Warner Bros. Records, which had Prince under contract
through the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Prince, charging that Warner Bros. exercised too much control
over his music, switched his name to a symbol in 1993. With the
contract now over, Prince said he's confident that are no new names
in his future.
</P>
<P>
   Prince also touched on a variety of other subjects, from his
marriage to his future touring plans to his search for
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   -- On his marriage to similarly single-named Mayte: ''We're still
friends ... The clearest I can put it is she does her thing, and I
do my thing, and sometimes we do our thing together.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On his immediate plans: ''My main concern now is to study
things of a spiritual nature.'' Asked to amplify his answer: ''It's
pretty personal.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On his ''weird'' persona: ''I've never thought of myself as
weird. And people who know me don't think I'm weird either. How you
perceive me is how you perceive me.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince later added that he would continue his fight against what
he perceives as major label domination of the nation's music scene.
</P>
<P>
   He promised, with a sly smile, not to ''give up the store to
Forrest Gump accounting firms who think a royalty check is like a
box of chocolates. You never know what you'll get.''

<HEADLINE> Brother of Mexican Candidate Brash  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS MOCHIS, Mexico (AP) -- Mexico has a long tradition of
''uncomfortable brothers'' -- siblings of presidents who cause
embarrassment or enrich themselves using their family's name.
</P>
<P>
   But never has a president had such a brash, open, unabashedly
redneck brother as Eduardo Labastida. At 64, he is six years older
than Francisco Labastida, the man who is in a neck-and-neck race to
be Mexico's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo likes to bet on cockfights and horse races. He likes to
drink. He has a direct sense of humor and makes no apologies. But
he denies news reports that he has been involved in shady business
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon interview on his farm in the northwestern state
of Sinaloa, Eduardo Labastida came off as a fun-loving good ol'
boy. He smelled of alcohol, and repeatedly slapped a reporter on
the arm as he joked about his relationship with Francisco, the
candidate of Mexico's ruling party in the July 2 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was the ''uncomfortable brother,'' Eduardo
laughed, then turned the tables on his brother Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The uncomfortable brother is him,'' he deadpanned. ''Because
he doesn't let me play the cocks and the horses. He forbid me.''
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida also laughed when asked about his brother's
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've told him to stay away from the cockfights, but he likes
them,'' he said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers are reminded of former President Carter's
colorful brother, Billy.
</P>
<P>
   A successful peanut farmer, Billy caused his brother
considerable embarrassment during his 1976-80 administration. He
once defined himself as a beer-drinking good ol' boy and put his
name on a brand of beer.
</P>
<P>
   He participated in a Canadian bellyflop competition, jumping in
with a can of beer in his hand and a rose between his teeth. And he
caused serious controversy with racist remarks and by accepting
money from Libya to pay off personal debts.
</P>
<P>
   The sins of Mexican brothers tend to be a bit more serious, just
as the power of Mexican presidents has been broader over the ruling
party's 71 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of former President Carlos
Salinas, is serving a 27-year sentence at a maximum-security prison
for masterminding the murder of a ruling-party rival, and has $114
million frozen in Swiss banks, allegedly profits from drug ties
during his brother's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Rodolfo Zedillo, brother of President Ernesto Zedillo, has been
sued for fraud for his construction businesses. He also reportedly
has been involved in shady real-estate deals with the Mexican army
during the current administration.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo concedes his farming business has done well as his
brother has risen through the political ranks, but says he has
never used government money or political influence.
</P>
<P>
   His booming farming business grows hot peppers, zucchini and
potatoes for the domestic market and for export to Japan and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started with (166 acres) and a pickup truck and now I farm''
3,954 acres, he said. ''I've done that by using my head -- and a lot
of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labastida family is from Los Mochis, a farming city on the
Pacific coast of Sinaloa state, of which Labastida was governor
from 1987-92.
</P>
<P>
   Still living there are brothers Eduardo and Juan Enrique.
Brother Jaime and sisters Gloria Luz and Blanca Guadalupe live in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Enrique also is a farmer, and has been accused of shady
dealings. An outstanding debt of his reportedly was covered by a
multibillion-dollar bank bailout, although he and Francisco both
deny that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan Enrique had a loan he couldn't pay back -- he's a farmer --
but he already presented collateral for the credit,'' the candidate
said.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida said none of his brothers held positions in
his government in Sinaloa state, so their alleged shortcomings are
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've never been involved in any official activity,'' he
said. ''They weren't before, and they certainly won't now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eduardo said the reason he didn't hold a position was
because he didn't want to.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had wanted opportunities, we've never lacked for them,''
he said. ''But we've never wanted them. No relative has ever done
business backed by the government.''

<HEADLINE> Chaos at Sierra Leone's Front Line  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASIAKA, Sierra Leone (AP) -- In the heat of the midday sun, at
the last highway junction before rebel country, young men with
glassy eyes sit in the shade of what's left of the Bond Street
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket launchers lie at their feet. Automatic rifles are cradled
in their hands, or stand propped against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   From their patio headquarters -- an orange and blue building
pocked with bullet holes and blasted by explosive rounds -- they
look over a town wracked by combat, littered with spent shell
casings and emptied of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Few of these men have much training, fewer still have uniforms.
Their notion of discipline often comes down to little more than
testosterone-fueled wars of will, with semi-soldiers shouting and
posturing and pointing their guns at one another.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of the people in the towns and villages outside
Freetown, the heavily guarded capital of this West African nation,
they are the protectors.
</P>
<P>
   ''These boys are fighting for us,'' said Abdul Kalokoh, one of
the small number of residents in town on a recent afternoon,
digging through his hut for food to carry back into the jungle,
where he was hiding from Sierra Leone's rebels. ''I want to come
back'' to Masiaka, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the two-lane highway from Freetown, where the city fades
quickly into small towns, palm plantations, thatch-roofed villages
and finally dense jungle, Masiaka is a key crossroad tying the
capital, about 45 miles to the west, to the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Until early May, a few thousand people lived here. Then, when
the Revolutionary United Front rebels launched an attack on
Freetown, Masiaka emptied, its people fleeing toward the capital or
into the surrounding forests.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels briefly held the town before Sierra Leone's ragged
military units -- its army, ousted junta soldiers and militia of
pro-government traditional hunters known as the Kamajors -- joined
to fight them back.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the rebels have launched attacks on Masiaka every
few days, most recently on Sunday, but have been repulsed each time
by the pro-government forces who are trying to push them further
away from Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   While the town is very tense, with soldiers watching for
possible guerrilla attacks or highway ambushes, it is also fairly
quiet, with more squabbling among its defenders than shooting from
the forest.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters form an unlikely combination. The army, allied with
the Kamajors, had fought the junta, allied with the rebels, just a
couple years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And none of them were even supposed to have guns. According to
the July peace accord that ended Sierra Leone's civil war and
brought the rebels into a rocky power-sharing government, all the
country's fighters were to be disarmed, and thousands of U.N.
peacekeepers were watch over the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament, though, limped along from the start and
thousands of fighters held onto their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, apparently emboldened by the departure of a
Nigerian-led intervention force that acted as the country's de
facto army, the rebels began attacking the peacekeepers, eventually
taking hundreds captive along with their vehicles, weapons and
uniforms. A few days later, the RUF launched its attack on
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a summons from ousted junta leader Johnny Paul
Koroma, the streets of Freetown were soon buzzing with commandeered
cars sprouting machine-gun barrels from every window. The Kamajors,
rural mystics who believe they can protect themselves in combat
with elaborate charms, began patrolling the city fully armed.
</P>
<P>
   But if such pictures would fuel fears of anarchy in the West,
many Sierra Leoenans welcomed the fighters back, seeing the U.N.
peacekeepers as useless protectors. Koroma, vilified just a few
years earlier after his forces ravaged Freetown following his 1997
coup, became a hero.
</P>
<P>
   For all their differences, the fighters are linked by a virulent
hatred for the RUF. It's a hatred that could, some say, enable the
rebels to finally be crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all brothers now, except for the RUF, because they want
to kill all of us,'' said Lt. Abu Conteh, the 29-year-old Masiaka
commander. ''You tell the government'' we will take the main rebel
bases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Sierra Leoneans live in terror of the RUF, who during the
eight-year civil war mutilated victims by the thousands in a brutal
campaign of terror, hacking limbs from children as young as 2 and 3
years old.
</P>
<P>
   But Masiaka's soldiers don't look much like protectors. Even by
regional standards, where many armies are composed of poorly
trained and miserably paid men, many fighters seem more like gang
members than soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   They spend much of their days lounging at checkpoints, harassing
the few passers-by for change or cigarettes, drinking beer or small
plastic baggies of gin or smoking marijuana. Shouting matches among
the different units is common.
</P>
<P>
   Conteh, a 12-year army veteran whose serious demeanor often
seems out of place amid his raucous fighters, insists the forces
are serious soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking at a large-caliber shell casing lying on the asphalt, he
says they eventually will defeat the rebels: ''This is a cohesive
force that must be reckoned with.''

<HEADLINE> NYC School Chief Has New Approach  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The man picked to run the nation's biggest
school system has never been a teacher and does not have a degree
in education. But the former banking executive notes that he has a
lot of experience dealing with ''screw-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The parallels with my corporate jobs are obvious: I want to
make sure the enterprise is run with a degree of humanity, but
tightly,'' said Harold Levy, a 47-year-old New Yorker who has been
interim chancellor of the New York City school system for the past
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was expected to win Board of Education approval today to
run the 1.1 million-student system, which is plagued by guns, rats,
crumbling buildings, low test scores, an exodus of teachers, an
unyielding bureaucracy and an organization chart that looks like a
plumbing diagram.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, he supports raises for the district's 78,000
teachers, whose starting pay averages $31,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   He has also tried to appeal to students and administrators'
higher faculties.
</P>
<P>
   Levy sent poems by Wallace Stevens to the city's 43 school
superintendents, with a memo telling them he is interested in ''the
inner souls of people.'' Then he arranged a group violin lesson for
them at Carnegie Hall with virtuoso Isaac Stern to impress upon
them how difficult it is to learn -- and how music can be the
ultimate teaching tool.
</P>
<P>
   ''Art and music are the hook by which we get the attention of
students who might otherwise drift away,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers union president Randi Weingarten said that raising
salaries ''is the only way to solve the biggest teacher shortage
we've ever faced, by attracting better ones.'' She pointed out that
New York City teacher salaries are about 25 percent lower on
average than those in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The private sector has outbid us when they want people with
similar skills,'' Weingarten said. ''Levy sees that. He's a strong
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy was named interim chancellor after the previous chancellor
left amid policy clashes with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. After a
nationwide search, all of the other candidates apparently decided
they had little chance against him.
</P>
<P>
   On teacher salaries, Levy could run into opposition from
Giuliani, who firmly controls the Board of Education's $10.6
billion budget. Giuliani supports raises based on teacher merit, as
judged by their students' performance.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education member Ninfa Segarra, a Giuliani ally, said
she is not thrilled that Levy is the only candidate for chancellor.
And she suggested Levy is wasting time by talking poetry.
</P>
<P>
   She said he was hired for his corporate expertise, not for his
intellectual prowess, and ''he has a very limited amount of time to
do some very critical things.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy -- wearing an impeccably tailored dark suit and tasseled
dress shoes during a recent interview -- is on leave as director of
global compliance for Citigroup. Before that, he was the chief
litigator at Salomon Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   At Citigroup, ''I was in charge of screw-ups,'' Levy, an earthy
figure who occasionally drops four-letter words into the
conversation, said with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   He was also on the state Board of Regents, which oversees exams
required for high school graduation, before being named to the
$245,000-a-year post as chancellor. He is married, with two
children, a 6-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter, who goes to a
private school.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education headquarters building in Brooklyn may
itself be a metaphor for the state of the school system. It is
Kafkaesque labyrinth of rooms connected by long, dreary corridors.
</P>
<P>
   The day Levy first arrived, he said, ''it was filthy. There was
garbage in the halls. The word that leapt out was Windex!'' In his
office, he found two air conditioners going full blast, even though
it was January and the temperature outside was well below the
freezing point.
</P>
<P>
   He was told the air conditioners were needed to regulate the
antiquated heating system.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Warn of TB Epidemic  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- World Health Organization researchers are warning
of a potential health crisis comparable to AIDS, saying a small
percentage of people worldwide have a resistant form of
tuberculosis that must be fought with stronger, more expensive
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't encourage countries to do a good treatment of TB,
then we will have an epidemic on our hands,'' said Dr. Marcos
Espinal, who led a study published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   TB is a contagious respiratory disease that kills an estimated 2
million people a year. If treated correctly, most cases are
curable.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined 6,402 TB cases at clinics in Russia, Peru,
China, South Korea and the Dominican Republic between 1994 and 1996
and found that about 5.5 percent did not respond to so-called
first-line drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs that could effectively treat these patients are much more
expensive and have to be taken for up to two years -- potential
barriers in some poor, developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   But failing to treat these patients could have catastrophic
results, particularly since TB tends to mutate into even more
resistant strains when treated incorrectly, said Espinal, a doctor
with WHO's communicable diseases program in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   If more countries do not correctly treat TB, the organization
estimates that nearly 1 billion people will be newly infected -- and
35 million will die -- in the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States from 1993 through 1998, 45 states and the
District of Columbia reported at least one case each of
multi-drug-resistant TB, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   While TB more commonly afflicts people in poorer, developing
countries, Espinal warned that because it is an airborne disease,
''TB can be in eight hours from Russia to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Another researcher agreed with Espinal's prognosis and called
drug-resistant TB a ''public health emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The genie of multi-drug-resistant TB is irreversibly out of
the bottle,'' Dr. C. Robert Horsburgh of Boston University's
Schools of Public Health and Medicine wrote in an accompanying
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Espinal said 119 of the 212 WHO member countries, including the
United States, have implemented or agreed to implement the
organization's TB-fighting plan, which calls for treatment with the
first-line drugs. Twenty-two countries representing 85 percent of
all TB cases -- including China, India, Brazil and Nigeria -- have
agreed to take part.
</P>
<P>
   WHO is also calling for an expansion of the TB-fighting plan
using treatments that are at least 350 more times more expensive
than first-line drugs such as isoniazid and rifampicin, which cost
$20 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   Already, India's health secretary has said that with an annual 2
million new cases in India alone, his government cannot keep pace
with the costs, estimated at $55 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   WHO estimates that 16 million people worldwide have
tuberculosis, and rates of infection are on the rise. WHO officials
estimate there were 8 million new cases of TB in 1997 alone. The
United States had 18,361 reported cases in 1998, according to the
CDC.

<HEADLINE> Schools Push Education for Profit  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- J.C. Huizenga's company uses
billboards, direct mail and videos to attract business. It offers
its employees stock options, and hopes to eventually go public.
</P>
<P>
   But Huizenga doesn't run a dot-com or a biotech startup. His
business is education and his customers are the children at his
National Heritage Academies charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   National Heritage is part of a trend across the country that has
become especially visible in Michigan: ''education management
organizations'' that run charter schools to educate students and
make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga, who has invested tens of millions of dollars of his
money in charter schools, says traditional public schools have
incentives to spend but little motivation to produce results.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the free-market system that's provided us with all of our
advances in technology, incredible breakthroughs in medical
technology,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His detractors worry that the three Rs -- not to mention
innovation and accountability -- could be sacrificed if the nation's
estimated 1,800 charter schools look instead to make a buck.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is the inherent tension between the company's bottom
line, which is profits, and education's bottom line, which is
students' work,'' says Heidi Steffens, an analyst with the National
Education Association, the largest teachers' union in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are funded by the state but run by others as
alternatives to traditional public education. They usually receive
funding from the state according to a ratio of the number of
students attending.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, 36 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico
have signed charter school legislation into law and more than
350,000 students nationwide are currently enrolled in such schools,
according to The Center for Education Reform.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the 170 charter schools in Michigan have
some type of for-profit management, compared with about one-tenth
of charter schools nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Charter school backers favor Michigan because it gives a higher
per-pupil reimbursement than many states and doesn't require the
schools to participate in the state pension plan, a big cost
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say for-profit companies have a long history of
operating school buses, custodial services and lunchrooms and
adding educational services is no different.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents contend that charter school students perform only
marginally better on standardized tests than children in
traditional public schools. Charter school advocates say the
research shows the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   There are also concerns about accountability -- including who
hires and fires teachers and the composition of charter school
boards -- as well as the financial arrangements between charter
schools and their backers.
</P>
<P>
   David Arsen, a professor of political economy at Michigan State
University, worries that charter schools don't have to disclose the
same detail in reporting public funds as traditional public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some for-profits, like Boston-based Advantage Schools, take a
prearranged percentage of the public funding provided for charter
schools. Others, like National Heritage, assume direct control over
nearly all the charter school's public funds, taking as profit
whatever is left after expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as my kids get the best that there is, go for it,''
said Bridget Reed, who sends her 9- and 7-year-old daughters to
National Heritage's Vista Academy in Grand Rapids. ''I'm not paying
tuition and my kids are getting a great education.''
</P>
<P>
   But some accuse the for-profits of failing to reach out to
at-risk or special-needs students because they are expensive to
educate and cut into profits. High school, which is more expensive
to operate than lower grades, is also less likely to be available.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Miron, an education researcher at Western Michigan
University, points to the lack of lunch programs and bus service at
some charter schools as ways to exclude students from
less-advantaged backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they can build a great school with less money, fine. But
when they select or they put in place structures to select
students, that's something different,'' Miron says.
</P>
<P>
   The charter school industry says competition is already
addressing some of the concerns.
</P>
<P>
   John McLaughlin, an educational consultant from Sioux Falls,
S.D., points to Advantage Schools, which targets urban areas and
promises one-on-one learning and higher test scores than the area's
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some niche approaches may be risky.
</P>
<P>
   National Heritage, which has extensively marketed its
morals-focused curriculum, is accused by some parents in a lawsuit
of violating the constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Among the allegations is that one of its 22 schools in Michigan
and North Carolina promoted a Christian mother's prayer group and
allowed a science teacher to teach creationism.
</P>
<P>
   National Heritage denies any wrongdoing but has since clarified
its policies to help staff and parent volunteers better understand
the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, meanwhile, are waiting to see whether there is money
to be made in education, which gets billions of dollars a year in
funding and is considered a key issue for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''For investors, the classic investment opportunity has been
where there's a problem. Companies who offer solutions are
rewarded,'' says Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Moe. ''And there's
no bigger problem in America than how to run our schools.''

<HEADLINE> Hostility, Heart Disease Linked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Young adults who scored high on a hostility test
were 2.5 times more likely to have signs of heart disease 10 years
later than those who were rated average or below, according to a
study in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers studied 374 people -- a nearly equal mix of men and
women, blacks and whites -- who were 18 to 30 in 1985. They were
given a 50-question test that asked them to respond to true or
false statements such as ''I have at times had to be rough with
people who were rude to me'' and ''No one cares much what happens
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, they underwent a heart scan to measure calcium
deposits in the arteries, which are an indicator of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen percent of those who scored above average on the
hostility test showed calcification, compared with 9 percent in the
below-average group.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers put the risk at 2.5 times higher for the
high-hostility group after adjusting for the other factors.
</P>
<P>
   The study was led by Dr. Carlos Iribarren of the Kaiser
Permanente Medical Care Program of Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He said one reason for the difference could be that hostile
people release more stress hormones that raise blood pressure and
can lead to heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   He said the next step is to find out if lowering someone's
hostility level will stem the progression of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a study published in Circulation, the
journal of the American Heart Association, found that people who
are highly anger-prone are nearly three times more likely to have a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   That link held true even after risk factors such as smoking and
obesity were taken into account.

<HEADLINE> Fish May Lower Depression Risk  </HEADLINE>
By MALCOLM RITTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A large study in Finland has found evidence that
people who ate fish less than once a week ran a 31 percent higher
chance of mild to severe depression than people who ate it more
often.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Antti Tanskanen of the University of Kuopio in Finland said
his study's evidence was statistically significant only for women.
But he said he believes the effect also applies to men, for whom
the results leaned in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   Tanskanen presented the work Tuesday at the annual meeting of
the American Psychiatric Association. It was paid for by his
university, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The results are probably because fish contains omega-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids, or PUFA, but it's too early to
recommend that people eat fish or take PUFA to avoid depression,
Tanskanen said.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved a random sample of 3,204 adults from four
areas of Finland. They filled out a standard questionnaire to
measure depressive symptoms and indicated how often they ate fish.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent ate fish less than once a week, and so were
classified as ''infrequent'' fish consumers. And 28 percent of the
overall group reported symptoms suggesting mild or more severe
depression, with most in the mild category.
</P>
<P>
   Among women, signs of depression appeared in 34 percent of the
infrequent-fish-eater group, compared with 27 percent of the other
women. In men, the difference was 30 percent vs. 28.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The overall difference of 31 percent emerged after results from
the two sexes were combined, and the rates were mathematically
adjusted to remove the effect of factors such as age and smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very suggestive,'' but such studies can't really show
what causes the differences they find, noted Dr. Alexander Glassman
of Columbia University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, other researchers reported that capsules of omega-3
fatty acids helped treat manic-depression. And in 1998, one of
Tanskanen's co-authors reported that countries with higher
per-capita fish consumption tended to have lower rates of major
depression.

<HEADLINE> Race May Have Role in Medical Test  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Decisions by doctors about whether to use a
common heart-monitoring procedure might be based in part on race
and insurance status, suggests a study published today in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   White patients and those with private insurance were nearly 1{
times more likely to undergo pulmonary artery catheterization than
blacks or patients with other types of insurance, according to a
study led by health economist John Rapoport of Mount Holyoke
College.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, based on data from 10,217 patients hospitalized
nationwide in 1998, suggest that a patient's condition isn't the
only factor involved in determining whether the procedure is used.
</P>
<P>
   Catheterization helps doctors monitor vital signs in critically
ill patients and provides information that determines treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure involves inserting a balloon-tipped catheter into
a vein near the neck or groin and guiding it through the heart into
lung vessels. It may remain there for days.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research found a higher death rate among patients who
underwent the procedure. Some theorize that the insertion of a
foreign object deep into the body could make patients prone to
deadly infection.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jesse Hall, a critical-care specialist at the University of
Chicago, said in an accompanying editorial that efforts are under
way to ensure that the procedure benefits the sickest patients and
isn't used just because it is available.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts could lead critical-care specialists to adopt a new
approach ''perhaps described as 'don't just do something, stand
there,''' Hall wrote.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Court Denies Adoption Petition  </HEADLINE>
By TARA BURGHART
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Oregon Supreme Court has cleared the
way for adoptees 21 and over to find out the names of their birth
parents, the latest ruling in an emotional and closely watched
court battle.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-2 ruling Tuesday, the court dismissed motions to
reconsider its March ruling that upheld a law giving the adoptees
access to birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Barring appeals or injunctions, the decision means the law
approved by voters in 1998 will go into effect at 5 p.m. on May 30
-- allowing adoptees access to their birth certificates the next
day, according to Jim Nass, spokesman for the Oregon Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Hunsaker, the attorney representing six women who gave up
their children, said he and his clients were ''extremely
disappointed the court didn't review the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt it was the court's responsibility to rule on these
important constitutional issues and I'm at a loss as to why they
didn't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The women, who have not been publicly identified, are expected
to make a decision on whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court
before May 30. If they do appeal, Hunsaker said, he would first ask
for a stay keeping the records sealed. The court already has
refused to review a similar open adoption records law in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the law breaks a promise of secrecy made to women
who gave up their children for adoption. Adoptees say they have the
right to know the identities of their birth parents and the case
has dragged on too long.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been an absolute roller coaster,'' said Helen Hill,
who sponsored the successful ballot measure. ''I understand we have
a system of checks and balances, and ultimately the system is very
fair. But it takes a lot longer than we would like to run its
course.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2,200 adoptees have applied for their birth certificates
from the Oregon Health Division. Cathy Allen, an elementary school
teacher in Beaverton, is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   A 49-year-old breast cancer survivor, Allen wants to find out
about her birth parents and her family's medical history to gain
information that could help her and her two children.
</P>
<P>
   She doubts her birth parents are alive but is aware she has some
half-siblings. She said she work through an intermediary to contact
them and honor their wishes if they did not want to meet her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not trying to create a family if there isn't one possible.
I'm just seeking information to make the best emotional and medical
plans I can for my family,'' she said. ''The issue has been voted
on, it's been talked about. I think it's time to take effect.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Argue Vs. Elian Cuba Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Throwing the latest jab in the Elian Gonzalez
case in court, the 6-year-old's Miami relatives say he eventually
would be forced to cut sugar cane in a work camp if he is returned
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the relatives filed a 25-page document Tuesday in
response to a motion filed by Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who wants to
replace them as his son's representative.
</P>
<P>
   If the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals grants the father's
motion, he would be free to drop the lawsuit seeking a U.S. asylum
hearing for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' lawyers said parental rights Juan Miguel Gonzalez
claims in this country would be denied in Cuba, where Elian would
be separated from his father in a few years and sent to work camps
for months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Irrespective of (his father's) wishes, Elian will be doing
agricultural work such as cutting sugar cane in the fields, to
further indoctrinate him and separate him ... for extended periods
to break down the bond between parent and child and cement the bond
between child and state,'' the lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers filed their own brief Tuesday, reiterating
their argument that answers to questions on the asylum application
Elian signed in block letters reflect the beliefs and concerns of
his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, not the boy himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''None contains information that came from Elian,'' the
government lawyers wrote. ''All are written in the third person.
There is no reason to believe that Elian could possibly affirm
their contents.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued Thanksgiving Day off the Florida coast after a
boat wreck killed his mother and other fleeing Cubans. After living
with his Miami relatives for five months, he was taken from their
home by federal authorities April 22 and is with his father at a
Maryland retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Three judges from the 11th Circuit are considering whether a
child as young as Elian can seek asylum despite his father's wish
to return with the boy to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives -- Elian's cousin Marisleysis and Lazaro
Gonzalez -- want the court to force immigration officials to give
Elian an asylum hearing. The government has sided with Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who says he should be allowed to decide for the boy as
his sole surviving parent.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been ordered to remain in the United States until a
decision is reached by the judges, who heard oral arguments in the
case last week.

<HEADLINE> Money for Everglades Preservation  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MEADOWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush has signed a
law setting aside $2 billion to help restore the Everglades and
called on Congress to match the commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time we, as a state and a nation, protect the beauty,
the natural water systems and the endangered species that make the
Everglades a truly unique and precious landscape,'' Bush said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill earmarks $200 million a year over the next 10 years to
restore a more natural flow of water through the Everglades and
lower the amount of fertilizer-saturated water flowing into Lake
Okeechobee and eventually into Florida Bay, at the southern tip of
the Florida peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from sugar cane
fields, citrus groves and cattle ranches have contributed to
runaway algae growth and destroyed fish and plant life in the lake
and bay.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore submitted a federal version of the bill
to Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
   Peter G. Umhofer, a senior adviser for the Interior Department,
said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt supports the restoration and
will work to make sure federal money is available.
</P>
<P>
   The state law will also help protect 68 endangered species in
the Everglades, an expanse of sawgrass, hardwood, cypress swamps
and mangroves.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the federal government has spent $1.2 billion in
Florida on related projects, including purchasing 500,000 acres in
and around the Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   A separate bill signed by Bush provides $38.5 million for the
restoration of Lake Okeechobee.

<HEADLINE> Newark Sued Over Bearded Police  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The Justice Department has sued the city,
claiming it is discriminating against two Muslim police officers
because of their religion.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday on behalf of all bearded Muslim
officers in Newark seeks damages for any current or former officers
who were the victims of bias. Seven months ago, the U.S. Supreme
Court allowed the two officers to have beards as an exception to
department policy.
</P>
<P>
   The city threatened the officers with termination and other
sanctions because of their beliefs, which include wearing beards,
according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Employers have a duty to accommodate reasonably the religious
observances, practices and beliefs of employees,'' said Bill Lann
Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The city has argued the no-beard policy was intended to present
a ''professional and dignified image to the public'' and establish
discipline and solidarity within the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   But after the two officers won in the Supreme Court, Newark
Police Director Joseph Santiago said the department would change
its rules to abide by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The department has since submitted a revised ''grooming policy''
to the city for review, and has not disciplined any officers for
wearing a beard, the department said in a statement issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The department declined to comment further, as did a spokeswoman
for Mayor Sharpe James.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a State Park Police officer who claimed he was
suspended for wearing a beard as a sign of his Muslim faith will be
paid $25,700 in back wages and rehired as a ranger, attorneys said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement of a federal lawsuit, State Park Police
also agreed to revise regulations to specify that officers may seek
exemptions to the force's no-beard rule on religious grounds.
</P>
<P>
   New York Assistant Attorney General Bonnie Garone said the state
denies any wrongdoing. She asserted Officer Muhammad Ali always had
the right to apply for an exemption under the old regulations.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Holds Mail-In Election  </HEADLINE>
By BRAD CAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon made history Tuesday as ballots
were counted in the nation's first regular primary election
conducted not at polling places but by mail -- a move intended to
improve turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots were mailed to voters' households on April 28 and had to
be returned to local election offices by Tuesday night to be
counted. Late Tuesday, the secretary of state's office estimated
voter turnout at 47 percent, which would be the highest since the
1992 primary, which had a turnout of 49.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since Al Gore and George W. Bush have sewn up their parties'
presidential nominations, and there is no Oregon governor's race
this year, the primary didn't generate much heat. But there were
six ballot measures, along with primary races for Congress,
secretary of state, treasurer and the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Voters rejected a measure that would have let the Legislature
clamp limits on the amount of ''pain and suffering'' money or other
damages people can be awarded when they sue over injuries.
</P>
<P>
   With 54 percent of the vote counted, the measure was being
trounced by a margin of 74 percent to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and other supporters of Measure 81 said restrictions on
jury awards were needed to hold down insurance costs. Trial lawyers
and victims' rights advocates who opposed the measure said juries,
not politicians, should decide how much money is awarded to people
who are injured by faulty products or someone else's negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-profile issue on the ballot headed for a resounding
defeat was a proposed nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax increase to pay
for road repairs. With 54 percent of the vote counted, the measure
was being voted down 88 percent to 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the tax pulled the plug on the campaign two months
ago after it became obvious people wouldn't vote for such an
increase at a time of rapidly rising gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Bush and Gore easily won their parties'
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The most hotly contested state race was between ''the battling
Lynns'' -- two Republicans who want to run against incumbent
Secretary of State Bill Bradbury.
</P>
<P>
   With 54 percent of the state's precincts reporting, House
Speaker Lynn Snodgrass had 47 percent of the vote to 45 percent for
state Rep. Lynn Lundquist. Bradbury, who was unopposed for the
Democratic nomination, is considered the early favorite heading
into November.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, Oregonians have voted by mail in local
elections and special statewide elections. But this is the first
all-mail ballot for a regularly scheduled election.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Oregonians voted to abolish the traditional
polling place in all statewide elections in favor of the mail
ballot. Supporters say it's cheaper and more convenient.

<HEADLINE> Combs is denied separate trial  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sean ''Puffy'' Combs' motion to separate his
bribery and gun trial from the trials of two co-defendants arrested
with him after a nightclub shooting has been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Combs' lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he asked for a separate
trial for his client because the judge plans to allow a jury to
hear evidence that would be barred if Combs were tried alone. The
evidence might be unfairly prejudicial, Brafman said.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan State Supreme Justice Charles Solomon, who will hear
the trial of the three men, denied Brafman's motion Tuesday, saying
he had ''failed to establish good cause for granting a severance in
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also rejected Brafman's challenge of the prosecution's
presentation to the grand jury. The judge said he found the
prosecution had set forth a sufficient basis to establish Combs'
guilt of the crimes charged.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, 30, was arrested with bodyguard Anthony ''Wolf'' Jones,
34, as the two fled the scene of a shooting at Club New York in the
Times Square area in the early hours of Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Combs protege Jamal ''Shyne'' Barrow, 19, was arrested at the
scene after siding with his mentor during a dispute in which a man
reportedly threw money in Combs' face. Barrow, charged with
attempted murder, allegedly shot a woman in the face and hit two
men in their right shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Combs is charged with two counts of illegal gun possession. One
count stems from police allegedly finding a 9 mm pistol in the
Lincoln Navigator in which Combs, Jones and Combs' girlfriend,
Jennifer Lopez, fled the club. The other count was filed because of
a 9 mm pistol that was allegedly thrown out of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Combs is also charged with bribery for allegedly offering to pay
his driver $50,000 to claim ownership of the gun in the car. Police
said he tried to sweeten the deal by offering the driver a diamond
ring Lopez had given him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm innocent,'' Combs said outside court. ''I want to go to
trial and get this behind me. When a jury hears my case, they'll
see that I'm innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, jury selection in a civil lawsuit against Combs
begins Monday. The lawsuit blames him for a deadly stampede during
a celebrity basketball game on Dec. 28, 1991, an event he organized
at City College of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Nine young people died and 29 others were injured in the crush
of people who tried to get into the event. One of the survivors,
Nicole Levy, sued CCNY, Combs and another rapper, Dwight ''Heavy
D'' Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Combs settled all the other CCNY-related lawsuits out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The judge scheduled hearings for June 14 for Jones and Barrow on
whether they were properly identified, whether evidence and
statements were legally obtained and whether prosecutors can ask
them about previous arrests. Those hearings do not involve Combs.

<HEADLINE> Feds Debate Blackbird Program  </HEADLINE>
By BLAKE NICHOLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- While two government agencies debate a
blackbird poisoning program, farmers in the Dakotas are seeding
their sunflower crops and looking at propane-powered cannons,
scarecrows or other ways to keep the birds at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got two agencies contradicting each other. Meanwhile,
who suffers? The producer,'' said Vance Neuberger, who farms in
northeast South Dakota. ''It's disgusting because government
agencies are here to help us, not work against us.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refused in March to grant the
Agriculture Department a permit to poison about 2 million
blackbirds in North Dakota and South Dakota. The Fish and Wildlife
Service told USDA more research is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The two agencies are hoping to work together on that research.
</P>
<P>
   The poison, known as DRC-1339, is put in rice bait and kills the
birds by damaging their kidneys and hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at a Colorado laboratory will study how the poison will
affect some grassland birds. And officials hope to get a graduate
student at North Dakota State University to study whether
habitat-related factors such as dry weather might influence the
results of a spring poisoning program, said George Linz, a project
leader for USDA's Wildlife Services office in Bismarck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we have an environmental problem, but if another
agency thinks we do, we've got to go out and get the data,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really working hard with the Fish and Wildlife Service
to try to meet their concerns,'' Linz added. ''They appear to want
to work with us, so we don't have what happened this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers don't see poisoning as the final answer to the blackbird
battle, but it could be a major weapon, Neuberger said.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in a large-scale poisoning program ''is very
frustrating to a farmer who has to deal with problem ongoing,'' he
said. ''We've been told that this is a partial solution ... for
between eight and 10 years, and now we have another government
agency for the immediate future putting a stop to it.''
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota and South Dakota are the nation's leading sunflower
producing states with a total of more than 2 million acres planted
each year. Officials estimate damage from blackbirds runs in the
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fish and Wildlife Service -- we're hoping that they're
going to play as fair as possible and not throw up other roadblocks
down the road,'' said Larry Kleingartner, executive director of the
Bismarck-based National Sunflower Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll just play the game and see how long they want to lay out
the barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the poison was to see if killing blackbirds as they
fly north to breeding grounds would reduce the number of the birds
in the fall, when sunflowers are ripe for attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife service denied the permit because
officials were worried that other species of birds might be harmed,
said Kevin Johnson, an environmental contaminant specialist with
the agency's office in Bismarck. They also felt there was not
enough scientific evidence that springtime poisoning would reduce
sunflower damage in the fall.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Bill a Yawn in Senate  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like the summer squall that drenches only one
side of the street, the debate over granting China permanent trade
benefits has spawned a tempest on the House side, but left the
Senate basking under clear skies.
</P>
<P>
   The China trade bill is being fought to the wire in the House.
Organized labor is battling it fiercely, confronting an equally
intense campaign in support of the legislation from the Clinton
administration and the business community.
</P>
<P>
   With a week to go before a House vote, neither side can say for
sure who will prevail on the measure to normalize trade relations
with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're losing some and getting some,'' President Clinton said
Tuesday of the still-large ''undecided'' bloc in the House. Still,
he predicted its eventual passage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, all is placid. The bill enjoys wide bipartisan
support, generating only a handful of naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance
Committee take up the China trade bill today -- and their
deliberations should help underscore the differences in approach.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic divide across the congressional street ''reflects
institutional differences,'' suggested Lee Hamilton, the former
Indiana congressman who was chairman of the House International
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think senators look upon themselves as national
officeholders more than members of the House do,'' said Hamilton,
who now heads the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
''Members of the House look upon themselves as local officials.
There's a much different perspective, frame of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   House members have far more vulnerability in this election year.
Senators serve for staggered six-year terms -- so in any given
election year, only a third of the seats are up for re-election.
All 435 House seats are up at every election.
</P>
<P>
   And interest groups -- in this case labor unions and
environmental groups -- are able to more effectively rally
opposition in individual House districts than across an entire
state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and a China-trade supporter, said that because
of narrower constituencies, many House members over the years have
consistently voted against trade-liberalization bills.
</P>
<P>
   That includes so-called fast track, legislation authorizing U.S.
membership in the World Trade Organization and the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''There might be a broader perspective'' in the Senate, Lugar
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The China bill will be debated in the House next week. If it
passes, the Senate will take it up in June. Both houses must pass
the legislation for it to be enacted.
</P>
<P>
   It would end the annual practice of renewing China's trade
status and grant Beijing the same normal trade relations that the
United States extends routinely to nearly every other nation in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would ease China's entry into the Geneva-based WTO
-- although China could still become a member without congressional
consent.
</P>
<P>
   James Thurber, a political scientist at American University,
said House members represent ''a specific narrow constituency,''
while ''constituencies in the Senate are broad and complex.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When senators try to get re-elected, they have broader view of
what the public interest is,'' Thurber said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Labor has been running ads making life miserable for
Democratic House members,'' complains Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who
opposes the bill but criticizes Labor's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney insists that with the bill, the
United States ''gives up -- permanently and unconditionally -- it's
ability to use economic leverage to insist that China stop its
horrifying human rights abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor is not making the case as forcefully among senators.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there are no Senate opponents. Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., announced his opposition on Tuesday, saying Beijing
''threatens world peace by flagrantly proliferating weapons of mass
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's clearly in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   The president has been making a full-court press to win over
House members, meanwhile.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the
Ways and Means Committee, said he didn't get much in the way of
goodies in exchange for his much-sought announcement of support on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to give me a free plane ride to Albany so I can
endorse the president's wife (in her Senate race),'' Rangel joked.
''Big deal.''

<HEADLINE> ABC Has Another Ratings Win  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If the first installment of ''Jesus'' didn't
quite work miracles Sunday night, it was certainly a blessing for
CBS, proving to be the season's highest-rated miniseries -- and even
edging out ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise for the week of May 8-14, ''Millionaire'' claimed four
of the top seven slots, helping to carry ABC to another win in the
May ''sweeps'' competition, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 13.64 million viewers, ABC led with a 9.3 rating and
16 share. In second place, NBC had 12.84 million viewers (9.0
rating, 15 share), with CBS, in third, scoring 11.86 million
viewers (8.1 rating, 14 share).
</P>
<P>
   Fox had 8.56 million viewers (5.7, 10), UPN had 4.08 million
(2.8, 5), the WB had 3.24 million (2.3, 4) and Pax had 1.08 million
(0.8, 1).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''ER,'' featuring the departure of charter cast member
Julianna Margulies, was last week's top-rated program. But NBC
suffered a big letdown with the conclusion of its sweeps
extravaganza, ''Jason and the Argonauts'' -- which ranked an
unheroic 40th place.
</P>
<P>
   And ABC had to be blue as ''NYPD Blue'' again fell to CBS'
''Judging Amy,'' which, with a 10.8 rating, won its time period in
households for the second consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening news derby, ''NBC Nightly News'' took first place
with 9.49 million viewers, besting ABC's ''World News Tonight,''
with 9.17 million viewers, and ''The CBS Evening News,'' in third
place with 7.53 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of May 8-14, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''ER,'' NBC, 22.1; tie: ''Frasier,'' NBC, and ''Who Wants to Be
a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, both 15.6; ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (Wednesday), ABC, 15.1; Movie: ''Jesus -- Part 1''
(Sunday), CBS, 15.0; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday),
ABC, 14.8; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 14.5;
''Friends,'' NBC, 14.4; ''Friends'' special, NBC, 14.0; ''Frasier''
special, NBC, 13.8.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Seeks Fair Elections  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- In Haiti, a local opposition candidate
is kidnapped at gunpoint a month before the election. In Peru,
international observers are denied access to the computer system on
election day amid allegations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   And in Mexico, election officials say they can't get media
barons to air anti-fraud public service announcements because of
broadcasters' links to the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   With Venezuela, Peru, Mexico, Haiti, Suriname and the Dominican
Republic currently in electoral campaigns, the fragility of the
region's electoral processes is becoming increasingly apparent,
raising questions about how far Latin America has moved away from
the dictatorships that dominated its past.
</P>
<P>
   ''In most cases we aren't talking about crude fraud,'' said
Jennifer McCoy, who heads the Carter Center's Latin American
program. Instead, she said the region is having trouble preventing
more subtle forms of electoral abuse that range from unequal access
to air waves to the absence of autonomous election agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's electoral difficulties in countries such as the
Dominican Republic, which held presidential elections on Tuesday,
may stem from years of strongman rule when opposition parties were
banned.
</P>
<P>
   With every Latin American nation now nominally a democracy
except for Cuba, many of these countries are reluctantly holding
open elections but not creating rules of fair play to ensure clean
balloting, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you are seeing a lot of the elections questioned
because you are seeing the collapse of the old parties and that
means the end of the old rules,'' said University of Delaware
political scientist Julio Carrion.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, federal election officials say that while the July 2
presidential vote is likely to be the cleanest in the country's
history, the campaign leading up to the balloting is still fraught
with accusations of unfair advantages for incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are only about halfway toward having transparency and
fairness in Mexico,'' Jaime Cardenas, a member of the country's
Federal Election Institute, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas said that while electoral reforms should prevent a
repeat of 1988, when Mexico was rocked by allegations that the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party stole the presidential
elections from challenger Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, opposition
candidates must still fight for media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The election institute, which is independent from the
government, is currently locked in a battle with television and
radio stations that refuse to air free public service ads
encouraging voter participation and instructing people not to sell
their votes. Critics have called the refusal an attempt at
electoral manipulation by media barons with ties to the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru and Venezuela, each of which will hold presidential
elections on May 28, international monitors are investigating
opposition claims that transparent elections are unlikely because
governments control the voting process.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Arias Cardenas, the main challenger to Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez, was joined by church and retired military
leaders in denouncing the country's election council, which was
hand-picked by Chavez's ruling coalition in an exercise widely
criticized as undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Arias said the balloting may be tainted, but added
that domestic and international opinion are Venezuela's best hope
for fairness on May 28.

<HEADLINE> Rowland says executive order could help curb power-plant pollution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Gov. John G. Rowland plans to issue an
executive order designed to curb pollution from Connecticut power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after the failure of the Legislature to pass a
bill requiring the state's so-called ''Filthy Five'' plants to
reduce emissions. Lawmakers said Tuesday they do not intend to
revisit the issue in next month's special session of the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could do something by executive order, working with the
same players, that would be just as effective,'' Rowland said
Tuesday. ''If you carve the politics out of this, generally you can
do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders said they plan to create a working group in
an effort to reach a comprehensive, bipartisan solution that would
be presented to the legislature during the 2001 session.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, environmentalists have fought for a
reduction in nitrogen and sulfur oxide levels at plants in Norwalk,
Bridgeport, New Haven, Middletown and Montville.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars if the plants
were forced to shut down, the power companies launched a feverish
lobbying campaign at the Capitol that prevailed two weeks ago when
no cleanup action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Clean-air advocates had pushed for legislation that would have
required reduced emissions reduced by 2003, but the operators said
shutting them down would jeopardize the region's power supply
during the warm summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists sharply rejected the idea of trading pollution
''credits,'' which allow the worst polluters to buy credits from
lesser polluters in an effort to reduce overall smog.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless the votes have changed since we lost during the regular
session, there is no purpose served by losing again during the
special session,'' Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan,
D-West Hartford said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, environmentalists said, is that the power plants
are exempt from emissions limits established by the federal Clean
Air Act because the plants were grandfathered when the act was
passed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland did not detail what his executive order would require
the plants to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is, it shouldn't be a political tennis
match,'' Rowland told reporters Tuesday. ''There's some middle
ground there, and I think the legislators were working around that
middle ground and then I guess politics came into play.''

<HEADLINE> Congressman Sam Gejdenson says he's convinced Pequots ''are Indians.'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- U.S. Rep. Sam Gejdenson, who helped the
Mashantucket Pequots get federal recognition nearly 20 years ago,
says the idea at the time was to help people clear their property
titles, not create a gambling industry in eastern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd District Democrat said he was simply trying to help his
constituents when Congress granted the tribe federal recognition in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing people are missing is, this thing wasn't settled to
help the Indians,'' Gejdenson told The Day. ''People couldn't sell
their homes. The state decided we are getting flooded with people
who are getting apoplectic about not being able to sell their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the state cut a deal with the Pequots in which the tribe
would relinquish its land claims in the Ledyard area in return for
the tribal recognition that eventually allowed the Pequots to
establish one of the world's largest gambling empires.
</P>
<P>
   In Jeff Benedict's controversial new book ''Without
Reservation,'' Gejdenson is characterized as pushing through the
recognition and land claims legislation without heeding warnings
from other federal officials that there were problems with the
Mashantucket Pequots' genealogy. The book, published by
HarperCollins, claims the tribe is not descended from the historic
Pequots, and may have a thin blood link to the Narragansetts in
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Gejdenson said he believes the Mashantucket Pequots definitely
are American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, I'm comfortable with them as a tribe,'' he said.
''They've been a tribe in Connecticut for 300 years ... nobody
really argued that case at the time. What was driving us was to
take care of non-Indian constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Some eastern Connecticut officials maintain the Pequots were
given more land for their reservation than they were entitled to.
They say transcripts from hearings of the congressional debate and
the land claims settlement legislation describe an 800-acre parcel
that the tribe could buy in exchange for dropping claims against
Ledyard property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, in his book, says legislators and tribal
representatives were talking about 800 acres, but the tribe's
reservation, the site of Foxwoods, the world's largest casino, is
covers 1,200-acres.
</P>
<P>
   Gejdenson said it may take a lawsuit to settle that dispute, but
he said Congress is not the aggrieved party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever those (aggrieved) parties are - the state of
Connecticut, communities or individuals - they would sue the
Indians. It wouldn't be Congress,'' he said.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trying to bolster his case against privatizing Social
Security, Al Gore's campaign is pointing to a Texas experiment that auditors
concluded was a bad deal for low-income workers and a mixed bag for those in the
middle. The experiment, which was created more than a decade before George W.
Bush became governor of Texas, allows three counties to invest workers' pension
money in private funds. Now a presidential candidate, Bush is advocating
allowing Social Security recipients to invest some -- but unlike the Texas
program, not all -- of their payroll taxes in the stock market.

<HEADLINE> Computer Viruses Said Threat to US  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The ''Love Bug'' computer virus is powerful
proof that the threat from opposing armies is no longer the central
danger facing America in an increasingly smaller, faster and more
computerized world, the White House says.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton planned to point to the virus, which spread by
electronic mail and disabled computers worldwide earlier this
month, during a commencement address today at the Coast Guard
Academy in New London, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Threats to America's national security are much more scattered
and varied than they used to be, including everything from the
alleged terror network operated by Osama bin Laden to diseases that
move around the globe as fast as airplanes, White House officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have in fact expanded our concept of what constitutes our
country's national security,'' White House National Security
Council spokesman P.J. Crowley said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard is on the front line of some of the new fights,
such as drug interdiction, Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this new age we have to think beyond traditional military
threats to other ways in which countries or rogue groups can attack
our national interests,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has struck this theme before, often making the point
that terrific advances in science and technology can bring added or
unforeseen risks.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Washington on Tuesday, Clinton said he backs a
bipartisan measure to give prescription drug benefits to military
retirees and tried to shame Congress into offering the same
benefits to every senior in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can they do this and say they're not going to do it for
people in the same situation in the rest of the country?'' Clinton
asked reporters in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also touched on his wife's Senate race. He spoke to
reporters before leaving for Albany, N.Y., to attend the New York
state Democratic Party's convention where Hillary Rodham Clinton
was nominated as a Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big deal for her,'' said Clinton, who decided at the
last minute to attend.

<HEADLINE> EPA Cites Cancer Risks From Dioxin  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The cancer risks from exposure to dioxins may
be significantly greater than previously thought, at least for a
small segment of the population, according to a draft report by the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The report, described by EPA officials familiar with it,
concludes that the cancer risk from dioxins among individuals who
eat large amounts of fatty meats and dairy products may as high as
1 in 100, or 10 times as great as previously projected.
</P>
<P>
   The health effects of dioxins, a group of toxic compounds
produced through a number of chemical processes including
combustion, have been the focus of research for more than 20 years.
Despite the extensive literature, the health effects remain in some
cases uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA, which began reviewing the literature in 1991, is to
make public its findings in a report to be released next month. The
draft report has not yet been scientifically peer reviewed and EPA
officials acknowledged in interviews it is likely to generate sharp
debate.
</P>
<P>
   According to agency officials, who discussed the report on
condition of not being identified by name, said it concludes that
at least one form of dioxin -- the most potent form known as TCDD --
should be classified as a definite human carcinogen. Other
dioxin-like compounds were considered by the EPA reviewers as
''likely'' carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
   The report also links exposure to dioxin to a variety of other
health problems, including diabetes, developmental problems and
irregularities in the immune system, they said. It also concludes
that children's intake of dioxin is greater than those of adults
because the chemical is often found in dairy products and even
breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials emphasized, however, that the draft report's
conclusions should not discourage people from eating a well
balanced diet, including dairy products, certain meats and
vegetables because their benefits outweigh any dangers posed from
dioxin. And officials said the benefits of breast feeding also
continue to outweigh the risks from dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin, a chlorine byproduct, can be dangerous even at very low
levels because it is believed to be widespread in the food chain
and can accumulate in the body over a lifetime. A product of
combustion as well as the pulp- and paper-making processes, it is
released into the air and into water and finds its way onto
pastures and into fish and animals and in turn into humans.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the EPA has imposed tougher regulations on many
dioxin emitters including municipal, medical and hazardous waste
incinerators and the pulp and paper companies. As a result, dioxin
emissions have been reduced by about 80 percent since the 1980s,
according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's findings are expected to be used by the agency as
evidence for additional actions to curtail dioxin. ''The findings
validate the policies that have been taken,'' said one agency
official, speaking on condition of not being further identified.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, as described by these officials, the
risks of getting cancer from dioxin may be zero or extremely slight
for most of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The report said its new projections were based on new evidence
developed in recent years on cancer risk, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although studied for more than 20 years with hundreds of
articles in the scientific literature, the health effects of dioxin
on humans remains somewhat uncertain. For example, dioxins have
been found to cause birth defects in mice, but no such causation
has been established in humans.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials acknowledged that its findings likely will prompt
extensive debate. Industry groups as well as some scientists over
the years have accused the EPA of exaggerating the dangers of
dioxins.
</P>
<P>
   The findings in the draft report were first reported in today's
Washington Post, which said it had obtained a copy of the document.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Construction Said Unjustified  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first independent review of a $1 billion
proposal to expand locks on the upper Mississippi River finds the
project is not needed and that the Army Corps of Engineers is using
flawed assumptions in its study favoring the costly construction,
according to a source familiar with the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by a panel of economists unrelated to
players in the controversy over whether top military officials at
the corps manufactured a case for the project, is to be released
Thursday by the Northeast-Midwest Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's critical of the corps,'' the Institute's George Dusenbury
said Tuesday. He would not provide any other details.
</P>
<P>
   But a source knowledgeable about the report, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the economists concluded the corps'
estimates for future grain exports -- which largely drive the amount
of barge traffic on the river and thus the need for larger locks to
reduce congestion -- were way too high.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it says is that the whole study is based on demand
projections that are unsupportable,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute asked three economists -- Yale University's Steven
Berry, Geoffrey Hewings of the University of Illinois, and
Washington University's Charles Leven -- to review the corps'
7-year-old, $54 million study of what modernizations are needed on
the aging upper Mississippi River navigation system. None is
connected to the corps, the agribusiness industry which favors
locks expansion or environmental groups that oppose it, Dusenbury
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report was commissioned months before a whistleblower
alleged in February that top corps officials altered his original
conclusions to favor doubling the length of seven barge locks on
the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers at a cost of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The sworn affidavit filed by corps economist Donald Sweeney
prompted still-ongoing investigations by the Army inspector
general, the National Academy of Sciences and several members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Corps officials have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying new
data -- not foul play -- has caused the study to change. The
not-yet-finished study and its construction recommendations are due
out this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping interests predict increasing traffic on the river means
massive expansions to the navigation system are crucial to ensuring
that barges have faster, cheaper trips and Midwestern grain is able
to compete on the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue the corps is too attentive to the needs
of politically connected agribusiness companies to the detriment of
the river's fragile ecosystem. They say the region cannot handle
more large-scale changes without serious losses in habitats and
fish and bird populations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, corps and Army officials told a Senate subcommittee
Tuesday that Congress has given a green light to $38 billion worth
of navigation, flood control and other water construction projects
without providing the corps with the funding to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous backlog -- the corps receives about $1.6 billion a
year for civil works construction -- is only expected to increase as
members of Congress approve more new projects. The shortfall
involves about 500 projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''The needs are not going away,'' said Sen. George Voinovich,
R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works
subcommittee on transportation and infrastructure. ''It's obvious
we need another billion at least.''

<HEADLINE> House Nixes Budget Overhaul Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers agree that the current budget
process is in disarray, but have stepped back from a bill to bring
about fundamental changes in the way they decide how the nation's
money will be spent.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday defeated, 250-166, a far-ranging measure
that would have made the president a participant in the process
earlier to avoid year-end showdowns, put the budget on a two-year
cycle and effectively ended the possibility of government
shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that the bill would shift too much power to the
executive branch, that the two-year budget undermined the ability
of Congress to react to economic changes and that the real problem
was not in the process but the people.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, said Rep. David Price, D-N.C., were fixes ''for
what is mainly a failure of political will and responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The last major revamping of the budget process was in 1974.
Pressure for reform has grown as Congress repeatedly failed to
finish its 13 spending bills on time, leading to all-night,
closed-door negotiations with the White House to determine billions
of dollars in spending and, on several occasions, government
shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The main element of the legislation would have changed the
nature of the budget resolution Congress draws up every year as an
outline for later spending bills. It would have gained the stature
of a law that must be signed by the president, forcing earlier
negotiations with the president and ideally avoiding the standoffs
that occur when the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year arrives with
the White House and Congress still fighting over budget levels.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial budget, offered as an amendment, was defeated
217-201. Supporters argued that finishing the budget and passing
the spending bills in the first year of a two-year session would
allow lawmakers to spend the second year overseeing programs to
make sure they work.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes the budget process more rational, it improves
accountability and it strengthens enforcement,'' said Rules
Committee Chairman David Dreier, R-Calif., noting that President
Clinton and his Republican predecessors have supported the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said they would be turned into fiscal lame ducks the
second year. Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich., said a two-year budget would
be inadequate in situations such as has occurred in the past two
years, when Congressional Budget Office estimates changed from
projections of a $70 billion federal deficit in fiscal 2000 to
current estimates of a $200 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of ceding congressional power was also involved in a
236-173 vote to defeat an amendment by Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa., to
automatically keep federal programs running even when Congress and
the White House fail to conclude spending bills by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 853.

<HEADLINE> Prince Reclaims His Name  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was a simple greeting from a reporter: ''Hi,
Prince.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That sounds great,'' replied The Artist Formerly Known As --
and now once again named -- Prince. ''I haven't heard that in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's been since 1993, when he swapped his given name
of Prince Rogers Nelson for an unpronounceable symbol in protest
during a protracted contract battle with his former record label.
That led others to dub him ''The Artist Formerly Known As Prince,''
or ''The Artist,'' for short.
</P>
<P>
   Well, forget the symbol and erase his acronym (TAFKAP). On
Tuesday, during a quirky, one-hour news conference, the artist
announced he will, now and forever, spell his name P-R-I-N-C-E.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Dec. 31, 1999, my publishing contract with Warner-Chappell
expired, thus emancipating the name I was given before birth --
Prince -- from all long-term restrictive documents,'' the freshly
re-minted Prince told the crowded press event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will now go back to using my name instead of the symbol I
adopted to free myself from all undesirable relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   That was easy, huh?
</P>
<P>
   The return to the Prince name ends a 7-year battle between the
performer and Warner Bros. Records, which had Prince under contract
through the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Prince is celebrating the reclaiming of his old name with plans
for a week-long party dubbed ''Prince: A Celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the event, his Paisley Park studio in his hometown of
Minneapolis will be opened for tours between June 7-13, with a
special concert set for June 13 at Northrop Auditorium in
Minneapolis. A new Prince song, ''Cybersingle,'' also will be
available at his web site, as will a modified version of his last
album, titled ''Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince said he would continue his fight against what he
perceives as major label domination of the nation's music scene.
</P>
<P>
   He promised, with a sly smile, not to ''give up the store to
Forrest Gump accounting firms who think a royalty check is like a
box of chocolates. You never know what you'll get.''

<HEADLINE> Duchovny 'X-Files' Return Unknown  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''The X-Files'' will return for another
season on Fox TV, but it's still a mystery if David Duchovny will
reprise his starring role as FBI agent Fox Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Chris Carter reached a last-minute deal for an
eighth season, but Duchovny remains in negotiations as Fox
Broadcasting Co. prepares to present its fall schedule to
advertisers Thursday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''My contract connects me to the show for another season,''
Carter said Tuesday. ''I've agreed to do it'' with or without
Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he could figure out a way to write around a missing
Duchovny, but would prefer not to.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Anderson, who co-stars in the offbeat drama about FBI
agents on the trail of supernatural forces and space aliens,
already was signed for another year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his agreement reached late Monday, Carter said he
expects ''The Lone Gunmen,'' an ''X-Files'' spin-off, to be part of
Fox's 2000-01 midseason schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were continuing with Duchovny, Fox said. Calls to
his representatives were not returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny is seeking more money and a less grueling work schedule
in contract negotiations, which have been complicated by a lawsuit
he filed against 20th Century Fox Film Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims Fox gave its own stations sweetheart deals on
''The X-Files'' reruns when the program should have been sold to
the highest bidder. The result, the suit claims, was that Duchovny
was underpaid on the series' profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely could do another year, but I really don't know if
it'll happen,'' Duchovny said in an interview last month. ''I'm
kind of happy that decision's been taken away from me. I've made my
terms clear.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The X-Files,'' which ends the season this Sunday, has been one
of Fox's most popular shows and a key part of its schedule. The
series, which moved here from Vancouver at Duchovny's request, will
continue production in Los Angeles, Carter said.

<HEADLINE> Korean 'Comfort Women' Speak Out  </HEADLINE>
By JEAN H. LEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hwang Keum-ju was just a teen-ager, a girl in a
navy skirt and a braid trailing down her back, when she left her
home in Korea during World War II lured by Japanese promises of
high wages at military factories.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she was packed into a train with dozens of other young
Korean girls and transported to the front lines of the war in the
Pacific, where she says she was forced to work in Japanese military
brothels.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five years later, she and dozens of other former ''comfort
women'' -- now in their 70s and 80s -- are still waiting for an
apology.
</P>
<P>
   ''For half a century, no words from Japan. Day and night you say
that it never happened,'' Kim Hak-soon says in the film ''Silence
Broken,'' which airs Thursday on PBS (check local listings). ''But
here I am, a living witness. I stepped forward -- that's how the
silence was broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians say 200,000 Korean women, as well as women living in
the occupied territories of China, the Philippines and Indonesia,
were forced into sexual servitude by the Japanese during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Herded into wooden shacks built near the front lines with just a
blanket on the floor, the women recall being identified not by name
but by number, and being drugged, beaten and raped.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers lined up dozens deep. Some brought condoms -- one brand
was labeled ''Let's Attack'' -- but the spread of venereal disease
still ran rampant, leaving many of the women swollen from
infection.
</P>
<P>
   ''The soldiers treated us like military supplies -- shipped,
transported -- and did whatever they wanted with us,'' one former
comfort woman says in the film. ''We were just playthings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five decades since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki brought an end to the war in 1945, Japan has not provided
legal restitution for aggression in Asia -- despite a U.N.
resolution last year urging it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Dai Sil Kim-Gibson, who was born in Korea during the
Japanese occupation and emigrated to the United States in the
1960s, had ''heard vaguely'' about the comfort women.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1992, she was asked to translate for Hwang, who was
invited to speak about her experience in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Kim-Gibson said, Hwang grabbed her by the arm,
whispering: ''These people do not have the faintest idea that to us
Koreans, chastity is more precious than life itself.'' Indeed,
shunted aside by a Confucian society that reveres chastity, few of
the women married or were able to bear children upon returning
home. Hwang, who survived by working in textile factories and
running a food stand, never went back to her village.
</P>
<P>
   ''After that, my eyes were so open,'' Kim-Gibson says. ''Many of
these people wanted to talk about it; it was the people around them
who did not want to hear about it. That's what silenced it.''
</P>
<P>
   She set out to give voice to their stories, producing the film
and a companion book of oral histories bearing the same title. On
screen, the women -- their faces lined but their spirits resilient --
are candid, their testimonies moving.
</P>
<P>
   Kim-Gibson weaves in chilling wartime footage of children buried
by bombings, soldiers galloping toward battle and prisoners
beheaded, juxtaposing them with shots of Korea's serene
countryside. Finding a dearth of images of the young comfort women,
Kim-Gibson dramatized the period using Korean actresses.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say the Japanese Imperial Army began setting up
''comfort stations'' in China in the early 1930s, later expanding
to war zones throughout the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the battlefield, we didn't know when we might die. Since we
might die tomorrow, we sought consolation,'' explains Masanori
Tokuda, a former soldier in the film. ''That's how they consoled
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Korea, then a Japanese colony, provided the largest number of
women -- some of them misled into thinking they would work in
factories or hospitals, others seized by soldiers who went village
to village hunting for virgins.
</P>
<P>
   One former soldier recalls transporting the women to the
military brothels, admitting that the way they were treated ''was
not human.'' Historians estimate that only a quarter of them
survived.
</P>
<P>
   But some in Japan refute the women's claims outright, insisting
they went willing to work as prostitutes. Documents that would
substantiate the women's claims have been destroyed, one Japanese
scholar says in the film.
</P>
<P>
   And time is running out for the survivors. Since Kim Hak-soon
first went public with her story in 1991, 190 women have registered
as former comfort women. Among them, Kim and some 40 others have
died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, then-Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi offered Japan's
fullest apology, saying he felt ''acute remorse'' for the 1910-45
colonization of Korea. But the women say that is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Emperor Akihito says, 'It was a crime committed by my
father; please forgive me,' then I would understand and I would
receive his compensation,'' Hwang says in the film. ''If not I will
never accept.''
</P>
<P>
   An apology is hardly an exacting exchange for ruining girls'
lives, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make me 18 again. I would get married, join the human race
properly, give birth to children,'' Hwang says. ''I deserve to know
what life is all about.''

<HEADLINE> Left-leaning populist leads in Dominican presidential elections  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Populist opposition
leader Hipolito Mejia appeared headed for a first-round victory in
Dominican presidential elections, but partial returns suggested he
might be forced into a second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Millions turned out Tuesday for balloting that will decide the
economic direction of this Caribbean nation -- where a free-market
government expanded the economy by almost 40 percent in the past
four years but failed to lift most people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia supporters cheered wildly and danced at his campaign
headquarters in central Santo Domingo as results were announced.
</P>
<P>
   With results from 82 percent of polling stations counted today,
Mejia's party and its allies had 49.4 percent of votes to 25.2
percent for former President Joaquin Balaguer of the conservative
Social Christian Reformist party. Free-market advocate Danilo
Medina of the incumbent Dominican Liberation Party had 24.8
percent. Smaller parties split the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia needs more than 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off
election on June 30. Final results were expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the partial count that showed him just short of a
majority, Mejia declared victory at his campaign headquarters,
where supporters cheered wildly as he assured: ''We have gotten
more than the 50 percent and we continue to increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The results left open the possibility of a return to power by
Balaguer, a blind and frail man who was seven times president of
this Caribbean nation for most of the last 40 years, ending in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a run-off, Balaguer's and Medina's parties are widely
expected to unite, as they did in 1996 when their combined efforts
helped the Liberation Party's Leonel Fernandez narrowly defeat the
Revolutionary Party's Jose Pena Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed Balaguer's continuing influence in Dominican
politics -- despite the frailty reflected in his need to vote from
inside his car Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials offered no exact participation figures, but Wilfredo
Alemany, a spokesman for the Central Elections Board, called
participation ''massive.'' Early indications were that the vote
occurred without major problems despite long waits, crowding and
last-minute charges of irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters considered it a referendum on Fernandez's
free-market policies, criticized for failing to better the lot of
the poor majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has governed for the rich,'' said voter Manuel Escalante, a
pharmaceuticals marketer. ''The rich have gotten richer and the
poor have gotten poorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mejia, who bills himself as ''The Hope of the People,'' is a
colorful campaigner who offered voters social programs and small
community-level public works projects. Medina, a technocrat who ran
a lackluster campaign, insisted that the current economic boom
eventually would trickle down. Balaguer promised the security of a
strong and benevolent hand in government.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported two deaths that appeared to be related to the
elections, but voting was otherwise peaceful throughout the nation
of 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   A man was shot and killed Tuesday during an argument with a
rival party supporter in the southwestern town of San Juan de la
Maguana, police said. A 76-year-old woman allegedly died of a heart
attack after being shoved by a guard at a polling station in Santo
Domingo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Guards also scuffled with reporters covering Balaguer as he cast
his ballot from his car.
</P>
<P>
   The election attracted thousands of Dominicans living abroad,
many of whom came home to vote on trips arranged by the political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Party complained Monday that immigration
officials confiscated the voting cards of some party supporters
because of suspicions that they were illegal immigrants from
neighboring Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration director Danilo Diaz confirmed agents confiscated
about 1,000 cards in recent days, but he denied that any belonged
to legal Dominican residents. Mejia said he did not believe the
seizures would affect the results.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 foreign observers, including delegations from the
Organization of American States and the Atlanta-based Carter
Center, monitored the election. The local Citizen Participation
group posted 8,500 monitors throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> Treasury To Buy $2 Billion in Debt  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flush with cash from a booming economy, the
Treasury Department will buy back $2 billion of the national debt
Thursday, the latest in a series of debt reductions.
</P>
<P>
   That means Treasury will ask investors who hold certain older,
higher-yielding 30-year Treasury bonds to consider selling them
back to the government. No one would be forced to surrender bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Treasury Department said Wednesday that it
wants to buy back 12 outstanding issues of 30-year bonds that will
mature between February 2015 and August 2019. The bonds carry
coupon interest rates ranging from 7.250 percent to 11.250 percent.
Those rates are higher than the current yield on 30-year bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bonds the Treasury wants to buy back generally pay
higher than current yields, they most likely will draw a premium
for sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury initiated the first buyback of debt in 70 years in
March and has conducted a total of four such operations. Treasury
has said it would like to buy back up to $30 billion of debt this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Treasury has bought back a total of $7 billion of
outstanding 30-year Treasury bonds and paid sellers roughly $1.8
billion in premiums to cash in early.
</P>
<P>
   Still, over the long run, the government expects to save money
through its debt-buyback operations because it will save more in
interest payments than its costs of buying the bonds back.
</P>
<P>
   The debt bought back thus far is a tiny fraction of the $5.7
trillion national debt. Of that total, $3.6 trillion is held by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury will buy back the debt using a process known as a
''reverse auction,'' in which the government selects offers on a
competitive basis based on the lowest prices. Offers, in increments
of $100,000, must be submitted by 11 a.m. EDT Thursday and the
winning offers will be announced around midday.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Drops in Euro Nations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Inflation in the 11 nations that have
adopted the euro averaged an annual rate of 1.9 percent in April,
down from a record high of 2.1 percent in March, the European
Union's statistical office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The easing will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, which
saw its 2 percent target exceeded in March for the first time since
the single currency was launched on Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Lower inflation was linked to a decline in oil prices. The rapid
rise in oil prices had pushed up the inflation reading at the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The April inflation rate was the lowest since January but well
above the 1.1 percent annual rate of April 1999, according to
Eurostat data.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the generally good news for the ECB, there will likely
be concern that prices excluding energy rose at a 1.1 percent
annual rate in April compared with 0.9 percent in March. Some
analysts attributed that rise to the weakness of the euro against
the dollar, which is making imported goods more expensive in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   EU officials were also worried by the growing gap between
inflation rates in various euro-zone nations. While France
registered a 1.4 percent annual rate and Germany 1.6 percent,
Ireland recorded 5 percent and Spain 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The increasing inflation rate in Ireland confirms the ... view
that there are risks of overheating in the Irish economy,'' said
Pedro Solbes, the EU finance commissioner. He suggested the Irish
government should seriously consider increasing taxes to cool
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Taking in the four member nations yet to adopt the euro, the EU
inflation rate fell to an annual rate of 1.7 percent in April from
1.9 percent the previous month. Britain continued to have the EU's
lowest rate at an annual rate of 0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 107; Nasdaq Down 65  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in early trading today as investors
took profits from the market's recent rally and determined that the
interest rate increase implemented by the Federal Reserve on
Tuesday may indeed threaten stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 107.60.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 16.53 to 1,449.51, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 65.34 to 3,652.23.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said stocks were due to falter today as investors tried
to capture gains from a four-day rally that was capped Tuesday when
the Fed, as expected, raised interest rates a half-percentage point
-- its steepest increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, raising
borrowing costs and cutting into bottom-line profits. Investors had
bid stocks higher on the hope that Tuesday's increase could be the
last for a while, but with many economists predicting still higher
rates later this year, many investors lost their nerve today,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, the top-performing Dow component on Tuesday,
fell 6~ to 133[. After the close of trading Tuesday, the company
reported second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street analysts'
expectations. But testy investors may have been expecting
Hewlett-Packard to more dramatically exceed published estimates,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Rate-sensitive financial stocks were also lower. American
Express fell 7/16 to 36 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 115.57 million
shares, behind Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.86 to 500.12.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.8 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 1.9 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 1.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bancorp CFO Steps Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- One of the highest-ranking women bankers in
the nation is stepping down as chief financial officer of U.S.
Bancorp.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lester, 43, said Wednesday that she decided to leave the
bank last year. She will be replaced by Andrew Cecere, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Lester, CFO since 1996 and executive vice president of finance
since 1995, said she told John Grundhofer, the bank's chief
executive officer, of her decision to leave in the early fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lester will stay with the bank for a couple of months to assist
Cecere's transition into the job. She doesn't know what she will do
next and doesn't plan to begin job hunting until October.
</P>
<P>
   Lester said she was most proud of her work on acquisitions,
which helped the once-ailing First Bank System become U.S. Bancorp,
the nation's 11th-largest bank spanning 16 states with $83 billion
in assets. She also was an advocate for better job flexibility for
employees struggling with work and life issues.
</P>
<P>
   Cecere joined U.S. Bancorp 15 years ago and most recently served
as vice chairman in charge of commercial services.

determined that the interest rate increase implemented by the
Federal Reserve yesterday may indeed threaten stock prices. Higher
interest rates are generally bad for stocks, raising borrowing
costs and cutting into bottom-line profits. But investors had bid
stocks higher yesterday on the hope that the rate hike would be the
last for a while. Economists, however, are now predicting still
higher rates later this year. Just before 11 a.m. EDT, the Dow
industrials were down 141.52 at 10,793.05. On the NYSE decliners
led advancers 1,695-702. The Nasdaq was down 85.84 at 3,631.73.

   Terra, Lycos Merging in $12.5B Deal
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The leading Internet service provider in the
Spanish-speaking world is buying Lycos Inc., the first time a major
U.S. Web portal has been bought by a foreign company. The widely
expected acquisition by Terra Networks SA was announced yesterday.
The Spanish company is paying $12.5 billion in stock for its
beachhead in the United States, where it likely hopes to attract
Hispanic subscribers. The new company, to be called Terra Lycos,
ties together Lycos' Internet traffic, Terra's access business and
the telecommunications infrastructure of Telefonica SA, Spain's
largest phone company and the majority owner of Terra. Lycos stock
was down 5[ at 67{ in morning trading.

   Gov't Filing Microsoft Rebuttal
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will defend its proposed
breakup of Microsoft in what essentially will be the last official
word before a federal judge holds a hearing on what remedies to
impose on the company's business practices. The Justice Department
and 17 states were filing a rebuttal to Microsoft's request to
dismiss a plan that would split the company into two businesses --
one to develop the company's dominant Windows computer operating
system and the other for Microsoft's Office software, Microsoft
Network Internet services and game divisions. The plan was proposed
as a remedy to behavior found to be anticompetitive -- and illegal --
by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.

   U.S. Bancorp CFO Steps Down
</P>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- One of the highest-ranking women bankers in
the nation is stepping down as chief financial officer of U.S.
Bancorp. Susan Lester, 43, said that she made her decision to leave
the bank last year. She will be replaced by Andrew Cecere, 39.
Lester, CFO since 1996 and executive vice president of finance
since 1995, will stay with the bank for a couple of months to
assist Cecere's transition into the job. Lester said she was most
proud of her work on acquisitions, which helped the once-ailing
First Bank System become U.S. Bancorp, the nation's 11th-largest
bank spanning 16 states with $83 billion in assets. She also was an
advocate for better job flexibility for employees struggling with
work and life issues.

the troubled toy manufacturer that has been plagued with sagging
sales and profits. Robert A. Eckert will immediately take over the

   Lenders OK Rite Aid Refinancing
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp.'s lenders have agreed to a
refinancing plan that the company's chief executive said will be
key to rebuilding the financially troubled drugstore chain. The
existing lenders agreed yesterday to extend the maturity on their
debt to August 2002. The extension gives the company more time to
pay its existing debt. Next, note-holders will have to decide
whether to accept the company's bond exchange offer. Philip Muldoon
of McDonald Investments said the pact gives the nation's
third-largest drugstore chain ''breathing room'' but added it was
too early to tell whether the chain can recover. Rite Aid stock was
down 3/16 at 7 1/16.

   Toyota Profits Jump 14 Percent

   TOKYO (AP) -- Record export sales at Toyota Motor Corp. softened
the impact of a rising yen and helped lift profits 14 percent for
the year. Japan's largest automaker said today it posted a group
profit of 406.7 billion yen ($3.72 billion) in the fiscal year
ended March 31, up from 356.1 billion yen ($3.26 billion) a year
earlier. The maker of the Camry sedan and Lexus line of luxury cars
enjoyed record demand in North America and other export markets,
selling more than 3 million vehicles overseas for the first time
ever. Sales rose 1 percent to 12.8 trillion yen ($11.7 billion).

   Euro Nations Have 1.9 Pct. Inflation

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Inflation in the 11 nations that have
adopted the euro averaged an annual rate of 1.9 percent in April,
down from a record high of 2.1 percent in March, the European
Union's statistical office said today. The easing will be welcomed
by the European Central Bank, which saw its 2 percent target
exceeded in March for the first time since the single currency was
launched on Jan. 1, 1999. Lower inflation was linked to a decline
in oil prices. The rapid rise in oil prices had pushed up the
inflation reading at the beginning of the year.

   LONDON (AP) -- Hotel and TV network owner Granada Group PLC said
today it plans to merge with hospitality business Compass Group PLC
to form a combined concern worth about $26.3 billion. The merger
would give Granada shareholders control of about 66.3 percent of
the enlarged group and is the first step toward the eventual sale
of shares in Granada's Media as a stand-alone business. Granada
said an independent Granada Media would be better placed to grow
through further consolidation. Such a step likely would heat up the
race to create Britain's largest commercial broadcaster.

expectations. In Tokyo, prices fell as investors sold shares that
had risen in the morning. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
147.22 points, or 0.84 percent, to 17,551.25. Hong Kong shares
plunged as investors feared the territory's monetary officials

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall on Profit-Taking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks stumbled today as investors took profits
from the market's recent rally and determined that the interest
rate increase implemented by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday may
indeed threaten stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 133.30 at 10,801.27.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 18.91 to 1,447.13, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 82.94 to 3,634.63.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said stocks were due to falter today as investors tried
to capture gains from a four-day rally that was capped Tuesday when
the Fed, as expected, raised interest rates a half-percentage point
-- its steepest increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, raising
borrowing costs and cutting into bottom-line profits. Investors had
bid stocks higher on the hope that Tuesday's increase could be the
last for a while, but with many economists predicting still higher
rates later this year, many investors lost their nerve today,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the accumulation of rate hikes that truly hampers stock
market performance over time,'' said Gail Dudack, chief equity
strategist at UBS Warburg in New York. ''We do expect lower lows in
May and June to materialize before a better and more sustainable
summer rally can begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, the top-performing Dow component on Tuesday,
plunged 9 13/16 to 130 3/16. After the close of trading Tuesday,
the company reported second-quarter earnings that topped Wall
Street analysts' expectations. But testy investors may have been
expecting Hewlett-Packard to more dramatically exceed published
estimates, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, the testing and measuring equipment maker that was spun
off from Hewlett-Packard, fell 15} to 80\.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods stocks were also lower today. Johnson &AMP; Johnson
fell 1 3/16 to 86[ and Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 13/16 to 64\.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 279.09 million
shares, behind Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.15 to 499.83.

<HEADLINE> ABC, WB Networks Present Schedules  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is retooling its Friday and Saturday night
schedules this fall to add four new dramas and is sending in Bette
Midler to compete against ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Midler will star in ''The Bette Show'' on Wednesday nights, a
situation comedy in which she plays a character suspiciously like
herself.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is canceling its long-running medical drama ''Chicago
Hope,'' ''Martial Law,'' ''Early Edition,'' ''Now and Again'' and
''Ladies Man.'' Bill Cosby is also off CBS's schedule: His
''Cosby'' has retired and CBS hasn't picked up ''Kids Say the
Darndest Things.''
</P>
<P>
   On Fridays, CBS will air an update of the classic series ''The
Fugitive'' and ''C.S.I.,'' a drama about a team of forensic
investigators in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   With ABC and NBC both scheduling movies on Saturdays, CBS will
try three dramas. It will bring back ''Walker, Texas Ranger'' and
start two new series: ''That's Life,'' about a New Jersey girl who
ditches her blue-collar fiance and goes back to college, and ''The
District,'' about a police commissioner who tries to shake up
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is also shifting the newsmagazine ''48 Hours'' to Thursdays
at 8 p.m. and moving ''Diagnosis Murder'' to Thursdays at 10 p.m.
The medical drama ''City of Angels'' will stay on the schedule in
part because of concerns about the lack of minorities in major TV
roles, CBS President Leslie Moonves said after the fall lineup was
announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and UPN are scheduled to announce their fall schedules
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Midler leads a pack of three new CBS comedies. She has the
unenviable task of competing against ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the ABC game show that Moonves admits ''drives me
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I lie awake at night thinking of how to fight this thing and I
don't have the answer yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, ABC announced it would add a fourth night of
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   With four prime-time hours of the hit show with Regis Philbin,
ABC is adding only four new series in the fall. The network
canceled the critically acclaimed ''Sports Night'' and trimmed its
newsmagazine schedule from four nights to three.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the youth-oriented WB network hopes to recover some
of its sizzle with a fall schedule that includes two nights of
comedies, including a parody of the teen angst dramas it has lived
on the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millionaire'' has been a ratings juggernaut since its premiere
last August, and industry analysts have estimated it will earn
between $400 million to $600 million in profits next year.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is adding Geena Davis to its lineup in ''Geena,'' a comedy
about a career woman thrust into the role of mom by marrying a
widower. It also is adding a medical drama with former ''Homicide''
star Andre Braugher, and a comedy with Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   The WB's young comedies on Friday include the new ''Grosse
Pointe,'' a spoof of the behind-the-scenes lives of actors starring
in a teen drama.
</P>
<P>
   The network, whose ratings sagged this year, scheduled six
comedies on Sunday nights. It picked up the animated show ''The
PJs'' from Fox and moved ''The Jamie Foxx Show,'' ''The Steve
Harvey Show'' and ''For Your Love'' to Sundays.

<HEADLINE> Jury Finds Bear Stearns Negligent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bear Stearns Cos. was ordered to pay $111.5
million to a Canadian investor after a federal jury in Manhattan
found it acted negligently when it made unauthorized trades in his
account.
</P>
<P>
   Henryk de Kwiatkowski, the 76-year-old owner of a Kentucky
thoroughbred-horse-breeding farm who now lives in the Bahamas, had
claimed in a lawsuit that Bear Stearns Cos. cost him $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury in U.S. District Court concluded Tuesday that a
broker at Bear Stearns had not acted negligently and that the
company had not breached its fiduciary duty.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the jury did find that the company acted negligently and
owed de Kwiatkowski $111.5 million. It was one of the largest jury
awards ever handed a Wall Street firm accused of wronging an
individual investor.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the company argued during the two-week trial that de
Kwiatkowski was a sophisticated investor, putting up to $6.5
billion at stake in trading in the high-risk currency futures
markets.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Bear Stearns said: ''The verdict was against the
weight of the evidence, and we intend to appeal. We are confident
we will be vindicated upon appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Curran, a lawyer for de Kwiatkowski, said his client ''is
gratified that he was vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Curran said he would submit an application to the court
Wednesday for his client to receive interest on the damages.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Poland, de Kwiatkowski fled the Nazis and escaped
from a Soviet prison camp during World War II. He built his fortune
leasing airplanes and in sales before purchasing Calumet Farm in
Kentucky.

<HEADLINE> Amway To Cut 1,300 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADA, Mich. (AP) -- Direct-sales giant Amway Corp. said today it
plans to cut nearly 11 percent of its global work force, or 1,300
jobs, as part of a restructuring expected to save $300 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was expected. Amway announced in February that
it was reorganizing in response to sluggish sales and the changing
business environment, and cuts were likely.
</P>
<P>
   About 900 jobs will be cut at the company's world headquarters
in Ada. Another 260 jobs will be slashed overseas with the
remainder of the cuts coming from Amway's California operations in
Buena Park and Lakeview.
</P>
<P>
   Management and salaried positions will be most affected by the
cuts, according to the company. The company expects to identify
most of the affected positions by Aug. 31. Most employees will
leave by year's end, but it could be 15 months before all the cuts
are completed.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the restructuring, Amway plans to divide its
worldwide operations into three business units.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held Amway, one of the world's largest
direct-sales companies with about $6 billion in annual revenue,
employs about 12,000 people worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel OKs China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's bill to extend permanent
favorable trade benefits to China gained a major boost today as the
Senate Finance Committee voted 18-1 to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee was also expected to approve
the measure later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., called
the measure ''a defining moment in our relationship with China.''
</P>
<P>
   The sole vote against the bill was cast by Sen. Jim Jeffords,
R-Vt. He said he was doing so primarily to protest the continued
imprisonment in China of Tibetan musicologist Ngawang Choepel, who
had attended a Vermont college.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords charged he was being held unjustly and that China had
also banned his mother from visiting her son in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''If China cannot obey its own laws in this case, how can we
expect it to follow the far more burdensome rules of the World
Trade Organization?'' asked Jeffords.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided vote reflects the fact that the bill has wide
bipartisan support in the Senate. However, its fate in the House
was less certain, with organized labor waging an intensive campaign
to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would end 20 years of annual congressional votes on
China's trade status and grant it ''permanent normal trade
relations,'' the same low-tariff access to U.S. markets that nearly
every other nation in the world already enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   It would also ease China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, the Geneva-based group that oversees world trade.
China was a founding member of the WTO's predecessor, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but it withdraw after the 1949
communist takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wide margin of passage, several committee members
expressed some skepticism over whether normalizing economic ties
would bring about improvements in China's human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who say change will come quickly may be misjudging 5,000
years of Chinese history,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rockefeller and other proponents of the bill said they
were persuaded that it would help open Chinese markets to U.S.
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We better figure out how we can live in peace with these
people because there are so many of them,'' said Sen. Bob Graham,
D-Fla., of the world's most populous nations.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a top Senate sponsor of the trade
bill, portrayed the panel's vote -- the first of any congressional
votes on the measure -- as ''a good opportunity for us to seize the
momentum'' in advance of the more difficult House battle.
</P>
<P>
   On the House side, Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and Rep. Doug
Bereuter, R-Neb., reached agreement with House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, and other key lawmakers on
language to be included in the China bill that would provide
protections for American industries against a sudden surge in
imports with China.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that the compromise, which was reached in
negotiations late Tuesday night, was to be included in the bill
that the Ways and Means Committee was scheduled to vote on.
</P>
<P>
   Levin and Bereuter are also pushing for creation of a human
rights commission that would issue annual reports on China's
performance to take the place of the annual congressional vote. But
House aides said that final agreement on the language for that
proposal would probably not come until the House Rules Committee
takes up the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Their legislation is being sponsored in the Senate by Baucus and
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.

<HEADLINE> 'N Sync Feels the Power  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Know your power.
</P>
<P>
   Those three words of advice from someone who had been in their
position seem to be a secret mantra for the five members of 'N
Sync.
</P>
<P>
   They came from Jordan Knight, the ex-member of New Kids on the
Block who is enjoying a second act after teen stardom. He passed on
the wisdom when the two acts were touring together a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Know who controls your business and that's you,'' said 'N
Sync's Lance Bass. ''And we didn't realize that until this last
year -- that we are in control. And without us five guys, nothing
could happen. ... We finally realized that and took control of our
own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can argue with the results? 'N Sync is white-hot, now
plainly the leaders of the teen-oriented pop style that's driving
the music business today.
</P>
<P>
   The group shattered a record when its album, ''No Strings
Attached,'' sold 2.4 million copies in one week in March. It's now
up to 5.2 million sold and quickly climbing. Bass, Joey Fatone,
Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick and JC Chasez are spending
their summer performing at sold-out concerts packed with squealing
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing their power arguably put them in that position. ''No
Strings Attached'' plainly pokes fun at their image as a boy band
controlled by others; the album cover and video for ''Bye Bye Bye''
depicts them as puppets.
</P>
<P>
   The quintet fought a messy legal battle to extricate themselves
from a record deal arranged by its former promoter, Lou Pearlman,
that was settled late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The fight cast them in the role of artists under assault -- just
the kind of thing that brings out the overprotective instincts in
teen-age girls. It undoubtedly helped send ''No Strings Attached''
into overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were worried in the first place that we weren't going to
get out of it,'' Kirkpatrick said. ''We thought that this was going
to hold up our careers for a good five years, keep us in litigation
and different trials here and there. But, luckily, we got out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkpatrick advises anyone who considers 'N Sync just another
boy band to listen to the album.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can see us in performance and they can see us in
interviews and realize we're individuals,'' he said. ''We put
ourselves together. We're a totally different group than what
people are trying to make us out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync's critics probably aren't even interested in listening
to the group's music, Fatone said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We enjoy the music,'' he said. ''It's not like we're just
trying to throw something together just to sell the album. It's
something that we put our blood, sweat and tears into, especially
this album due to all the legal issues.''
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync wasn't too happy about the ABC television series,
''Making the Band,'' which followed Pearlman as he tried to create
another teen sensation. It fell flat in the ratings and has been
canceled, but it still stung.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since it was made by one of the guys that put money behind us
in the beginning, you know, they flip it around and make it look
like he's out there, he's the one that's putting the group
together,'' Kirkpatrick said. ''He's the one sitting in
choreography rehearsals, putting in his input. He's the one in
vocal rehearsals when, in actuality, we didn't talk to him for
months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It kind of clumps us into this thing and making us look like
we're like that group,'' he said. ''And it really kind of takes
away some of our credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatone's bought a house from the profits of ''No Strings
Attached.'' So has Bass. It's hard to know when they'll have the
chance to enjoy these fruits of their success.
</P>
<P>
   When the tour ends, they have August and September to write and
record another album. Then they head to Europe for a concert tour
with Britney Spears. Then it's back to North America for another
tour around the holidays. Then it's time to make a movie. By next
spring, it will be time to promote another album.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that when Fatone is asked to pick a song that best
describes what his life is like now, he chooses Michael Jackson's
''Working Day and Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Chasez said rehearsals for the concert tour were killers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This tour is going to be physically exhausting,'' he said. ''I
think everyone who watches the show, they're going to walk away
amazed, but they're going to walk away tired. That includes the
fans, because it's such a high-energy show. We've been looking at
the set list and working out the details of the show, and we're
literally now trying to find places where we can breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   What does 'N Sync see itself doing in 10 years?
</P>
<P>
   ''Most likely doing a little bit less dancing,'' deadpanned a
tired Chasez.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a bigger house,'' Kirkpatrick added.
</P>
<P>
   They're intent upon staying in the business. ''We're always
going to grow up with our fans,'' Bass said. ''You know, those
teens can't stay teens forever.''
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync admitted to some nervousness heading out on their
concert tour, not wanting to disappoint fans who overwhelmed phone
lines and box offices to snap up the tickets -- and maybe because of
their newfound power.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're excited to say that everything you see is done by us,''
Bass said. ''And it's dangerous to say that because if anything
goes wrong, if we happen to make a mistake here or there, we're
going to be blamed.
</P>
<P>
   ''But that's OK because, you know, we've learned from our
mistakes.''

<HEADLINE> Corelli Reunites Greece, Filmmakers  </HEADLINE>
By THEODORA TONGAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAMI, Greece (AP) -- The war is returning to the island of
Cephalonia.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of Italian troops coming across the Ionian Sea, this
invasion is mobilized by filmmakers creating World War II-era sets
for one of the largest movies ever made in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Work crews are applying finishing touches to building facades
and hunting for extras -- including mules -- for ''Captain Corelli's
Mandolin,'' based on the best-selling novel by Louis de Bernieres
about a love affair between a local woman and an Italian officer in
Mussolini's ill-fated occupation of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The book also covers another pivotal event: the 1953 earthquake
that left almost nothing standing, and required set designers to
recreate the Venetian-style architecture that once characterized
the island.
</P>
<P>
   Filming is scheduled to begin this weekend and is seen as a
possible revival in interest in Greek locales among foreign film
companies. The last major movie filmed in Greece was 1991's
Italian-Spanish hit ''Mediterraneo,'' also about an Italian soldier
smitten by a local woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had always wanted to film it here and here is where we
are,'' producer Kevin Loader said. ''There's something about this
landscape that we wanted to get in the movie ... and historically,
this is where it all happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage will play Corelli, who falls
in love with a local doctor's daughter, Pelagia, played by Spanish
actress Penelope Cruz, best known as the star of Pedro Almodovar's
1999 Oscar-winning ''All About My Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The new film will be directed by John Madden, whose credits
include the 1998 best-picture Oscar winner ''Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   The sounds of hammers and drills broke the normal winter calm on
the streets of Cephalonia's main port, Sami, about 180 miles
northwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have to get more help,'' said cafe owner Evgenios
Theofilatos, who opened his business one month early to accommodate
the crews. ''If we're this busy now, I can't imagine what will
happen when the whole cast is here and the tourist season begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 2,300 residents in and around Sami rely on tourism,
farming and raising livestock to make their living. But the movie
has offered a spectacular diversion and a chance to make extra
money.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of local workers have assisted British and Irish builders
on the sets, which are carefully weathered and battered for a
war-torn effect.
</P>
<P>
   The abandoned and quake-leveled village of Dihalia, perched on a
cliff above the sea, will be temporarily resurrected with movie
sets: a cafe, church, houses and a village square.
</P>
<P>
   Casting coordinator Stavros Kaplanidis, meanwhile, is hunting
for at least 400 extras for the 12 weeks of filming.
</P>
<P>
   Many locals who survived the war and the 7.2-magnitude
earthquake, which claimed 476 lives on the island, have helped
researchers striving for historical accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Erikaiti Tzaneta, president of the local cultural organization,
offered family photos and her great-grandmother's clothing for
study as well as joining others in showing off regional dances.
</P>
<P>
   A researcher, Rea Apostolidis, also looked for details about the
Italians' failed conquest of Greece.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it seems, locals are more excited with the prospect of
seeing their island's history on the big screen than they are
star-struck by the chance of mingling with Cage and other actors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be admirable and honorable for our land,'' said cab
driver Dionysis Vitoratos. ''We will have something to brag
about.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This movie is going for an Oscar. We'll be lucky, like with
'Zorba (the Greek)' back then,'' Tzaneta gushed, referring to the
1964 movie that was filmed in Crete and won three Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   But others are less than enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Tavern owner Angelos Liberatos complained of Sami being divided
in half by the set and worries about noise from battle scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Gerasimos Artelaris tries to counter the grumbling by
predicting that the $35 million movie will keep alive tourist
interest started by the mid-'90s publication of ''Corelli's
Mandolin.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The island had a 20 percent increase in tourism last year,
mostly British, German and Italians,'' he said. ''We already have
many visitors to see the set's construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Media reports earlier this year indicated that ''Corelli'' was
slated for filming elsewhere, possibly in Turkey or Albania,
because of complications with local residents and authorities,
including some who claimed the book gave an unfairly romantic
portrayal of the occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Love during war has always existed,'' scoffed cab driver
Vitoratos, who was hurt in the earthquake and fought in the
resistance. ''People who said we didn't want the film done were
just spreading dirty rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently there is no single Corelli-Pelagia story that was
used as the basis for the book. But memories of wartime affairs
between Italian soldiers and Greek women are still vivid.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Angeliki Stratigou and former Italian soldier Luigi
Surace rekindled their romance more than half a century after their
meeting in the port of Patras in August 1941. They planned to marry
last year, but Stratigou died just two weeks before the wedding.

<HEADLINE> Woody Allen Hits Campus Circuit  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- What an odd place for Woody Allen to turn up:
Los Angeles, the city whose only cultural advantage, he once said,
was that it let you ''make a right turn on a red light.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as strange is the venue: Allen, a self-professed lousy
student who was kicked out of New York University, now sits on a
theater stage at UCLA, leading an academic dialogue about writing
and moviemaking to an audience of film students, teachers and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Averse to the marketing mill, Allen decided to promote his
latest film -- the comedy ''Small Time Crooks,'' starring himself
and Tracy Ullman, and opening Friday -- by sharing 35 years of movie
experience with young filmmakers and industry enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   He went back to school for a week this month, visiting prominent
film schools to show the movie and answer questions about how he
does what he does. The tour of NYU, the University of Chicago, UCLA
and Harvard was fortuitously scheduled so Allen could be home in
Manhattan to catch the New York Knicks' home playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all timed perfectly. I haven't missed a game,'' Allen
said before his UCLA appearance in an interview at his ornate
Beverly Hills hotel suite (the ''Mussolini suite,'' he calls it,
welcoming a visitor).
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought this would not only be a painless way to do
publicity for the film but a nice thing to do,'' Allen says. ''I'm
enjoying the experience of answering questions for them because I
think that I'm teaching them something and being helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   In the packed theater at UCLA, Allen's got an adoring audience.
They wouldn't be here if they didn't love his films. It's something
like the devotion shown by Emmet Ray, Sean Penn's jazz-guitarist
hero from Allen's ''Sweet and Lowdown,'' who swoons in the presence
of his idol, Django Reinhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ditched class to come here,'' one student tells the
director, adding that she spotted her professor in the room ''so he
ditched class, too.'' She says she wrote her question down so she
wouldn't throw up out of nervousness, and asks Allen if there's a
single theme running through his pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ''People think my films have a kind of sameness, like 'Oh,
another Woody Allen movie,''' Allen replies. ''From where I sit,
they're very, very different, but maybe I'm not seeing it.''
</P>
<P>
   He compares it to Chinese food: While a Chinese buffet might be
rich in variety, with 100 different dishes, diners tend to group it
all just as Chinese food.
</P>
<P>
   If his films do have a recurring theme, he wisecracks, it's one
''that keeps people out of theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Small Time Crooks'' could help Allen break out of his bind as
a beloved American filmmaker whose movies generally do little at
the U.S. box office. Loaded with sight gags and funny put-downs,
the story of a bank heist planned by a lovably cretinous gang is
one of his lightest comedies since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ''My films are not made for box office, and indeed, they don't
get the box office,'' Allen says at his hotel. ''I've never been in
that hit-flop sweepstakes because I would be a consistent loser all
the time, and have been.''
</P>
<P>
   He's had a few breakout hits such as ''Hannah and Her Sisters,''
but Allen's movies generally remain in the $4 million to $12
million range domestically. The last two, ''Sweet and Lowdown'' and
''Celebrity,'' grossed $4 million to $5 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Much like jazz, which Allen plays weekly in New York City gigs,
he is a popular American export, however, and European audiences
have kept his film career going.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a different culture, so a film in Europe by certain
directors, no matter how serious it is or how comic, once they glom
on to a certain director, you become box office,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Again, if it wasn't for Europe, I think I would have been in a
different business 20 years ago. I mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for his fans that didn't happen, and the UCLA crowd tells
him so.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to ask you a favor: Do not stop working,'' one
student tells Allen. He asks if Allen has thought about doing
director's commentary or otherwise enhancing DVD releases of his
films. Allen says no.
</P>
<P>
   ''I make the film, this is the film, that's the end of it,''
Allen says. ''If you like it, you like it. If you don't like, you
don't. I've never thought of supplementing it with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student tells Allen she's a ''humongous fan'' of his
Ingmar Bergman-style drama ''Another Woman.'' Another asks about
the inspiration for that movie, which prompts a discussion of
Allen's comedies vs. the much less popular dramas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe they're not popular because I can't do them well. Maybe
they're not popular because dramas are never as popular,'' Allen
says.
</P>
<P>
   He confesses that for all his comic talents, he always wanted to
be a serious dramatist like Eugene O'Neill or Tennessee Williams --
''real heavy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   That leads to talk about Allen's choices about what movies to
make and why he decided early on to take full artistic control,
after he wound up hating the first movie he wrote, ''What's New,
Pussycat?,'' from 1965. The movie became popular, and Allen found
himself having to say nice things about a movie he loathed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I vowed never to write another film if I couldn't direct it,''
he says, though he did do it once more, with ''Play It Again, Sam''
in 1972. ''It's better to have a film you love and people hate
rather than one you hate and people love. The ideal way is a movie
you love and they love, but that's hard to do. If you get that, you
hit the jackpot.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the jackpot, with unexpected repercussions, is the idea
behind Allen's new movie. ''Small Time Crooks'' traces the rise and
fall of Ray and Frenchy Winkler (Allen and Ullman), low-class New
Yorkers who open a cookie store as a front to tunnel into the bank
two doors down.
</P>
<P>
   In an unforeseen manner, they strike it rich, but end up at odds
over Frenchy's Pygmalion-like desire to get some culture under the
tutelage of a suave Henry Higgins-type art dealer (Hugh Grant). Ray
just wants turkey meatballs and cheeseburgers for dinner after days
at the dog track.
</P>
<P>
   The part fit what Allen calls his limited acting range.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really not an actor,'' Allen says at his hotel. ''There's
two things I'm believable as. Three things, actually. I'll get to
the third in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm believable as an intellectual because I'm slight and I
wear big black-rimmed glasses and people think I'm an intellectual.
I'm not, but they think I am, and I can play that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can also play a low-life, because that's much closer to me.
I really am the guy at home with the Beck's beer, the spaghetti,
the Knick game on or the baseball game on or the prize fight on.
That's really closer to who I am. So I can play Broadway Danny Rose
or this or the guy in 'Take the Money and Run.'
</P>
<P>
   ''The other thing is, I played an ant (DreamWorks' animated
''Antz'') and a sperm (Allen's ''Everything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask''). I can do creatures. But
in humans, I can do a low-life or an intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Small Time Crooks'' is partly an homage to Jackie Gleason's
''The Honeymooners'' -- ''one of the only things I find
authentically funny,'' Allen says. ''I truly find them hilarious,
and whenever the reruns are on television, no matter what late hour
it may be, I always manage to stay up and watch it and genuinely
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kramden style, Allen and Ullman lovingly trade barbs and
threats, Ray raising his fist, barking at Frenchy to fix him
dinner, telling her, ''I'm going to slam your head off.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents, who are still alive, had that kind of relationship
my whole life,'' Allen says. ''It was a Ralph-and-Alice
relationship, where they were constantly battling but clearly loved
each other. ... They've stayed together and had a very good
marriage, though, you'd think, out of spite.''
</P>
<P>
   Ullman also appeared in Allen's ''Bullets Over Broadway'' and
worked on his musical, ''Everyone Says I Love You,'' though her
part was cut from that film.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has encountered new challenges casting female leads since
his breakup with longtime lover and co-star Mia Farrow. Their
relationship ended bitterly over Allen's affair with Farrow's
adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, whom Allen then married.
</P>
<P>
   He reunited with Diane Keaton for ''Manhattan Murder Mystery,''
and has cast Goldie Hawn, Julia Roberts, Elisabeth Shue, and
regulars Judy Davis and Dianne Wiest in recent films.
</P>
<P>
   ''It opens you up, definitely, because I get a chance to work
with Elisabeth Shue or Julia Roberts and new people,'' Allen says.
''But you also have the problem of not working with someone you've
worked with before, and that's always a help to me. I can write
better for someone if I've worked with them. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd love to do another piece with Diane Keaton because I think
there's some chemistry between us. I think we're funny together,
because I know her so well and I know how to get the most out of
her in a comic way.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen has backed away more and more from starring in his own
movies, partly because he felt he had better actors to take the
roles, partly because of his age, 64. He cast Kenneth Branagh as
the neurotic magazine writer in the dark ''Celebrity,'' the sort of
pathetic misfit of romance that Allen would have played himself 20
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't do that part because I needed a 40-year-old, and
I'm a 60-year-old,'' Allen says. ''If a 60-year-old has those
problems, it's sort of tragic. If a 40-year-old has those problems,
he still has time to change his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he knew he lacked the acting chops for the fictional
guitarist in ''Sweet and Lowdown,'' so he cast Penn, who earned an
Oscar nomination for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to act in almost all my films. Now I do one out of
three or one out of two or something,'' Allen says. ''Jerry Lewis,
years ago, I asked him what the best thing was about not being in
your films when you're the director, and he said, 'You don't have
to shave.'
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew exactly what he meant. Those cold mornings when I have
to get up and shave and be out and be funny at 7 o'clock in the
morning on a freezing New York street. But when you're just the
director, you get up, take a shower, drive to work and look awful,
and the burden is on Kenneth Branagh or Sean Penn. They've got to
come in and make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA, Allen is asked how he gets his cast to make things
happen, given his notoriously light directing touch and the fact
that he often gives actors only the pages of the script where their
characters appear.
</P>
<P>
   He says he lets actors play with the lines, improvise around
them, even throw them out completely and try something different.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very big on spontaneity,'' Allen says. ''I feel actors
should not know where they're going -- what they call in acting
school 'playing the results.' They should not know what they
wouldn't know in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   His evening on campus wraps up with blunt words on what young
filmmakers can expect in real life. ''Reality will winnow out the
ones who don't have it, and they will fall by the board
eventually,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Those that have the talent will find their way, Allen assures
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are not a lot of Martin Scorseses or Steven Spielbergs
or Francis Ford Coppolas walking around cursing the fact that they
are undiscovered,'' Allen says. ''You just have to give it a fair
shot and let reality take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   And this parting shot from Woody Allen:
</P>
<P>
   ''Reality eventually crushes you.''
</P>
<P>
   To a standing ovation, Allen quickly slips behind a red velvet
curtain, bound for his last college visit, at Harvard the following
night, then home to New York.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- From an interview with Woody Allen and his
session with a UCLA film audience:
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   On why he never watches his previous movies:
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never seen any of them after I finish them. But only
because I wouldn't be able to take it. If I popped in and saw
'Bananas' today or 'Hannah and Her Sisters' or any of them, I would
just be sitting there saying, 'Oh, if I only had a little more
money I could have done that better, or look at that joke, it's not
holding up, I don't think it's very good. I could do this better
now.' And you can't do it over. ... It's just heartbreaking to look
at them.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   On paying his actors on his low film budgets:
</P>
<P>
   ''We really pay a very low amount, shockingly low. Everybody
that works, whether it's Julia Roberts or Sean Penn or whoever it
is gets the same $5,000 a week. Whether they get $10 million on
another picture, they get $50,000 for our picture, and that's our
top.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   On ''Small Time Crooks'' co-stars Tracey Ullman and Elaine May:
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think of Tracey as I was writing it, but when I was
finished and I sat with Juliet Taylor, my casting person, she read
off a list of possibilities, and the second she read Tracey's name,
the two of us looked at each other and felt, who else could do it
but Tracey? She has that perfect edge to her, she can do those
accents perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whereas Elaine May I was thinking of as I was writing it. I
even named the character May in the movie because I've know Elaine
for years and find her brilliant. In this picture I was working
with two female comic geniuses, and I was intimidated because I've
known Elaine for 30 years and have always wanted to work with her,
but she was always elusive. You can call Elaine, and she's
brilliant but she'll say she can't work because she has to feed her
hamster or something. She's always got some strange reason why you
can't get her. And this one, I got her.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   On early career prospects:
</P>
<P>
   ''I had toyed with going into a life of crime. It would not have
been brutal crime. First, I thought about going into law
enforcement, but they had height requirements. There's no height
requirement for criminals. I thought of maybe being a confidence
man or a bookmaker or trying clever burglary. Or a card cheat. I
saw myself on boats or cruises cheating people playing cards. Or a
safecracker.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   On Samantha Morton, nominated for an Oscar for her role as a
mute waif in ''Sweet and Lowdown'':
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw her on a videocassette, and I said, 'My God, that face
should have been in silent movies.' She's got that kind of little
gamine's face. So I hired her immediately the minute I saw her.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   On what's really important to his bank-robber character in
''Small Time Crooks,'' and to Allen himself:
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a guy who likes the turkey meatballs and the pinball
machines and just to hang out, and when he did get all that money,
thinking he needed a big score in his life, he didn't. He needed a
little bit of money so he could go to Florida and go to the dog
races and eat the stone crabs. ... It's the action he wants, the
work itself that is distracting in life sufficiently to be
therapeutic. It's the same thing with the film business. Making the
film is the fun. I've been on the end of films that were wildly
successful and very unsuccessful, and, you know, neither one means
that much. You go on to make your next film. Your life doesn't
change hugely when you make a big success, and it doesn't go down
the toilet if you have a failure. It's somewhere in between. If
you're having fun for the year it takes you to make the film, then
your life has some meaning to it. It's an enjoyable experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   On speaking to film students at NYU, which kicked him out in the
1950s:
</P>
<P>
   ''It is ironic. They wanted to give me an honorary degree at
NYU, and many colleges in the country have asked me to make
commencement speeches and come there to get degrees. I've never
done any of that because I've never wanted to, not out of anything
other than that it seemed a nuisance and an empty ritual, to travel
to a school to get a degree. I have nothing to say at a
commencement speech, and those degrees don't mean anything to them
or me. I haven't earned a degree. I don't have any of the schooling
for it. It's a public-relations ritual for them, and some piece of
paper you take to your house and after a week it falls behind the
bookshelf and you never see it again, or you throw it out because
the maid says you're accumulating too much.''

<HEADLINE> Asian-African Author Returns Home  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN LINNEE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- When night descended on the house on Desai
Road, the small boy shivered as windows and doors were shut and
bolted to keep out the Mau Mau and the fear they incited across
colonial Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have this image,'' recalls author M.G. Vassanji. ''My father
was alive then. He had bought a gun, and my mother was really
scared. I was really young then, but I always had this memory, and
I wanted to cope with it in a literary fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I finally have the courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Vassanji, a nuclear physicist and author of ''The Gunny Sack''
and other novels and short stories, recently returned to the
country of his birth from his home in Toronto to research his
latest work set in Kenya in the mid-1950s during the Mau-Mau
uprising against British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is that it is inspired by the fear that I had of
the climate here, because the Mau Mau was active. There is a strong
Mau Mau element in the sense that that's what I'm trying to explore
-- how the Asians felt and what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1952 to the late 1950s, fear swept beautiful Kenya, the
East African colony thousands of British and European settlers had
decided to call home. Many had obtained land seized from the
Kikuyu, Kenya's largest tribe. Determined to get their land back
and drive out the foreigners, Kikuyu fighters took to the forests
and swore vengeance against all who opposed their Mau Mau crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Although the period was reported in the Western media as a time
of barbaric violence against whites, especially those living on
isolated farms, Kikuyus and other Africans who sided with the
colonial government bore the brunt of the Mau Mau wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that 32 European civilians, 26 Asians and 1,819
''loyal Africans'' were killed in what became known as ''The
Emergency.'' A report for the British colonial government said
11,503 ''terrorists'' were killed and another 26,625 arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion was stamped out by British troops and African
soldiers. Thousands of Kikuyus were uprooted and placed in
detention camps for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do you build? There's an image or an incident. Here, it's
just this fear we had on Desai Road at night when we closed the
doors, the windows, the curtains, and then you were really scared
of the darkness outside and what may come from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vassanji, 50, is an Ismali Muslim whose ancestors came to East
Africa from the Gujarat region in northwestern India at the end of
the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants from the Indian subcontinent originally numbered tens
of thousands in what are now Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. During the
colonial era, they were not first-class citizens, but they were
considerably better off than native Africans. Middle managers and
junior colonial civil servants, artisans and traders, some built up
large mercantile empires. They are known collectively as Asians,
and their relationship with their African homelands has often been
ambiguous and tense.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, at a time when more black Africans -- particularly
the Kikuyu -- were getting access to education in schools run by
missionaries, resentment against the Asians, who dominated trade
and the middle levels of the colonial civil service, was on the
rise.
</P>
<P>
   After independence in 1963, many Asian businesses were taken
over by Africans. In neighboring Uganda, at least 70,000 Asians
were forced to leave all together.
</P>
<P>
   Vassanji's family moved to Dar es Salaam in neighboring Tanzania
at the end of the Mau Mau period. He won an undergraduate
scholarship to study physics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1970 and obtained his doctorate from the University
of Pennsylvania in 1978. He says he only became aware of his
Asian-Indian heritage while studying in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, I discovered India for myself and started reading
philosophy and Gandhi in the original. ... These things were
meaningless to me when I was growing up. We had disregarded it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while living in Toronto where he had obtained a job
teaching nuclear physics that Vassanji began to encounter his East
African past. His wife, Nur Jehan, is also from Dar es Salaam, but
they only met in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started reading about my history in East Africa. ... I found
references to Indians. ... Not very pleasant, but still.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Vassanji -- Moyez to his friends -- returned to Dar es
Salaam for the first time in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was such an experience. I landed at night. Early in the
morning I got out and started walking, and I walked all day. ... I
have never met an Asian, especially from our Ismali community,
especially from my generation, who talks of Dar es Salaam without
fondness. ... There's such a warmth to that memory. It was the best
years of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   On his return to Toronto, Vassanji, ''burdened by this sense of
the past and not knowing what to do with it,'' began putting the
pieces together and wrote ''The Gunny Sack,'' the saga of an
Asian-African family in East Africa told through the contents of a
magic gunny sack. It was his first attempt at fiction, and the
prestigious -- if not well-endowed -- African Writers Series of the
British firm Heineman published the work the same year. The book
went on to win the Commonwealth Prize for a first work of fiction
by an African author.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a kind of vindication to be published by the African
Writers Series as an Asian,'' Vassanji says. ''It was the only
place I sent the manuscript; they were the only people who would
know where Dar es Salaam was.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Uhuru Street,'' a book of short stories, and ''No New Land,''
followed. In 1994, he published ''The Book of Secrets'' another
engrossing account of Asians in East Africa based on a diary kept
by a junior British colonial administrator. It's a novel that cries
out to be made into a film, but the director, Vassanji says, would
have to be someone ''who understands India and Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Vassanji, who never studied writing, writes like he talks, in a
simple, straightforward way, pausing to highlight seemingly small
details that will illuminate his narrative. He has captured the
rhythm of those who speak in Kiswahili, in Gujarati and in English
and sometimes in all three together, both stilted and lilting, and
full of memory.
</P>
<P>
   The prologue to ''The Book of Secrets,'' published in the United
States by St. Martin's Press:
</P>
<P>
   ''They call it the book of our secrets, kitabu cha siri zetu. Of
its writer they said: He steals our souls and locks them away; it
is a magic bottle, this book, full of captured spirits; see how he
keeps his eyes skinned, this mzungu, observing everything we do.
... Because it has no end, this book, it ingests us and carries us
with it, and so it grows.''
</P>
<P>
   Vassanji and his wife started the Toronto South Asian Review
''as an Asian thing'' about 10 years ago; she now runs the
publishing side of the family, TSAR publications, as well as the
magazine, now known simply as the Toronto Review.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent book, ''Amrika,'' is a collection of vignettes
published last year in Canada by McLellan and Stewart, about Asian
East Africans in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher will probably also handle the new book, as
yet untitled. Vassanji says he wants to set it somewhere outside
Nairobi, perhaps in Nakuru on the edge of the Great Rift Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The chance discovery of a book written by an English woman who
lived during the Mau Mau period -- ''Letters to Nellie'' by Elspeth
Huxley -- has put his collective memories in motion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just flipped through it ... it tells you how whites felt ...
things began to fall into place. For me, it was a matter of looking
at the ground, the trees ... and also trying to find out where to
take the novel from there,'' said the lapsed physicist who still
likes to solve problems. ''It will take a couple of years at least.
I want to move it into something that's of significance to me
now.''

<HEADLINE> Ghent Goes 'Over the Edges' for Art  </HEADLINE>
By CONSTANT BRAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   GHENT, Belgium (AP) -- Ham-covered pillars rotting at the
university law faculty? A giant pink statue of a nude Cyclops
overlooking the city's most famous bridge? A naked bather suspended
over a busy intersection?
</P>
<P>
   It seems this ancient city has gone mad for art.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the Edges'' touches all the human senses, and is an
exhibition so different, yet so simple. The city known for its
gothic churches, medieval squares and excellent cuisine is taking
art where few shows have gone before.
</P>
<P>
   April Fool's Day marked the beginning of a contemporary art
exhibition that mixes the bizarrely modern with the old and
traditional, the absurd with the routine. The show runs through
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Curators Jan Hoet and Giacinto Di Pietrantonio are the
masterminds behind the ''Over the Edges'' show, which has brought
modern art to the old historical medieval heart of Ghent, putting
it on the crest of an arts wave the like of which the city has
never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Showcasing some 55 internationally renowned artists over the
entire area of the old city, the exhibition is meant to express the
link between the old and the new.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of the Ghent's celebration marking the 500th birth
year of its most famous native son: Emperor Charles V. The
16th-century Holy Roman Emperor ruled a huge empire that went from
the Netherlands to Sicily, included much of Germany and Spain, and
parts of Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   ''We asked artists to create works for outside: for corners, for
crossroads, for the edge of the street,'' Di Pietrantonio said.
</P>
<P>
   The show's most controversial and most visited art piece is
Belgian artist Jan Fabre's ''fleshy tapestry'' of smoked ham
covering the eight, two-story-high pillars in the university's
neoclassical facade.
</P>
<P>
   Antipoverty groups argue the piece is not art but a bad-taste
waste of essential food, which should have been used to feed the
homeless. Animal-rights activists complain the pigs were needlessly
slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council decided not to meddle in the show, but has
warned that if the state of the ham gets too bad, health officials
will step in.
</P>
<P>
   The notoriety of the show's center piece means a 24-hour,
round-the-clock police guard has been put on to protect the 8,000
slices of ham from vandals. Student volunteers have also been
posted at the ham pillars to protect them from intruding dogs and
cats hoping for a nibble at the now rotting and stinky art decor.
</P>
<P>
   Fabre told the local De Morgen newspaper the work will really be
at its best when it starts to attract swarms of flies, and when
worms emerge from the rank flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Some art experts have called the ham pillars questionable,
siding with critics who said it has gone too far, calling the work
''immoral'' and that it only promotes ''capitalist decadence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are more decadent things in a museum, perhaps,'' said
Han Van den Hoof, Ghent art student on a five-hour watch. ''People
say it's a waste of money, but I like the aesthetic quality of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire show is a treasure hunt through the narrow streets of
Ghent.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen carefully, you will hear the familiar yet
displaced cry of Tarzan echoing from atop the city's spires. Close
to one of the city's canals, plates fly out of a window, seemingly
the bizarre result of a couple's quarrel inside. In reality, it is
another exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   An aquarium on one of the city's busy intersections is filled
with gold fish and also had a naked woman in it during the opening
weekend. The ''sky bath'' caused mayhem for traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say it takes more than a day to see all the sites,
which includes the SMAK contemporary art museum. Art critics have
given the show much acclaim, lauding its uniqueness and calling it
progressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fantastic,'' said visiting Hilde Jansenns. ''It brings
the art to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were simply bemused. ''What is it all about?'' asked a
tourist from Uruguay.

   He's Ralph's kid brother. ''The name gets the door open, but you
still have to pass through it,'' says Joseph Fiennes, who won
praise from critics and audiences for his performances in
''Elizabeth'' with Cate Blanchett and ''Shakespeare in Love'' with
Gwyneth Paltrow. ''Does it hinder? Enhance? I don't know,'' he
says. ''I still have to do the work.'' Fiennes, who was born on May
26, 1970, is the youngest -- along with his twin brother Jake -- of
seven Fiennes, a gypsylike clan that moved more than a dozen times
around England and Ireland during their early childhood. His
upcoming films include ''Enemy at the Gates'' with Jude Law and Ed

   Some life tips from comedian Drew Carey: Set goals, drink beer
with friends and value what's in your heart and mind. Carey, who
dropped out of Kent State University, told this year's Cleveland
State graduates that he got drunk and overslept on the last day
students could drop courses without penalty. His grades were D's
and F's. ''But look at me now,'' said Carey, who was born on May
23, 1958. ''I'm a millionaire.'' He added that material goods
aren't the most important things in life. ''Things don't make me
nearly as happy as talking and having a beer with my friends. And
that's something everyone can do.''

taught me was how not to be a father.''

<HEADLINE> Wet Outlook Dampens Grain, Soybeans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices fell in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat was led by soybean futures, which were weakened by
followthrough selling from Tuesday's technical slide. Forecasts of
significant rainfall for a large portion of the Midwest helped push
prices lower.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in soymeal futures prices also weighed on the soybean
market.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains expected today and Thursday also pressured corn
futures prices. The precipitation is expected to create
near-perfect crop-growing conditions in a region that has been
plagued by dryness.
</P>
<P>
   Weather concerns pushed aside news South Korea purchased 135,000
metric tons of U.S. corn. There also were reports Taiwan may be in
the market for corn.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness of corn and soybeans helped push wheat futures
prices lower.
</P>
<P>
   In early trading, wheat for July delivery was 1\ cents lower at
$2.80 a bushel; July corn was 1} cents lower at $2.33} a bushel;
July oats were } cent lower at $1.18\ a bushel; July soybeans were

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Danny Glover  </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Commitment to social change comes in several
forms for Danny Glover.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's the acting. Glover is most recognized for his
role in the ''Lethal Weapon'' action-comedy series with Mel Gibson.
But he has also appeared in films with a powerful social message,
including ''The Color Purple,'' ''Mandela,'' ''Buffalo Soldiers,''
''Beloved'' and ''Freedom Song.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the straight-out activism -- against
discrimination, poverty and capital punishment. He was recently
honored by Essence magazine for his years of political activism at
home and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to his latest role as spokesman for the United
States Tennis Association's USA Tennis Month. Glover is committed
to the program, which provides free lessons and sponsors other
activities around the country during May.
</P>
<P>
   ''A strong component of the program is the National Junior
Tennis League, which was started by Arthur Ashe in 1968,'' he said.
''The idea was to make tennis accessible to people in inner cities,
to communities that would normally be off the radar screen in
respect to the sport. ... What the USTA has done is continued to
make that part of its legacy as well.''
</P>
<P>
   His new film ''Boesman and Lena,'' also starring Angela Bassett,
is scheduled for release this fall. The movie was shot in Cape
Town, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the 52-year-old Glover talked about tennis, his
career and the choices he has made in his life.
</P>
<P>
   1. Have you been playing tennis for a long time?
</P>
<P>
   Glover: I'm not what you call a regular tennis player. ... I've
played before, I understand the game, I'm a big fan and watch the
game a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   2. What made you a fan?
</P>
<P>
   Glover: What got me started as a fan was Arthur. I followed
everything Arthur did. Wherever he played, I just followed it.
Arthur Ashe gave tennis a different kind of image. He brought
dignity to it. He brought my dignity to it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Now let's talk about acting. Your roles have ranged from
silly to serious. Why the variety?
</P>
<P>
   Glover: At times, you're juggling between two things: what you
want to do and the things they want you to do. Most of the time you
end up doing the things they want you do. Some of the choices that
I've made, like 'Freedom Song,' are more what I want to do. ... And
sometimes we meet in the same place. In terms of 'Beloved,' we met
in the same place. Truly, life goes from moment to moment. One
moment something happens and starts a process and you go on a
journey and you complete the journey, and another moment there's
another journey that takes you on, and I think you have to be
available to the moment.
</P>
<P>
   4. How do you feel about your critically acclaimed film
''Beloved'' not becoming a box-office hit?
</P>
<P>
   Glover: It bothered me. You want people to see your stuff; stuff
that you're proud of. You want to say, 'This is where I stood up
and took a risk and did this, and this is my contribution right
here.'
</P>
<P>
   5. So is there a certain kind of film legacy you're trying to
leave?
</P>
<P>
   Glover: When you talk about film legacy, it always feel like as
if you as an individual have decided 'this is the mark I want to
make.' But all I'm trying to do in some sense is identify the
stories I think are important to be told. ... I wanted to tell
those because I want to create the library of storytelling that
goes beyond what is commonly viewed as our definition of ourselves.

<HEADLINE> Psychologist Becomes Folk Singer  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF SIMONS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Mick Jagger studied economics and
became a Rolling Stone. Jim Morrison had a fling in film school and
morphed into a rock legend.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical psychologist Lucy Kaplansky analyzed her dreams, gave
up her practice and followed her heart to become a folk singer.
</P>
<P>
   ''What pulled me away from psychology was my passion for
music,'' said Kaplansky, who has carved out a career doing TV
commercials and film soundtracks, and recording three solo albums.
''I haven't looked back for one minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Her solo albums on Red House Records are ''The Tide,'' ''Flesh
and Bone'' and ''Ten Year Night,'' which just won an American
Federation of Independent Music award as best pop album of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At the Outpost Performance Space here recently, she delivered
two sets of effusive love ballads to a capacity audience that
couldn't get enough of her music.
</P>
<P>
   With her cascading black curls, cherubic face and a luminous
voice floating over a flood of resonating guitar chords, the
40-year-old Kaplansky melded music and lyrics that rendered an
autobiographical sketch of a woman who ultimately chose passion
over her profession.
</P>
<P>
   In her version of Buddy Mondlock's ''The Kid,'' she was a young,
romantic girl recalling how she was once ''the kid who always
looked out the window. ... The kid who has this habit of
dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   In ''Scorpion,'' she was a brazen lover, poised to ''sting you
with a kiss from my lips. ... Sting you with a piece of my mind.
... Sting you with a taste of my skin.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Richard Shindell's ''The Ballad of Mary Magdalen,''
Kaplansky sang the part of the jilted lover, lamenting her own
share of unrequited love: ''He was always faithful, he was always
kind/But he walked off with this heart of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Defining her brand of music is tricky. She loosely labels her
style ''alternative country'' -- along the lines of Lucinda
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a real hunger for acoustic music that has emotional
resonance,'' said Kaplansky, who grew up in Chicago and got her
break in New York City in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Her soundtrack credits include singing with Suzanne Vega on
''Pretty in Pink'' and with Nanci Griffith on ''The Firm.''
</P>
<P>
   She has also landed a few TV commercials, including Chevrolet's
''The Heartbeat of America'' ad in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Like many folk musicians, Kaplansky learned to play guitar and
piano pretty much on her own. At 11, she started imitating pop
songs, quickly developing an attraction to the music of Jim Croce.
</P>
<P>
   ''I played whatever was on the radio. But when I was 15, my
older brother turned me on to Joni Mitchell's 'Blue' album,'' she
said, referring to the 1971 work that set a new standard in folk
music. ''I wanted to play like (Mitchell), so I started learning
her tunings because it was more than just playing chords.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's influence drew Kaplansky away from mainstream music.
She started gravitating toward Jackson Browne, Joan Baez, Gram
Parsons, Emmylou Harris and the Roches.
</P>
<P>
   When she was barely out of high school, Kaplansky started
playing in folk bars in Chicago. In the late 1970s, she moved to
New York, where she immersed herself in a flourishing folk scene
that was attracting Vega, John Gorka, Bill Morrissey and Cliff
Eberhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd been singing for two or three years in New York, doing
well -- and I even got a great review in the (New York) Times,'' she
said. ''But I decided I didn't want to do it anymore. I thought it
wasn't what I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplansky went to college and graduate school and became a
licensed clinical psychologist. During the '80s and '90s, she
juggled full-time clinical work with part-time singing, harmonizing
with Shawn Colvin on her Grammy-winning album ''Steady On'' and
with Griffith on ''Lone Star State of Mind'' and ''Little Love
Affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   But in January 1997, Kaplansky closed her practice to focus
solely on her music. The following year, she collaborated on the
critically acclaimed album ''Cry Cry Cry'' with Dar Williams and
Richard Shindell.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, she did 160 shows in small venues across the country,
and has been touring again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of her performance in Albuquerque wasn't planned -- but it
demonstrated her versatility. Whether it was the high desert
altitude or plain bad luck, she snapped a steel string four times
in midsong on her Martin guitar, an infrequent occupational hazard.
</P>
<P>
   She sailed through it with a little schmoozing, a few backup
pieces on the piano and a touch of musical comedy.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute to her father, a mathematician and music
dilettante, she reeled off a few a cappella measures of Irving
Kaplansky's quirky ''Song About Pi'' and ''That's Mathematics'' -- a
little ditty she sang to the tune of ''That's Entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   She wowed the crowd with her stage presence, poise and singing.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of her fans are 30 to 50 years old, many teens are
listening to her music, Kaplansky said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a vibrant, independent scene with a lot of people
making great music. And smart kids go for great (song) writing.''
</P>
<P>
   She has no doubts about her future as a full-time musician.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like being away from home, but I like the life,'' she
said. ''I'm grateful every single day I can do this for a living.''

<HEADLINE> Johnny Mathis Puts Audience At Ease  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When Johnny Mathis opens a concert, he sings his
most popular songs right away so his audience can relax. He
realized years ago that listeners get anxious, wondering whether he
will sing the hits.
</P>
<P>
   Being at ease -- and having his audience at ease -- is a priority
for Mathis, whose '50s hits include ''It's Not for Me to Say'' and
''Chances Are.'' Many of his fans can recall a romance that was
sweetened by one of his songs playing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ''Music is really about memories,'' said Mathis, 64. ''At this
point in my life, there are very few surprises I can give to
people. They know what I'm going to sing. They've heard me sing.
The only thing I have to worry about is keeping my voice in
condition so I'll be able to sing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis always sings the songs that he is most comfortable with.
And he usually performs with a 26-piece orchestra -- with piano,
guitar, oboe, French horn and strings -- because that's the sound
listeners know from his recordings.
</P>
<P>
   When someone yells out a request from the audience and the
orchestra doesn't have an arrangement, Mathis may sing it anyway,
without accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember almost everything. Or I remember enough of the song
to sing a little bit of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mathis has sold millions of records, he hasn't based
his career on how well his albums sell. ''If you're lucky, you have
one hit record and everybody finds out who you are. If you're
really lucky, you have a few hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''But you really need to get out and form a relationship with
audiences. It requires vigilance and nothing but hard work and
dedication. I always knew that. I always knew I wanted to sing all
my life and what it was going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   His new CD ''Mathis on Broadway'' (Columbia) features hit songs
from recent Broadway shows, including Stephen Sondheim's ballad
''Loving You'' from ''Passion''; and a combination of ''Children
Will Listen'' (from ''Into the Woods'') and ''Our Children'' (from
''Ragtime''), sung with Betty Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've made over 100 albums; I don't know exactly how many,''
Mathis said. ''For the first 15 years or so, I made four albums a
year. They had the orchestra in the studio. I'd do four songs a day
in three hours. It took three days to do a record. Now I sing and
sing and sing and they say, 'Would you do it again?' I swear I
can't hear the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis was an outstanding track and field athlete at San
Francisco State College and was invited to try out for the 1956
U.S. Olympic team. But a jazz executive at Columbia Records heard
Mathis sing and signed him. His first recording, which was jazz,
didn't sell well. But Mitch Miller, a pop music executive at the
company, believed Mathis could be a smooth singer of soft, romantic
ballads and chose songs that brought him success.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Not for Me to Say,'' ''Wonderful, Wonderful'' and
''Chances Are'' were hits in 1957. ''Misty'' followed two years
later. In 1958, only two years after signing him, Columbia Records
released ''Johnny's Greatest Hits,'' which was on Billboard's top
albums chart for nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He quit smoking in his 20s, stopped drinking alcohol 10 years
ago, and tries to eat healthful foods. He does most of his own
cooking, a skill he learned from his parents, who were domestic
workers in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a very domesticated person,'' said Mathis, who has lived
in the same house for 40 years. He bought it when he was doing a
lot of recording in Los Angeles. ''I love being home. I go to the
golf course and market and home. That's where I'm happiest.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also enjoys performing and trying new venues. He still
sings in Las Vegas and in Atlantic City, N.J., and with symphony
orchestras. A few years ago, he started singing on stages in
vineyards, in casinos operated by Indian tribes and in refurbished
movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of a nice time for me. People know my music and what
to expect. I'm able to sing more or less whatever I want to,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   An avid golfer, Mathis participates in golf-related charities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes I travel to Great Britain just to play golf for a
week or two,'' he said. ''I found out I should take the time to
enjoy my life a little bit. If not now, when? It gives me more
incentive to come back to the music, if I get away from it a little
bit.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Kathy Mattea  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer Kathy Mattea is 40, an
age when many entertainers begin to consider cosmetic surgery,
hoping to extend their careers in a youth-obsessed culture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to look good for my age, although I refuse to have any
plastic surgery,'' Mattea said. ''I just think someone has to be
responsible for looking like we look. If they kick me out of
country music because of that, then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   The singer from West Virginia with the earthy alto has chosen to
embrace maturity with her ''The Innocent Years'' CD, just released
by Mercury Records.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would much rather do that than be chasing around trying to
look younger and younger as I get older and older,'' Mattea said.
''I'm not 13. I can't be LeAnn Rimes. My job is to be me, and do it
with as much dignity as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's song list includes ''That's the Deal,'' about an old
man who accepts his role as caretaker for his ailing wife, and
''Why Can't We,'' a salute to her parents' generation. The song
asks why happiness seems to elude the more privileged baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Innocent Years'' was influenced by her parents'
life-threatening health problems during the past two years,
including her father's cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our whole family just circled the wagons and went into
crisis-management mode,'' Mattea said. ''He wasn't supposed to live
but about four months.''
</P>
<P>
   While her brothers took over finances and other practical
matters, Mattea helped her father cope with his illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was the one who would sit up with dad until midnight or one
or two in the morning, talking about the emotional stuff and
spiritual stuff,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To make a long story short, he responded very well to the
chemo they put him on and he's in complete remission. They can't
really find any cancer in him right now. He played golf last
weekend. He's going to turn 80 in a few weeks. It was just an
amazing year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the songs are about what's important as youth fades,
although the wry breakup song ''BFD'' is tacked on at the end to
show that Mattea hasn't lost her sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''You turn 40 and start to deal with your own mortality,'' she
said. ''All of a sudden you realize it's a finite thing. It really
makes you kind of ask yourself a lot of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's important in your life? What are you spending your time
doing? And what do you want to wake up and feel like when you're 70
and you look back on your life?''
</P>
<P>
   Mattea says the answers are to simplify and prioritize.
</P>
<P>
   She sings in the CD's title song: ''You know I'd trade it all
back in/for just one day like it was back then/ back before just
living my life got in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Her folk-based country music has proved durable since she made
it big in the late 1980s with ''Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen
Roses.'' She has generally managed at least one hit from every
album.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may just be one, but it's enough to let my fans know I'm
there,'' she said. ''And I have such a loyal following that they go
buy them. And they play them for their friends. I got a letter from
a guy recently, and he said he had bought 12 copies of 'Love
Travels' because he kept giving them away.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a wonderful testimony to your music.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattea performed recently in Washington, D.C., at a birthday
celebration for the Library of Congress. Other performers included
Tito Puente, Gatemouth Brown, Ralph Stanley, Bob Weir and Mickey
Hart of the Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every one of these people are still making music and not going
through the motions,'' Mattea said. ''I listened to Ralph Stanley
play and he practically brought me to tears. I want to be just like
that.''

average was down 165.85 at 10,768.72.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 21.68 at 1,444.36, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 88.14 at 3,629.43.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness on Wall Street didn't surprise analysts, who
believed stocks were due to falter as investors tried to capture
gains from a four-day rally. The market's gains were capped Tuesday
when the Fed, as expected, raised interest rates a half-percentage
point -- its steepest increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, raising
borrowing costs and cutting into bottom-line profits. Investors had
bid stocks higher on the hope that Tuesday's increase could be the
last for a while, but with many economists predicting still higher
rates later this year, many investors lost their nerve today,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the accumulation of rate hikes that truly hampers stock
market performance over time,'' said Gail Dudack, chief equity
strategist at UBS Warburg in New York. ''We do expect lower lows in
May and June to materialize before a better and more sustainable
summer rally can begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudack pointed out that in the 11 volatile months since the Fed
began raising rates, the Dow has declined modestly. The Nasdaq is
up about 35 percent since June 1999, but has tumbled dramatically
from its all-time high of 5,048.62, set March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's performance, Dudack said, is more typical during a
time of escalating rates, and the Nasdaq's recent slump may be
bringing it in line with historical measures.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, the top-performing Dow component on Tuesday,
plunged 9{ to 130{. After the close of trading Tuesday, the company
reported second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street analysts'
expectations. But testy investors may have been expecting
Hewlett-Packard to more dramatically exceed published estimates,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, the testing and measuring equipment maker that was spun
off from Hewlett-Packard, fell 16\ to 79}.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods stocks were also lower today. Johnson &AMP; Johnson
fell | to 86 11/16 and Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 1 5/16 to 63}.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a better than 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 388.56
million shares, behind Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.04 to 497.94.

<HEADLINE> Bankrupt AmeriServe Sues Ex-CEO  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Troubled restaurant supplier AmeriServe Food
Distribution Inc. has filed a lawsuit against its founder and
former chief executive, claiming he improperly pulled tens of
millions of dollars out of the company before it filed for
bankruptcy in January.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriServe charged that John Holten wrongfully diverted funds
from the company into other companies under his control under the
guise of expense reimbursements, management fees and other
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The transfers had ''no legitimate business purpose'' and left
the company short of money to meet its obligations, the company
charged in its lawsuit filed late Tuesday in Wilmington, Del. The
company asked for the return of the money and unspecified punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Holten's lawyer denied any wrongdoing and called the lawsuit a
typical tactic in bankruptcy cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a bankruptcy proceeding, where there is ever a transfer of
money, lawsuits are filed ... creditors are trying to maximize
their return,'' said Robert Burrick, a New York bankruptcy lawyer.
''We can justify the payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrick said Holten's companies, principally closely held
Holberg Industries Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., maintained financing
for AmeriServe.
</P>
<P>
   David Margulies, a spokesman for the Addison-based distributor,
said Wednesday the amount of money involved is ''substantial,'' but
that AmeriServe wasn't alleging that the transfers alone forced the
bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   Margulies said chief executive Ronald Rittenmeyer asked the
company's outside lawyers several weeks ago to look into
pre-bankruptcy transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been questions about these transactions from
various people certainly ever since the bankruptcy filing,''
Margulies said.
</P>
<P>
   Holten resigned as chief executive after the bankruptcy filing
but remains chairman. Margulies said Holten has not been asked to
resign as chairman and hasn't offered to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In a related matter, investors who bought AmeriServe bonds have
asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington for help in
investigating a $200 million bond offering in September
underwritten by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Holten's lawyer denied that Holten misled investors about the
company's liquidity. Burrick said Holten and Holberg Industries put
$30 million into the company in early December, along with $100
million from DLJ and $15 million from a major customer, Tricon
Global Restaurants Inc. of Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriServe, once a $6 billion company, has lost more than
one-third of its restaurant business, including accounts with
Burger King and Chick-fil-A, in recent weeks and has said it will
lay off 1,400 to 1,600 of its roughly 6,000 employees.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court orders new trial in Colonial case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A federal appeals court has ordered a new
trial for an accountant acquitted two years ago by a federal judge
of wire and mail fraud charges in the Colonial Real Estate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves former Arthur Andersen accountant Edmund M.
Autuori who had been convicted of 16 fraud counts on March 12,
1998. The jury found that he had conspired with Colonial, in 1989
and 1990 to hide damaging information about a Colonial syndication
deal from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial's $2 billion real estate empire collapsed in 1990,
costing over 6,000 investors more than $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. District Judge Ellen Bree Burns, who had presided
over Autuori's 18-day trial, threw out the jury's verdict five
months later, saying the convictions were based on ''a morass of
conflicting testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns wrote that she felt compelled to overrule a jury for only
the second time in her 20-year judicial career, to prevent a
''manifest injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals Tuesday reversed Burns'
acquittal of Autuori on a dozen charges, while affirming his
acquittal by the judge on four other counts.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge appellate panel refused to reinstate the guilty
verdicts. Instead, it ordered a new trial on the dozen charges.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court did agree with Burns that were ''serious
contradictions and conflicts in the government's evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it said that the standard for reversing a jury is high.
A trial judge is not entitled to set aside a verdict simply because
he or she would have reached a different verdict, the appeals court
said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter A. Clark said the government would
review the decision before deciding on a course of action.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Bloss, one of Autuori's lawyers, said he hoped the
government would end the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be no doubt now that four federal judges, the
three appeals judges and Judge Burns, viewed this as a remarkably
weak case,'' Bloss said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Congressman Sam Gejdenson says he's convinced Pequots ''are Indians.'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- U.S. Rep. Sam Gejdenson said he was
simply trying to help his constituents when Congress granted the
Mashantucket Pequots federal recognition in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd District Democrat says the idea at the time was to help
people clear their property titles, not create a gambling industry
in eastern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing people are missing is, this thing wasn't settled to
help the Indians,'' Gejdenson told The Day. ''People couldn't sell
their homes. The state decided we are getting flooded with people
who are getting apoplectic about not being able to sell their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the state cut a deal with the Pequots in which the tribe
would relinquish its land claims in the Ledyard area in return for
the tribal recognition that eventually allowed the Pequots to
establish one of the world's largest gambling empires.
</P>
<P>
   In Jeff Benedict's controversial new book ''Without
Reservation,'' Gejdenson is characterized as pushing through the
recognition and land claims legislation without heeding warnings
from other federal officials that there were problems with the
Mashantucket Pequots' genealogy. The book, published by
HarperCollins, claims the tribe is not descended from the Pequots,
and may have a thin blood link to the Narragansetts in Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Gejdenson said he believes the Mashantucket Pequots definitely
are American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, I'm comfortable with them as a tribe,'' he said.
''They've been a tribe in Connecticut for 300 years ... nobody
really argued that case at the time. What was driving us was to
take care of non-Indian constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Some eastern Connecticut officials maintain the Pequots were
given more land for their reservation than they were entitled to.
They say transcripts from hearings of the congressional debate and
the land claims settlement legislation describe an 800-acre parcel
that the tribe could buy in exchange for dropping claims against
Ledyard property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict, in his book, says legislators and tribal
representatives were talking about 800 acres, but the tribe's
reservation, the site of Foxwoods, the world's largest casino, is
covers 1,200-acres.
</P>
<P>
   Gejdenson said it may take a lawsuit to settle that dispute, but
he said Congress is not the aggrieved party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever those (aggrieved) parties are-- the state of
Connecticut, communities or individuals-- they would sue the
Indians. It wouldn't be Congress,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner, NBC Sign Coverage Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc.'s cable division, fresh from a
nasty fight with ABC, has signed an agreement with NBC to carry the
network's main feed as well as cable channels CNBC and MSNBC
through 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Wednesday includes coverage of the Olympic
Games, which NBC has exclusive U.S. broadcast rights through 2008.
NBC also plans to offer extended coverage of the Olympics on its
cable channels beginning with the Sydney Olympics this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Cable spokesman Michael Luftman said NBC asked for,
and received, extra compensation for its Olympics coverage, but he
declined to say how much Time Warner was paying NBC overall.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner now has agreements with networks CBS, Fox, and NBC --
with ABC the notable exception -- to rebroadcast TV signals over its
cable lines, which reach nearly 13 million homes across the
country. Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable service
provider after AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of retransmission rights came to the fore at the
beginning of this month when a corporate spat between Time Warner
and Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC, erupted into the public arena
as the cable provider yanked ABC signals in several major cities,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner says Disney is asking too much at the bargaining
table, including the transfer of the Disney Channel from premium to
basic cable. Disney says it's only seeking fair compensation for
its top-rated network, which has enjoyed a jump in ratings thanks
to a big push from ''Who Want to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies are still trying to reach an agreement, and have
imposed a deadline of July 15.

<HEADLINE> Trade Bill Advances in Congress  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of debate, legislation
normalizing trade relations with China advanced in Congress on
Wednesday, gaining the near-unanimous endorsement of the Senate
Finance Committee and moving toward expected approval by a
counterpart House panel.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would end 20 years of annual congressional votes
on China's trade status, has the strong support of the Clinton
administration and business groups but is opposed by organized
labor and some human rights groups, particularly in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its approval by the House Ways and Means Committee later
Wednesday was expected by supporters and opponents alike. The full
House will take up the bill next week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would grant China ''permanent normal trade relations,''
the same low-tariff access to U.S. markets that nearly every other
nation in the world already enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   It would also ease China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, the Geneva-based organization that oversees world
trade. China was a founding member of the WTO's predecessor, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but it withdrew after the
1949 communist takeover in China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States normalized diplomatic relations with China in
1979, but has kept the restrictions on trade.
</P>
<P>
   To make the measure more palatable to labor unions and human
rights groups, the House was expected to include side legislation
to set up a commission to monitor human rights and a mechanism to
protect U.S. businesses from surges in low-cost Chinese products.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee went first, voting 18-1 to approve
the China trade bill and to ready it for a vote by the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., called it ''a
defining moment in our relationship with China.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a member of the
committee, said he hoped the bill would be ''approved
overwhelmingly'' by the Senate. ''It's not a totally easy vote ...
but I think you've got to look at the benefits for this country ...
and within China itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters assert the legislation will open China's vast markets
to U.S. businesses and help bring the nation of 1.2 billion people
-- the world's most populous -- into the world community. Labor
opposes it, criticizing China's human rights and worker protection
policies and suggesting the measure could cost American
manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The sole Senate vote against the bill was cast by Sen. Jim
Jeffords, R-Vt. And he said he was doing so primarily to protest
the continued imprisonment in China of a Tibetan musicologist,
Ngawang Choepel, who had attended a Vermont college.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said he was being held unjustly, even under Chinese
law, and that China had banned his mother from visiting her son in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''If China cannot obey its own laws in this case, how can we
expect it to follow the far more burdensome rules of the World
Trade Organization?'' asked Jeffords.
</P>
<P>
   Before the House Ways and Means panel took up the measure, Rep.
Sander Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the panel, and
Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., reached agreement with Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas, and other lawmakers on language to be included
that would provide protections for American industries against a
sudden surge in imports from China.
</P>
<P>
   Levin and Bereuter are also pushing for creation of a human
rights commission that would issue annual reports on China's
performance to take the place of the annual congressional vote. But
House aides said that final agreement on the language for that
proposal would probably not come until the House Rules Committee
takes up the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Their legislation is being sponsored in the Senate by Sens. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wide margin in the Senate panel, several Finance
Committee members expressed skepticism over whether normalizing
economic ties would bring about improvements in China's
human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who say change will come quickly may be misjudging 5,000
years of Chinese history,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rockefeller and other proponents of the bill said they
were persuaded that it would help open Chinese markets to U.S.
companies.

<HEADLINE> Disney Hopes Kids Like Talking Dino  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Some actors aspire to become the voice of
a generation. D.B. Sweeney is the mouthpiece for the entire
Cretaceous Period of 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is the voice of Aladar, the iguanodon star of Disney's new
computer-animated adventure ''Dinosaur,'' which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney believes that giving the realistic-looking dinosaurs
human speech makes storytelling sense. And so does Disney, which is
gambling that audiences will accept the huge reptiles yammering in
English.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing when animated kitchenware breaks into song in
''Beauty and the Beast'' or a cartoon crab croons in ''The Little
Mermaid.'' When these dinosaurs speak, the effect is more like the
talking live-action animals of ''Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   It could have come off as silly as Godzilla asking a cabbie how
to get to Carnegie Hall so he could stomp on it. But Disney's
creative team took some liberties with the reptiles' facial
expressions to make it more credible, and laid the groundwork to
prepare the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Disney considered doing the movie without dialogue, then toyed
with third-person narration or voice-overs representing the
dinosaurs' thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It almost played as though we were taking the easy road out
and being cheap about it,'' said ''Dinosaur'' co-director Eric
Leighton. ''That became more of a distraction than just biting the
bullet and making them move their lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a talking cartoon mouse was once groundbreaking, too.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Sweeney, whose credits include ''Eight Men Out'' and
TV's ''Lonesome Dove,'' others in the ''Dinosaur'' voice cast are
Julianna Margulies, Ossie Davis, Alfre Woodard, Joan Plowright and
Della Reese.
</P>
<P>
   The dinosaurs and other animals were created by computer
animation and then edited into footage of real-life landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The PG-rated movie opens with an extended, dialogue-free montage
introducing the dinosaurs' peaceful kingdom. A meat-eating predator
charges into their midst. An egg containing Aladar is swiped by a
hyena-like scavenger reptile, and eventually ends up among
prehistoric lemurs.
</P>
<P>
   The first characters to speak are the lemurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then Aladar is the first dinosaur to speak, because of course,
he was raised by the primates,'' Leighton said. ''By the time we've
reached all the other dinosaurs, we've established that a dinosaur
can talk. Now they can all talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Special-effects wizards adhered closely to supposed dinosaur
anatomy in many instances but took creative license on the size of
some creatures and especially the faces.
</P>
<P>
   Iguanodons had beaks, but the filmmakers chose to put lips on
Aladar because in early tests of him speaking, he looked silly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beak looked like a couple of coconuts slapping against one
another,'' said Neil Eskuri, digital-effects supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Horse musculature was used to model the iguanodons' faces to
give more range of expression. To design Aladar's love interest,
the animators tried to imagine how Audrey Hepburn would move had
she been a dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted her to have that slim neck, that proud, prestigious
quality that she had,'' co-director Ralph Zondag said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dinosaur'' plays out like a drama rather than one of Disney's
animated musical romps. Still, said Sweeney, ''If you're making a
movie for kids, there's no cooler topic. It's talking dinosaurs.''

<HEADLINE> Former labor boss, wife indicted in funds theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A former labor leader and his wife are
accused in a federal indictment of stealing more than $235,000 in
union funds and making themselves rich while the union they ran
fell into financial ruin, U.S. Attorney Denise O'Donnell said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ervolino, 79, and his 66-year-old wife, Anna May Ervolino,
were charged in an eight-count indictment with embezzlement from a
labor union, embezzlement from a labor union's pension fund and
conspiracy to commit both crimes. If convicted they could face up
to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines on each count.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses the couple of looting the treasury of the
7,000-member AFL-CIO Hospital and Nursing Home Council, which
served as an umbrella union that also included locals of hotel and
restaurant workers and the laundry workers union.
</P>
<P>
   While running the Hospital Council from 1990 to 1996, the
Ervolinos allegedly diverted $183,000 from it and $52,000 from its
pension fund, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury indictment noted the couple's salaries increased
from $275,749 in 1990 to $504,339 in 1996. The net assets of the
Hospital Council, meanwhile, steadily declined from $196,512. By
1996, the union was $178,648 in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Ervolinos are despicable,'' said Marshall Blake, a
union-appointed trustee who took over operations of the union after
the Ervolinos retired and their successors were ousted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just gratified the feds were able to bring forth an
indictment,'' he told The Buffalo News.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses the Ervolinos of stealing the money by
paying themselves severance while still employed and buying
unauthorized insurance and annuity policies for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the Ervolinos did not report the transactions
in required federal labor reports and used a rubber stamp bearing a
union officer's signature on the checks without his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The former Buffalo couple now lives in Boynton Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure there will be a plea of not guilty, and I'm sure they
will come back up here and enter the plea,'' their attorney, Joseph
Sedita, said.
</P>
<P>
   They were expected to be arraigned next week.

<HEADLINE> Remains of Vietnam MIA Pilot ID'd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An Illinois Air Force pilot missing in action
from the Vietnam War has been accounted for and his remains are
being returned to his family for burial, the Pentagon said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He was identified as Col. Harold V. Smith of Bridgeport, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was leading a four-aircraft attack against enemy
surface-to-air missile sites in Thanh Hoa Province, North Vietnam,
on March 7, 1966, when he disappeared, the Pentagon said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   When the flight reformed after the attack, Smith's plane failed
to rejoin the group. Other members of the flight searched the area,
but couldn't find him.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Vietnamese investigators interviewed potential
witnesses and searched again in 1993, 1994 and 1995, but neither
the crash site nor human remains were found, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1996, the Vietnamese government helped U.S.
investigators find an informant who led them to the burial, which
was excavated in August and September 1998, uncovering human
remains and some personal items. Smith was identified through
analysis of the remains and other evidence by the U.S. Army Central
Identification Laboratory Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   With the accounting of Smith, 2,028 Americans remain missing in
action from the Vietnam War, and 555 have been identified and
returned to their families.

<HEADLINE> Man Who Killed 2 in Ballpark Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OZARK, Ala. (AP) -- A man shot to death his ex-wife and her
boyfriend in front of more than 200 children and their parents at a
youth baseball park, then shot himself. He died of his injuries
today.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings erupted Tuesday in a parking lot of Ozark's Fuqua
ballpark, about 75 miles south of Montgomery, as children and
parents were gathering for evening games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very fortunate with the direction the shots were fired
that a stray bullet did not go up in the stands or onto the
field,'' Police Chief Tony Spivey said.
</P>
<P>
   Slain were Diana Smith, 32, and James Edward McQuinn II, 35.
Ricky Gerald Todd Smith, 35, died at a hospital today, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings stemmed from a custody dispute, Spivey said. It
wasn't clear how many children the couple had or if they witnessed
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Spivey said at least 200 people witnessed the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large number of them are just in total shock and total
disbelief,'' Spivey said. ''And very obviously, we have a lot of
traumatized children and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspect used a 12-gauge shotgun to fire 10 shots at the
victims, WSFA-TV reported. When the shotgun jammed, he pulled out a
.22-caliber pistol and shot his ex-wife before shooting himself,
witnesses said.

the United
States and abroad:
<TEXT>
<P>
   May 17
</P>
<P>
   The Des Moines (Iowa) Register, on Bobby Knight:
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosier brass choked Monday. Indiana University President
Myles Brand shot an air ball. He announced basketball coach Bob
Knight would be suspended for three games, fined $30,000 and forced
to follow a supervised code of conduct. Knight will be allowed to
keep his job despite his ''pattern of inappropriate behavior,'' but
one slip-up and the coach is history.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment is akin to expecting the great white shark not to
grab the chunk of meat because it's meant for the blue marlin.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's crude and repulsive behavior should have got him fired
years ago. ...
</P>
<P>
   Brand in essense said Monday that what Knight did is tolerable.
To be sure, the university shares culpability through its silence
all these years. The man is a bully. His behavior has embarrassed
the university and the state of Indiana. His antics send the
message to young people that abusive behavior by coaches is
acceptable, even admired. ...
</P>
<P>
   IU presidents looked the other way. Athletic directors looked
the other way. Alumni, fans, and even players and their parents
looked the other way. On Monday, Brand and the school's board of
trustees all looked the other way. ...
</P>
<P>
   May 12
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald, on AIDS drugs for poor nations:
</P>
<P>
   Those fighting AIDS got some powerful allies this week when five
of the world's largest drug companies agreed to slash the prices of
HIV drugs for people living in poor nations. That means millions of
people throughout Africa and the Caribbean Basin living with HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, will now get access to those lifesaving
drugs. ...
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest hurdle was the cost of the drugs. The lower
prices, though still too high for many, will go far in combating
this epidemic. The combination of three or four drugs needed to
keep the virus at bay will now cost between $150 and $200 a month
in those countries, unlike the $10,000 and $15,000 a year it costs
in the United States and Europe. ...
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ... commendably issued an executive order
declaring that the United States will not interfere with countries
that violate American patent laws to provide AIDS drugs at lower
costs.
</P>
<P>
   That should be a warning to the drug companies. Profit margins
are never more important than life itself.
</P>

   The Norman (Okla.) Transcript, on People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals:
</P>
<P>
   We haven't seen one in our area yet, but we've been reading
about billboards in other places bearing the message, ''Jesus was a
vegetarian.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest controversy stirred up by People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals gets Christian carnivores riled in just about
every city it hits. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Bible is mostly silent on what Jesus ate, preferring to
focus on what he taught, but it's not entirely silent. We refer the
reader to the 24th chapter of Luke, where the risen Jesus appears
to the disciples. In verses 41-43 we read, ''And while they yet
believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here
any meat? And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of an
honeycomb. And he took it, and did eat before them.'' Pareve but
not vegetarian, unless you consider fish a vegetable.

<P>
   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail, on Million Mom March:
</P>
<P>
   The duel between Million Mom March Inc. and Second Amendment
Sisters Inc. for the hearts and minds of the American people on
Sunday should have been spelled d-u-a-l.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have good ideas about a problem that is still too big
to be ignored. ...
</P>
<P>
   To hasten the decline of gun deaths, Donna Dees-Thomases, whose
sister-in-law is a close friend of Hillary Clinton ... organized a
rally to demand new gun laws. ...
</P>
<P>
   One proposal would close the loophole regarding background
checks for buyers at gun shows. Trigger locks and mandatory gun
safety classes are among other proposals. ...
</P>
<P>
   To counteract that rally, the Second Sisters were hastily
organized. They call for protecting the Second Amendment right to
own a gun and for better enforcement of existing laws. ...
</P>
<P>
   Some unsolicited advice to the moms and sisters: Emulate Mothers
Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   That means being nonpartisan. That means holding people, not
cars or guns, responsible for their actions. That means new laws.
That means better enforcement of existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   That means working together.
</P>
<P>
   May 15
</P>
<P>
   American Press of Lake Charles, La., on ecstacy:
</P>
<P>
   An illicit drug called ecstacy is pouring into the United States
in such quantities that an epidemic is not only possible, but
probable.
</P>
<P>
   Parents need to talk to their kids about this one, and young
people need to know that ecstacy is bad news. ...
</P>
<P>
   Ecstacy is popular among young people. Sadly, this is the group
that is most vulnerable to the effects of the drug, which produces
euphoria and an increased desire to interact socially. ...
</P>
<P>
   Blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature increase
dramatically. Other physical symptoms include involuntary
teeth-grinding. To counter this, some users suck on pacifiers. ...
</P>
<P>
   The more parents and teen-agers learn about ecstacy, the better
equipped they will be to make sure the answer is ''No!'' when
someone suggests using it.

<P>
   The Plain Dealer of Cleveland, Ohio:
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia school board has made its district the largest
in the country to require students in every school to wear
uniforms. The policy change ... is supposed to cut down on
distractions and discipline problems.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that students are less likely to battle over Nike
sneakers at school if they're not wearing them in buildings. It's
also true that parents may save money -- and students time -- if the
choice of school clothing is limited to a couple of colors and
styles. But as some students and parents pointed out at
Philadelphia's school board meeting, blue bottoms and a white top
offer no guarantee of academic improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Not that uniform policies are a bad idea. But parents and
policymakers cannot expect the adoption of uniform regulations to
relieve them of their duties toward real education reform.
</P>
<P>
   May 9:
</P>
<P>
   The Herald-Journal of Spartanburg, S.C., on rejecting the
expansion of hate crime laws:
</P>
<P>
   The federal government should not be policing the thoughts and
attitudes of Americans or taking control of state criminal matters.
That's why Congress should resist President Clinton's proposal to
expand the federal hate crimes law. ...
</P>
<P>
   Hate crimes laws put the government in the unconstitutional role
of policing individuals' thoughts and attitudes. ...
</P>
<P>
   Laws against hate crimes expand the government's power into our
thoughts and attitudes. The federal statute expands the national
government's control over state and local law enforcement. The
president's proposal should be dropped on both grounds.
</P>
<P>
   May 12, 2000
</P>
<P>
   Boca Raton (Fla.) News, on gender gap in pay:
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe it but even in the 21st century, even in
boom-times America, women still earn less than men doing the same
job. This disturbing news shows that discrimination, despite all
our social advances and legislation to stamp it out, dies a hard
death. ...
</P>
<P>
   This is not only shameful, it is, in many instances illegal.
Those employers who indulge in such archaic salary shifting need to
understand both the moral and legal peril of what they are doing
and be made to pay both penalties if they persist. ...
</P>
<P>
   What possible excuse can there be for paying a woman $7.60 an
hour to perform the same tasks for which a man is paid $10?
</P>
<P>
   One answer is simple but unacceptably trite, it always has been
that way. But as times have changed, so, too, has the value of
women in the workplace. ...
</P>
<P>
   Equal pay for equal work, that is how it must be.
</P>
<P>
   May 16
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and Mail of Toronto, on Dr. Laura:
</P>
<P>
   Laura Schlessinger -- a.k.a. Dr. Laura, based on her Ph.D in
physiology -- has been taken to task by the Canadian Broadcast
Standards Council for characterizing homosexuality on her radio
show as ''deviant,'' ''dysfunctional,'' ''aberrant,'' ''abnormal''
and biologically ''an error.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   What is most astounding about ''Dr. Laura's'' proposition is
that she clearly missed taking a course in evolutionary biology.
Biology is all about deviance. Species arise because variant traits
are selected for by the environment. Because you never can tell
which traits are going to be selected for, as a general principle,
biology favors significant genetic variance in populations.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality seems to be among the variations favored by nature
in humans. We say this because, as far as we can tell, it is found
in all cultures and throughout human history, not to mention in
other species. It is not average, but neither is being seven feet
tall or having red hair or being Einstein.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ''Dr. Laura's'' central intellectual failure is not that
she gives offense to homosexuals, but that she gives offense to
biology as it proudly proclaims: Variancy is part of normalcy. Back
to school, Ms. Schlessinger.
</P>
<P>
   May 17
</P>
<P>
   The Guardian of London, on Mideast peace:
</P>
<P>
   This week's explosion of violence in the West Bank and Gaza --
which (so far) has left three dead, hundreds wounded, and brought
direct exchanges of fire between Israeli troops and Palestinian
police -- is not difficult to explain, though much harder to
justify.
</P>
<P>
   Promised that the new millennium's opening year would finally
bring a lasting settlement, Palestinians have watched with growing
frustration as U.S.-expedited ''fast-track'' talks have reverted to
the old, familiar, stop-go two-step.
</P>
<P>
   While the outside world focuses on the more salient drama of a
Lebanon withdrawal under fire, on the grim harvest of Syria's
displeasure, and on a vengeful Hizbullah's vow to pursue its war
beyond the pale, the dream of Palestine reborn is again obscured.
</P>
<P>
   May 16
</P>
<P>
   The Nation of Bangkok, on the death of Obuchi:
</P>
<P>
   The vacuum created by the unexpected death of Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi will be felt throughout Asia, Thailand
included, for some tie to come. During his tenure, Obuchi was not
only an active visitor to Southeast Asia, but also advanced Japan's
recognition in the region.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the economic crisis, when the (Thai) public
looked to the United States for assistance, it was Japan that
became deeply involved. ... History will show how Japan had offered
quickly shore up the Thai economy as it was collapsing, only to be
thwarted by the indecision of the then-prime minister, Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
   Japan also recognized quickly that the crisis would not be
restricted to Thailand, but would become a global capitalism
crisis. Obuchi's government moved to launch the Asian Monetary
Fund, a vehicle designed to help stabilize the financial crisis.
Although the proposal was shot down by the United States and the
European Union, it showed that Japan is a reliable friend in times
of need.
</P>
<P>
   May 17
</P>
<P>
   Liberation daily of France, on the price of information:
</P>
<P>
   How do journalists cover a hostage crisis of the type unwinding
in the Philippines? We can only say it must be done in a
''responsible manner.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to draft a guide telling journalists how to
face such a situation: each hostage crisis presents a unique case,
as does each journalist and each news organization.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer always the case where newspapers, television and
the families of hostages must succumb to the pressure of
authorities who urge for silence. Giving them publicity constrains
governments to face the situation and to not forget the hostages,
for obscure reasons of state.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that visitors and
journalists ''refrain from going to the (Philippine) region so as
to not complicate the task of those trying to obtain the liberation
of the hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   That's to say, do not make a game of the hostage crisis. To
inform doesn't oblige one to participate in morbid sensationalism.
</P>
<P>
   May 16
</P>
<P>
   Asahi Shimbun of Japan, on Zimbabwe:
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe became free of white rule and formally gained its
independence from Britain 20 years ago. ...
</P>
<P>
   Racial conflict has remained on the African continent even after
colonization ended. The unlawful occupation of farms has spilled
over into Kenya. Even in South Africa, where reappropriation of
farmland to black farmers is behind the program, some elements have
begun to advocate following the Zimbabwe example.
</P>
<P>
   But illegal occupation and other violence only intensified
racial conflict. (President Robert) Mugabe must remember the ideals
he preached 20 years ago. Racial animosity should not be inflamed
for partisan advantage. The farm problem should be resolved through
the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   The President must also hold the election as scheduled and seek
popular opinion, especially on whether voters support the
government's farm occupation. Mugabe should not adopt repressive
policies, as typified by his repression of opposition criticism of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of Zimbabwe's largest aid donors. But we cannot
continue to provide aid if the nation flouts democracy and the rule
of law. The government of Japan should make that policy clear to
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   In turmoil, the poorest always suffer most.

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon Fire Spreads  </HEADLINE>
Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with gusts much milder today,
aiding firefighters' efforts; update with acreage now topping
13,000.
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- Winds died down at the
Grand Canyon today, aiding firefighters' efforts to contain a blaze
that has charred 13,350 acres on the North Rim.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Bland, fire information officer for Grand Canyon
National Park, said the wind gusts, which had been up to 50 mph on
Tuesday, were expected to be only about 20 mph today. That meant
aircraft could once again fly over the fire to drop water, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Outlet fire, which began as a 1,500-acre prescribed burn
April 25, was driven out of control by high winds a week ago.
Prescribed or controlled fires are set on purpose in order to
reduce underbrush that could fuel a worse fire later.
</P>
<P>
   Windy conditions Tuesday prevented firefighters from better
containing of the fire, which remained 43 percent contained this
morning, Bland said.
</P>
<P>
   Western winds drove the flames over and down the canyon's North
Rim and away from birch and fir trees to the north, said park
spokeswoman Vicki Allred. It was not threatening any structures.
</P>
<P>
   The South Rim of the Grand Canyon, the site where most tourists
visit, remained open.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,100 firefighters and support personnel battled the
fire today.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the state, firefighters were nearing full
containment of a 9,359-acre wildfire in the Tonto National Forest
in central Arizona east of Phoenix. The fire was 95 percent
contained Tuesday and should be fully contained by tonight, said
forest spokesman Jim Payne.
</P>
<P>
   The number of firefighters was reduced to 36 as crews headed to
the Grand Canyon fire and to New Mexico, where a fire at Los Alamos
destroyed hundreds of structures.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 120; Nasdaq Off 44  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks stumbled today as investors took profits
from the market's recent rally and determined that the interest
rate increase implemented by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday may
indeed threaten stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 120.54 at 10,814.03.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 14.91 at 1,451.13, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 44.03 at 3,673.54.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness on Wall Street didn't surprise analysts, who
believed stocks were due to falter as investors tried to capture
gains from a four-day rally. The market's gains were capped Tuesday
when the Fed, as expected, raised interest rates a half-percentage
point -- its steepest increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, raising
borrowing costs and cutting into bottom-line profits. Investors had
bid stocks higher on the hope that Tuesday's increase could be the
last for a while, but with many economists predicting still higher
rates later this year, many investors lost their nerve today,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the accumulation of rate hikes that truly hampers stock
market performance over time,'' said Gail Dudack, chief equity
strategist at UBS Warburg in New York. ''We do expect lower (stock
prices) in May and June to materialize before a better and more
sustainable summer rally can begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudack pointed out that in the 11 volatile months since the Fed
began raising rates, the Dow has declined modestly. The Nasdaq is
up about 35 percent since June 1999, but has tumbled dramatically
from its all-time high of 5,048.62, set March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's performance, Dudack said, is more typical during a
time of escalating rates, and the Nasdaq's recent slump may be
bringing it in line with historical measures.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, the top-performing Dow component on Tuesday,
plunged 7| to 132]. After the close of trading Tuesday, the company
reported second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street analysts'
expectations. But testy investors may have been expecting
Hewlett-Packard to more dramatically exceed published estimates,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, the testing and measuring equipment maker that was spun
off from Hewlett-Packard, fell 16] to 79|.

<HEADLINE> Former 'Millionaire' contestant accused of embezzling $190,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A publisher was as surprised as anyone
Wednesday to learn the author of a book offering tips to get on the
popular television game show ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' is
accused of embezzling nearly $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first we heard of this was yesterday so it's been less
than a day and we are trying to understand a little bit more about
the situation,'' said Peter Kaufman, publisher of TV Books.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said it was premature to say what impact the revelation
might have on the upcoming release of ''Who Wants to be a
Contestant,'' a book by Paul Barbour of Baldwinsville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour and his two brothers, Mark and Mike, were the first
three siblings in the country to appear on the popular game show.
On Wednesday, the brothers appeared on ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show''
to talk about their appearances on the game show. Other national
outlets, including ''Extra'' and ''Inside Edition,'' have told
their story.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Barbour also has attracted other interest.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in July accused Barbour and Kellie Moran of
defrauding Nationwide Insurance Co. out of more than $190,000 by
authorizing dozens of payments to a phony medical services company
between April 6, 1998, and Dec. 4, 1998, the Syracuse newspapers
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury indicted them on charges of scheming to defraud
Nationwide, mail fraud and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, 38, who worked as an in-house attorney, was accused of
authorizing 145 checks from Nationwide to Medical Evaluation
Services of Central New York as payment for medical evaluations
performed on Nationwide clients, then spending that money on
personal expenses of his and Moran's.
</P>
<P>
   Moran, 40, a registered nurse from Liverpool, N.Y., performed
only one medical evaluation in those cases, the indictment said.
The indictment said Moran set up the company as part of the scheme
to defraud Nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just a good guy who didn't do anything wrong who's really
getting screwed here. I'm trying to vigorously defend the
charges,'' Barbour told the Syracuse Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Having successfully advised his brothers on how to get on the
show, Paul decided to write a book with tips on how to qualify as a
contestant. The 200-page book is scheduled to be distributed by
HarperCollins, said Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour said he disclosed the charges to his publisher. Kaufman
said that was not true. He was waiting Wednesday to talk to Barbour
who appeared on the show Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Paul didn't make it past the preliminary ''fastest-finger
round,'' the prelude to sitting in the hot seat answering trivia
questions from host Regis Philbin. Neither did brother Mark, who
appeared on the show March 30. The third brother, Mike, finally
made the show that aired last Wednesday night. He also failed to
make it to the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's part of the story of the book that I've
been wrongfully accused of something,'' Paul Barbour told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour plans to go to trial to fight the charges. He is
scheduled to appear in court June 2. If convicted, he could face up
to 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Baxter declined to comment on the
case except to confirm that charges are pending against Barbour.

   Incomes Rise Faster Than Inflation
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Incomes grew faster than inflation in every
state last year, with residents of Wyoming enjoying the fastest
growth, the government reported today. ''Basically, it's entirely a
function of this exorbitant job growth we've seen,'' said economist
Richard Yamarone of Argus Research Corp. Nationally, average income
for America's 272.7 million people last year was $28,518, up 4.8
percent from 1998, the Commerce Department said. The figures
include not only wages and salaries but also other sources of
income, such as investment earnings and government benefits.

   Dow Drops 162; Nasdaq Off 67
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With many economists predicting more interest
rate hikes later this year, investors lost their nerve that fueled
Wall Street's recent rally. ''It is the accumulation of rate hikes
that truly hampers stock market performance over time,'' said Gail
Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS Warburg in New York. ''We do
expect lower (stock prices) in May and June to materialize before a
better and more sustainable summer rally can begin.'' Just before 3
p.m. EDT, the Dow industrials were down 162.77 at 10,771.80. On the
NYSE, decliners led advancers 1,925-914. The Nasdaq was down 67.46

   Time Warner, NBC Sign Coverage Deal

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc.'s cable division, fresh from a
nasty fight with ABC, has signed an agreement with NBC to carry the
network's main feed as well as cable channels CNBC and MSNBC
through 2008. The deal includes coverage of the Olympic Games,
which NBC has exclusive U.S. broadcast rights through 2008. NBC
also plans to offer extended coverage of the Olympics on its cable
channels beginning with the Sydney Olympics this fall. Time Warner
Cable spokesman Michael Luftman said NBC asked for, and received,
extra compensation for its Olympics coverage, but he declined to
say how much Time Warner was paying NBC overall.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lycos Inc. stock was down 13 15/16 at 58 11/16
this afternoon on news that Terra Networks, the leading Internet
service provider in the Spanish-speaking world, is buying it. It's
the first time a major U.S. Web portal has been bought by a foreign
company. The widely expected acquisition by Terra was announced
yesterday. The Spanish company is paying $12.5 billion in stock for
its beachhead in the United States, where it likely hopes to

   Gov't Filing Rebuttal to Microsoft Plan

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is defending its proposed
breakup of Microsoft in what essentially will be the last official
word before a federal judge holds a hearing on what remedies to
impose on the company's business practices. The Justice Department
and 17 states were filing a rebuttal this afternoon to Microsoft's
request to dismiss a plan that would split the company into two
businesses. The spinoff plan was proposed as a remedy to behavior
found to be anticompetitive -- and illegal -- by U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson. In addition to asking that the proposal be
dismissed, Microsoft last week offered to impose several
restrictions on itself instead.

   Philippines Seek 'Love Bug' Law
</P>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A senior Department of Justice
official has ruled that a law investigators hoped to use against
suspects in the ''Love Bug'' computer virus case does not apply to
computer crimes. The decision severely handicaps the investigators,
who have struggled to find a legal basis on which to charge any
suspects. The Philippines has no laws specifically addressing
high-tech computer crimes such as the ''ILOVEYOU'' virus, which
earlier this month crippled e-mail systems worldwide.

   Amway To Cut 1,300 Jobs

   ADA, Mich. (AP) -- Direct-sales giant Amway Corp. said today it
plans to cut nearly 11 percent of its global work force, or 1,300
jobs, as part of a restructuring expected to save $300 million a
year. The announcement was expected. Amway announced in February
that it was reorganizing in response to sluggish sales and the
changing business environment, and cuts were likely. About 900 jobs
will be cut at the company's world headquarters in Ada, 260
overseas, and the remainder in Amway's California operations in
Buena Park and Lakeview. Management and salaried positions will be
most affected, according to the company.

   Bankrupt AmeriServe Sues Ex-CEO
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Troubled restaurant supplier AmeriServe Food
Distribution Inc. has filed a lawsuit against its founder and
former chief executive, claiming he improperly pulled tens of
millions of dollars out of the company before it filed for
bankruptcy in January. AmeriServe charged that John Holten
wrongfully diverted funds from the company into other companies
under his control under the guise of expense reimbursements,
management fees and other transactions. In its lawsuit filed late
yesterday in Wilmington, Del., the company asked for the return of
the money and unspecified punitive damages.

   Jury Finds Bear Stearns Negligent
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bear Stearns Cos. was ordered to pay $111.5
million to a Canadian investor after a federal jury in Manhattan
found it acted negligently when it made unauthorized trades in his
account. Henryk de Kwiatkowski, the 76-year-old owner of a Kentucky
thoroughbred-horse-breeding farm who now lives in the Bahamas, had
claimed in a lawsuit that Bear Stearns Cos. cost him $300 million.
The jury in U.S. District Court concluded yesterday that a broker
at Bear Stearns had not acted negligently, and that the company had
not breached its fiduciary duty but did act negligently and owed de
Kwiatkowski $111.5 million. It was one of the largest jury awards
ever handed a Wall Street firm accused of wronging an individual
investor.

   U.S. Bancorp CFO Steps Down

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- One of the highest-ranking women bankers in

Bancorp. Susan Lester, 43, said that she made her decision to leave
the bank last year. She will be replaced by Andrew Cecere, 39.
Lester, CFO since 1996 and executive vice president of finance
since 1995, will stay with the bank for a couple of months to
assist Cecere's transition into the job. Lester said she was most
proud of her work on acquisitions, which helped the once-ailing
First Bank System become U.S. Bancorp, the nation's 11th-largest
bank spanning 16 states with $83 billion in assets.

Robert A. Eckert will immediately take over the helm at the world's

after more than a year of declining share prices and disappointing
earnings reports. ''This is one of the best consumer goods
companies on the planet. There are some wonderful assets on which

<HEADLINE> Judge: Wynette Files Off Limits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Medical and financial information about
late country music legend Tammy Wynette will stay off limits to the
public -- and her four daughters -- even after her widower hands it
over to a federal court, a judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynette's widower George Richey has to provide the materials as
part of a wrongful death lawsuit over the singer's death in April
1998. An autopsy showed her death was caused by repeated blood
clots that led to heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Wynette's daughters have sued Dr. Wallis Marsh and Care
Solutions of Nashville Inc. Marsh is a Pittsburgh physician who
treated Wynette for six years before her death. Care Solutions is
the pharmacy that filled some of Marsh's prescriptions. The lawsuit
alleges that Marsh prescribed too many painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   Richey asked that the information be sealed. He said one of
Wynette's daughters has admitted selling information to a tabloid
and cannot be trusted with the requested data.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Juliet Griffin issued a protective order Tuesday
and directed that the documents be returned to Richey or destroyed
when the lawsuit is concluded. Trial is set for October 2001.

<HEADLINE> Pope Celebrating 80th Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pope John Paul II celebrates his 80th
birthday Thursday striking a note he's sounded throughout his
papacy: acclaiming the roots shared by Judaism, Christianity and
Islam -- this time in a concert directed by a Jewish conductor.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration is also taking on an air of tribute to John
Paul's 22-year papacy, which is clearly in its twilight.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to continue working I'm sure until the time God calls
him,'' U.S. Archbishop John Foley said this week in Rome. ''And he
won't give up before then.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the limitations brought on by age, I continue to enjoy
life,'' the aging and ailing pontiff assured Catholics in a highly
personal open letter to the elderly last year. ''It is wonderful to
be able to give oneself to the very end for the sake of the Kingdom
of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's celebrations will be intensely spiritual, with John
Paul inviting priests from around the world to join him in
celebrating a Mass at St. Peter's. In addition, there will be
special birthday Masses celebrated at churches throughout Poland,
his native land.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrations sustain a theme of his papacy: building a
bridge between Christians and Jews, and followers of other faiths
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Like his prayers at Jerusalem's Western Wall in March, the point
is being made largely symbolically. John Paul chose Brooklyn-born
Jewish conductor Gilbert Levine to conduct Haydn's ''Creation'' for
the birthday serenade.
</P>
<P>
   The late 18th-century work depicts the start of the universe by
the common God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a tremendous statement there about the universality of
man,'' said Levine. ''It's who the pope is.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine first met the pontiff in 1987, after Levine assumed the
leadership of the Krakow Philharmonic in the pope's former diocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've read all about you,'' John Paul said without preamble
when the conductor walked into his private library at the pope's
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Levine received an invitation to conduct at the 1988
10th anniversary of John Paul's papacy. It forged an alliance
between Jewish conductor and Catholic leader whose symbolism was
obvious to observers on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Levine took part in a solemn Vatican concert and
prayers in mourning for the Holocaust. The pope and Holocaust
survivors listened as the Jewish prayer of mourning was read in the
center of the Roman Catholic faith.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Levine joined John Paul and 500,000 young people in a
far more joyous occasion, World Youth Day held in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Levine saw other sides of the pope's nature over the years,
including his kindness to Levine's mother-in-law, who watched Nazi
guards shoot her mother and father to death at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, born in a small town within sight of the smokestacks
of Auschwitz, would sit with the woman, talking quietly in Polish.
</P>
<P>
   When she died in 1998, at 75, there were only three pictures in
her room -- a small room, Levine noted, because death camps seemed
to have left her with a preference for small places.
</P>
<P>
   The photos: her dead mother. Her dead father. And the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe he was able to soothe her,'' Levine said. ''She
actually became more devoted to Judaism ... and more comfortable,
and also the pain in her eased.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, John Paul paid a private visit to the shrine of the
Madonna of Fatima, whose intervention he credits with sparing his
life in a 1981 assassination attempt in St. Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul placed before the statue a gold ring given him by his
mentor, the late Polish Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski. It was such a
precious possession that newspapers speculated the gift meant John
Paul is about to relinquish the papacy itself.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation was ''150 percent wrong,'' the pope's spokesman,
Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the pope's infirmities and age -- turning 80, he reaches
the age when cardinals may no longer cast votes in conclaves to
elect new popes -- talk at the Vatican naturally turns to possible
successors.
</P>
<P>
   But the race is considered wide open, particularly because John
Paul has outlived many cardinals seen as possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians, who lost the papacy after 455 years, would like it
back. Their candidates include Cardinal Camillo Ruini, head of the
Italian bishops' conference, and Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the
archbishop of Milan, the choice of liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates mentioned around the world include Miloslav Vlk
of the Czech Republic, Godfried Danneels of Belgium, Carrera
Narberto Rivera of Mexico and Jaime Ortega of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, however, has given no hint of giving up his duties --
although some around him have suggested he might if his symptoms of
Parkinson's become incapacitating.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, the U.S. archbishop, repeats a saying he said the pope
often cites on the subject: '''Heaven is the time to rest. Now is
the time to work.'''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 166; Nasdaq Down 70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks stumbled today as investors took profits
from the market's recent rally and determined that the interest
rate increase implemented by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday may
indeed threaten stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 166.03 at 10,768.54.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 19.33 at 1,446.71, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 70.28 at 3,647.29.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness on Wall Street didn't surprise analysts, who
believed stocks were due to falter as investors tried to capture
gains from a four-day rally. The market's gains were capped Tuesday
when the Fed, as expected, raised interest rates a half-percentage
point -- its steepest increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, raising
borrowing costs and cutting into bottom-line profits. Investors had
bid stocks higher on the hope that Tuesday's increase could be the
last for a while, but with many economists predicting still higher
rates later this year, many investors lost their nerve today,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the accumulation of rate hikes that truly hampers stock
market performance over time,'' said Gail Dudack, chief equity
strategist at UBS Warburg in New York. ''We do expect lower (stock
prices) in May and June to materialize before a better and more
sustainable summer rally can begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudack pointed out that in the 11 volatile months since the Fed
began raising rates, the Dow has declined modestly. The Nasdaq is
up about 35 percent since June 1999, but has tumbled dramatically
from its all-time high of 5,048.62, set March 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's performance, Dudack said, is more typical during a
time of escalating rates, and the Nasdaq's recent slump may be
bringing it in line with historical measures.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, the top-performing Dow component on Tuesday,
plunged 8~ to 131[. After the close of trading Tuesday, the company
reported second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street analysts'
expectations. But testy investors may have been expecting
Hewlett-Packard to more dramatically exceed published estimates,
analysts said. Others suggested that the company may be growing
dependent on lower margin areas such as personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, the testing and measuring equipment maker that was spun
off from Hewlett-Packard, fell 16| to 79].
</P>
<P>
   Consumer goods stocks were also lower today. Johnson &AMP; Johnson
fell 7/16 to 86~ and Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 5/16 to 64}.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell 1| to 37\ after Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack
Grubman said he expects the company to earn $2.55 per share in
2001, instead of his previous estimate of $2.75. Grubman said AT&AMP;T
is facing higher sales, general and administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a better than 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to a
moderate 654.12 million shares, behind Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.48 to 499.50.

<HEADLINE> Paris Canals To Get Overhaul  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Imagine kayaking down the Seine, antique-hunting
along the banks of the Paris canals, or even taking a trip north of
Paris by boat.
</P>
<P>
   These are part of an $85.7 million plan unveiled Wednesday to
make the historic waterways of the French capital tourist-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to make the landscape around the canals more
attractive for leisure activities and promenades,'' Paris Mayor
Jean Tiberi said in a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Tiberi said the project to renovate the city's three main canal
systems -- Saint-Denis, Saint-Martin and Ourcq -- would take about
six years.
</P>
<P>
   The canal system was built in the early 1800s by Napoleon
Bonaparte, eager to bring clean water into the city and cut a
straight water route though the capital, in contrast to the
meandering Seine River.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 81-mile system of waterways stretches across Paris
and into outlying suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Picturesque, working-class neighborhoods grew around the locks,
inspiring generations of painters and movie directors. The Hotel du
Nord -- which inspired Marcel Carne's 1938 cult film of that name --
still overlooks the Canal Saint-Martin, its facade now a historic
monument.
</P>
<P>
   Tiberi said greater use of the canals for cargo would also
reduce pollution and truck traffic in and around the city. The
waterways currently transport 1 million tons of building materials
yearly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took a boat to the inauguration of the Stade de France in
1998,'' Tiberi said of the stadium north of Paris that staged the
World Cup soccer final. ''It was the middle of winter, but it was
still quite pleasant. Think how nice it would be in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Most visitors think visiting Paris' waterways is limited to a
ride down the Seine through central Paris on a Bateau Mouche.
</P>
<P>
   But the slow boat ride down the Canal Saint-Martin and through
its nine locks draws some 80,000 visitors yearly. The new project
includes quick trips with shorter routes as well as a trip through
what the mayor's office describes as a ''fairylike'' underground
portion of the Canal Saint-Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation project also includes making the canal quays
accessible to pedestrians and cyclists. The city plans to install
high-tech lighting in underground areas, revamp the harbor at the
Villette in northern Paris -- where visitors can already rent kayaks
-- and build more boat docks at the Pavillon de l'Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The Arsenal harbor, where Parisians lounge on grassy banks of
the Seine, currently has dock space for about 170 boats -- 70
percent of which go to foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,300 boats dock in Paris each year, mostly between May
and September, according to the Paris Chamber of Commerce.

<HEADLINE> DA in court to hear of husband's 'greed and lust'  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- With District Attorney Jeanine Pirro
in the front row of the gallery, a federal prosecutor said
Wednesday that her husband's ''greed and lust for material
possessions,'' ranging from a Ferrari to a custom-made pigpen, led
him into a tax-fraud conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The husband, lobbyist Albert Pirro, ''subsidized a lavish
lifestyle by cheating on his taxes,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Cathy
Seibel said in her opening statement to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, who sat with her mother, dismissed the
claims as so much ''theater'' and said she was confident the
charges are false. She called the case ''an overreaching effort by
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   She came to court, she said, because ''My family is in trouble
now.'' She has not been charged in the case and much of the trial's
interest is in how closely she is linked to any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   During her morning in court, the district attorney showed little
emotion. When Seibel alleged that Albert Pirro had spent -- and
illegally deducted -- $70,000 to fight a paternity suit filed
against him, Mrs. Pirro looked toward the jurors once but did not
otherwise react.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Gustave Newman acknowledged that Pirro's tax
returns had ''misclassified'' many personal expenses as business
write-offs, but he attributed that to ''the hectic life'' of the
real estate dealmaker, lobbyist and Republican fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't hands on,'' Newman said. ''He did not sit down and
approve every check and look at every check.'' He claimed, for
example, that Pirro signed only 24 percent of the checks issued
from his personal checking account and as few as 2 percent of the
checks drawn on some of his business accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro's brother Anthony, who was his accountant and is a
co-defendant, ''signed a whole series of checks and paid bills
without ever discussing it with him,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Seibel said that between 1988 and 1997, Albert Pirro
''fraudulently deducted ... hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of
personal items as though they were business expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Many involved the Pirros' home in Harrison, she said. Pirro
illegally deducted checks for work ranging from an exterminator's
visit to a pool man to a $45,000 electronically controlled driveway
gate. There was also a custom wrought iron enclosure for the
family's potbellied pigs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Newman implied that the driveway gate was required for Jeanine
Pirro's security. Although Seibel noted that Mrs. Pirro was not yet
district attorney when the gates were designed, Newman said she was
a county judge dealing with murderers and drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Also illegally deducted, Seibel said, were expenses from Jeanine
Pirro's campaigns for public office and the salaries of business
employees Albert Pirro used to do substantial personal work for
himself and his family, including the furnishing of his vacation
home in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said Pirro's behavior -- keeping just one set of books,
noting some personal expenses on the checks, making records
available to the IRS -- was not the behavior of ''somebody who wants
to commit a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that after Pirro learned his taxes were being
investigated, he amended his returns, showed them to the Internal
Revenue Service and asked, ''Is there anything else you want me to
add?''
</P>
<P>
   Pirro, 52, ended up paying back half a million dollars plus
interest, Newman said -- more than was actually due.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think he got a refund?'' Newman asked the jury. ''You know
what he got? He got an indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Seibel said paying taxes after learning of an investigation
is no more of a defense than ''a bank robber paying the money back
after being caught red-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Pirro's lawyer, Roger Stavis, said several times that
his client was ''only the accountant.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anthony Pirro is not a big shot, not a powerful man, not the
reason why I don't think there's a seat to be had in the
courtroom,'' Stavis said. ''He was paid regular accounting fees for
regular accounting work. ... The evidence will show that there was
no conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, if convicted, could be sentenced to up to five
years in prison if convicted of any of the scores of counts against
them.

<HEADLINE> India Altering Nursery Rhymes  </HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Mary and her famous lamb will turn into
Meera and her cat for thousands of Indian children when new English
language textbooks come into use in June.
</P>
<P>
   And, instead of ''Rain, rain go away,'' some 8.5 million
students in the water-thirsty western state of Maharashtra will
recite ''Rain, rain come again.''
</P>
<P>
   '''Rain, rain go away' is a disastrous proposition in the Indian
context. So we changed this ...,'' Ramesh Dhongde, chairman of the
English committee of the textbook firm, Balbharati, told The
Associated Press on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   English nursery rhymes have been taught for more than 50 years
in primary schools in India, a former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of an effort to make the rhymes ''more Indian,''
teachers and textbook writers have been told they can substitute
the animals and other objects in the rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   The new English language textbooks will be introduced in June in
60,000 regional language schools all over Maharashtra, of which
Bombay is the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a government decision to Indianize. We academics merely
implemented it,'' said Dhongde, professor of linguistics at Deccan
College in Pune.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we kept the rhythm and used objects Indian children are
familiar with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 64-page book called, ''My English'' has short explanatory
texts for teachers in Indian languages, such as Urdu, Marathi,
Gujarati, Telugu, Kannada and Sindhi.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Express newspaper reported the book will contain a
picture of a beaming Indian shepherd wearing a traditional dhoti or
wrap-around trousers to illustrate the rhyme, ''Ba, Ba, black
sheep.''
</P>
<P>
   Nursery rhymes such as ''Twinkle, twinkle, little star'' and
''Jack and Jill went up the hill'' were left untouched since
academicians felt these were universal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no point just changing names. We've tried to introduce
some Indian culture and make them more appealing,'' said Dhongde,
part of the five-member committee that revised the syllabus.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want children to feel threatened by a new language.
They should enjoy it.''

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Guest Faces Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A former ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
contestant who wrote a soon-to-be-released book on how to get on
the game show is accused of embezzling nearly $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher Peter Kaufman of TV Books said he does not know yet
what he will do about the release of Paul Barbour's ''Who Wants to
be a Contestant.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, 38, of Baldwinsville, N.Y., and his brothers, Mark and
Mike, were the first three siblings to appear on the game show,
though none made it past the preliminary ''fastest-finger'' round.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in July accused him and a nurse of
defrauding an insurance company of more than $190,000 by
authorizing dozens of payments to a phony medical services company
in 1998, The Syracuse Newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour is scheduled to appear in court June 2. If convicted, he
could face up to 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just a good guy who didn't do anything wrong who's really
getting screwed here,'' he told the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he disclosed the charges to his publisher. Kaufman
disputed that.

<HEADLINE> 10 Commandments Poster Removed  </HEADLINE>
By MARK R. CHELLGREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITLEY CITY, Ky. (AP) -- A poster of the Ten Commandments was
removed from a county courthouse Wednesday as one preacher declared
it ''a dark and shameful day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''God forgive us,'' shouted one of the roughly four dozen people
who had assembled at McCreary County Courthouse, many wearing
T-shirts that bore a recitation of the scripture.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Jennifer Coffman last week reiterated an
order that the display in McCreary County be removed while a
lawsuit challenging their constitutionality is pending. Similar
displays in the Pulaski County Courthouse and the Harlan County
schools also were to be taken down this week.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman had earlier agreed with the American Civil Liberties
Union that the displays amounted to a government endorsement of
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today or tomorrow they will probably be taken off the walls
and stored,'' said Harlan County Schools Superintendent Don
Musselman. ''But I'm sure they will be going back up one day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the school district has received more than $25,000 in
donations toward its legal fight to keep the Commandments posted.
</P>
<P>
   Community officials have portrayed the Commandments as
collections of historic documents that show the importance of
religion in America. Coffman said the displays, which included
excerpts from the Declaration of Independence, the state
Constitution and the Mayflower Compact, all had a religious tone.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Willie Ramsey, pastor of the Somerset Church of Christ,
said Coffman had declared the documents illegal. ''That's a dark
and shameful day. That's communism. That's atheism,'' Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Kentucky case that the U.S. Supreme Court used to rule
in 1980 that posting the Ten Commandments violated the
constitutional prohibition against government establishment of
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, the 2000 Kentucky General Assembly passed a
resolution that encourages local governments and schools to post
the Ten Commandments and ordered a display on the Capitol grounds.

<HEADLINE> German Unions Open to Reform  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- In the egalitarian world of Germany's
consensus economy, there was a time when unions held out for
one-size-fits-all contracts that covered nearly every field from
shipbuilding to semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   But with Europe's biggest economy scrambling to compete in a
global economy where wages are increasingly set by local conditions
and profitability, Germany's most powerful union seems finally
poised to rethink old tactics -- and in doing so could give an extra
boost to Germany's fledgling economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough came recently when IG Metall, the world's largest
union representing 3.4 million metal and electronics workers in
such blue-chip companies as DaimlerChrysler AG and Siemens AG,
invited its members to contemplate a wide range of reform topics
that once were considered taboo.
</P>
<P>
   That includes mixing up pay scales, accepting different work
weeks for different industries, and even allowing opt-out clauses
for companies that cannot afford the unions' demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to realize that the different branches of the economy
have different needs,'' said IG Metall spokeswoman Dagmar
Opoeczynski. ''The idea is to open up to greater flexibility to
serve all our members.''
</P>
<P>
   The move has ramifications for the whole German economy because
IG Metall has traditionally set the standard for contracts in other
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Union vice president Juergen Peters asked members for feedback
Monday as part of a plan to draw up negotiating points that offer
more flexibility when the union goes back the bargaining table in
2002. IG Metall has already sealed a two-year contract to keep them
working until then.
</P>
<P>
   That contract gives equal wage increases to workers in the
eastern and western parts of the country. But it failed to get
eastern workers a shorter, 35-hour workweek to match western hours,
settling instead for a 38-hour workweek.
</P>
<P>
   That was the first sign of trouble for the unions' strategy of
demanding identical contracts throughout the country, an outcome
employers have long decried as artificially driving up unemployment
and labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling companies in the eastern part of Germany resist
paying equal wages saying it would force them out of business
because productivity in the east continues to lag western levels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, high-tech workers in information technology,
telecommunications and semiconductors shun unions for usually
lumping them together with other fields and depressing their
otherwise higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Those pressures are starting to show in union membership.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six years, the number of German workers belonging to
unions dropped 17 percent. If that weren't bad enough, high-tech
workers -- the engine of the new economy and a big growth field --
tend not to join unions, making up only 10 percent of IG Metall's
membership.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unions are realizing that they are losing members so this
approach is more realistic,'' said Peter Meister, an economist with
BHF Bank in Frankfurt. ''It's important that they make changes and
this should help the impression that Europe is resistant to
reform.''

<HEADLINE> Trucker Rape Acts Found on Video  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A trucker is accused of raping an
intoxicated and unconscious woman with swords, knives and other
objects and recording the acts on video.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Rupprecht, 53, was arrested after the alleged victim
found the videotapes at the man's home and photographs on the
Internet, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old woman told police that over the past two years,
Rupprecht pressured her to drink alcohol until she passed out at
his home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had been unaware of what happened while she was
unconscious until she found the tapes, a suspicious computer disk
and forms from an Internet company at his home.
</P>
<P>
   She used passwords and account numbers on the forms to find lewd
pictures of herself on the Internet, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Wednesday they seized a computer and 140 tapes from
Rupprecht's home. The alleged victim was not the only woman on the
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a case with a lot of potential for additional victims
depending on what we find on that computer,'' Sgt. Randy Stull
said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman notified police on May 8 while Rupprecht was on the
road. Investigators used his employer's satellite-directed tracking
system to find his truck near Nashville, Tenn., where the arrest
was made last week.

By The Associated Press	   Other civil rights cases that recently have been
reopened:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --February 1994: Byron De La Beckwith is convicted for the June
12, 1963 murder of Medgar Evers, the first field secretary for the
NAACP. Beckwith had been tried twice before for the crime, but both
trials ended with hung juries. He is appealing the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1998, Police in Jackson County, Miss., reopen investigation
into the 1967 death of Benjamin Brown, who was shot to death by
police during a student protest at Jackson State University. Brown
had not been protesting, and no action was taken against the police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   --April 1998: Police in Natchez, Miss., begin reinvestigating the
1967 death of Wharlest Jackson, treasurer of the Natchez NAACP, who
was killed by a car bomb. Weeks before his death, Jackson had been
promoted to a position at a local tire plant that had previously
only been held by white men. No one was ever arrested for the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   --August 1998: Sam Bowers, former imperial wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan, is convicted for the 1966 murder of Vernon Dahmer. Dahmer,
president of the NAACP in Hattiesburg, Miss., was killed in a

the crime, and three were convicted. The case of another suspect,
Charles Noble, ended in mistrial in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   --November 1999: Charles E. Caston, James Caston and Hal Crimm
are each sentenced to 20 years in prison for the 1970 murder of
Rainey Pool. Pool, a one-armed sharecropper from Midnight, Miss.,
was beaten and dumped in a river. Seven white men were originally
arrested for the crime, but charges were dismissed. Two had since
died, one was acquitted in June 1998 and another pleaded guilty to
reduced charges in 1999. Charles Caston died in prison in March,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   --February 2000: The FBI reopens investigation into the 1964

<HEADLINE> Behind-the-scenes battle over Assembly leadership  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The halls of the state Capitol were sizzling
Wednesday with reports that state Assembly Majority Leader Michael
Bragman, possibly with the help of opposition Republicans, might
move to oust fellow Democrat Sheldon Silver as Assembly speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message from Mike is that there's just no comment at this
time,'' said Bragman spokesman Daniel Weiller when asked about the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman, a Syracuse-area Democrat, is the leader of the
Assembly's conservative upstate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lynch, a spokesman for Manhattan Democrat Silver, said
she was not commenting on the reports of a possible rebellion
against the Assembly's No. 1 Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he puts a statement out, then I'll respond,'' Lynch said
when asked about Bragman.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario had Bragman lining up some fellow Democrats who are
dissatisfied with Silver's leadership and joining up with some or
all of the chamber's 51 Republican members to come up with the 76
votes needed in the 150-member Assembly to elect a new speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Republican votes might be used to help Bragman
against Silver, Assembly Minority Leader John Faso, the leader of
the chamber's GOP forces, said: ''That remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bragman has been talking to some Republicans,'' said one
senior Republican member of the Assembly, who spoke only on
condition of not being identified.
</P>
<P>
   Silver loyalists insisted Bragman would be unable to muster the
votes to depose Silver, even if he could form an alliance with the
Assembly Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have been strained between Silver and Bragman for some
time over a host of issues, including Bragman's desire to someday
have Silver's job.
</P>
<P>
   More recently there has been tension over Bragman's decision to
get behind the possible 2002 gubernatorial candidacy of state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall. Silver had urged members to stay
neutral for the time being and there has been speculation that
Silver really favors the potential rival candidacy for governor of
federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Bragman was also not among the 24 speakers that addressed the
Democratic state convention Tuesday that nominated Hillary Rodham
Clinton for the U.S. Senate. Silver had much influence over who got
those speaking assignments.
</P>
<P>
   With the Assembly is in recess until Monday, no formal action
could come before then.
</P>
<P>
   The possible move by Bragman against Silver was the hot topic at
the state Capitol on Wednesday, even in the Republican-led state
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just heard people talking about it in the aisle,'' state
Sen. William Larkin, an Orange County Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
   Also creating tension between Bragman and Silver is the
traditional upstate-downstate split in New York. The Assembly has
long been controlled by New York City-area Democrats who tend to be
more liberal than Bragman and other Democrats from outside the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Silver was elected Assembly speaker in 1994. Bragman has been
majority leader that entire time.
</P>
<P>
   The last Albany leader to be deposed was then-state Senate
Majority Leader Ralph Marino, a Long Island Republican, who was
ousted in a 1994 Thanksgiving Day weekend coup led by current
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican. At
the time, Marino's troops insisted Bruno didn't have the votes to
pull off the coup.

<HEADLINE> Ohio man sentenced to 6 months for assaulting child on plane  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- An Ohio man who pleaded guilty to
charges he assaulted a 7-year-old girl aboard a Northwest Airlines
flight was sentenced to six months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Howard, 40, of Sylvania, Ohio, told the girl's family he
was sorry for the crime at a sentencing hearing Tuesday. But the
child's mother rejected his apology.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has no idea what he has done to my family,'' the mother
told U.S. District Judge Dean Buttram. ''I do not accept his
apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard entered a guilty plea in December to assaulting the girl
last May 14 while she was traveling alone from Birmingham to see
her father in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was first seated in the back of the airplane, but
flight attendants moved her to first class, where an intoxicated
Howard tried to start a conversation with the girl and hold her
hand. He pulled her hair to keep her in the seat, leaving the
little girl with scrapes and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants moved the girl to the back of the airplane,
but Howard followed. He was asked to return to his first-class
seat, and flight attendants finally put a beverage cart in the
aisle to thwart him.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's family is suing Minneapolis-based Northwest Airlines,
Howard and his employer, Toledo, Ohio-based Midport Electronics
Inc., claiming negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you've done disturbs the court,'' Buttram told Howard.
''I wish I could do more to you than what I'm allowed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He ordered Howard to pay a $5,000 fine with interest and $400 in
restitution to the girl's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's attorney, Lorin L. Zaner, told the judge Howard is not
a career criminal and listed various charities his client is
involved in.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a plea agreement, the prosecution recommended Howard
serve his sentence at a prison camp.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Phillips asked Buttram to dismiss
a charge of sexual contact. Buttram did so, but said the action was
taken ''reluctantly and disapprovingly.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Rape Caught on Video  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- A trucker is accused of raping an
intoxicated and unconscious woman with swords, knives and other
objects and recording the acts on video.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Rupprecht, 53, was arrested after the alleged victim
found the videotapes at the man's home and photographs on the
Internet, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old woman told police that over the past two years,
Rupprecht pressured her to drink alcohol until she passed out at
his home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had been unaware of what happened while she was
unconscious until she found the tapes, a suspicious computer disk
and forms from an Internet company at his home.
</P>
<P>
   She used passwords and account numbers on the forms to find lewd
pictures of herself on the Internet, investigators said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Kidnappers Seek Ransom  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Islamic rebels are asking $2 million
ransom for an ailing German woman who is just one of their 19
foreign hostages -- a demand Philippine negotiators have rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon the Abu Sayyaf captors had
increased their demand from the $1 million previously asked for the
safe release of 57-year-old German Renate Wallert, who suffers from
high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages -- three Germans, two French citizens, two South
Africans, two Finns, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos
-- were abducted on April 23 from Sipadan Island, a Malaysian diving
resort. They were then taken to the Philippine island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite intense international pressure to secure the release of
the hostages -- especially Wallert -- chief negotiator Robert
Aventajado said the government has ruled out any ransom payment, as
have each of the governments of the foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage shot Wednesday by GMA7 TV shows Wallert
sitting on the floor and using her arms to move herself out to the
steps of the captives' hut.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier pictures showed her lying, apparently nearly comatose,
in a hammock. Her condition has improved since she began taking
high blood pressure medicine, negotiators have said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to earlier images of sullen-faced captives,
Wednesday's footage of the hostages showed some of them smiling and
even clowning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fine,'' Lebanese Marie Moarbes said in a message to her
father. ''Don't worry about me. I'm worrying about you. Don't smoke
too much!''
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said negotiations will start Thursday or Friday, with
the government insisting that Abu Sayyaf leaders first agree on
their demands.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage negotiations are an opportunity to address such
larger problems as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is still poverty. The issue of land. The issue of
injustice,'' Aventajado said. ''What's happening now is just a
small component of a larger struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the latest ransom demand, in a statement on
Tuesday, the rebels also called for the creation of an independent
Islamic state -- a demand the Philippine government has repeatedly
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The statement described the kidnapping as a ''minor thing''
compared to injustices suffered by the Philippines' Muslim
minority.
</P>
<P>
   The group is also holding about eight Filipino hostages on the
nearby island of Basilan out of a group of about 50, including many
children, taken from two schools on March 20. Some of those
hostages were released, 15 were rescued and six were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf has been linked to many previous kidnappings and
attacks on Christians in this predominantly Roman Catholic country.
They tortured and killed a priest and beheaded two other Basilan
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250,000 people on the southern island of Mindanao have
been displaced since last month, when the army attacked a 10-mile
stretch of highway held by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the
larger and more moderate of the two rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippine capital Manila on Wednesday, at least 10
people, including children, were injured when a bomb exploded in a
shopping center in the city's financial district, officials said.
There was no immediate indication if it was connected to a rebel to
attack cities.
</P>
<P>
   At least 113 government soldiers have been killed and more than
470 others wounded during a five-month offensive against Muslim
rebels in the southern Philippines, the highest casualty rate since
the height of the insurgency about 25 years ago, armed forces
spokesman Col. Rafael Romero said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Over Queen Mother's birthday  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Queen Mother Elizabeth turns 100 this summer,
a joyful occasion for much of the nation -- and the surprising
source of a dispute that reached the House of Commons on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The publicly funded British Broadcasting Corp. last week
announced it would not televise the celebratory pageant to be held
in the Queen Mother's honor two weeks before her Aug. 4 birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage, dismay and mutterings about disloyalty echoed around
the land.
</P>
<P>
   ''How Dare The BBC Snub The Queen Mother'' trumpeted the tabloid
Daily Mail. The more sedate Daily Telegraph called it ''sad and
surprising that the BBC is ignoring the main pageant in honor of
this extraordinary life.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, answering a parliamentary question
Wednesday, said he hoped the problem could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everyone would like to see a televised broadcast of
the Queen Mother's celebration because everyone wishes her well --
it would be a fantastic event for the whole of the nation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Within the hour, the commercial ITV network rode to the rescue,
announcing it would televise the pageant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am delighted that ITV, Britain's favorite channel, will lead
the salute to Britain's favorite grandmother,'' said ITV's program
director David Liddiment, seizing the high-profile moment to plug
his network.
</P>
<P>
   But the Queen Mother is far more than an appealing grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   As queen consort during World War II, she was a source of
strength to King George VI and a focus for homefront morale. In the
half-century of change that followed, she became a bulwark of the
monarchy and remained untainted by the criticism that afflicted her
daughter, Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   She has retained the affection and loyalty of the wartime
generation, and maintains ties with the surviving men and women who
served at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The July 19 pageant involves a cast of 7,000, as well as many
charities for whom the Queen Mother is patron.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights will be a march of the scarlet-coated
Household Cavalry, an air show by World War II aircraft, music from
the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and a tribute from actor Sir John
Mills.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC said it would focus its coverage instead on the Aug. 4
events, having decided that ''Her Majesty's birthday itself should
be our main priority and that the BBC's comprehensive level of
coverage was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the Aug. 4 celebrations have not been publicized, but
the BBC said it planned a full schedule of tributes for that day,
as well as coverage of a July 11 service of thanksgiving at St.
Paul's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the Queen Mother herself kept well away from the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at Clarence House, her London residence, said no
comment would be made, and that the arrangements were a matter for
the TV companies.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Fall; Grains Mixed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Weather concerns sent soybean futures prices
tumbling, while grain futures prices were mixed in trading
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Corn futures prices, after falling at the start of trading,
ended the day unchanged, with the market having already factored in
forecasts of rain in the Midwest crop-growing area, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   This week's rain and last week's precipitation has replenished
the top soil, which will allow the corn crop -- which is more than
90 percent planted -- to get off to a good start, according to
analyst Tim Hannagan of Alaron Trading Corp. The market is now
looking at long-term weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has already
indicated that in the long term, conditions in the Midwest will be
drier and hotter than normal, which does not bode well for the corn
crop, Hannagan said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service 30- and 60-day forecast, expected
this week, will be looked at closely by traders to confirm those
fears, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean futures prices fell in league with soybeans, although
the precipitation is not expected to affect the soybean crop, with
is about 55 percent planted, Hannagan said, adding the weather will
become a more important factor in crop development later in the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Precipitation in the hard red winter wheat belt this week eased
quality concerns in the market. The approach of the June wheat
harvest also weighed on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery was 4\ cents lower at $2.77 a bushel;
July corn was unchanged at $2.35{ a bushel; July oats were
unchanged at $1.19 a bushel; July soybeans were 2{ cents lower at
$5.41\ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle futures prices were higher and pork futures prices were
mixed in trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   June live cattle were .08 cent higher at 68.20 cents a pound;
August feeder cattle were .28 cent higher at 84.10 cents a pound;
June lean hogs were .12 cent higher at 71.02 cents a pound; July
pork bellies were .38 cent lower at 86.72 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Video Shows Rep. Kennedy Push Guard  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A videotape of a confrontation between Rep.
Patrick Kennedy and an airport security guard shows the congressman
shoving the woman backward into the archway of a metal detector.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was recorded by security cameras at the Los Angeles
airport, and a tape was released Wednesday by airport police after
the city attorney's office decided Tuesday not to bring charges.
</P>
<P>
   The guard, Della Patton, 58, had filed a battery complaint
against the 32-year-old the Rhode Island Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had claimed the videotape would support their account
of the March 26 incident.
</P>
<P>
   The tape shows Kennedy trying to fit a large carry-on bag into
an X-ray machine. Patton waves at Kennedy, apparently indicating
the bag won't fit.
</P>
<P>
   She and Kennedy talk, and he steps over to the metal detector,
which is blocked by Patton. Kennedy raises his right hand to her
left shoulder and pushes her back, jostling the detector archway.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the son of Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, has
admitted acting rudely and apologized, but he denied hurting
Patton. He said the incident was blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's lawyer has said he will probably seek a settlement and
sue if those talks fail.

<HEADLINE> State senator's son gets charges reduced in plea bargain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CANTON, N.Y. (AP) -- The son of long-time state Sen. Ronald B.
Stafford has pleaded guilty to having an altered license, but he
avoided several other charges in a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Parker K. Stafford, 20, a St. Lawrence University student, was
charged April 22 with driving while intoxicated, driving while
ability impaired by drugs, possession of marijuana and driving
without headlights. All of those charges were dismissed Tuesday by
Village Justice Michael C. Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Parker Stafford, who was represented by attorney Charles B.
Gardner of Gouverneur, was fined $50 and ordered to pay a $30 fee
for the altered-license charge.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe also ordered him to pay a $125 civil penalty and suspended
his driver's license for six months for violating the state's zero
tolerance law.
</P>
<P>
   The zero tolerance law, enacted in 1996, applies to drivers
under age 21 who are found to have blood alcohol levels between .02
and .07 percent. A drunken-driving charge in New York requires a
blood alcohol level of at least .10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the zero tolerance law, there were no sanctions to
apply to someone under 21 who was drinking and driving but not
legally drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Stafford has represented the Plattsburgh area in the
state Legislature since 1966.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Bin Laden in Y2K Plot  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn.(AP) -- President Clinton today accused the
terror network allegedly operated by Saudi fugitive Osama bin Laden
of plotting to harm Americans gathered for millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last December, working with Jordan, we shut down a plan to
place large bombs at locations where Americans might gather for New
Year's Eve,'' Clinton said in commencement remarks to 184 cadets at
the Coast Guard Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned the plot was linked to terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and the organization created by Osama bin Laden, the
man responsible for the 1998 bombings at our embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya, which cost the lives of Americans and hundreds of
Africans,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the plan was uncovered, a Customs agent in Seattle
discovered bombmaking materials being smuggled into the United
States, Clinton said, ''the same material used by bin Laden in
other places.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the president's most extensive discussion of bin Laden's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi exile believed to be in Afghanistan, is among
17 people charged in a federal indictment with conspiracy to kill
Americans in the embassy bombing cases. Six are in custody in the
United States and three overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In the alleged bomb smuggling, Ahmed Ressam, 32, was arrested
Dec. 14 after driving his rented car off a ferry from Victoria,
British Columbia at Port Angeles, Wash. Prosecutors allege Ressam
was at the center of a plot, involving a handful of other Algerian
nationals in New York and Canada, to bomb buildings or other
targets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam has pleaded innocent to nine charges, including
possessing and transporting explosives with the intent to cause
damage or injury. His trial has been moved to Los Angeles because
of intense media coverage and is scheduled to begin July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Ghani Meskini, 31, has been held without bail since his
December arrest as an alleged accomplice in Brooklyn, N.Y. Meskini
has been charged with providing and concealing support for Ressam.
Another alleged accomplice, Mokhtar Haouari, 31, remains in
Montreal as the United States seeks to extradite him to be tried in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other arrests have been made in the case, and one man believed
to have stayed with Ressam in a Vancouver, British Columbia motel
in the weeks before the alleged smuggling attempt remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was making the point that the new Coast Guard graduates
will face a range of threats to America's security, from terrorism
to smuggling to the spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today and for the forseeable tomorrows we and especially you
will face a fateful struggle between forces of integration and
harmony and the forces of disintegration and chaos,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology can be a servant of either side, or, ironically,
both,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, the president speaks at graduation ceremonies for
one of the four service academies each year. He last spoke to Coast
Guard cadets in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton spoke, each cadet was presented with a bachelor of
science degree and a commission as an ensign. Ensigns begin their a
five-year service obligation with a tour of duty aboard a Coast
Guard cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited the ''Love Bug'' computer virus as powerful proof
of the new kinds of threats to American security in an increasingly
smaller, faster and more computerized world, the White House says.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that the virus, which spread by electronic mail,
disabled computers worldwide earlier this month and did millions of
dollars in damage.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Land Spending Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel voted Wednesday to slash
President Clinton's plans for purchasing new parklands next year by
70 percent, prompting Democratic warnings that a veto battle lay
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts were part of a $14.6 billion measure financing the
Interior Department and cultural programs in fiscal 2001. The
measure has other environmental provisions the administration also
opposes, including a prohibition on improvements in the four
national monuments Clinton has created this year in California and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The overall bill, approved by voice vote by a subcommittee of
the House Appropriations Committee, provides $300 million less than
this year and $1.7 billion less than Clinton requested. Democrats
declared the bill unsalvageable for now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We might as well get on with the hanging and see if we can
resurrect the corpse somewhere down the road,'' said Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would increase the overall budgets of the National
Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land
Management, with most of the extra money for maintenance, not
expansions.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was our highest priority,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula,
R-Ohio, the subcommittee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   By trimming Clinton's $620 million proposal for acquiring
federal, state and local land to just $186 million, Republicans
were once again targeting one of his top legislative priorities. In
a bill written earlier this month, House Republicans would kill his
plans to help communities hire new teachers and repair schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can guarantee the president won't sign this bill into law
unless this level is significantly raised,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The amount in the bill falls well below the nearly $3 billion a
year that would be set aside for land purchases, wildlife
protection and other environmental programs under a huge
conservation bill the House approved last week. Should that measure
become law, it would not take effect until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   A provision sponsored by Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, would bar
any expenditures for planning, designing or managing the new
national monuments. Democrats said they believed the language would
even prohibit expenditures for roads or law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans and business interests have opposed Clinton's
monument designations, calling them federal land grabs that were
hurting local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, he has designated the Grand Canyon-Parashant
and Agua Fria national monuments in Arizona; the California Coastal
National Monument, which is thousands of tiny islands; and more
than 30 groves of giant sequoia trees across California. They total
more than 1 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 1996 designation of the 1.7-million-acre Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah would not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes:
</P>
<P>
   --$350 million in emergency funds for the Interior Department's
and Forest Service's costs of fighting fires this year, including
the huge blaze that has devastated much of Los Alamos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   --Language slowing efforts to tighten federal restrictions on
public lands in Washington state east of the Cascade Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   --A halt to Fish and Wildlife Service plans to create a new
refuge at Yolo Basin, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   --$98 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, the same
as this year and $52 million below Clinton's request.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested at Congress Hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man carrying an Australian passport was
arrested Wednesday after he smashed two glass bottles during a
House hearing on China trade and threatened to kill himself if he
was not heard.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Capitol Police spokesman Lt. Dan Nichols said one police
officer suffered a superficial cut on the wrist when he and an
Agriculture Department special agent subdued the man, identified as
Daniel Chagashvili, 49.
</P>
<P>
   He said Chagashvili was a native of the Republic of Georgia and
a naturalized Australian citizen who has been living in the
Brooklyn borough of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said Chagashvili would be arraigned as early as Thursday
in U.S. District Court on charges of assaulting a federal police
officer and disrupting the official business of Congress, both
federal offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman was testifying at the time on
the effects of U.S.-China trade on agriculture. Commerce Secretary
William Daley and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
were also present at the packed hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Baca, D-Calif., who was attending the hearing, said the
man, after smashing the large bottles, raised one to his head and
said he would kill himself if he was not heard. Baca said the two
security officers reacted immediately, wrestling him to the ground
before he could approach any of the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Baca said that after his initial comment the man spoke in a
language Baca did not understand.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D., said he also grabbed the man from
behind and the man fell on top of him before the security officers
pushed him into the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said it appeared the man was carrying soft drink
bottles. He said the contents were checked for chemical or
biological materials, but the tests were negative.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing stopped with the incident, but resumed in the
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 166; Nasdaq Off 72  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors resumed a cautious stance today,
sending stocks lower as they determined that the interest rate
increase implemented by the Federal Reserve on yesterday may indeed
threaten stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 166.03 to close at
10,769.74.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower, although their losses
were more modest. The Nasdaq composite index fell 72.68 to
3,644.89.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 18.25 to 1,447.79.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,908 down, 1,015 up and 483
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 813.68 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
945.94 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.32 to 499.66.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness on Wall Street didn't surprise analysts, who
believed stocks were due to falter as investors tried to capture
gains from a four-day rally that extended through Tuesday, when the
Fed, as expected, raised interest rates a half-percentage point --
its steepest increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, raising
borrowing costs and cutting into bottom-line profits. Investors had
bid stocks higher on the hope that Tuesday's increase could be the
last for a while, but with many economists predicting still higher
rates later this year, many investors lost their nerve today,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is supposed to have a difficult time when the Fed
is raising rates,'' said Robert Streed, senior investment counselor
at Northern Trust in Chicago. ''The old adage says 'Don't fight the
Fed,' and I think people forgot that for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have, in fact, suffered while the Fed has been raising
rates in an attempt to slow the economy's growth to a more
sustainable pace. Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS
Warburg in New York, pointed out that in the 11 volatile months
since the Fed began raising rates, the Dow has declined about 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which had a history-making surge in late 1999 and
early 2000, is up about 35 percent since June 1999. But the index
has tumbled dramatically from its all-time high of 5,048.62, set
March 10, and a large number of stocks in the index are down for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Dudack said the Dow's performance is more typical during a time
of escalating rates, and the Nasdaq's recent slump may be bringing
it in line with historical measures. Further rate increases will
only worsen the damage, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the accumulation of rate hikes that truly hampers stock
market performance over time,'' Dudack said, adding that she
expects the market to dip further in May and June before rallying
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, the top-performing Dow component on Tuesday,
fell sharply today. After the close of trading Tuesday, the company
reported second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street analysts'
expectations. But testy investors may have been expecting
Hewlett-Packard to more dramatically exceed published estimates,
analysts said. Others suggested that the company may be growing
dependent on lower margin areas such as personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, the testing and measuring equipment maker that was spun
off from Hewlett-Packard, also fell after releasing its earnings
report, which revealed weakness in health-care products and
chemical-analysis equipment divisions.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell after Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack Grubman said
he expects the company to earn $2.55 per share in 2001, instead of
his previous estimate of $2.75. Grubman said AT&AMP;T is facing higher
sales, general and administrative costs.

<HEADLINE> Nancy Reagan Endorses G.W. Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Former first lady Nancy Reagan endorsed
George W. Bush for president Wednesday, calling him ''a candidate
Ronnie would be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reagan said Bush, whose father was Ronald Reagan's vice
president, ''is doing a fine job carrying on Ronnie's legacy,''
according to an announcement by the Bush campaign. Using one of her
husband's famous phrases, she said the younger Bush ''will help
America once more become a 'shining city on a hill.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate, speaking with reporters after a speech
in Everett, Wash., said he was honored by the former first lady's
comments because ''one of the things the president did was lift the
spirits of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''I think it helps. Of course, the Reagans hold a
place of honor in a lot of people's hearts and minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The 89-year-old former president, suffering from Alzheimer's
disease, no longer appears in public.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1996 Republican National Convention in San Diego, Mrs.
Reagan hushed the crowd with an emotional tribute to her ailing
husband. A Bush spokeswoman said Wednesday that a role for Mrs.
Reagan at this year's convention in Philadelphia ''has not been
discussed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we are thrilled to have Mrs. Reagan's support and
hope she will join us at the convention,'' spokeswoman Karen Hughes
said. ''But we are not sure what role, if any, she will play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he last spoke to Mrs. Reagan when he telephoned
recently while traveling in California.

<HEADLINE> Eurotunnel Probe Continues  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Eurotunnel on Wednesday rejected accusations that
its executives acted dishonestly or published false information, as
shareholders assailed the company's directors for its poor
performance and dismal share price.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglo-French company, which operates the rail tunnel beneath
the English Channel, insists it's on the track to recovery and
expects to break even by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in France are currently investigating allegations
made by French investors who suffered heavy losses on their shares
in the company. The probe focuses on six current or former top
executives and four bankers and members of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Eurotunnel board said it ''totally rejects'' the allegations
against these executives, calling them ''multiple errors of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judicial inquiry is just the latest blow to
Eurotunnel since it began digging the ''Chunnel'' in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Cost overruns and delays plagued work on the tunnel, and last
year's ban on sales of duty-free goods inside the European Union
bit deep into revenues. The company is laboring to staunch its
losses, and its share price has hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Eurotunnel shares debuted in 1987 at 3.50 pounds each and soared
to more than 12 pounds in mid-1989. But they plunged as the
company's financial problems mounted. Shares finished trading
Wednesday at 67 pence ($1.01), down 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Several people at Eurotunnel's annual shareholder meeting blamed
the board for failing to revive the share price.
</P>
<P>
   ''You keep talking about the good work you do. ... All I see is
you keep improving your remuneration,'' said Serge Caron, a
shareholder from Dunkirk, France. Caron wore a white T-shirt with
the French words for ''Despoiled by Eurotunnel'' emblazoned on its
front.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Patrick Ponsolle said he shared shareholders'
disappointment. He and other members of the board tried,
unsuccessfully, to deflect such criticism by pointing to recent
improvements in the company's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Directors noted that operating profit for 1999 was higher than
the year before, in spite of the ban on duty-free sales. Passenger
and freight traffic also increased during the first quarter of
2000, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are, God willing, in sight of a complete turnaround,''
deputy chairman Charles Mackay said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ponsolle acknowledged that the judicial inquiry
threatens to undermine the incipient recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problems prevailing now will certainly impede
improvements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry follows complaints in 1994 and 1997 from two groups
representing Eurotunnel's small shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier complaint accuses bankers of using insider
information to profit from share dealings at the expense of small
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The later complaint alleges that Eurotunnel executives
themselves misinformed shareholders by publishing overly optimistic
forecasts about the company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Board members acknowledged that the forecasts proved to be
unrealistic but denied they had misled investors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel guilty,'' Ponsolle said. ''I made a mistake in
perfectly good faith.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson Set for Sierra Leone Trip  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
welcomed the arrest of rebel leader Foday Sankoh of Sierra Leone,
civil rights activist Jesse Jackson was planning to depart
Wednesday on a five-nation West Africa tour to promote peace in
that country.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, head of the Revolutionary United Front, is held
responsible for sabotaging a 10-month old peace agreement, and
Albright hailed his arrest as good news. Sankoh was seized by
pro-government troops in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, the administration's special envoy to Africa, scheduled
a late afternoon departure for Nigeria, which is weighing the
possibility of deploying military units in Sierra Leone to
supplement U.N. peacekeepers already there.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Jackson will visit Liberia, Mali, Guinea and Sierra
Leone, security conditions permitting, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is departing on his mission a day late. For unexplained
reasons, the chronology of the countries he will visit changed
substantially overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Jackson's mission is to consult with regional
governments on ways the United States can support their efforts to
solve the Sierra Leone crisis and to bring about the release of
U.N. peacekeepers, who are being detained by Sankoh's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Albright visited Sierra Leone last October and met with Sankoh,
imploring him to abide by the July peace agreement, which was
designed to end long years of fighting that had catastrophic
consequences for the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Sierra Leone deteriorated rapidly after a
Nigerian-led intervention force departed the country almost three
weeks ago. Sankoh's forces took 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage,
about a third of whom have been released.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has shown little inclination to
become involved in the situation, declining to go beyond an offer
of airlift and logistics in support of an expanding U.N. deployment
of peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue of what happens next for Foday Sankoh and the peace
process is really in the hands of the people and the government of
Sierra Leone,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration seems to have a mixed view on Sankoh. On
Monday, Boucher said Sankoh has a ''chance to play a positive
role'' in resurrecting the peace agreement that he signed almost a
year ago and then violated.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the administration had said that Sankoh, by his
actions, may well have forfeited his right to the amnesty he and
his forces were granted as part of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International USA, meanwhile, expressed grave concern
that Sankoh won't be brought to justice despite continuing human
rights violations by his forces.
</P>
<P>
   The group said the violations are ''serious breaches of
international humanitarian law and possible crimes against
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   It also said that Jackson, during his West Africa mission,
should ''oppose the granting of renewed impunity to the
perpetrators of atrocities and human rights abuses''

<HEADLINE> FBI Releases Files on Puerto Ricans  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI director released decades-old
surveillance files on suspected Puerto Rican independence leaders
to a New York congressman on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Director Louis Freeh also pledged increased cooperation in
releasing additional files, Democratic Rep. Jose Serrano said after
he and lawmakers from Puerto Rico's Senate met with the FBI leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting for me was historic, dramatic and important
because I saw from the director a desire to deal with this ugly
part of our history,'' said Serrano, who was born in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI only recently acknowledged that it played a role in
police surveillance in Puerto Rico that produced more than 135,000
secret dossiers spanning more than three decades. FBI officials did
not immediately return a phone call Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the files released dated back to the 1930s. A batch of
documents had been released in the 1970s and 1980s, but much of the
information in them was deemed classified and blacked out. Serrano
said Freeh had assured him that the newly-released files would
contain ''99 percent less blackouts.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the dossiers contained in the four boxes released
Wednesday was that of Pedro Albizu Campos, leader of the Puerto
Rican independence movement. Campos was jailed several times,
including a 1954 arrest after four of his followers opened fire
inside the U.S. House of Representatives, wounding five lawmakers.
He died in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The recent decision to dedicate New York City's Puerto Rican Day
Parade next month to Campos has drawn fire from some circles.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what if any new information the files would
contain. Serrano said a review would take time.
</P>
<P>
   Police began collecting information on suspected independence
advocates as Puerto Rico moved toward its current commonwealth
arrangement with the United States. The government passed the
so-called Gag Law in the 1948, which made it illegal to show the
Puerto Rican flag, sing nationalist songs or hold ''seditious''
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The files, some released in 1989 when the practice was declared
unconstitutional, carried detailed notes and even photographs
tracking people's jobs, lives, family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   In December, after 10 years of legal battles, Puerto Rico's
government apologized and offered $5.7 million to compensate those
who were under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand for the meeting Wednesday was Charlie Rodriquez,
president of the Senate of Puerto Rico, as well as Sens. Manuel
Rodriguez-Orellana and Eduardo Bhatia-Gautier.

rates later this year, many investors lost their nerve today,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is supposed to have a difficult time when the Fed
is raising rates,'' said Robert Streed, senior investment counselor
at Northern Trust in Chicago. ''The old adage says 'Don't fight the
Fed,' and I think people forgot that for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have, in fact, suffered while the Fed has been raising
rates in an attempt to slow the economy's growth to a more
sustainable pace. Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS
Warburg in New York, pointed out that in the 11 volatile months
since the Fed began raising rates, the Dow has declined about 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which had a history-making surge in late 1999 and
early 2000, is up about 35 percent since June 1999. But the index
has tumbled dramatically from its all-time high of 5,048.62, set
March 10, and a large number of stocks in the index are down for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Dudack said the Dow's performance is more typical during a time
of escalating rates, and the Nasdaq's recent slump may be bringing
it in line with historical measures. Further rate increases will
only worsen the damage, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the accumulation of rate hikes that truly hampers stock
market performance over time,'' Dudack said, adding that she
expects the market to dip further in May and June before rallying
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, the top-performing Dow component on Tuesday,
fell sharply today. After the close of trading Tuesday, the company
reported second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street analysts'
expectations. But testy investors may have been expecting
Hewlett-Packard to more dramatically exceed published estimates,
analysts said. Others suggested that the company may be growing
dependent on lower margin areas such as personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, the testing and measuring equipment maker that was spun
off from Hewlett-Packard, also fell after releasing its earnings
report, which revealed weakness in health-care products and
chemical-analysis equipment divisions.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell after Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jack Grubman said
he expects the company to earn $2.55 per share in 2001, instead of
his previous estimate of $2.75. Grubman said AT&AMP;T is facing higher
sales, general and administrative costs.

<HEADLINE> Babbitt to Explain N.M. Fire Rage  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt could
face the white-hot anger of Los Alamos' residents when he visits on
Thursday to explain how a government-ordered brush-clearing fire
raged out of control and destroyed their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I think about it, I get very angry. It's ludicrous. There's
no reason any of us should have lost our homes under these
circumstances,'' said Tory Temple, 24, whose parents lost their
home.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt is expected to release a preliminary report on what went
wrong with a fire that was set May 4 by the National Park Service
to clear out 968 acres of brush in the wilderness. The fire raged
out of control and burned nearly 47,000 acres, leaving 405 families
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Weaver, the park superintendent who took responsibility for
igniting the blaze, has been placed on leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping that if he's guilty, we can get something back.
Everything we owned is gone,'' said Tracie Korth, 29, who is
expecting twins in August. She and her husband lost their rented
home and had no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, nearly 1,300 firefighters battled the blaze
outside of town. Shifting winds pushed the flames toward
already-charred land, giving firefighters a boost. By midday,
officials said fire lines had been built around 45 percent of the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that we are very secure right here in Los Alamos,''
Forest Service spokesman Jim Paxon said.
</P>
<P>
   He said close to 1,000 acres have burned on the Baca Ranch, a
majestic 95,000-acre volcanic area being purchased by the Forest
Service for recreation, such as fishing and hiking.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, families escorted by National Guardsmen making quick
trips into Los Alamos to gather valuables, pets and other
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Sandoval, a cardiologist, brought his wife, Mary,
and their six children home for a 30-minute frenzy of packing. Tops
on the list: school books and two parakeets.
</P>
<P>
   Their wood-and-stucco home escaped damage, but around the
corner, a neighbor's house was burned to the foundation. And a home
nearby that the Sandovals had been remodeling also was destroyed.
The Sandovals had hoped to move in by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It backs up right the forest, and that's why we bought it,''
Mary Sandoval said. ''It was a beautiful location. It had really
nice pine trees in the back yard, and that's probably what did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire threatened the nation's top nuclear weapons laboratory
and destroyed several portable buildings. The lab's main buildings
were spared.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear was whether smoke from the blaze contained
radiation that may have been set free as flames rolled across the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Eugene
Brezany, said a slight boost in background radiation is expected
any time there is a forest fire. Preliminary results released
Wednesday appear to indicate that those increases are being
captured in air samples, Brezany said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was ready to rage at Babbitt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel we should start from here and go forward and not be
laying blame on people,'' said Judy Hutson, 64, who still had no
idea whether her home was still standing. She was denied access to
the area because it had not yet been checked for hazardous waste.

<HEADLINE> Magnetic Pads May Affect Pacemakers  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People with pacemakers or implanted
defibrillators should never use those new magnet-laced mattress
pads touted to ease back pain because the magnets could temporarily
shut off the heart devices, scientists reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Magnets slipped inside shoe insoles, wristbands, back braces and
other gadgets are the newest rage, purported to treat different
aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   Most never get close enough to the heart to affect a pacemaker
patient, said Dr. Thomas Mattioni of the Arizona Heart Institute in
Phoenix, who led the magnet study after some of his own patients
asked if they were safe.
</P>
<P>
   His best advice: keep ''therapeutic magnets'' 6 inches from your
chest if you have a pacemaker or defibrillator. ''You need to stay
that critical distance away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But rolling onto your stomach while sleeping on a magnet-laced
mattress pad could cause the heart devices to switch off
temporarily, concludes Mattioni's study, presented at this week's
North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology meeting.
</P>
<P>
   That could be life-threatening if the patient went into an
irregular heartbeat at the same time, Mattioni said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to mattress pads, it also is possible that a a
magnet-laced neck brace or shoulder wrap could get closer than 6
inches to the chest, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mattioni discovered the magnets are not nearly as powerful as
the claims made by some manufacturers of magnetic strength equal to
an MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, machine.
</P>
<P>
   When Mattioni measured a variety of magnets, he found even the
highest-strength ones were over 10 times weaker than claimed. They
rapidly grew weaker the farther away they are held from people's
skin. Most lost their ability to deactivate a pacemaker when 1 inch
away, and their power completely disappeared 6 inches away.
</P>
<P>
   Over 2 million Americans have pacemakers and 250,000 have
defibrillators to help their hearts beat properly.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people use magnets in hopes of alleviating back
pain or arthritis, even though there is no scientific proof they
work. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association
this spring found no difference between patients using real magnets
and fake ones given as a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Mattioni's study did not examine whether the magnets worked.
Instead, he performed the first known safety tests after some of
his pacemaker patients told him the magnets made them feel better.
</P>
<P>
   No magnets are approved by the Food and Drug Administration,
which worries more about magnet manufacturers making improper
health claims than about their safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the new findings are ''something to be concerned and aware
of,'' said FDA scientist Mitchell Schein, a pacemaker specialist.
''I would advise the patient to consult their physician before
using such a mattress pad.''

<HEADLINE> Student Accused of Lacing Drink  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MICHIGAN CITY, Ind. (AP) -- A high school junior is accused of
trying to poison a teacher who dates her aunt by lacing a soft
drink with copper radiator sealant.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Kniola, 18, was charged Tuesday with criminal
recklessness. If convicted, she could face six months to three
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, earlier this month Kniola had
another student deliver a tainted Dr Pepper to Michigan City High
science teacher David Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The student said she was initially unaware that the beverage
contained poison, but learned later that Kniola had allegedly put
something in it.
</P>
<P>
   Another student had warned Davis of rumors of a poisoning,
however, so Davis saved the soda and contacted police.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, according to court records, Kniola approached
Davis and said she heard he had been sick all night. He told her
she was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suspect's eyes became very large, and she quickly walked
off,'' Davis told police.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also reported receiving a threatening letter and harassing
telephone calls from Kniola for several weeks last fall.

<HEADLINE> Bush Pushes for China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. (AP) -- George W. Bush pushed for normalization of
trade relations with China Wednesday in a rare moment of agreement
with the Clinton administration, winning a warm reception from
Boeing Co. workers whose jobs depend on sales overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate said political differences
should not prevent congressional approval of the agreement. His
Democratic foe, Vice President Al Gore, also endorses the measure,
though it has been strongly opposed by some labor unions that fear
a loss of jobs to overseas competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Key committees in both the House and Senate gave their approval
to the measure Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stakes are high, they're high on all sides,'' Bush said,
speaking to several hundred airplane builders from a platform in
front of an unfinished Korean Air Boeing 777-300. The plane, among
the newest models for the company, is a popular pick for Asian
airlines. On the other side of the factory, customers were touring
a completed Air China 777.
</P>
<P>
   ''For businesses and workers and farmers across our country, it
will mean much lower trade barriers, important opportunities for
U.S. exports and more work and jobs for United States workers. For
the people of East Asia, it will affect their relations with the
region's major power, and for the people of China, it holds out the
hope of more open contact with the world of freedom,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was hampered earlier this year by a strike by its
engineers, members of the Society for Professional Engineering
Employees in Aerospace. Boeing missed at least 15 airplane
deliveries during the walkout in February and March.
</P>
<P>
   While the union has endorsed Gore, the Texas governor said
Tuesday, ''They may be supporting him, but this is not a political
event. ... I want the machinists to understand that opening up
China to trade would be good for their jobs and their job
security.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of Machinists, another union that
has endorsed Gore, praised him for earlier Boeing visits and
criticized the Republican Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find it ironic that George Bush shows up at the Boeing
Everett Plant five months before the election to do a major trade
event. This doesn't mean he understands or has spent any time with
our Boeing workers,'' the machinists' statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's speech was warmly received and he spent over a
half hour afterward shaking workers' hands. One, Thomas Mariano, a
30-year-old fuel tank inspector, said he appreciated Bush's focus
on job creation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would think that either of the candidates, if they're for
working families, I think that would be the best benefit for most
folks,'' Mariano said.
</P>
<P>
   The China bill would end the annual practice of renewing China's
trade status and would grant Beijing the same normal trade
relations that the United States extends routinely to nearly every
other nation in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would ease China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   With unions generally opposed to the measure, Gore had remained
mostly quiet on the issue until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, standing with former Presidents Ford and
Carter at the White House, Gore declared: ''It is right for
American jobs. It is right for the cause of reform in China and I
believe it will move us closer to the strong and stable world
community that we all seek to create.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in a swipe at Gore, said, ''This will be amongst the most
serious decisions our government will make this year, and no one
who is serious about shouldering the responsibilities of the
presidency should be silent on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush highlighted what he said would be the agreement's economic
benefits. Boeing, for example, projects China to be its largest
market over the next 20 years, and China must cut industrial
tariffs and allow more imports of wheat, corn and other
agricultural products, perhaps creating new markets for U.S.
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also argued that the benefits would be more than
economic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Economic freedom creates habits of liberty, and habits of
liberty create expectations of democracy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> House Panel: Repeal Telephone Tax  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal tax on telephone service originally
imposed to pay for the Spanish-American War would be repealed over
three years under legislation approved unanimously Wednesday by the
House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bipartisan support for the bill, which the full House is likely
to pass next week, was tempered by a letter from Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers expressing support for the concept but warning
that its five-year, $20 billion cost must be considered in an
overall budget and spending blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said the only reason the
102-year-old tax has survived so long is that ''it is awfully hard
to stop Washington bureaucrats from taking tax dollars from
hard-working taxpayers,'' even as federal budget surpluses continue
to swell.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will move forward to repeal the Spanish-American War tax
because it is plain common sense,'' Hastert said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the 3 percent tax would be reduced to 2 percent
30 days after it becomes law. It would drop to 1 percent on Oct. 1,
2001, and would be fully repealed on Oct. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The tax has been repealed on two previous occasions but was
brought back in different forms to pay for World War I, World War
II and then increased to help fund the Vietnam War. It was made
permanent in 1990, with the money going into the general treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tax has been on and off again, depending on what war we're
in,'' said Rep. Gerald Kleczka, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite President Clinton's misgivings, repealing the telephone
tax appears to be gaining unstoppable momentum in Congress similar
to unanimous repeal of the Social Security earnings limit passed
earlier this year. Both issues have been around for years but have
never before been moved without unrelated, more controversial
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's appropriate and I hope that it's done soon,''
said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., of the phone tax
repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas, plans to have the panel vote next week on a bill to
gradually repeal the estate tax. The leading version of the bill,
sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., has attracted 237
co-sponsors, including 44 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Death by itself should not trigger a tax,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would be patterned after a provision in last year's
$792 billion tax bill that was vetoed by President Clinton, Dunn
said. To reduce the cost, estate taxes would be reduced gradually
in the first five years and then cut more dramatically in later
years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, including the Clinton administration, frequently
attack estate tax cuts as primarily benefiting the rich, but Dunn
said a coalition including farmers, small business people and
environmental groups concerned about land conservation are
supporting its repeal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hopeful the president will see the value of this and make
it a part of his legacy,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   --------
</P>
<P>
   The phone tax repeal bill is H.R. 3916.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax repeal bill is H.R. 8.

<HEADLINE> Sophia Loren Loses Voting Rights  </HEADLINE>
By PETER W. MAYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Sophia Loren has been cut from a leading roll.
</P>
<P>
   Loren, a symbol of Italian female beauty, was among more than
300,000 names stricken from the voter rolls, local officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Italian lawmakers last week ordered election officials to purge
names of voters who had died, emigrated or otherwise become
ineligible. Officials in the southern town of Pozzuoli near Naples
said they deleted the film star because she has long lived abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Loren's politician-niece, Alessandra Mussolini, insisted her
aunt still spends much of her time in Italy. ''If this could happen
to someone famous like my aunt, imagine all the ordinary citizens
who will lose their right to vote,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mussolini, whose grandfather was fascist dictator Benito
Mussolini, said Wednesday she would boycott a key nationwide
referendum to protest the voting-list cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I already had my doubts about this referendum, but the way the
lists were purged is anti-democratic,'' said Mussolini, a member of
Parliament for the right-wing National Alliance party.
</P>
<P>
   The order came ahead of Sunday's referendum on pivotal election,
justice and labor reforms. Failures of past referendums have been
blamed in part on poorly maintained election lists with dead
voters, making it all but impossible to obtain the necessary votes.
</P>
<P>
   Mussolini's party supports the referendum and the purge of voter
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Mussolini, herself a former actress, is the daughter of
Mussolini's son Romano, a jazz pianist, and Loren's sister, Maria
Scicolone.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: bin Laden in Y2K Plot  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn.(AP) -- President Clinton today accused the
terror network allegedly operated by Saudi fugitive Osama bin Laden
of plotting to harm Americans gathered for millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last December, working with Jordan, we shut down a plan to
place large bombs at locations where Americans might gather for New
Year's Eve,'' Clinton said in commencement remarks to 184 cadets at
the Coast Guard Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned the plot was linked to terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and the organization created by Osama bin Laden, the
man responsible for the 1998 bombings at our embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya, which cost the lives of Americans and hundreds of
Africans,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the plan was uncovered, a Customs agent in Seattle
discovered bombmaking materials being smuggled into the United
States, Clinton said, ''the same material used by bin Laden in
other places.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the president's most extensive discussion of bin Laden's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi exile believed to be in Afghanistan, is among
17 people charged in a federal indictment with conspiracy to kill
Americans in the embassy bombing cases. Six are in custody in the
United States and three overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In the alleged bomb smuggling, Ahmed Ressam, 32, was arrested
Dec. 14 after driving his rented car off a ferry from Victoria,
British Columbia at Port Angeles, Wash. Prosecutors allege Ressam
was at the center of a plot, involving a handful of other Algerian
nationals in New York and Canada, to bomb buildings or other
targets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam has pleaded innocent to nine charges, including
possessing and transporting explosives with the intent to cause
damage or injury. His trial has been moved to Los Angeles because
of intense media coverage and is scheduled to begin July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Ghani Meskini, 31, has been held without bail since his
December arrest as an alleged accomplice in Brooklyn, N.Y. Meskini
has been charged with providing and concealing support for Ressam.
Another alleged accomplice, Mokhtar Haouari, 31, remains in
Montreal as the United States seeks to extradite him to be tried in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other arrests have been made in the case, and one man believed
to have stayed with Ressam in a Vancouver, British Columbia motel
in the weeks before the alleged smuggling attempt remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was making the point that the new Coast Guard graduates
will face a range of threats to America's security, from terrorism
to smuggling to the spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today and for the forseeable tomorrows we and especially you
will face a fateful struggle between forces of integration and
harmony and the forces of disintegration and chaos,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technology can be a servant of either side, or, ironically,
both,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By tradition, the president speaks at graduation ceremonies for
one of the four service academies each year. He last spoke to Coast
Guard cadets in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton spoke, each cadet was presented with a bachelor of
science degree and a commission as an ensign. Ensigns begin their a
five-year service obligation with a tour of duty aboard a Coast
Guard cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited the ''Love Bug'' computer virus as powerful proof
of the new kinds of threats to American security in an increasingly
smaller, faster and more computerized world, the White House says.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that the virus, which spread by electronic mail,
disabled computers worldwide earlier this month and did millions of
dollars in damage.

<HEADLINE> Violence Erupts in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Rival party supporters clashed in
western Harare, leaving one person dead and 18 injured, police said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the violence Tuesday night started when about 15
youths attacked Takudzwa Chipunza, who was believed to have been a
supporter of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change party,
police spokeswoman Tendai Nembire said.
</P>
<P>
   Chipunza died Wednesday at a Harare hospital from head injuries
suffered in the attack, bringing to 20 the number of people killed
in political violence since February.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight clashes occurred in the Budiriro township in
western Harare. Four of the injured were in serious condition,
Nembire said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of those injured said they belonged to President Robert
Mugabe's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Some clashes took place outside the office of Chenjerai Hunzvi,
a doctor who leads a militant group of pro-Mugabe liberation war
veterans that led to independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Fire bombs were hurled into two homes, gutting them. Opposition
supporters smashed the windows of Hunzvi's offices, claiming that
veterans had dragged their colleagues into the clinic last week and
beaten and tortured them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, the opposition group denounced Mugabe's call
for parliamentary elections to be held on June 24-25 as a violation
of electoral procedures, and opposition lawyers prepared for a
court action that could force a postponement.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party says the government failed to release voter
lists and voting boundaries within the time frame that electoral
law demands. It planned to ask the High Court for the immediate
release of the information, and to argue that the government was
trying to thwart opposition preparations for polling, the party's
legal adviser David Coltart said.
</P>
<P>
   The elections pose the greatest threat to Mugabe's power since
1980, when he led this former British colony in southeast Africa to
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe says candidates must be nominated by May 29. But Coltart
said that, under electoral law, the voting lists and boundaries
must be made public 14 days ahead of the nomination deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without the information required, it will be virtually
impossible to nominate 120 candidates by month end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coltart said the opposition party's court application, expected
to be filed Thursday, would likely delay elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are as reluctant as anyone to see further delays, but we
have no option but to lodge this application. The government has
acted unconstitutionally and in breach of electoral law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's opponents say he has encouraged the often-violent
occupations of more than 1,200 white-owned farms to punish white
farmers and their workers for supporting the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Prepare Ad Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee is
preparing to launch a multimillion dollar ad campaign designed to
bolster Al Gore's presidential campaign by introducing his
biography to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The ad blitz, engineered by the vice president's political team,
could begin as early as this month and end at the presidential
convention this summer, costing upwards of $10 million, according
to Democratic officials in Washington who cautioned that the
details were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Democrat said the campaign would cost between $10
million and $20 million, though others said much of the money has
yet to be raised and a budget has not been finalized. A late-May
start-up is possible, officials said, but June is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   The officials spoke on condition that they not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, are already accusing Gore of violating a
pledge to forsake unregulated, unlimited expenditures in the
presidential campaign. Gore challenged the Republican Party and
presumptive nominee George W. Bush to mutually disarm their
so-called ''soft money'' ad arsenals, but the offer was rejected
and no deal was struck.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC ads, which are still being tested in focus groups, will
be funded with a mix of ''hard money'' -- limited, regulated
donations -- and the so-called ''soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were described by several party officials as a
discussion of Democratic issues that give way to biographical
material about Gore. Other Democratic candidates would
theoretically benefit from the DNC expenditure, though Gore would
be the primary benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   There was little chance that the first batch of ads would
criticize Bush, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers envision airing several different spots, placed
strategically in key media markets based on polling data that shows
what issues play well in various battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the outlines of the ad campaign were reviewed by
Gore's team last week. Senior officials asked for more data and
scheduled a meeting Thursday at Gore's campaign headquarters here.
The ad campaign will be discussed, but not necessarily finalized,
at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Since the vice president issued the challenge on the night he
and Bush secured their party's nominations, independent
Republican-allied groups have run issue ads paid with ''soft
money.'' Officials at the Republican National Committee itself say
they have not run ''soft money'' ads and have no control over
independent groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''If (Democrats) are looking for a loophole, they can find one.
We always knew that. In 1996 they ran an illegal campaign. This
year, they're running an unethical campaign,'' said RNC spokesman
Cliff May, who noted that Democratic-allied independent groups have
aired issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   DNC spokeswoman Jenny Backus said two GOP-allied interest groups
ran about $1.5 million in ads criticizing Gore shortly after the
vice president issued the challenge. ''They've violated (the
challenge) in both words and deeds right after it went out,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats privately concede they were looking for an excuse to
spend their ''soft money'' accounts to improve Gore's political
standing.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president narrowly trails Bush in national polls and is
not faring well in several traditionally Democratic states. His
advisers are more troubled by underlying poll results that show
Gore trailing Bush among key demographic groups; voters also
consider Bush to be a better leader.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's advisers say his fortunes will improve as
Americans learn more about him.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a similar situation in the primary race against former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, the vice president aired biography
ads and started talking more about his background in public -- the
achievements of his father, former Sen. Al Gore Sr, and mother, a
groundbreaking law student; his service in the Vietnam War; his
stint as an investigative journalist and his experience in the
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's top advisers said there was debate within the campaign
almost immediately about whether challenging Bush was a good idea,
given the Democrats' reliance on ''soft money'' to close the
fund-raising gap against the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not accept federal matching money, thus is not bound by
spending limits. Gore is subject to the limits.
</P>
<P>
   Top Gore advisers such as Bill Knapp work both for the DNC and
the vice president's campaign, making it possible to navigate the
loosely regulated guidelines regarding coordination between party's
and campaigns.

<HEADLINE> Gold at 7-Mo. Low As Dollar Gains  </HEADLINE>
By HERBERT G. McCANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gold futures prices fell to a 7-month low Wednesday as the
dollar grew in strength against most major currencies in the wake
of the Federal Reserve's half percentage point increase in the
short-term borrowing rate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the firmer dollar, gold was weakened by the
negative sentiment in the market over the upcoming auction of gold
bullion by the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
   On other markets, energy prices were mixed, and grain and
soybean futures prices were mostly lower.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in interest rates is an indication the Federal Reserve
is combating inflation, which makes the dollar strong and weakens
gold's appeal, according to analyst James Steel of Refco Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A strong dollar makes gold more expensive in non-dollar
economies, which is most of the world, driving demand lower because
those buying in rupees or yen will have to pay more because the
metal is sold in U.S. denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to gold's selloff on the New York Mercantile Exchange is
the planned auction on Tuesday of 25 metric tons of gold by the
Bank of England. Because prices tend to weaken in the days leading
up to a gold auction and strengthen afterward, investors bailed out
the market, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The stronger dollar also weighed on silver prices, with the
weakness of gold also pushing silver futures lower.
</P>
<P>
   Gold for June delivery was $2.40 lower at $273.80 a troy ounce;
June silver was 10.5 cent lower at $5.016 a troy ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's inventory report from the U.S. Department of Energy
sent crude oil futures prices lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department reported crude inventories rose 200,000
barrels last week, while gasoline stocks rose 1.7 million barrels
and distillates rose 300,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The figures contradicted data released Tuesday by the American
Petroleum Institute, which reported crude oil stocks fell 2.234
million barrels, while gasoline rose 629,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Natural gas futures prices rose 6.5 percent to reach a new,
three-year high as the market reacted to low storage inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The American Gas Association reported an injection of 46 billion
cubic feet last week, while the five-year average for the period is
71 billion cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   June light sweet crude was 41 cents lower at $29.32 a barrel;
June heating oil was .52 cent higher at 77.36 cents a gallon; June
unleaded gasoline was .33 cent lower at 97.98 cents a gallon; June
natural gas was 24.1 cents higher at $3.689 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Weather concerns sent soybean futures prices tumbling, while
grain futures prices were mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Corn futures prices, after falling at the start of trading,
ended the day unchanged, with the market having already factored in
forecasts of rain in the Midwest crop-growing area, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   This week's rain and last week's precipitation has replenished
the top soil, which will allow the corn crop -- which is more than
90 percent planted -- to get off to a good start, according to
analyst Tim Hannagan of Alaron Trading Corp. The market is now
looking at long-term weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has already
indicated that in the long term, conditions in the Midwest will be
drier and hotter than normal, which does not bode well for the corn
crop, Hannagan said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service 30- and 60-day forecast, expected
this week, will be looked at closely by traders to confirm those
fears, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean futures prices fell in league with soybeans, although
the precipitation is not expected to affect the soybean crop, with
is about 55 percent planted, Hannagan said, adding the weather will
become a more important factor in crop development later in the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Precipitation in the hard red winter wheat belt this week eased
quality concerns in the market. The approach of the June wheat
harvest also weighed on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery was 4\ cents lower at $2.77 a bushel;
July corn was unchanged at $2.35{ a bushel; July oats were
unchanged at $1.19 a bushel; July soybeans were 2{ cents lower at
$5.41\ a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Ups Counterterrorism Effort  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- Warning of threats ranging from
computer viruses to alleged plots of Saudi fugitive Osama bin
Laden, President Clinton ordered tighter surveillance along the
U.S-Canadian border Wednesday as part of a $300 million expansion
of the nation's counterterrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The money is in addition to the $9 billion that the United
States already spends in a year for anti-terrorism, the president
said. ''It sounds like a lot of money,'' Clinton said. ''When you
see the evidence of what we're up against, I think you will support
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke at the commencement exercises of the U.S.
Coast Guard Academy, addressing about 5,000 people outdoors under
sunny skies at Cadet Memorial Field. Gusts of wind blowing off the
Thames River almost blew away the president's notes as he presented
degrees to 184 newly commissioned ensigns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the very openness of America's borders and
technology ''makes us vulnerable in new ways.'' He cited the Love
Bug virus that spread from the Philippines through millions of
computers worldwide, causing billions of dollars of damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central reality of our time,'' he said, ''is that the
advent of globalization and the revolution in information
technology have magnified both the creative and the destructive
potential of every individual, tribe and nation on our planet.''
The world also faces threats such as AIDS and other diseases, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new anti-terrorism measures will include installation of
high resolution day and night camera technology on the
U.S.-Canadian border, along with other secure communication and
advanced monitoring equipment, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures include:
</P>
<P>
   --Increasing the number of Justice Department prosecutors and
legal staff to support the prosecution of terrorists. Fifteen
positions will be added.
</P>
<P>
   --Expanding from 26 to 37 the number of Joint Terrorism Task
Forces, which combine the assets of the FBI, Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the Customs Service, Secret Service and
state and local law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   --Strengthening the immigration service's forensic capabilities
to detect fraudulent travel documents.
</P>
<P>
   --Intensifying efforts to track and analyze the financing of
terrorist organizations and expanding the Treasury Department's
office of foreign asset control.
</P>
<P>
   ''In responding to terrorist threats,'' Clinton told the academy
graduates, ''our own strategy should be identical to your motto:
semper paratus. Always ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's ambassador to the United States, Marwan Muasher, was on
hand to swear in a Jordanian cadet, Nour Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took the occasion to thank Jordan for its help in
quashing ''a plot to place large bombs at locations where Americans
might gather on New Year's Eve'' as the world welcomed the
millennium, recounting incidents that received worldwide attention
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned the plot was linked to terrorist camps in
Afghanistan and the organization created by Osama bin Laden, the
man responsible for the 1998 bombings at our embassies in Tanzania
and Kenya, which cost the lives of Americans and hundreds of
Africans,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the plan was uncovered, Clinton recalled, a
Customs agent in Seattle found bomb-making materials being smuggled
into the United States, ''the same material used by bin Laden in
other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, a Saudi exile believed to be in Afghanistan, is among
17 people charged in a federal indictment with conspiracy to kill
Americans in the embassy bombing cases. Six are in custody in the
United States and three overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In the alleged bomb smuggling, Ahmed Ressam, 32, was arrested
Dec. 14 after driving his rented car off a ferry from Victoria,
British Columbia, at Port Angeles, Wash. Prosecutors allege Ressam
was at the center of a plot, involving a handful of other Algerian
nationals in New York and Canada, to set off bombs in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam has pleaded innocent to nine charges, including
possessing and transporting explosives with the intent to cause
damage or injury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at the academy under a tradition that the
commander in chief delivers the commencement speech at one of the
military service academies each year. Clinton said it was a
nostalgic occasion since the Coast Guard address was the last he
would give in his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Clinton played golf at Stanwich Club, a
private club in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   He also was to speak at a Democratic National Committee
fund-raiser in Greenwich expected to raise $500,000.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rules on Tobacco Case Proof  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cigarette makers cannot tell a jury considering
punitive damages for sick Florida smokers that the $250 billion
they agreed to pay to states was sufficient punishment, a judge
ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You didn't get punished by any other case. You capitulated,
and that's another matter,'' Judge Robert Kaye said. ''You were not
forced by court action in the law to pay against your will.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury already has ruled the industry conspired to produce a
deadly product and awarded $12.7 million in damages to three
smokers serving as representatives of an estimated 500,000 smokers
covered by the class-action suit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the jury must decide whether to award punitive damages in
order to punish the companies for their conduct.
</P>
<P>
   During this phase, the tobacco industry can tell jurors what
they owe under the settlements as a cost of doing business. But
Kaye said: ''You cannot argue, 'Please don't punish us any more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kaye also excluded testimony about the industry's charitable
contributions, community projects and diversity programs. But he
will allow testimony from employees to back up claims by executives
that the industry has changed, as the public's attitude toward
smoking has changed.
</P>
<P>
   The punitive phase could last up to two months.

<HEADLINE> Abortion-Rights Group Speaks Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- An abortion-rights group defended itself against a
denunciation by the U.S. bishops conference this week, saying it
was being targeted for its effectiveness in presenting the views of
dissenting Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based National Conference of Catholic Bishops
issued a strongly worded statement Wednesday calling Catholics for
a Free Choice an ''arm of the abortion lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   It accused the U.S.-based group of trying to silence the
Vatican's ''moral voice'' by campaigning to have the Holy See's
permanent observer status at the United Nations lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics for a Free Choice in turn accused the bishops'
conference of misrepresenting the group's views and trying to
demonize its leaders, while bishops refuse to meet with the group's
directors to talk issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take small comfort in the belief that these attacks occur
because our organization is effective in presenting the views of
many of the world's Catholics,'' the group's president, Frances
Kissling, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of Catholics remain faithful while opposing the
Roman Catholic Church's official positions on family planning,
divorce and homosexuality, Kissling said.
</P>
<P>
   The group also repudiated the bishops' conference charge of
anti-Catholicism, saying it was an accusation often used to
''silence much-needed criticism of public policies espoused by the
church.''

<HEADLINE> Kasyanov Turns To Reviving Economy  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Lawmakers swiftly approved a tough, polished
economist as Russia's new prime minister on Wednesday, backing
President Vladimir Putin's plan for modest market reforms that
emphasize gradual growth over radical upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   The vote endorsing Mikhail Kasyanov came after a short and
cautious speech in which he said the best way to get the economy
moving is to cut taxes and clean up corruption while making sure
impoverished Russians aren't overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say Putin will concentrate on strengthening the state
and leave Kasyanov to focus on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin will not have the time to deeply get into economic
problems,'' said Andrei Ryabov, an analyst with the Carnegie
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   How much Kasyanov will attain isn't clear. His political
experience is limited, and Russia's problems are immense: poverty,
crime, plummeting public health, unemployment, ineffective laws.
Analysts say Kasyanov is likely to focus more on day-to-day
economic projects than structural reform.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov enjoys broad political support: In Wednesday's vote in
the lower house of parliament, the State Duma, 325 lawmakers voted
for him, well above the 226 needed. Fifty-five opposed Kasyanov and
15 abstained.
</P>
<P>
   The vote contrasted with the emotional, protracted squabbling
between the Duma and former President Boris Yeltsin, and
demonstrated how strong Putin has become.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now have the conditions for successful development under
conditions of political stability,'' Kasyanov told legislators.
''It doesn't make sense to carry out reforms without public
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers grumbled about approving Kasyanov before Putin
makes his economic plans known. They worried that Kasyanov was
linked to powerful businessmen and political insiders who played a
prominent role under Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a difficult situation, having to approve a prime
minister but unaware of what program his Cabinet is going to
implement,'' said Nikolai Kharitonov, leader of the Agrarian
faction. ''There are many questions about how close (Kasyanov) is
connected to the former president's 'family.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the vote, Kasyanov went to the Kremlin to discuss
the government's plans with Putin. They agreed to restructure the
Cabinet, reducing the number of ministries and cutting some
government personnel, Kasyanov said later.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is struggling to shed the failed Soviet system of central
planning and the flawed market reforms of the past decade, when
corruption and insider dealing often derailed efforts to build a
market economy. Still, much of the economy has been privatized -- an
estimated 70 percent of the country's workers are employed in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has grown slightly in recent months thanks mostly to
high world prices for oil and other commodities, but is
structurally unsound. The tax system is confusing, investors have
few rights, and there is deep resistance to allowing individuals to
own land. Russia's legal system barely works and graft flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov called for reducing taxes, saying private businesses
must allowed to thrive and that the country's bad banks must be
weeded out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The removal of obstacles hampering free initiative immediately
brings fruit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect immediate or drastic changes from the 42-year-old
Kasyanov, who is seen as a methodical technocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Kasyanov's main jobs will be sustaining minimal
economic growth and making sure tasks like the payment of pensions
and wages go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   He will also likely seek a way to alleviate Russia's huge
foreign debt and re-establish relations with foreign lenders
destroyed by a 1998 financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who easily won election on March 26, moved last week to
wrest some control of Russia's unruly regions away from influential
governors. He followed that with a proposal Wednesday to remove the
governors from the upper house of parliament.

<HEADLINE> Reno: Renew Women-Violence Law  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The rate at which American women are attacked
or threatened by loved ones dropped 21 percent in the mid-1990s,
Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday while calling for the
renewal of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act's programs and
funding.
</P>
<P>
   This comes after the Supreme Court on Monday struck down a key
provision of the law that let rape victims sue their attackers in
federal court. Reno called that ''deeply disappointing'' and called
on Congress to act on the renewals before the October deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''Violence still devastates too many lives,'' she said at a news
conference in front of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, ''Intimate Partner Violence,'' the Justice
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics described a widespread
drop in violence among husbands and wives, boyfriends and
girlfriends that mirrors the general decline in serious crimes
nationwide since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The rate at which women were attacked by ''intimate partners'' --
current or former spouses, boyfriends, girlfriends or partners --
dropped 21 percent during the mid-1990s and the number of men
murdered by wives or girlfriends plunged 60 percent from 1976
through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've given wives alternatives to feeling like they have to
pick up a loaded gun to kill their loaded husbands,'' said
Professor James Alan Fox of Northeastern University in Boston.
''Divorce is easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., the sponsor of the 1994
legislation, credited the act for the decrease. Under the law,
states had to honor protective orders issued by other states,
federal funding for shelters more than doubled and new grants were
given to train police and prosecutors, set up special units and
track incidents.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for certain grants, states also had to adopt policies
that encourage police to arrest offenders on a domestic call. In
many states, police now must make an arrest when they go to a
domestic dispute or explain in writing why they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Monday threw out the provision allowing
rape victims to sue their attackers in federal court, saying
Congress wrongly trampled on an area of state authority. The other
provisions were not at issue in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Biden said he could not figure out a way to rewrite the law to
allow rape victims to circumvent the ruling. Asked if there were
any changes that could be made to make federal rape lawsuits legal,
he replied: ''Yes, two new justices.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau report, citing FBI data, showed the number of
intimate partner homicides dropped since 1976 for every race and
gender group except white women. Some details of the report:
</P>
<P>
   --In 1998, 1,320 women were murdered by intimates but only 510
men. In 1976, women had accounted for just over half of the 3,000
men and women killed by intimates.
</P>
<P>
   --For black men, the number murdered by intimates declined by 74
percent from 1976 through 1998.
</P>
<P>
   --For black women, the number murdered by intimates was down 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   --For white men, it declined 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   --Between 1976 and 1993, the number of white women killed by
intimate partners was fairly stable, but such murders dropped by 23
percent between 1993 and 1997. Then in 1998, they shot up 8
percent, leaving the total 3 percent above the 1976 figure.
</P>
<P>
   --Black women were far more likely to report intimate violence to
police than white women -- 67 percent of the time, compared with 50
percent for white women.
</P>
<P>
   --Overall, the percentage of women who reported intimate violence
to police rose from 48 percent in 1993 to 59 percent in 1998. Among
men, 46 percent reported intimate violence to the police, with
next-to-no difference between races.
</P>
<P>
   --Counting both deadly and lesser violence and threats of
violence, attacks on women by intimate partners fell from 1.1
million in 1993 to 876,340 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   --The rate at which men were attacked by wives or girlfriends
remained stable during this period, with 160,000 attacks on men in
both 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   --Two-thirds of all intimate attacks were simple assaults, the
least serious form of violence studied.

<HEADLINE> Two Surrender in Church Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE BRYAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two former Ku Klux Klansmen were
arrested on murder charges Wednesday in the 1963 Birmingham church
bombing that killed four black girls on a Sunday morning -- a crime
that shocked the nation and galvanized the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Blanton Jr. of Birmingham, who is in his early 60s,
and Bobby Frank Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Texas, surrendered on the
state charges and were jailed without bail. If convicted, they
could get life in prison with the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have long suspected that Blanton and Cherry plotted
with former Klansman Robert Edward Chambliss to bomb the Sixteenth
Street Baptist Church. Chambliss was convicted in 1977 and died in
prison in 1985. A fourth suspect, Herman Cash, was never charged;
he, too, is dead.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Doug Jones would not say what led to the break in
the case after 37 years. But over the past year, estranged family
members of Cherry have said publicly that he talked of helping
plant the dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   The blast was one of the most shocking crimes of the civil
rights era and came just months after police in Birmingham used
dogs and firehoses to drive back black marchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 15, 1963, blast demolished an outside wall of the
church and killed four girls who were in a basement restroom,
preparing for a youth program: 11-year-old Denise McNair and three
14-year-olds: Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson and Addie Mae
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment marked the latest in a series of 1960s racial
crimes in the South that are being brought for prosecution decades
later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Byron de la Beckwith was convicted in the 1963
assassination in Jackson, Miss., of NAACP organizer Medgar Evers.
In 1998, former KKK leader Samuel H. Bowers, 73, was found guilty
in the 1966 firebomb death of Mississippi civil rights activist
Vernon Dahmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one should stop until the people who are responsible are
brought to justice,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Cherry for years have denied any role in the
Birmingham bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Johnson, Cherry's lawyer, said his client is in ill
health. ''He wants the world to know his story, and he thinks he'll
be vindicated,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Cherry were charged with eight counts of murder each
-- two counts covering each of the four slain girls. One count was
for intentional murder and the other involved ''universal malice''
because the bomb was placed where it could have killed any number
of people.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the evidence lent itself better to state charges than
to federal ones. He said the capital murder statute on the books in
1963 could not be used because it was replaced in the mid-1970s
after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Wilson, 39, a black man who works for a staffing
services company, said it was unfair that whoever bombed the church
had remained free for decades. ''They should have taken care of
this a long time ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a white resident, Stan Leo, who was 16 when the church was
bombed, questioned the point of pursuing the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry it all happened,'' he said, ''but it needs to be
buried and put aside and let the city go on. Why keep bringing up
the past?''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing shocked and embittered civil rights workers.
Widespread revulsion over the killing of girls at Sunday services
added many moderates -- in Birmingham and elsewhere -- to the civil
rights cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Christopher Hamlin, pastor of the church since 1990,
said there is a ''strong sense of some beginning of a conclusion''
to the bombing. ''The city has come a long way in race relations''
since 1963, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial federal investigation into the bombing resulted in
no charges, though the FBI named the four Ku Klux Klansmen as
suspects. After the probe that led to Chambliss' conviction, the
case was reopened in 1980 and 1988, without additional charges. It
was reopened yet again in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, the bombing was the subject of director Spike
Lee's Oscar-nominated documentary ''4 Little Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a leader of the Birmingham
demonstrations in the 1960s and now a pastor in Cincinnati, said
the charges should have been brought long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FBI, they knew back then what they know now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-congressman says he's seeking GOP Senate nomination  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Ex-congressman Joseph DioGuardi said
Wednesday he is seeking the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate,
whether or not New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani decides to run.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer we sit around waiting, the greater the chance that
(Hillary) Clinton will win by default,'' DioGuardi said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to members of the Republican state committee and a
separate one to Gov. George Pataki, Dioguardi presented his
credentials as an anti-abortion, more-conservative alternative to
Giuliani. He criticized Giuliani for endorsing Democratic Gov.
Mario Cuomo in 1994, the mayor's close ties to state Liberal Party
head Raymond Harding and Giuliani for marching in Manhattan's ''gay
pride'' parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that isn't bad enough, the final insult is that Rudy
Giuliani is losing to Hillary Clinton, and our values are being
bartered not to purchase victory, but defeat,'' DioGuardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls generally show Giuliani and Clinton, formally given the
Democrats' Senate nomination Tuesday, running neck-and-neck.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Allen, a spokesman for state Republican Committee,
downplayed the impact of a DioGuardi candidacy among New York
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know who Joe DioGuardi is,'' Allen said. ''We are
nominating Mayor Giuliani on May 30th (in Buffalo). I don't know
where Joe DioGuardi is coming from and who he is talking to. ... We
plan on nominating him (Giuliani) barring any health considerations
on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi is already seeking the Conservative Party's Senate
nomination -- with the encouragement of Conservative boss Michael
Long -- and the Right-to-Life and Independence party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been pondering whether to stay in the Senate race
in light of his disclosure that he will need to undergo treatment
for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans have expressed an interest in running for the
GOP Senate nomination, including Reps. Rick Lazio and Peter King,
but only if Giuliani decides not to run.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by the mayor is expected any day. The Republicans'
nominating convention is May 30 in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old DioGuardi, of Ossining in Westchester County,
was in Congress from 1985-89.

<HEADLINE> CBS, Pax TV Networks New Schedules  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS is sending Bette Midler in to fight ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and will retool its Friday and Saturday
night lineups in the fall with four new dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Midler's ''The Bette Show'' has the highest profile of the three
new CBS comedies, featuring the singer playing a character
suspiciously like herself. It's scheduled for 8 p.m. on Wednesdays
-- opposite ABC's fourth night of ''Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going into the teeth of it with Bette Midler,'' admitted
CBS President Leslie Moonves on Wednesday. ''We think we will do
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching clips of the upcoming show, advertisers gave it a
rousing ovation on Wednesday. ''I'm really looking forward to it,''
Midler said. ''I think we're going to have a sensational time.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is canceling its long-running medical drama, ''Chicago
Hope.'' Three dramas that were on Fridays or Saturdays -- ''Martial
Law,'' ''Early Edition,'' and ''Now and Again'' -- were also
canceled. The comedy ''Ladies Man'' was left off the schedule but
may make a midseason reappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby is also off CBS's schedule. His ''Cosby'' sitcom has
retired and CBS didn't pick up ''Kids Say the Darndest Things,''
which had the comedian as host.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS schedule contains 12 hour-long dramas, with comedies
featured only on Monday and Wednesday nights. On Fridays, CBS will
air an update of the 1960s action series, ''The Fugitive,'' and a
new drama about a team of forensic investigators in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   With ABC and NBC both turning over Saturday nights to movies,
CBS will bring back ''Walker, Texas Ranger'' and surround it with
two other new dramas. ''That's Life'' is about a New Jersey woman
who goes back to college, and ''The District'' is about a
Washington police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves acknowledged that criticism of the networks for not
having enough minority actors in prime-time played a role in CBS's
renewal of ''City of Angels,'' a medical drama with a primarily
black cast. It will air on Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it wasn't good, it wouldn't have been picked up,'' Moonves
said. ''I still think it's a very good drama.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS is also shifting the newsmagazine ''48 Hours'' to Thursdays
at 8 p.m., and moving ''Diagnosis Murder'' to Thursdays at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fledgling Pax TV network said Wednesday it would
introduce three new series later this year. ''Mysterious Ways'' is
about a professor driven to uncover the mysteries behind uncanny
occurrences, and it co-stars Rae Dawn Chong. ''The Rumfords'' is
believed to be the first prime-time series to mix cartoons and
live-action comedy. ''Encounters With the Unexplained'' is a
reality series that explores some of the mysteries of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Country star Billy Ray Cyrus will star in ''Doc,'' a series
about a country doctor who moves to Manhattan, but it won't debut
on Pax until next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and UPN deliver their new schedules on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Senate Commends Million Mom March  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted Wednesday to commend last
weekend's Million Mom March and urge enactment of long-stalled gun
control legislation, capping an occasionally heated partisan debate
that belied the purely symbolic nature of the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is strange that we find ourselves with such passion about
something that won't count,'' Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a gun
control foe, said shortly before the 50-49 vote in favor of the
Democratic proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not substantive law. It is not intended to be. It is
intended to make a political point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they raised the issue on an unrelated spending
bill because Senate-passed gun control legislation, including
restrictions on sales at gun shows, has been stalled for months
without progress toward a compromise with the House. The Senate
last year approved the gun show restrictions, a requirement for the
sale of trigger locks and other gun measures as part of a bill to
crack down on juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a war at home and we have to have the courage to stand
up and say, 'enough is enough,' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.,
''Let's commend the Million Mom March.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from gun control, the issue brought long-simmering Senate
grievances to the surface in an institution where colleagues
customarily refer to one another as ''distinguished,'' or ''my good
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats accused Majority Leader Trent Lott of attempting
to run the Senate -- where unlimited debate is a proud tradition --
like the House of Representatives, where the rules strictly limit
what amendments can be proposed and how long lawmakers may speak.
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later, the Mississippi Republican responded.
Looking toward Democrats a few feet away on the Senate floor, he
said he felt ''personally maligned ... and I don't appreciate it.
... I'm getting real tired of people questioning my commitment to
the Senate.'' He added it was the majority's responsibility to make
sure necessary legislation is passed.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, responded in equally
strong terms. ''The way the Senate is being run is wrong,'' he
said. ''No majority leader in history has attempted to constrain
debate as aggressively as Sen. Lott has chosen to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle added that Lott was ''trying to protect his members from
having to vote on tough issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic aides made no secret of their desire to make
Republicans vote on the issue of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   On the nonbinding vote, 43 Democrats and seven Republicans voted
in favor. Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana joined 48
Republicans in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The vote hinted at a modest shift in the GOP ranks. Sens. James
Jeffords of Vermont and William Roth of Delaware, both of whom are
seeking re-election this fall, sided with Democrats after opposing
the actual legislation a year ago. Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio,
who supported the legislation last year, opposed the Democratic
proposal on Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came moments after Republicans won approval for a
nonbinding proposal of their own. It accused the Clinton
administration of lax enforcement of the laws and failing to
''protect law-abiding citizens'' from gun violence. It, too, called
for passage of legislation dealing with juvenile crime, but did not
mention gun control provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 69-30.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Tigers Shell Military  </HEADLINE>
By NEELESH MISRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sri Lankan rebels shelled the military's
only airport in Jaffna Wednesday, threatening the supply line for
thousands of government troops.
</P>
<P>
   The international relief organization Doctors Without Borders
said it was planning to move its base out of Jaffna if large-scale
fighting breaks out in the city of 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, authorities blamed the rebels for a bombing Wednesday
that killed 19 and wounded at least 40 in the Sri Lanka town of
Batticaloa, 135 miles east of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil separatists, using 122 mm artillery that can hit
targets up to 10 miles away, hit Palali airport three times,
military officials reached by telephone said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 40,000 government soldiers and support staff get
most of their supplies through the airport, built when Britain was
a colonial power in Sri Lanka, then called Ceylon.
</P>
<P>
   Palali has been under government control since 1983. But in
April 1995, the guerrillas shot down two Air Force Avro transport
planes, killing at least 100 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgents on Tuesday resumed an assault on Jaffna, ending a
three-day lull in fighting, one of the few pauses since the
military's April 21 loss of the main causeway linking Jaffna
Peninsula to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Trujillo, the head of the French unit of Doctors Without
Borders, said by telephone that the organization was preparing to
shift about 60 civilian patients in Jaffna hospitals, to safer
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the United Nations Development Program moved
out some of its Jaffna staff, involved in clearing land mines,
saying it was no longer safe for them to work there.
</P>
<P>
   The minority Tamils claim they face discrimination from the
Sinhalese majority, which controls the government and the military.
They are fighting to establish a homeland in northern Sri Lanka for
the country's 3.2 million minority Tamils. The 17-year war has
killed more than 62,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, controlled Jaffna between 1990 and 1995, when they were
evicted by the Sri Lankan army after a 50-day war.
</P>
<P>
   During their five years of control of Jaffna, the separatists
set up their own Tamil administration for more than 1 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Sri Lankans celebrated the birth of Buddha
Wednesday by praying to end the country's ethnic war.

Women Act, which provides funds to shelters for battered women.

   ''This is the time to intensify our efforts with the goal of
eliminating violence in the home in any form,'' Gore said in a

<HEADLINE> NTSB: More Rest Stops for Trucks  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board, in
an effort to help truck drivers get more rest while on the road,
called Wednesday for an end to the ban on private development of
rest areas on some interstate highways.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB concluded there are not enough truck parking spaces
available in some parts of the country, especially near urban areas
and in parts of the Northeast and the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fatigue is one of the silent killers on our highways,'' said
NTSB Chairman Jim Hall, contending the parking space shortage has
forced drivers to park on highway shoulders or to keep driving when
they are tired, posing a risk to themselves and others.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB recommended that the Federal Highway Administration,
which is conducting its own study of the problem, ask Congress to
drop a federal ban on private development of rest areas on some
highways.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean private truck stops, commonly found near highway
exits, could potentially be built right on interstates.
</P>
<P>
   NATSO, an association that represents travel plazas and private
truck stops, opposes lifting the ban, Scot E. Imus, vice president
of government affairs, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said rest areas along interstate highways would keep truck
drivers from pulling off to visit the roughly 1,500 private truck
stops in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the long term, we'd go out of business,'' Imus said.
''There's no way we could compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Imus said his organization does not believe there is a shortage
of parking spaces. He said if there were, more private operators
would take advantage of the tight market.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Trucking Associations Inc., offered a different
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a growing need for tens of thousands of parking
spaces,'' said Dave Osiecki, vice president of ATA safety and
operations.
</P>
<P>
   He said a lack of spaces makes it difficult for drivers to
comply with federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers currently can drive for no more than 10 consecutive
hours. Under rules proposed by the Department of Transportation,
drivers would be able to drive for 12 hours but would have to take
two, hour-long breaks or four, half-hour breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said federal and state governments have a responsibility to
help drivers comply with the law and to prevent accidents similar
to one that occurred in his home state of Tennessee last year.
</P>
<P>
   In that accident, five people were killed in a fiery wreck on
Interstate 40.
</P>
<P>
   A truck ran off I-40 and collided with three other trucks that
were parked on the entrance ramp to the highway from the public
rest area. In its report, the NTSB said the vehicles were parked on
the ramp, because the rest area was filled to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB also recommended that the Federal Highway
Administration and other groups create a comprehensive guide for
truck drivers to inform them of parking areas and space
availability.
</P>
<P>
   The board did not make a recommendation concerning time limits
imposed on drivers at public rest stops in many states. It is
expected to issue a separate recommendation on that soon.
</P>
<P>
   Osiecki said the time limits force drivers to leave the areas
even when they are tired, or risk getting a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''That puts a driver in a place where he has to make an
unfortunate choice,'' Osiecki said.

<HEADLINE> EPA Orders Big Truck Pollution Cut  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government proposed regulations Wednesday
it said would eliminate almost all pollution from tractor-trailers,
buses and other heavy trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ''These dirty trucks and buses will be history,'' said Carol
Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, new big trucks would be required to have the
kind of pollution control equipment long mandated for automobiles.
The rules also direct that most sulfur be removed from diesel fuel
to prevent the new emission control devices from becoming clogged.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to cut the pollution by nearly 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Browner dismissed complaints from the oil and trucking
industries that the cleaner fuel could cause diesel shortages and
that it would cost too much.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're providing a lot of time and flexibility,'' she said at a
news conference where she announced the proposal regulators, which
are not expected to be made final until later this year. ''We don't
see any reason why they shouldn't be able to deliver clean diesel
fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   She estimated the new fuel, which would be required in 2007,
will add 3 cents to 4 cents a gallon to the cost of diesel, which
now retail for about $1.41 a gallon. Some industry estimates have
been as much as 20 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone who has ever driven behind a large truck or bus is
familiar with the clouds of thick exhaust,'' said Browner, added
that ''such air pollution is not just dirty and annoying -- it is a
threat to our health.''
</P>
<P>
   The new diesel requirements would not go into effect until 2006,
one year before the tougher truck and bus tailpipe standards. Even
then, the standards would apply to only new trucks and truck
engines and not to vehicles already on the road. As a result, it
would be years the requirements apply to all trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the proposal won praise from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the biggest vehicle pollution news since the removal of
lead from gasoline,'' said Richard Kassel, an attorney for the
Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   John Coruthers Jr., president of the American Lung Association,
said the regulations would dramatically cut the chemicals that
produce smog and microscopic soot, both major causes of respiratory
illnesses and other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute said
the EPA standard was ''extreme'' and ''unrealistic.'' The trade
group has proposed a 90 percent reduction in the amount of sulfur
in diesel, or to 50 parts per million, arguing that would provide
the environmental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But the pollution control equipment manufactures said the
tougher standard is needed if the equipment is going to work
properly, and the diesel engine makers also praised the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA proposed rule would require:
</P>
<P>
   --Diesel exhaust particulate, or soot, be cut to 0.01 grams per
unit of engine energy, compared with 0.1 under current standards.
</P>
<P>
   --Smog-causing nitrogen oxide emission be reduced to 0.2 grams
per unit of engine energy, compared with the current 2.5 grams.
These reductions can be phased in so not all new trucks would be
required to meet them until 2010.
</P>
<P>
   --That refiners reduce the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel from
as much as 500 parts per million today to no more than 15 parts per
million, a reduction of 97 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While large diesel trucks are cleaner today 20 years ago, they
continue to spew out much more pollution than automobiles for
number of miles traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the federal National Toxicology Program added
diesel exhaust particulates -- or microscopic soot -- to its list of
chemicals that are ''reasonably anticipated to be a human
carcinogen.'' Cancerous tumors have been found in rats after
exposure to diesel exhausts.

<HEADLINE> State Police have issued no tickets for truck ban on local roads  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Despite a state order to keep big trucks
off local roads and a new law creating fines for violators, no
tickets have been issued to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   But State Police spokesman John Hagerty said Wednesday that
troopers have been briskly enforcing a wide array of truck
regulations, stopping and inspecting more than 300 trucks over four
months just on state Routes 31 and 29 leading north from Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   These stops resulted in 166 tickets and 34 cases in which
troopers seized control of the truck and had it impounded until
safety violations were corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman in January signed a bill that sets fines
for drivers who take large trucks on roads that are not part of the
the National Truck Network.
</P>
<P>
   The action was taken after years of complaints from residents
and local officials along highways like Route 31 with heavy truck
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of Trenton reported Wednesday that the State Police
had not issued a single summons to a wayward truck driver for being
on the wrong road since the law was enacted. Local police do not
have the authority to issue such tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the truck
ban was being enforced and the lack of tickets was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The governor) has been assured that the enforcement is
happening. State Police are turning away trucks that violate the
ban,'' O'Connor said. ''The governor has been assured by the
attorney general that enforcement of the fines and penalties will
begin very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Shatzkin, a spokesman for Attorney General John Farmer,
told the Times that some legal issues had to be worked out before
summonses could be issued and upheld in municipal court.
</P>
<P>
   Hagerty told The Associated Press that troopers have been
diligent in inspecting trucks and issuing summonses to improve
safety. However, he said there have been few instances in which
troopers have caught trucks of a certain size being found on roads
where they do not belong.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the 166 tickets issued on Routes 31 and 29 from January
to April, Hagerty said, ''These violations would probably have
included any oversized vehicles on the roadway, but our troopers
have inspected very few oversized vehicles, which is indicative
that the word (about the ban on local road travel) is getting
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The law carries stiff penalties: $400 for a first summons, with
fines of $700 to $1,000 for repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has returned to center stage since a video store clerk
was killed in Lambertville on Friday by a 20-ton garbage-hauling
truck that crashed into the store, prompting Mayor David Del
Vecchio to denounce the state's enforcement of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''This truck was coming from Massachusetts and going to
Pennsylvania. It had no business being on this road,'' Del Vecchio
told the Times in its Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Charges have not yet been filed against the driver but
authorities said he lost control after running a traffic light in
an attempt to keep up with a caravan of trash trucks bound for a
Pennsylvania landfill.
</P>
<P>
   In Lambertville on Tuesday, where flowers had been placed at the
crash site, several residents and workers told the newspaper they
hadn't seen any decrease in local truck traffic since the ban was
put in place last summer and augmented with the penalties in
January.

<HEADLINE> Allied Action on Yugoslavia Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
consult with the European allies next week on the possibility of
joint action in response to a Yugoslav government crackdown on the
independent media, the State Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown involved the police seizure of several media
outlets critical of President Slobodan Milosevic and his
government.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the crackdown represents ''a
major step in efforts to preserve Milosevic's dictatorship. This
nighttime police raid smacks of desperate Bolshevik-style
oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright will raise the issue at a NATO foreign ministers
meeting in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the State Department plans to add six judges and
prosecutors to its list of Yugoslav citizens who are not eligible
for visas. He said all have taken repressive actions against the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will also immediately add family members of several top
officials to the regime to our visa ban list,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   European countries are being asked to take similar action, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Three Dead After Ballpark Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OZARK, Ala. (AP) -- A woman who was killed Tuesday night by her
ex-husband in a murder-suicide at a youth baseball park had filed
harassment charges against him just over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gerald Todd Smith, 35, opened fire in front of more than
200 people, killing Diana Smith 32, and her date, Edward McQuinn
II, 35, before turning the gun on himself. He died Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths were recently divorced, and Ricky Smith lost a
custody battle over the couple's two children, said police Chief
Tony Spivey. Diana Smith had filed harassment charges against her
ex-husband on Saturday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spivey said the couple's two boys were at the ballpark when the
shooting occurred. He didn't know if they witnessed the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the witness reports we have, the father did communicate
with one of the children,'' Spivey said. ''Then he went to his
truck to retrieve his weapon and started the shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Smith shot McQuinn in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun, he
said, but the gun apparently malfunctioned when he tried to fire at
his ex-wife. Smith then shot her several times in the head with a
.22 caliber pistol, Spivey said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Diana Smith and McQuinn had just recently begun dating.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings happened at about 6:40 p.m. as children and
parents were gathering for evening games. As shots rang out,
witnesses said parents grabbed their children and ran for a nearby
wooded area.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large number of them are just in total shock and total
disbelief,'' Spivey said. ''And very obviously, we have a lot of
traumatized children and parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Alton, who lived next door to Ricky Smith and his
parents until a few years ago, recalled Smith was a member of a
Baptist church.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not too long ago, he was driving the church van on Sunday,
picking up children,'' Alton said. ''I thought everything was fine.
I don't understand it.''

<HEADLINE> McCain: Global Warming for Real  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain expressed concern Wednesday
about the ''mounting evidence'' pointing to global climate change
and the potential for harm, but said any action should be based on
science ''and not on rhetoric or political expedience.''
</P>
<P>
   The former GOP presidential contender made good on a campaign
promise and held a hearing before his Senate Commerce Committee on
global warming. A half dozen scientists told him that the surface
of the Earth is warming, that concentrations of so-called
''greenhouse gases'' have significantly increased in the atmosphere
and that there's plenty of evidence humans have something to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, an Arizona Republican, had been dogged during his
unsuccessful president campaign by a group of environmental
activists, especially in New Hampshire, who pressed him on the
climate issue. That prompted him to promise hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a signature issue for Vice President Al Gore. Texas Gov.
George Bush has been vague on the issue, saying that he
increasingly has come to the conclusion that there may be a warming
of the Earth but want's more scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In opening the session, McCain said he had no specific plan to
address the problem, but that he was ''concerned about mounting
evidence that indicates something is happening. It is of the utmost
importance that we examine this issue and examine it thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made no mention of the Kyoto agreement, signed by
President Clinton, that calls for industrial nations to cut
emissions that are believed to be warming the Earth -- principally
carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. The pact is in
limbo, with Congress in no mood to ratify it because, many
lawmakers believe, it would be too costly and have marginal impact
unless countries like China and India also are required to reduce
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, in the House, lawmakers are expected to debate
a provision that would restrict the ability of the Clinton
administration to even discuss with other countries measures that
would reduce the cost of implementing the Kyoto accord.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Lane, the president's science and technology adviser, said
when asked about the House provision by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
that it could ''stifle'' administration attempts to negotiate
issues that would make the Kyoto agreement more palatable as well
as efforts to get developing countries to participate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain asked the panel of scientists, including Lane, to
separate what is known and not known about climate change.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite clear that the Earth is warming'' and that surface
temperatures will continue to rise during the next century, Lane
said. ''There is mounting scientific evidence that climate change
is already affecting ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Watson, chairman of the United Nations-sponsored
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, insisted that ''a large
majority of scientists'' believe the threat of global warming is
real, although there are ''a half dozen or so contrarians.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The overwhelming majority of scientific experts recognize that
scientific uncertainties exist, but still believe that
human-induced climate change is inevitable,'' said Watson.
</P>
<P>
   John Christy, a climatologist at the University of
Alabama-Huntsville, admitted he was ''the most skeptical among the
panelists'' when it came to climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Christy has questioned surface temperature readings that show
the Earth has been warming. These readings are contradicted by
readings over the past 20 years of atmospheric temperature readings
that show no increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sixty percent of the atmosphere is going in a direction
opposite from the (computer climate) models,'' said Christy. He
also said that broad global temperature data may be misleading
since it does not address local or regional climate changes or
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. climate panel in 1995 produced a report that said that
the Earth is warming because growing concentrations of man-made
gases in the atmosphere are trapping the Earth's heat much like a
greenhouse. The panel is to produce another report next year that
will likely come to the same conclusion with even more definitive
evidence, suggested Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Mahlman, an expert on climate modeling at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that ''there is no
remaining doubt that increased greenhouse gases are caused by human
activity.'' And, he continued, it's a ''virtually certain bet that
this problem will refuse to go away.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 165; Nasdaq Off 73  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors resumed a cautious stance Wednesday,
sending stocks sharply lower as they decided that the interest rate
increase implemented by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday may indeed
threaten stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness on Wall Street didn't surprise analysts, who
believed stocks were due to falter in the wake of the Fed's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is supposed to have a difficult time when the Fed
is raising rates,'' said Robert Streed, senior investment counselor
at Northern Trust in Chicago. ''The old adage says 'Don't fight the
Fed,' and I think people forgot that for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 164.83 to close at
10,769.74.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower, although their losses
were more modest. The Nasdaq composite index fell 72.61 to 3,644.96
and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 18.24 to 1,447.80.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's selloff reversed a four-day winning streak that had
extended through Tuesday, when the Fed, as expected, raised
interest rates a half-percentage point, its steepest increase in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, raising
borrowing costs and cutting into profits. Investors had bid stocks
higher on the hope that Tuesday's increase could be the last for a
while, but with many economists predicting still higher rates later
this year, many investors lost their nerve Wednesday, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have, in fact, suffered while the Fed has been raising
rates in an attempt to slow the economy's growth to a more
sustainable pace. Gail Dudack, chief equity strategist at UBS
Warburg in New York, pointed out that in the 11 volatile months
since the Fed began raising rates, the Dow has declined about 2
percent -- a sharp contrast with the double-digit annual gains it
enjoyed in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which made a history-making surge in late 1999 and
early 2000, is up about 36 percent since June 1999. But the index
has tumbled a dramatic 28 percent from its all-time high of
5,048.62, set March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Dudack said the Dow's performance is more typical during a time
of escalating rates, and the Nasdaq's recent slump may be bringing
it in line with historical measures. Further rate increases will
only worsen the damage, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the accumulation of rate hikes that truly hampers stock
market performance over time,'' Dudack said, adding that she
expects the market to dip further in May and June before rallying
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, the top-performing Dow component on Tuesday,
fell 7 13/16 to 130 11/16 Wednesday. After the close of trading
Tuesday, the company reported second-quarter earnings that topped
Wall Street analysts' expectations. But testy investors may have
been expecting Hewlett-Packard to more dramatically exceed
published estimates, analysts said. Others suggested that the
company may be growing dependent on lower margin areas such as
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Agilent, the testing and measuring equipment maker that was spun
off from Hewlett-Packard, fell 10{ to 78 after releasing its
earnings report, which revealed weakness in health care products
and chemical analysis equipment divisions.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell 11/16 to 38 1/16 after Salomon Smith Barney analyst
Jack Grubman said he expects the company to earn $2.55 per share in
2001, down from his previous estimate of $2.75. Grubman said AT&AMP;T
is facing higher sales, general and administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclical stocks, which are sensitive to changes in the broad
economy, also closed lower. Alcoa fell 1 9/16 to 65] and Honeywell
lost 1 13/16 to 54[.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 980.57 million
shares, compared with 1.16 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.32 to 499.66.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.8 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 2.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 1.9
percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Fired State Police chief now wants Whitman picture  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A picture of Gov. Christie Whitman frisking
a black drug suspect will help prove that top state administrators
were biased and interested only in being ''cowboys,'' the lawyer
for fired State Police Col. Carl Williams said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Clifford Van Syoc said he is preparing to file a motion
in state Superior Court demanding a copy of the photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, fired in February 1999 after making statements linking
minorities to drug suspects, adamantly opposed Whitman's tour with
state troopers during patrols in Camden in 1996, but was powerless
to stop the governor, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was definitely not the colonel's idea. He thought it was
a bad idea for civilians to be running around pretending to be
cops,'' Van Syoc said. ''On that particular day, he was an Indian,
not a chief.''
</P>
<P>
   The former State Police superintendent now alleges in a $21
million lawsuit that he was improperly fired by Whitman and that he
and his wife suffered severe emotional damage. Among other things,
Williams claims he was forced out so Whitman could hire a black
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think (the photograph) is particularly relevant in terms of
people's attitudes toward race and his termination,'' Van Syoc
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would show that the powers that be are more
interested in being cowboys and panderers rather than treating
people on an equal basis,'' Van Syoc said.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who have seen the photograph, Whitman is
wearing a white nylon jumpsuit, a baseball cap and black gloves
similar to those used by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The governor appears to be ''arresting and/or frisking a young
black male'' according to the subpoena filed May 2 in state
Superior Court in Mercer County.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the operation said the suspect was not
charged with any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Philip J. Moran filed the initial subpoena for the
photograph. Moran represents at least 30 black, Hispanic and female
troopers, many who claim they were targets of discrimination from
their State Police superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoena also seeks all records, patrol logs, operational
orders and other reports related to Whitman's visits to Camden in
March and April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence would be used to back claims by minority troopers
that their superiors were racists, according to Moran.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said the
state would comply with any court order regarding the records and
other materials.
</P>
<P>
   But the state officials have not actually seen the picture, said
spokesman Chuck Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We provide all discovery. If he asks for other materials and
we deem it relevant, we'll give it to him,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis declined to address any of the charges raised by Van Syoc.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are allegations made by an attorney in civil
litigation,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   A governor's spokeswoman also declined to discuss the Williams
lawsuit and the impact that the picture could have.
</P>
<P>
   ''The request for the alleged photograph is being made as part
of an ongoing lawsuit,'' said Jayne O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Several black, Hispanic and female troopers filed their claim
last year after the Attorney General's Office acknowledged the
existence of racial profiling, a practice in which white troopers
pulled over minority drivers based on their race.
</P>
<P>
   Those same internal investigations said the State Police did not
respond to complaints filed against troopers and that the
department did not hire enough women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The reports were sparked by the April 1998 shooting by white
troopers of four minority men during a traffic stop on the New
Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Since the reports were issued, Whitman has appointed a new State
Police superintendent who has begun reforms in hiring and
promotions practices.

<HEADLINE> NYC Church Vandal Suspect Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A suspect has been arrested in the vandalism of
statues at Roman Catholic churches and he told investigators he was
following orders from God, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told us that he believed that God had told him to do it --
that the Bible suggested to him that he should not worship graven
images,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Primus St. Croix, 34, allegedly led a group of a dozen followers
who helped him damage religious statues at Brooklyn churches. More
arrests are expected.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix was arrested Tuesday after a tip was called to the
NYPD's Crime Stoppers, Safir said. St. Croix, who is Catholic,
confessed to taking part in five incidents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank DeRosa, spokesman for the Diocese of Brooklyn, said
parishioners were encouraged by the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statues of Jesus, or of the Blessed Mother or the saints
are there to remind us how to live the Christian life -- there is no
idolatry involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Croix faces several counts of criminal mischief and
aggravated harassment. He was to be arraigned late Wednesday. It
wasn't clear whether he had an attorney yet.

<HEADLINE> Diet, Dioxin Risk May Be Linked  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consider it a possible additional reason to
eat a lowfat diet.
</P>
<P>
   A draft report from the Environmental Protection Agency suggests
the cancer risk from dioxins may be greater than previously
thought, but only among people who eat lots of fat.
</P>
<P>
   That may sound scary but even if it's true, these
long-controversial chemicals still would play a very small role in
anyone's individual risk, say cancer experts.
</P>
<P>
   Eating a lowfat diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, regular
exercise and not smoking are the best recommendations for
preventing cancer and preventing heart disease, the nation's No. 1
killer.
</P>
<P>
   ''An ordinary person should base their health decisions on the
known major (risk) factors,'' says Dr. Michael Thun of the American
Cancer Society. Worry about dioxins ''shouldn't be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ''the kind of diet that is healthy for your
heart ... is also healthy as far as protecting you from dioxin,''
said Dr. Gina Solomon, a physician with the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   The health effects of dioxins, toxic compounds produced from
combustion and certain manufacturing processes, have been
controversial for decades. While very high doses sickened
laboratory animals, the health effects in people have remained
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   But studies have found that people worldwide have at least some
dioxin in their bodies. Dioxin is released into the air and water
and works its way into animals and fish, accumulating in fatty
tissue. Eventually people eat it.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is over cumulative lifetime exposure, not eating a
single food.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the EPA has imposed tougher regulations on many
dioxin emitters. As a result, dioxin emissions have been reduced by
about 80 percent since the 1980s, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA began reviewing the health issue in 1991. Draft
conclusions say a small segment of the population who eat lots of
fatty foods may have a cancer risk as high as 1 in 100 from dioxin.
</P>
<P>
   The draft does ''show that the health risks associated with
dioxin are greater than previously suspected,'' EPA Administrator
Carol Browner said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But she stressed the draft report needs additional scientific
review.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do enjoy one of the safest food supplies in the world,''
Browner added. ''It's important to understand where dioxin is
found. It tends to accumulate in fat. So a low-fat diet for any
number of reasons continues to be advisable.''
</P>
<P>
   As dioxin in the environment dropped, it also dropped in the
food supply, said Dr. Susan Alpert of the Food and Drug
Administration, which has tested foods after dioxin pollution
scares.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the FDA stopped some Belgian food imports because
of dioxin contamination, and in 1997 it stopped shipments of some
poultry and catfish fed dioxin-contaminated feed.
</P>
<P>
   But even in pollution cases, scientists find minute amounts -- so
small they're measured in parts per trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists had thought dioxins were turning out to be less
hazardous than initially feared, ''so the EPA's report represents a
real reversal in that opinion and it's really important to see what
data they have,'' said the cancer society's Thun.
</P>
<P>
   A higher risk might urge tougher pollution-control standards
without meaning people should worry about dioxin at the dinner
table, he said. ''People have trouble separating issues that are
important for a regulatory agency from issues important for
individual life decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Alpert agreed ''it's premature'' to offer diet recommendations.
''The best thing we can say ... is to eat a varied diet,'' she
said.

   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A man was arrested Wednesday and charged
with setting a bomb that killed a woman a month before she was to
give birth to his child 2{ years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman Leake Johnson Jr., 29, was charged with murder in the
Dec. 3, 1997, pipe bomb blast that killed 24-year-old Tammy Lynn
Baker outside her apartment. The fetus also was killed. If
convicted of the federal charge, Johnson could face the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not want to support this child and that was his motive
for committing this heinous crime,'' U.S. Attorney Robert P. Crouch
Jr. said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was indicted by a federal grand jury in Charlottesville
on Tuesday and was arrested at 9:45 a.m. Wednesday in his car in
Newport News. He was jailed in Newport News pending a bond hearing
Monday. It was not immediately clear whether he had an attorney.

<HEADLINE> Amid profit drop, Campbell announces turnaround plan  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Calling their quarterly fiscal results
''unacceptable,'' Campbell Soup Co. executives on Wednesday
reported a 14 percent drop in profits, which they blamed primarily
on a sharp decline in U.S. soup consumption.
</P>
<P>
   With the previous two quarters also weak and the next likely to
be disappointing, the world's biggest soup maker announced a ''back
to basics'' plan focusing on its primary product with new soup
varieties, more convenient packaging and increased marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the biggest set of plans for soup ever to be unleashed in
the U.S. market,'' chief executive David W. Johnson said of the
campaign, set to start in July.
</P>
<P>
   He said the food company, which also makes Pepperidge Farm
cookies and crackers, Godiva chocolates and Swanson broths, had let
its focus drift away from its core business. Johnson predicted
Campbell will get back on track, but it could take a while if the
soup market doesn't rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here today to discuss the gloom and terror of where we
are, and yet we've got a 70 percent (soup) market share in this
country,'' Johnson told analysts. ''We're not doing too badly.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third fiscal quarter, which ended April 30, Camden-based
Campbell reported net earnings dropped to $139 million, or 32 cents
per share, from $162 million, or 37 cents per share, a year
earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial
apparently anticipated the weak results and had forecast earnings
per share of 31 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales declined 6.6 percent, to $1.39 billion from $1.49
billion. Sales of Campbell's soups dropped 9 percent to $927
million in the quarter, and the earnings contribution from the
company's soups and sauces division plunged 18 percent. Likewise,
sales of V8 Splash and sauces, including Prego, Franco-American and
Pace, were down.
</P>
<P>
   That division's decline was slightly offset by a 2 percent sales
increase for the biscuits and confectionary division and an 8
percent sales increase for the ''Away from Home'' division, which
sells soups to restaurants, college cafeterias and fast food chains
such as McDonald's and Subway.
</P>
<P>
   ''Results in the third quarter are very distressing, completely
unacceptable and unprecedented,'' senior vice president F. Martin
Thrasher said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months, Campbell's net profit increased a
dismal 1.6 percent to $655 million, or $1.52 per share, from $645
million, or $1.44 per share, a year earlier. Sales for the August
through April period slipped 1 percent, to $5.08 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to chase too much growth and as a result spread
themselves too thin,'' said Nomi Ghez, a food analyst and managing
director at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and the other executives conceded as much during the
analyst conference, but stressed that most of their products remain
No. 1 or No. 2 in their markets.
</P>
<P>
   While they plan to continue developing new products, the
turnaround campaign will focus on the company's most popular soups.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chicken Noodle,'' the single-largest selling dry grocery item
in U.S. markets, will get 20 percent more meat per can. That
condensed variety will be combined with another favorite,
''Tomato,'' in a new flavor called ''Tomato Noodle'' meant to
appeal to both children and adults. Advertising will ''really
exploit'' the cancer-fighting properties and other health benefits
linked to tomatoes, Thrasher said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's ''Ready to Serve Soups,'' the noncondensed brands
such as ''Chunky'' and ''Select,'' will be getting easy-open pull
tops. And Super Bowl MVP Kurt Warner will be added to the celebrity
team endorsing Campbell products.
</P>
<P>
   Unsatisfied with the results of recent advertising, Campbell
also plans to revisit earlier ads, increase advertising spending
and add more traveling sales representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect earnings in fiscal year 2001 to be up only modestly,
6 percent, despite the fact that this year was horrendous,'' Ghez
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Campbell has temporarily brought back Johnson, one of
its most successful leaders, as president and chief executive
officer while it searches for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 67, held the same top posts from January 1990 until he
retired in July 1997, a period when Campbell had consistently
strong profit increases and saw its market value more than triple
to more than $22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he won't be a mere ''night watchman'' while
Campbell's board of directors seeks a permanent replacement for
Dale F. Morrison, who resigned March 22.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, company spokesman John Faulkner said he would not
characterize whether Morrison was pressured to leave.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Seeks Satellite Control  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department wants to take back
control of U.S. satellite exports, which are dwindling rapidly
under strict State Department licensing that classifies them as
munitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our experience in the past 14 months suggests that the changed
controls on satellite exports hurt the U.S. more than they hurt any
intended target,'' said Commerce Under Secretary William A. Reinsch
in testimony prepared for a Senate hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Exports have declined 40 percent, from $1.06 billion in 1998 to
$637 million last year, the industry says, and the U.S. share of
the market has dropped from 73 percent to 52 percent for the last
three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which Congress gave final say over
satellite exports in March 1999, plans to issue new rules next week
to speed up exports to NATO countries and other allies, which
increasingly have been turning to European, Japanese and Russian
sources for satellites and related products.
</P>
<P>
   The law changing control of satellite exports was prompted by
concern that the technology could be used by Russia or China to
develop weapon systems or be transferred to hostile countries.
</P>
<P>
   But Reinsch and industry representatives say the whole idea of
classifying a $69 billion-a-year industry that provides TV
broadcasts, telephone service, Internet access and an increasing
array of commercial applications around the globe is misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jurisdictional change has affected our foreign relations,
our national security and a broad range of U.S. industry,'' Reinsch
said in his testimony. No date was set for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee hearing which he and other administration and
industry official gathered for Wednesday. It was called off due to
a backup of votes on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Holum, senior State Department adviser for arms control
and international security affairs, said in his testimony that the
department neither sought nor welcomed the change in jurisdiction
but has tried to make the best of it.
</P>
<P>
   He said special rules are being proposed to ''expedite satellite
related exports to U.S. friends and allies'' but no matter how
promptly licenses are handled, it will not be as fast as it was
when no licenses were required.
</P>
<P>
   New rules will allow four-year licenses covering multiple
shipments to any NATO or major no-NATO ally, including Australia,
New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of the special procedures will apply should the
transaction at any stage involve an activity beyond the territories
of U.S. allies, such as space launches from the People's Republic
of China or Russia,'' Holum said in his prepared testimony.
</P>
<P>
   All witnesses said they were concerned for national security and
for protecting against the leakage of weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton Mowry, executive director of the Satellite Industry
Association, said the industry is committed to protecting U.S.
security.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that our national security is enhanced by having a
healthy and robust commercial satellite industry that can compete
on an equal footing in the international marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The change in jurisdiction was prompted by congressional concern
over U.S. industry's involvement with China. A report by a special
House committee said valuable military technology flowed to China
by putting U.S.-built satellites into orbit on Chinese rockets.,
and the Clinton administration stopped one $450 million commercial
sale to China.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, the State Department accused Lockheed Martin
Corp. of illegally giving a conglomerate owned partly by the
Chinese government a scientific assessment designed to improve a
flawed Chinese-made satellite motor, threatening a $15 million
fine. Lockheed denied it had violated export laws.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Hamre, a former deputy defense secretary who now heads
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a private
defense think tank, said putting State Department restrictions on
satellite exports was ''analogous to saying that since a burglar
broke into one person's garage, we now must move the entire
neighborhood to a new location.''
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a sharp loss in U.S. space exports and a
threat to U.S. technological leadership in a critical era, he said.

<HEADLINE> Time Names New Real Simple Editor  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Inc. has replaced the editor of Real
Simple, a new lifestyle magazine for women, just two issues after
the magazine launched.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Wyland, a former editor of Martha Stewart Living, had
developed the idea for the magazine over a two-year period at Time
Inc. and saw the publication through its launch in April.
</P>
<P>
   But reports of internal friction between Wyland and other senior
staff as well as a lukewarm reception from advertisers overshadowed
what the company called a strong reader response to the magazine's
first two issues.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc. spokesman Peter Costiglio said Wednesday that it was
not clear whether Wyland would remain with the company. Wyland did
not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Pearlstine, the top editorial executive at Time Inc.,
announced that Carrie Tuhy, the assistant editor at InSyle, would
take over as editor of Real Simple. Isolde Motley, who had been
editor of the recently closed Life magazine, will supervise Tuhy in
her new post as corporate editor for all of Time Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Pearlstine praised Wyland's efforts, saying the
magazine has had one of the highest response rates from readers by
a Time Inc. magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''The underlying concept of the magazine has been validated,''
he said, adding that he hoped the new editors would ''build on the
momentum Real Simple has already achieved in the marketplace and
bring it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple promised women in their 30s and 40s help with
stripping away clutter from their lives, offering tips on easy
meals to cook, basic personal finance advice, dieting and exercise.
But media critics as well as advertisers were not impressed with
the initial results.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think advertisers were disappointed with the execution, but
they are glad that Time Inc. is moving quickly to remedy the
situation,'' said Roberta Garfinkle, who buys print ads for
McCann-Erickson Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt change marked an unusual setback for Time Inc.'s
People magazine group, which has had a string of successful
magazine launches, including InStyle, Teen People and People en
Espanol.
</P>
<P>
   The People group had $942 million in ad revenues last year, a
significant portion of the $3.5 billion figure for all of Time
Inc., according to the Publishers Information Bureau. Time Inc.
publishes more than 20 magazines including Time, Fortune, Sports
Illustrated, Money and Entertainment Weekly.

<HEADLINE> Tribes: Gov't Not Enforcing Laws  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government is not enforcing a law
designed to protect American Indian artisans from forgers said to
be cutting into a $1 billion a year business, artists and tribal
leaders told lawmakers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency responsible for enforcement has not sought criminal
charges or civil lawsuits since 1990, when the law was
strengthened, even though trade groups estimate that at least half
of all Indian-style art sold in the United States is not authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Indian communities, enforcement ... has become a joke. It's
like a paper tiger with no teeth,'' said Tony Eriacho Jr., a member
of New Mexico's Zuni tribe and a jewelry maker and wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Indian Arts and Craft Board said Congress has
provided little money -- $1 million this budget year -- or support.
The agency, part of the Interior Department, also operates three
federal museums -- in Montana, Oklahoma and South Dakota -- where
Indian crafts are displayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have the investigators to go out and be looking for
cases,'' Faith Roessel, a Navajo, told the Senate Indian Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which hired its first staff lawyer two months ago,
has received 45 written complaints since 1996, many from consumers
who ''got a bad deal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's plenty of blame to pass around, but we don't seem to
be making any progress,'' said the committee chairman, Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, a Northern Cheyenne and former jeweler.
Campbell, R-Colo., said the government needs to do more.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jon Kyl, who wrote the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act,
raised the possibility of moving enforcement to another government
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''With an estimated 50 to 60 percent of the marketplace plagued
with forgeries, how hard can it be to find a test case?'' Kyl,
R-Ariz., said in a statement. ''It almost seems as if the board
isn't looking for cases at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 law strengthened existing penalties and gave the Indian
Arts and Crafts Board responsibility for referring complaints to
federal prosecutors. The intention was to further protect Indian
artists, who account for up to 85 percent of the job-holders on
some reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopi tribe estimates that arts and crafts bring in $11.2
million a year for the 37 percent of its workers involved in the
business, but faux Hopi knockoffs cost another $4.6 million a year,
Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico's Isleta Pueblo have seen the number of full-time
artists drop to 30 from 150 in the past 50 years, Isleta sculptor
Andy Abeita told senators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfair competition from import fakes and mechanically cast
pottery and jewelry is now often being sold to the unsuspecting
consumer as Indian handmade,'' said Abeita, who has investigated
the problem for tribes and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This threat has made it almost impossible to compete fairly in
the commercial marketplace, forcing generations of potters and
silversmiths to discontinue the trade,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Violators can face up to five years in prison and a $250,000
fine. Companies could pay a $1 million fine for a first offense.
</P>
<P>
   The government board has pressured some businesses into dropping
sales of fakes, Roessel said. She said Time-Life Books agreed in
1996 to use authentic Hopi Kachina dolls as a promotional giveaway
for its books on American Indians after the board learned the
company originally planned to give away fakes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in South Dakota charged a man under the arts
and crafts law in 1998, Mark Van Norman of the Justice Department
said. The result was a guilty plea and an agreement to stop using
the words ''Native American'' on the goods produced, said Van
Norman, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The head of a Security Council mission to
the Congo urged the United Nations on Wednesday to immediately
deploy U.N. observers to the northern city of Kisangani or risk
another flare-up in fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dates like July will not work for Kisangani,'' U.S. Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke said in calling for the ahead of schedule
deployment within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He was briefing the Security Council on his recent visit to
Congo with a council delegation. The trip resulted in an agreement
between Rwanda and Uganda to withdraw their forces and allow the
United Nations to take control of the divided northern city.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda support rival groups of Congolese rebels who
took up arms in August 1998 to oust Congolese President Laurent
Kabila, but all sides have since signed a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan and Ugandan armies clashed last week in Congo's
third-largest city when the Ugandans tried to introduce large
numbers of reinforcements and expel Rwandan units, according to the
Rwandan army and U.N. military observers.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lt. Col. Akram Hossein, head of the small U.N.
team in Kisangani, said it would be at least July before the first
group of U.N. soldiers from the U.N. Observer Mission for Congo,
known as MONUC, lands in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that was not soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time is essential,'' Holbrooke said. ''It is vitally important
that the forces from MONUC that will go to Kisangani get there
ahead of the initial deployment schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''Otherwise the risks of war beginning again are very
substantial,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, when asked about Holbrooke's
appeal, said he believed it would be possible to put Kisangani at
the top of the deployment list but that it still might not be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not entirely in our hands. It does have to do with how
quickly governments would make their troops available,'' Eckhard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several ambassadors, including French Ambassador Jean-David
Levitte, asked the peacekeeping department for a quick study of
what money and equipment would be needed to allow for the extra
deployment now envisaged for Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has authorized a 5,537-strong force for the
Congo to monitor a cease-fire reaffirmed by the warring sides April
8. Deployment -- already held up because of security conditions --
has also been threatened by the outbreak of violence in Sierra
Leone, where 350 U.N. peacekeepers remain detained by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every ambassador at the council meeting said the events
in Sierra Leone, while dramatic, shouldn't overshadow Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The needs of the Congo cannot wait for other problems
elsewhere to be solved,'' said British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock.
</P>
<P>
   But Canadian Ambassador Robert Fowler said the violence in
Sierra Leone underscored the precariousness of the Congo mission as
currently planned. Canada has consistently complained that the
Congo force is too small and its mandate too narrow to take on the
challenges that Congo presents.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials have privately criticized Canada's insistence
that the force be larger and given a broader mandate to ensure
compliance with human rights and humanitarian law, noting that
Canada hasn't committed troops for the mission.

<HEADLINE> Santa Fe Lab Helps Los Alamos  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- When fire closed Los Alamos National
Laboratory on May 8, scientists quickly lined up an alternative
laptop lab in exile.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe Institute, a think tank down the hill from Los
Alamos, has provided computer links with the lab and a kind of home
away from home for researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The lab remained closed Wednesday as the Cerro Grande Fire
continued to grow. And while most Los Alamos residents have been
allowed back home, no date for a lab reopening has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists started taking advantage of the Santa Fe Institute
offer last Friday, SFI researcher Erica Jen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Los Alamos has been so important to the institute and the
general area, we really wanted to help in any way we could,'' said
Jen, a research professor at Santa Fe Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've provided them with the use of our machines so they can
get access to the lab,'' said Tim Carlson, director of computing
for the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The institute has long been a forum for the exchange of new
scientific ideas and a center for computer simulation.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson estimated 10 to 15 Los Alamos scientists are now working
at SFI. The Institute has provided computer hardware, software,
work stations -- even lunch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of them have brought their own laptops. We have put those
laptops on our networks,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can get into the unclassified lab computers from here,''
he added. ''Of course, you cannot get to the classified
computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say their laptops have allowed them to stay in touch
via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Wojciech Zurek, a Los Alamos researcher in quantum mechanics,
said he has been working on his laptop and his home computer, where
he has copied much of his recent work ''since I don't do any
classified work.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it's now on his laptop, Zurek knows his data is safe. He
also is optimistic that data left at the lab is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Macken, a theoretical biologist, said she, too, has
been working at SFI.
</P>
<P>
   Working at SFI and at home has been productive, she said, but
not being able to meet personally with colleagues on projects has
hampered some of her research.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Frauenfelder, director of nonlinear studies at Los Alamos,
said his department's 20th annual conference also may have to find
an alternative location, but he hopes the lab will be open by the
conference's scheduled starting date of June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Because this year's conference is the 20th, he said, it was
decided to include all fields covered by his department.
</P>
<P>
   ''That includes black holes and cosmology and goes all the way
to the brain. We are having first-rate people in all of these
fields,'' he said, and they're all already invited, so cancellation
was not really an option.

<HEADLINE> Economists Blast Army Corps' Plan  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A panel of economists criticized the Army
Corps of Engineers' handling of a study that has prompted
allegations that top agency officials manufactured a case for
costly construction on the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The economists' report, funded by the McKnight Foundation, the
Joyce Foundation and Environmental Defense, is being released by
the Northeast-Midwest Institute on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The economists reviewed the corps' 7-year, $54 million study
that aims to balance the economic benefits of expanding barge locks
on the rivers with the financial and environmental costs.
</P>
<P>
   The new review, based on public documents as well as those
provided by the corps, shipping interests and environmental groups,
was begun months before corps economist Donald Sweeney filed a
sworn affidavit that his superiors altered data and his original
conclusions to justify massive construction. Sweeney's charges
resulted in several pending investigations by the Army inspector
general, the National Academy of Sciences and some in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said it did not attempt to conclude whether the corps
study had been rigged.
</P>
<P>
   But the economists did criticize the corps for not
comprehensively studying what the value of a crucial component of
its economic model should be.
</P>
<P>
   Without such extensive analysis, the variable value ultimately
chosen -- which accounts for shippers switching to alternative
transportation as barge costs rise -- ''seems at best to be
arbitrary and at worst possibly chosen to justify the project,''
they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The central charge in Sweeney's filing was that corps brass
ordered that variable lowered to make the $1 billion cost of
doubling the length of seven locks on the upper Mississippi and
Illinois rivers appear warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Corps officials have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying new
data -- not foul play -- caused the study to change.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ron Fournier, a corps spokesman in the Rock
Island, Ill., district that is overseeing the study, said corps
economists had not had time to examine the new report. If they
determine it is based on ''solid data, instead of fear or emotion''
it is likely many of its criticisms would be addressed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not something that comes as any great concern to us,''
Fournier said.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of a years-long, fierce debate, the corps study is
expected to be finished this year. Its initial, unofficial
conclusion favors the seven-lock proposal, the most extensive still
on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping interests say massive lock expansions are crucial to
keeping transportation costs low as grain exports -- and thus barge
traffic -- rise. Otherwise, they say, Midwestern products will not
be able to compete on the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue that river's fragile ecosystem would be
further endangered by more large-scale changes.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said the study employs overly simplistic analysis,
uses faulty assumptions and ignores key factors.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to grade the corps' effort, Yale University's Steven Berry
and Charles Leven of Washington University called it ''inadequate
for the purpose.'' The panel's third member, Geoffrey Hewings of
the University of Illinois, was unavailable for the Wednesday
conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ''At best, parts are a nice try -- but not well executed,'' Leven
said. ''Other parts are just wrong, and still other parts just
aren't there.''

<HEADLINE> Likely Domincan Winner Speaks  </HEADLINE>
By ISMAEL TORRES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- On the verge of winning
the Dominican presidency, opposition leader Hipolito Mejia on
Wednesday credited his grass-roots base for drawing out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked for votes everywhere,'' the former tobacco farmer
said triumphantly -- even though he had yet to receive the simple
majority needed to avoid a runoff on June 30. ''I looked under
rocks, under a shrub, under a yucca tree and a the stump of a
plantain tree.''
</P>
<P>
   It was vintage Mejia, who has won many hearts by once
proclaiming ''I'm no jerk!'' and distancing himself from a
political establishment many believe is more concerned with
statistics than people.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia's informality delighted voters who, weary with the
seemingly aloof leadership, wanted more attention for ordinary
people struggling to live on an average of $2,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   While Mejia, 59, comes from the Dominican Republic's
light-skinned, landowning elite, he belongs to the left-leaning
Revolutionary Party that commands the strongest following in this
Caribbean nation of 8 million.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised to spend more on social programs and
community-level public works projects. And while he offers no
overreaching changes in economic policy, businessmen fear he'll
take money from much-needed infrastructure investments to make good
on his promises.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I promised, I will do,'' he said Wednesday. ''I will not
be a person who will be frustration for this society.''
</P>
<P>
   Mejia was born near Santiago in Gurabo, and studied at the
Polytechnic Institute in San Cristobal. He finished his studies in
tobacco production at the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he was director of the Dominican Tobacco Institute, and
later worked for various private firms. In 1970, he was president
of the National Professional Farmers Association, and served as
agriculture secretary from 1978-82 under President Antonio Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   Married with four children, Mejia has been his party's vice
president for years but never held elected office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he was the vice presidential running mate of the
legendary Jose Francisco Pena Gomez -- a black shunned by most of
the white elite and widely believed to have lost the 1994 election
to fraud. Pena Gomez died in 1998, after three unsuccessful tries
for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia and his vice presidential running mate, Milagros Ortiz
Bosch, visited Pena Gomez's grave Wednesday morning. They held
their hands over the tomb, and Mejia addressed his old friend:
''Pena, these hands will be used for the good of the people. They
will not be stained by robbery.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fire Season on the Move  </HEADLINE>
By DAN GALLAGHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- While the Southwest is suffering through
dramatic blazes, the fire season is making its normal annual
migration from Florida to the Pacific Northwest, say experts at the
nation's fire suppression center.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this year's track record depends on whether summer
storms also pack moisture to douse the multitude of lightning
strikes flickering into the trees and brush.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the wild cards in the fire season is dry lightning,''
said Rick Ochoa, a National Weather Service meteorologist working
in tandem with Boise's National Interagency Fire Center. ''How much
will you get? It's difficult to project in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal facility on Wednesday reported 10 large fires in the
Southwest and South, including the 47,000-acre prescribed fire that
roared out of control into Los Alamos, N.M. Firefighters also are
contending with a 13,000-acre fire on the northern rim of the Grand
Canyon which started as a 1,500-acre prescribed burn.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 38,821 fires have blackened 928,945 acres
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Fire weather usually starts in Florida in February, then moves
across the South, reaching Texas and the Southwest in May, said
Mike Apicello, Forest Service public affairs officer at NIFC.
</P>
<P>
   Monsoons in the Southwest may douse fires there, but they
usually do not appear on the horizon for another 1{ months, Ochoa
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days are long in Alaska, fire crews start scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of wildfires has eased since the National Weather
Service issued a one-day ''red flag warning'' last week for
wildfires in southcentral Alaska. The interior, however, is
beginning to dry out, said Bill Beebe, coastal regional fire
management officer for the Division of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous time for wildfires is the period after snow
melts and before new grass grows, when low humidity and winds can
quickly dry out dead grasses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California, which only went off the official fire
season in February, has the potential for a ''somewhat worse than
normal'' fire cycle ahead, Forest Service spokesman Matt Mathies
said. California spent a record $145 million on blazes on private
and state lands last year, and the final tally is not finished yet.
</P>
<P>
   The fire spotlight then moves into southern Utah, western
Colorado, Wyoming and central and eastern Montana. Ochoa said those
areas are dry this year. Later in the summer, the northern Rockies
and Pacific Northwest start to burn.

<HEADLINE> DA: My life is in that indictment  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- With District Attorney Jeanine Pirro
in the front row of the gallery, a federal prosecutor said
Wednesday that her husband's ''greed and lust for material
possessions,'' ranging from a Ferrari to a custom-made pigpen, led
him into a tax-fraud conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The husband, lobbyist Albert Pirro, ''subsidized a lavish
lifestyle by cheating on his taxes,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Cathy
Seibel said in her opening statement to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney, who sat with her mother, dismissed the
claims as so much ''theater'' and said she was confident the
charges are false. She called the case ''an overreaching effort by
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   She came to court, she said, because ''My family is in trouble
now.'' She has not been charged in the case and much of the trial's
interest is in how closely she is linked to any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   During her morning in court, the district attorney showed little
emotion. When Seibel alleged that Albert Pirro had spent -- and
illegally deducted -- $70,000 to fight a paternity suit filed
against him, Mrs. Pirro looked toward the jurors once but did not
otherwise react.
</P>
<P>
   When she left during the afternoon session, however, she told
reporters, ''There's not any part of my life that's not in that
indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Gustave Newman acknowledged that Pirro's tax
returns had ''misclassified'' many personal expenses as business
write-offs, but he attributed that to ''the hectic life'' of the
real estate dealmaker, lobbyist and Republican fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't hands on,'' Newman said. ''He did not sit down and
approve every check and look at every check.'' He claimed, for
example, that Pirro signed only 24 percent of the checks issued
from his personal checking account and as few as 2 percent of the
checks drawn on some of his business accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Pirro's brother Anthony, who was his accountant and is a
co-defendant, ''signed a whole series of checks and paid bills
without ever discussing it with him,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Seibel said that between 1988 and 1997, Albert Pirro
''fraudulently deducted ... hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of
personal items as though they were business expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Many involved the Pirros' home in Harrison, she said. Pirro
illegally deducted checks for work ranging from an exterminator's
visit to a pool man to a $45,000 electronically controlled driveway
gate. There was also a custom wrought iron enclosure for the
family's potbellied pigs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Newman implied that the driveway gate was required for Jeanine
Pirro's security. Although Seibel noted that Mrs. Pirro was not yet
district attorney when the gates were designed, Newman said she was
a county judge dealing with murderers and drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Also illegally deducted, Seibel said, were expenses from Jeanine
Pirro's campaigns for public office and the salaries of business
employees Albert Pirro used to do substantial personal work for
himself and his family, including the furnishing of his vacation
home in West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said Pirro's behavior -- keeping just one set of books,
noting some personal expenses on the checks, making records
available to the IRS -- was not the behavior of ''somebody who wants
to commit a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that after Pirro learned his taxes were being
investigated, he amended his returns, showed them to the Internal
Revenue Service and asked, ''Is there anything else you want me to
add?''
</P>
<P>
   Pirro, 52, ended up paying back half a million dollars plus
interest, Newman said -- more than was actually due.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think he got a refund?'' Newman asked the jury. ''You know
what he got? He got an indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Seibel said paying taxes after learning of an investigation
is no more of a defense than ''a bank robber paying the money back
after being caught red-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Pirro's lawyer, Roger Stavis, said several times that
his client was ''only the accountant.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anthony Pirro is not a big shot, not a powerful man, not the
reason why I don't think there's a seat to be had in the
courtroom,'' Stavis said. ''He was paid regular accounting fees for
regular accounting work. ... The evidence will show that there was
no conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The first witness was a real estate agent who testified that
there was no mention of business uses when the West Palm Beach
residence was purchased. Later, an assistant to Albert Pirro said
he spent much of his time at the house in Harrison, but was paid by
two of Pirro's companies. Testimony resumes Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, if convicted, could be sentenced to up to five
years in prison if convicted of any of the scores of counts against
them.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Targeting Media Outlets  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Baton-wielding police beat
protesters Wednesday following a sweeping crackdown on Serbia's
pro-democracy opposition and the seizure of the country's most
popular independent media.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police in full riot gear charged into a
rock-throwing crowd of opposition supporters at rally held late
Wednesday to protest a police raid on Studio B Television, the
country's largest media company not controlled by President
Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic government.
</P>
<P>
   Police also took control of three other independent media
located in the same building -- B2-92 Radio, Index Radio and the
privately owned daily newspaper Blic, infuriating pro-democracy
activists. Another radio station in nearby Pancevo also was taken
off the air Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties announced rallies would be held daily in some
of Serbia's largest cities and were meeting late Wednesday on a
strategy to keep up the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The regime has taken the country into a state of emergency,''
opposition parties said in a joint statement. ''Let us stand
against this violence with all our energy because the future of our
country is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The move against the media followed the government's threat to
clamp down on the opposition following the assassination Saturday
of a regional official which authorities blame on Milosevic's
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders have denied any role in the killing and
claimed the government was simply using the slaying as an excuse to
snuff out the democracy movement and to silence dissenting voices
ahead of elections later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Studio B was taken over because it had
''frequently called for the toppling of the constitutional order
and rebellion against a legally elected government'' in Serbia, the
main Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 30,000 people took to the streets within hours.
Some first attended a late afternoon gathering outside Belgrade's
City Hall, which owns Studio B, to listen to the station's
journalists, who set up a makeshift, open-air program to read their
evening news program over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   As another crowd of several thousand supporters -- mostly soccer
fans -- tried to join the rally, riot police blocked the two groups
from meeting up, causing a tense standoff that erupted into a
clash.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people were injured, including three demonstrators
who were hospitalized with head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday night, Belgrade's main shopping area was littered
with debris, broken glass, overturned garbage cans, some smoldering
after being set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Protests against the media closings were also reported in three
other major Serb cities: 15,000 demonstrators turned out in
Kragujevac in central Serbia and several hundred protested in Novi
Sad, 44 miles northwest of the capital Belgrade, and in Mladenovac,
south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-democracy student group Otpor, or Resistance, blamed for
Saturday's slaying of a senior government official in Novi Sad,
said at least 11 of its activists were detained by police
Wednesday. Other members were arrested in previous days.
</P>
<P>
   The nongovernment media are crucial for the opposition as they
provide some balance in the otherwise biased reporting of the
dominant state media staunchly supporting Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   An infuriated Aleksandar Cotric, head of Studio B's managing
board, said, ''Milosevic's fascist-communist government that has
for years been killing Serbian people has just killed Studio B.''
He added, ''We call on all Belgraders to come to defend their
radio-television.''
</P>
<P>
   Studio B continued transmitting Wednesday, but only as a relay
for news programming from the government station. B2-92,
predominantly a news station, broadcast only music on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Committe to Protect Journalists issued a
statement condemning the raid on the media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, the Serbian authorities have shown their utter
contempt for democratic principles, among them the right of all
people, including journalists, to express themselves without fear
of harassment and intimidation,'' said Ann Cooper, executive
director of CPJ.
</P>
<P>
   A top opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, sent an open letter
to Milosevic, warning of chaos and possible foreign intervention if
the crackdown continues.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
condemned the crackdown and said it would urge Russia, Serbia's
traditional ally, to use its influence to try to rectify the
situation.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board on
Wednesday recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration
advise airline carriers about the dangers of transporting hydrogen
peroxide, a hazardous material that could cause a fire.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB issued its safety recommendations in response to a
hydrogen peroxide spill aboard a Northwest Airlines passenger
flight on Oct. 28, 1998, from Orlando, Fla., to Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The solution leaked from two undeclared plastic containers in
the plane's cargo compartment. The chemical spill was not
discovered until the cargo handlers in Memphis began unloading the
bags.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB reported that the handlers thought it was water and
sent contaminated bags to other destinations. They realized a
caustic chemical had spilled when about a dozen people had to be
treated for exposure.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, a bag that originally was on the Northwest flight
was discovered smoldering in an airplane cargo compartment. One
person was treated there. None of the injuries were serious.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB concluded that the passenger failed to properly package
and identify the hazardous material, and the airline did not ask
enough questions about the cooler she put on the plane. The FAA
bans passengers from bringing hazardous materials onto airliners.
</P>
<P>
   The board recommended that the FAA develop and distribute to
carriers guidance about the difficulty of identifying a hydrogen
peroxide spill and the danger of allowing hydrogen peroxide to dry
on organic materials, which could cause fire.
</P>
<P>
   The board also wants the FAA to issue guidance to carriers about
the need to isolate bags that have been involved in a hazardous
material spill and make sure they are not put on another flight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to promptly identify any hazardous material ...
before allowing passenger baggage or cargo to be distributed to
other aircraft,'' said Robert J. Chipkevich, director of the NTSB
Office of Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB also is urging the FAA to issue guidance to airlines
about the need to notify pilots when cargo involved in a hazardous
material spill is on board a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it's important, whenever hazardous material is on
board an airplane, that the pilot is aware of what the material is
and what hazards it poses,'' Chipkevich said.

<HEADLINE> With attention on Democrats, Republicans target voters and wait  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The other side's ticket features the
Energizer Bunny of campaign spending up against a vilified former
governor with a $2.8 billion tax increase on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Polls say more than half of likely voters don't know the
Republican U.S. Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But with attention now mainly on the Democratic primary,
Republicans say that only helps June's winner in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever our candidate is, I think the guy is going to do very
well because the other two guys on the other side are beating each
other up,'' said Republican State Committee Chairman Garabed
''Chuck'' Haytaian.
</P>
<P>
   ''When all is said and done, we don't have to do a whole lot of
opposition research on those guys. They'll have done it for us,''
Haytaian said.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Corzine is spending more than a million dollars a week on
glossy network television ads to convince Democrats to choose him
over former governor Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Big numbers make big news in that campaign: Corzine's estimated
$400 million personal bankroll and the apparent will to spend it;
Florio's billion-dollar tax increase and the defiant defense of his
action.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have numbers of their own.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. William L. Gormley, R-Atlantic; Essex County
Executive Jim Treffinger; U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, R-7th; and college
professor Murray Sabrin are likely to draw an estimated 250,000
voters, say campaign staffers and political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate with around 40 percent -- in some views that's as
little as 90,000 votes -- gets to challenge the Democratic survivor.
</P>
<P>
   So while Corzine spends to boost name recognition and Florio
fights the ghosts of his past, Republican candidates target
Republican voters with selected mailings and limited television
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ''There really are two different games being played,'' said
Charlie Smith, a spokesman for the Franks campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our audience is different. The Republican campaign is not
being overshadowed by the Democratic campaign by distracting
Republican voters,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   News agencies are following the Democrats for a number of
reasons, said David Murray, a spokesman for Gormley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And, Murray said, it's not just Corzine's money.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is much easier to follow a campaign between two rather than
four,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Florio is ''known by about 99 percent of New Jerseyans'' while
Corzine spends to promote programs the state's ''centrists voters''
won't find appealing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of that adds to the Republican advantage, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe Jon Corzine is spending a small fortune to define
himself as far too much to the left to be acceptable to a very
central state,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   But the talk of Corzine's cash could further lull voters, said
political analyst and Rider University professor David Rebovich.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is almost a mindset in the state that this is a guy that
will spend twice as much in the general campaign,'' Rebovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a former governor can't beat him, what can four
lesser-known guys do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another apparent mark against the Republican candidates is the
fact that Gov. Christie Whitman first appeared to run, then backed
out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately they have the look of second-string about
them,'' Rebovich said.

<HEADLINE> Authorities Lookout for Schlichter  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SUNDHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Federal marshals are fanning out across the
Midwest looking for Art Schlichter, the former Indianapolis Colts
and Ohio State quarterback whose gambling problems ended his NFL
career and led to years of legal troubles.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen marshals are mounting an intense effort to find
Schlichter after learning he recently tried to obtain a handgun
from a friend, authorities said. Police in Grove City, Ohio, a
suburb of Columbus, are also seeking Schlichter on a felony charge
of using someone else's credit card to try to obtain cash.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities Monday charged Schlichter, 40, with money
laundering. Prosecutors say he accepted advance payments for
tickets to sporting events he could not obtain, then tried to repay
the money by making unauthorized charges on his father's credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Schlichter was accused of driving a car at a
motorcycle police officer after a routine traffic stop in Columbus.
He also is free on bond on charges of illegal gambling while he was
in prison recently in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichter also is wanted for violating his probation. He had
been ordered to make daily visits to Hoch Correctional Consultants
and Services in Indianapolis but has not been seen since April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have made the hunt for Schlichter ''a major
case,'' meaning it will get extra manpower and other resources if
need be, Deputy U.S. Marshal Mark Robinett said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known if Schlichter is armed, but agents are proceeding
cautiously. Investigators believe he has left the Indianapolis
area, Robinett said.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents filed this week shed additional light on
allegations that Schlichter swindled money from an Indianapolis
physician.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichter approached the doctor in September with an investment
scheme to buy tickets to sporting events, then sell them at a
profit. She gave him more than $100,000, according to an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, Schlichter used the threat of media
exposure to get the woman to give him more money, but he never
obtained the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The woman later had to turn to her father to pay debts that
arose from the payments to Schlichter. Her father -- also a doctor --
asked Schlichter to repay $45,000, the affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichter said he could make payments with credit cards that
were in his father's name. He demanded that the woman's father make
charges on the credit cards from his business. Some of the money
from the credit charges was repaid to the woman's father, some went
in cash to Schlichter.
</P>
<P>
   In early February, authorities said, Schlichter also contacted a
sports-related business and offered to sell it tickets to the NCAA
Final Four. The Sports Corp. in Indianapolis gave him $6,000 for
tickets that Schlichter never obtained. Schlichter later said he
could repay the money with a $15,000 charge to his father's credit
cards if the business would return $8,100 in cash to him.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichter's father, John ''Max'' Schlichter, told an IRS
investigator last month that he never authorized his son to use the
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Wednesday at his Columbus, Ohio, home, the elder
Schlichter declined to comment on the case against his son.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on the federal charges, Art Schlichter faces up to
20 years in prison. He faces five years on the Ohio felony charge.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichter, a first-round draft pick by the then-Baltimore Colts
in 1982, was suspended by the NFL in 1983 when it was learned that
bookies threatened him over $150,000 in gambling debts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Schlichter returned to the Colts, who by then had
relocated to Indianapolis. He was released following the 1985
season.
</P>
<P>
   Schlichter was freed from an Indiana prison last September after
serving less than half of a four-year sentence on charges of theft,
forgery and fraud in connection with the theft of $800,000 to
support his gambling habit.
</P>
<P>
   Since his release, he has been charged with using the Indiana
prison's pay phones to bet on football and hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   Before beginning his Indiana prison term, Schlichter served a
federal sentence in Kentucky for a probation violation. He
surrendered to Indiana authorities on Jan. 26, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Flyers-Devils Getting Testy  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- After Game 1 of the Eastern
Conference finals, officials at the First Union Center in
Philadelphia beefed up security in the wake of a fight in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   While that calmed things down for the fans for Game 2, it got
downright nasty on the ice between the New Jersey Devils and
Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   There were hits galore, pushing and shoving after the whistle, a
couple of fights, some stick work, facial massages -- with gloves
on, of course -- and a lot of trash talking as the Flyers posted a
4-3 win to even the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   With a couple of injuries added in and some bruised egos, the
potential for more rough stuff might increase on Thursday night,
when the turnpike series between the long-time rivals crosses the
border from Pennsylvania to New Jersey for Game 3 at Continental
Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams will probably be missing a center.
</P>
<P>
   Daymond Langkow, who scored the game-winner, sustained a
concussion in a collision with Devils defenseman Scott Stevens
early in the third period, the Flyers said Wednesday. His status is
being listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't go, right wing Mark Recchi will move to center,
rookie Simon Gagne will move to the top line and forward Mark Greig
will play for only the second time in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Devils rookie center John Madden will be sidelined with an
injured right knee. The team did not disclose the exact nature of
the injury, but it said an MRI on Wednesday revealed it was similar
to the one sustained by Sergei Brylin in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Brylin did not require surgery but was unable to skate for two
weeks and missed six games.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Brule, who had 30 goals for Albany of the AHL this season,
is expected to make his NHL debut in filling in what would be
another physical game.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is only one thing we are worried about, that's winning
the series,'' said Devils center Bobby Holik, who exchanged big
checks with Flyers defenseman Dan McGillis in Game 2 and later
bowled over Flyers goaltender Brian Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't go out there to try to injure some of the other
players because that's not why we play,'' Holik added. ''We want to
win four games as soon as we can. We're not worried about
revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Devils and coach Larry Robinson are concerned about is
letting the rough stuff take them out of their game. New Jersey
doesn't mind the physical play, but it becomes a problem when the
players are more concerned about hitting rather than staying in
position and doing the little things that win games.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and some veterans like Claude Lemieux have reminded
everyone it's better to turn the other cheek sometimes and not get
involved.
</P>
<P>
   That's not always easy, rookie Scott Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happens if you work in an office and some guy comes up
and hits you,'' Gomez said. ''What are you going to want to do? Do
you want to get fired or keep your job?
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to play, you have to suck that up,'' Gomez said.
''It works both ways. We're not angels and they're not angels. It's
part of hockey and we've all gone through it. But yeah, you'd
definitely like the get the guy back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost certain the Flyers will continue to play a physical
game. That's just their style. They like to get the puck in the
offense zone, work in the corners, get shots and crash the net for
the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a style of hockey that we like to play,'' said
Flyers center Keith Primeau, who set up Rick Tocchet's second goal
with a play behind the net. ''We want to make contact. That's how
we play, we create turnovers that way. That's how we generate our
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers' four goals in Game 2 were the most given up the
Devils in the playoffs this season, and they were all scored even
strength. The win also snapped a five-game losing streak against
New Jersey this season.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has struggled even more against the Devils in New
Jersey, going 4-22-2 over the past five years here.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we can play against anybody anywhere,'' Flyers coach
Craig Ramsay said. ''I don't care where the game is. I don't think
it bothers our players, they believe in what they're doing. Believe
me, our players aren't going over statistics from two years ago,
nobody cares.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Inflation Worries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices slipped Wednesday, amid expectations
that the Federal Reserve hasn't finished raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell { point,
or $5.00 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, rose to 6.49 percent from 6.42 percent late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 1/16 points with the yield
rising to 6.18 percent from 6.10 percent a day earlier, according
to Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
   Traders are worried the Federal Reserve, which has raised
short-term rates six times since June 1999, will raise them again
in an effort to contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the central bank raised rates by one-half percentage
point and said it remained worried about the risk of rising
inflation. The five previous rate hikes had each been a more
moderate one-quarter point.
</P>
<P>
   Rising interest rates reduce the value of investments that pay a
fixed rate of return, such as bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Tuesday, short-term Treasury securities fell
1/16 to 3/32 point, while intermediate maturities ranged from
declines of [ point to { point.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 6.03 percent while
the discount rate was 5.87 percent, down 0.15 percentage point from
Tuesday. Yields are the interest bills pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Six-month yields finished at 6.41 percent with a discount of
6.14 percent, falling 0.09 percentage point from Tuesday. One-year
yields settled at 6.34 percent with a discount of 6.03 percent,
falling 0.01 percentage point from late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, rose to 6 percent from 5.75 percent late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3/16 point to 92 1/16. The average
yield to maturity rose to 6.22 percent from 6.21 percent.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Scarf Outrages Exiles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Cuban Americans were outraged after seeing
photographs of Elian Gonzalez wearing a blue scarf, which is the
uniform of the Pioneers, a communist youth group.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Americans said Tuesday the photographs, published in
the Cuban newspaper Granma, are proof that the Castro government is
brainwashing the 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban diplomats scoffed at the accusations that Elian is being
brainwashed. They said the scarf is part of his school uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children go to school in uniform -- just the way they do at
private schools in the United States. I don't see what the problem
is,'' said Luis Fernandez, spokesman for the Cuban Interests
Section in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While federal courts decide whether to send Elian back to Cuba,
he has been living at a Maryland retreat with his father. He has
been there since shortly after he was seized by federal agents last
month from the home of Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The five photographs apparently were taken while he was
receiving instruction from a Cuban teacher sent to Maryland. It is
unclear when they were taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''No -- it seems communism has penetrated the United States,''
said Ramon Chong, a Miami area security guard who came to the
United States from Cuba four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been in the United States since Thanksgiving Day, when
two men out fishing found him clinging to an inner tube off the
coast of South Florida. The boy's mother died trying to flee their
country in a boat that capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, an attorney for Elian's great-uncle Lazaro
Gonazlez, said the Miami relatives plan to complain to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, selects the boy's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not the INS's business what Elian wears on daily
basis,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bombing Rebuilt Rights Movement  </HEADLINE>
By KENDAL WEAVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- In the basement of the Sixteenth Street
Baptist Church, the four black girls in white dresses were getting
ready for the main Youth Day service. As it would be recounted
later, the last conversation of their lives was on their
Sunday-school class topic: ''The Love That Forgives.''
</P>
<P>
   For many in the generation of the civil rights era, the dynamite
explosion that killed the four girls at the church in downtown
Birmingham on Sept. 15, 1963, was a turning point -- an act of
segregationist violence that made the struggle for equal rights a
national cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was mind-boggling in its depravity,'' said Taylor Branch,
author of a history of the civil rights period. ''Bombing churches
while girls are getting ready to go to Sunday school was
unspeakably evil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It made some people stand up and speak out against racial
hatred and violence and segregation,'' said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.,
who was in Alabama and went to the scene of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw the devastation. I remained for the funerals,'' he said.
''More than anything else, I think it created a sense of righteous
indignation.''
</P>
<P>
   It also expanded the movement. Lewis said voting rights
demonstrations in Selma and elsewhere, culminating in passage of
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, were a product of the church
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Selma was conceived as an answer to this crime,'' said Branch.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing came after months of protests in Birmingham,
including children's demonstrations as segregationists sought to
keep blacks out of schools and public places.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children had been so vitally a part of those demonstrations,
and the church bombed was the church they marched out of,'' said
Branch. ''It was chilling, a brutal attack on the very place where
the movement came of age, nationally really.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the bombers were seeking to intimidate the movement, the
crime did just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think tragedy always moves good people to make a
commitment,'' said the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a leader of the
demonstrations in Birmingham in the 1960s and now a pastor in
Cincinnati. ''It's unfortunate that it's like that, but it does.''
</P>
<P>
   The church was not the headquarters of the movement, said
Shuttlesworth, but it was ideally located downtown as the site
where demonstrators could gather for mass protests. Today it is
something of a shrine of the movement, located across the street
from the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and memorials to the
black children and others who survived snarling police dogs and
fire hoses -- and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttlesworth, whose home was bombed twice, said the jailing
Wednesday of two former Ku Klux Klansmen in the 1963 church bombing
is good for the families of the victims and the many others who
suffered in a reign of Klan violence in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brings some relief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttlesworth said the deaths of the girls showed the extent of
the danger for those involved. But, he said, ''we already had made
a commitment: No matter what happened, we would struggle on.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush's presidential campaign,
getting ready for the general election battle, is expanding its
senior staff -- including the hiring of a new deputy to chief
strategist Karl Rove who started work Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hennick, most recently a lobbyist with former Republican
National Committee chairman Haley Barbour's firm and a former
political operative for both the RNC and the Republican Governors
Association, joined the campaign as Rove's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has bolstered his staff with several new senior aides in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Feather, a Missouri political telemarketing consultant,
recently joined the campaign as political director. John
Bridgeland, a former aide to Rep. Rob Portman of Ohio, is the new
deputy policy director. A former aide to President Bush, Joe Hagin,
is deputy campaign manger for operations and scheduling, working
directly under campaign manager Joe Allbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   Two new spokesmen also have come on board.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker Eskew, communications director when Carroll Campbell was
governor of South Carolina, will be senior communications adviser
and regional press director. Ray Sullivan, a new deputy press
secretary, has campaign experience in California, Ohio, and worked
in Bush's gubernatorial office in Austin. Most recently, Sullivan
was communications director for the Texas lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Dowd, who worked for Maverick Media, which produced
Bush's early campaign ads, also has joined the operation as
director of polling and media planning.

Wednesday that ''we could see the end of Social Security as we know
it'' under George W. Bush's plan to allow private investment of
government retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning a continent away in Washington state, accused
his Democratic presidential rival of being ''mired in the past''
while Bush leads by proposing changes to ensure Social Security's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Gore addressed a big AARP convention, campaigning for Florida's
25 electoral votes and support from senior citizens nationwide. He
quoted from Bush's news conference on Tuesday to argue that the
Republican has moved onto dangerous ground with his proposal -- not
entirely fleshed out in specifics -- to allow Americans to invest
some of their Social Security taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In that news conference in Oregon, Bush, the Texas governor,
said it was ''conceivable'' that a worker taking advantage of the
investment accounts would get a lower guaranteed benefit from
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, and I quote word for word, 'That's all up for
discussion,''' Gore told AARP members at their biennial convention.
Some of them groaned.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all due respect, I don't think your retirement security
should be up for discussion,'' Gore added.
</P>
<P>
   The senior citizens applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had also said it was possible workers would eventually be
allowed to invest their entire Social Security tax, not just a
portion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the group he ''could scarcely believe it'' when he
read those comments. ''Governor Bush said that what he really
envisioned was -- and I'm quoting again here -- 'a system where
personal savings accounts are the predominant part -- a completely
different world.'''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president added that because Bush could not guarantee a
minimum benefit, ''In his 'completely different world' -- in his
phrase -- we could see the end of Social Security as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has alternately proposed using budget surpluses to infuse
the Social Security Trust Fund with revenues for the baby boom's
retirement. He would also improve benefits for widows and
homemakers at an estimated cost of $100 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Washington state, Bush told reporters Wednesday:
''My job as the president is to assure Congress that I will spend
the capital necessary to get something done and lay out the
framework for reforms. This is an issue that shows the vice
president is mired in the past and my campaign is willing to think
about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, just before Gore spoke in a cavernous hall to the
AARP, a local official, Orange County Chairman Mel Martinez, called
reporters to a side room and said Gore should ''stop spreading fear
and panic'' on Social Security -- now the centerpiece issue of the
Bush-Gore contest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe candidate Al Gore came to the AARP convention to
scare his way to the White House,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the convention, Republicans, Democrats and independents
alike seemed cold to Bush's proposed change in the Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''It puts it at risk,'' said Mary Ann Van Oostendorp, 63, a
Republican postal worker from Woodbridge, N.J. ''True it's a bull
market. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ''Not right now. It's up and down, up and down. It's scary,''
interrupted her retired husband, Bart, an independent. ''That's
scary. It's been guaranteed since Roosevelt.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Steiman, 77, from Orlando, said, ''The way the market is
going, I don't want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that this campaign could create a generational
schism, Van Oostendorp, who said he is leaning toward Gore solely
on the Social Security issue, worried that younger workers could be
drawn to Bush's plan. ''Those who made a killing (on the stock
market) are going to say it's a good plan! It's a good plan!''
</P>
<P>
   Beaming from a front row at the Orange County Convention Center
was Gore's 87-year-old mother, Pauline. She flew here aboard Air
Force Two from her granddaughter's law school graduation in New
York Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The plane made a detour through Nashville, Tenn., en route back
to Washington, where Gore and his wife were to celebrate their 30th
wedding anniversary with a long weekend at home, so that Gore could
give his mother a ride home and meet with his media crew filming
campaign footage.
</P>
<P>
   Horace Deets, executive director of the 34-million-member AARP,
said Bush declined invitations to speak at Wednesday's convention,
as well as forums earlier this year in Iowa, New Hampshire, South
Carolina and Michigan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Soldiers To Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By MUHARRAM M. NUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (AP) -- Attorneys for 24 Indonesian
soldiers convicted Wednesday of murdering dozens of villagers
during a massacre in Indonesia's Aceh province said that they would
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants -- the soldiers and one civilian guide -- were
found guilty and sentenced in Indonesia's first human rights trial.
The prison terms ranged from eight years and six months to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists criticized the sentences as too short,
given the brutality of the crime, and said that military commanders
who ordered the massacre of 56 students and their teacher at an
Islamic boarding school last July should also be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings by a joint civilian-military tribunal came after
prosecutors dropped demands for the death penalty, saying the
defendants had only obeyed orders.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict in the landmark trial is seen as a victory for the
reformist government of President Abdurrahman Wahid, who has vowed
to end systematic human rights abuses by the Indonesian army, which
has been waging a war against separatist rebels in Aceh for the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government and rebels agreed in Switzerland to
start open talks on the future of the province. A cease-fire is due
to come into effect June 2 and last for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Embittered by years of military crackdowns and perceived
economic exploitation, the Free Aceh Movement is fighting for
independence for their province, located on the northern tip of
Sumatra Island.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 people have been killed in the fighting in Aceh
in the last decade, including about 350 this year.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, one of the defendants' attorneys, Burhan
Dahlan, said his clients would appeal the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judges have closed their eyes to the facts presented to
them,'' he said. ''We are disappointed with the verdicts and will
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the military's legal department, Maj. Gen. Timor
Manurung, said the armed forces would respect the verdict, but he
said the defendants had the right to appeal if they felt their
sentences were too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   However, a human rights activist in Indonesia's capital Jakarta
said the sentences should have ranged from 20 years to life in
prison and accused prosecutors of failing to go after top
commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict ''isn't fair as it's only the lower ranking soldiers
who are going to be punished,'' said Hendardi, the director of the
private Indonesian Human Rights Association. ''The commanders who
were responsible are going to go free,'' he said in an interview in
Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> House, Senate Panels OK China Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a big victory for President Clinton and a
blow for labor, legislation normalizing trade relations with China
overwhelmingly won the support Wednesday of key committees in the
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee approved the measure 34-4 as
previously undecided committee members flocked to support the
administration. A showdown on the House floor was set for next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Senate Finance Committee approved the legislation
18-1.
</P>
<P>
   The wide margin was expected in the Senate, where the overall
measure has broad support. But in the House, organized labor has
waged a fierce campaign against the legislation, undercutting
Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vote by the House committee with jurisdiction over
trade matters, sponsors still expected a close floor vote. A
majority of House Democrats continues to oppose the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would end 20 years of annual congressional votes on
China's trade status and grant Beijing ''permanent normal trade
relations,'' the same low-tariff access to U.S. markets nearly
every other nation in the world now enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   It also would ease China's entry into the World Trade
Organization, the Geneva-based organization that oversees
international trade.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee added bipartisan language designed to
protect U.S. industries from surges in certain exports from China.
It would allow the president to grant financial relief to
industries battered by such surges.
</P>
<P>
   Separate legislation to set up a commission to monitor human
rights in China was also expected to be included once the bill gets
to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote provided a big boost for the administration and
its congressional allies, who have been carefully counting support
vote-by-vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''The votes reflect the strength of the agreement and affirm the
president's policy of engagement with China,'' Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton welcomed ''the strong bipartisan votes in both
committees'' and pledged in a statement to ''redouble my efforts''
to build support for the legislation in advance of next week's
House vote. The president is considering a five-minute address to
the nation on Sunday evening to promote the legislation,
congressional supporters of the bill said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in a commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in
New London, Conn., Clinton said Congress can help influence whether
China will ''emerge as a partner or an adversary.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure drew only four negative votes in the House, all
Democratic: Reps. Fortney Pete Stark, D-Calif.; William J. Coyne,
D-Pa.; John Lewis, D-Ga; and Gerald D. Kleczka, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   At least six committee members -- five of them Democrats -- who
had previously been undecided voted for the bill: Reps. Mac
Collins, R-Ga.; Benjamin Cardin, D-Md.; Karen L. Thurman, D-Fla.;
Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas; William Jefferson, D-La.; and Richard Neal,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, three other previously undecided Republicans
announced they would vote for the bill: House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Reps. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., and
Rick Hill, R-Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Capitol, the Senate Finance Committee chairman,
William Roth, R-Del., said the legislation was ''a defining moment
in our relationship with China.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a member of the
committee, said he hoped the bill would be ''approved
overwhelmingly'' by the Senate next month. ''It's not a totally
easy vote ... but I think you've got to look at the benefits for
this country ... and within China itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters assert the legislation will open China's vast markets
to U.S. businesses and help bring the nation of 1.2 billion people
-- the world's most populous -- into the world community. Labor
opposes it, criticizing China's human rights and worker protection
policies and suggesting the measure could cost American
manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The sole Senate vote against the bill came from Sen. Jim
Jeffords, R-Vt. He said he was protesting the continued
imprisonment in China of a Tibetan musicologist, Ngawang Choepel,
who attended a Vermont college.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some proponents are skeptical that China's record on
human rights would improve as a result of normalized economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who say change will come quickly may be misjudging 5,000
years of Chinese history,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller and others said they were persuaded that it would
help open Chinese markets to U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   On the House side, Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the senior
Democrat on the panel, and Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., reached
agreement with Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, on the
export surge-protection language.
</P>
<P>
   Levin and Bereuter also are pushing for creation of a human
rights commission that would issue annual reports on China's
performance to take the place of the annual congressional vote.

<HEADLINE> Southern U.S. Facing Drought  </HEADLINE>
By CHAD ROEDEMEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Green lawns are tough to find in the South this
spring, as a lack of rain and water restrictions have left
homeowners helpless against a drought that also has forest
officials fearing a summer of wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   ''My grass is already turning dry and crunching under your
feet,'' said Kathy Holloway, who lives about 30 miles northeast of
Atlanta. ''And it's only May. That's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters are predicting extreme drought conditions this
summer in parts of the Southeast and Midwest -- a combination of hot
weather and little rain that spells bad news for lawns, gardens and
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Southeast, 432,297 acres have burned so far this
year. By contrast, the high-profile fires in the Southwest have
scorched 130,000 fewer acres, according to the National Interagency
Fire Center.
</P>
<P>
   Through Monday, forest fires had consumed 42,347 acres in
Georgia -- nearly as much as in all of 1999, when 47,370 acres
burned. And the hottest, driest part of the year is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Garden center managers say people are buying fewer trees and
shrubs this summer, apparently fearing that they will wither in the
unrelenting sun.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really off from last year, and last year we had a drought
too,'' said Brad Balsis, manager of Habersham Gardens in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Newly planted trees and shrubs are particularly sensitive to dry
conditions. The only solution during a drought is constant
watering, which can get expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Many local governments already have started restricting outdoor
water use to certain days or times, and things will only get
tougher for gardeners as the summer heats up.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people aren't allowed to water their sod, they don't buy it
because it's going to die,'' said Kevin Stroner, sales manager at
Southeastern Sod in Lawrenceville.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration are predicting extreme drought conditions in
Georgia, Florida and parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, extreme drought conditions are predicted for
Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Indiana and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Climatologist David Stooksbury of the University of Georgia said
rainfall in the state has been below average for more than two
years, and most of the Georgia is from 5 to 15 inches below normal
precipitation levels for this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   The drought is even more frightening for farmers, which is why
Claxton Mayor Perry Lee DeLoach organized a prayer service Tuesday
in the southeast Georgia town.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers and farmers gathered to pray for rain, singing the
hymn, ''There Shall Be Showers of Blessing,'' which says, ''Mercy
drops round us are falling, but for the showers we plead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Robert Healy of St. Christopher's Catholic Church in
Claxton said one man at the prayer service was upset by the
participants' lack of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he was ashamed no one brought their umbrellas,'' Healy
said.

<HEADLINE> Haitians, Reporters Rescued At Sea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- A U.S. Coast Guard ship rescued 44
illegal Haitian migrants and two U.S. free-lance journalists from a
sinking sailboat off Haiti, the Coast Guard said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of the Coast Guard cutter Forward spotted the 35-foot
sailboat slowly sinking late Sunday in international waters about
20 miles northwest of Haiti, the Coast Guard said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard team boarded the vessel and determined it was
unseaworthy. The Coast Guard ship took all 46 people northward to
Great Inagua Island in the Bahamas, arriving early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 44 Haitians were being transferred to Nassau, the Bahamian
capital, on Wednesday, said William Nottage, Bahamian
superintendent of immigration. They were to be interviewed, and the
government will decide whether they will be repatriated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two journalists left on their own to return home, Nottage
said.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Mathis, a spokeswoman for The New York Times, said the
free-lancers, writer Michael Finkel, and a photographer, were
working on an article for The New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Bahamian officials identified the photographer as Christopher
Anderson, but Mathis said she was not sure of his name or where the
journalists are based.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were on assignment for The New York Times Magazine, but I
don't have any further details,'' Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, thousands of Haitians attempt illegal boat trips to
the United States, crammed into rickety boats. Last month, 288
Haitians were rescued when their boat ran aground in the Bahamas,
and rescuers found two dead. Survivors said as many as 17 died.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have complained of a surge in the number of Haitian
migrants as the country readies itself for long-delayed elections
on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Clash Mars Soccer Match in Denmark  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTIAN WIENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Riot police fired tear gas into a
crowd of brawling English and Turkish soccer fans Wednesday after
at least three people were stabbed in violence surrounding the UEFA
Cup final.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's Galatasaray beat London Arsenal 4-1 in a penalty
shootout after the game ended 0-0 after overtime. Galatasaray is
the first Turkish club to win one of Europe's two major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now calling police officers from the rest of Denmark to
help us try to divide the supporters after the game and then we
will try to take as many of them as possible to the airport,''
police chief superintendent Mogins Lauridsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Lauridsen said a Dutch man who was stabbed in the stomach was in
serious condition, and a Turkish man and an English fan sustained
superficial stab wounds in the fighting that broke out in the late
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At least 26 were arrested and five others were seriously injured
in the afternoon melee, including head injuries, a broken ankle and
one person whose ear was partially severed, Lauridsen said. He said
those charged with the most serious crimes would face a hearing,
while the others would be deported.
</P>
<P>
   In Turkey, celebrations throughout the country were marred as
nine people were wounded by stray bullets as guns were fired in joy
despite warnings by the police.
</P>
<P>
   At least 24,000 Turkish and English fans flocked to Copenhagen
to watch Wednesday night's match.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting broke out in the late afternoon when hundreds of
supporters of both teams started chasing each other around a
downtown square, throwing bottles and uprooting tables and
flagpoles as helmeted riot police arrived and fired tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   The tear gas chased the fans to another part of the City Hall
Square, but they continued fighting using iron bars and anything
else they could grab until police regained control after more than
hour. It was the same square where clashes had erupted in the early
morning hours, resulting in the stabbing of 41-year-old Arsenal fan
Paul Dineen of London.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a snack bar on the square who refused to give his
name said a group of people wearing Galatasaray jerseys attacked an
English fan with a bloody chair from a cafe until he was taken away
in an ambulance with severe head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The violence came amid fears that English hooligans would
attempt to avenge the killing of two English fans last month before
Leeds' first-leg semifinal in Istanbul against Galatasaray.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 officers -- 20 percent of Denmark's police force --
were dispatched for the game, with assistance from some two dozen
police officers from England, Turkey and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The littered streets downtown were largely quiet by Wednesday
evening as most of the fans and police had moved to the Parken
stadium for the game. Two miles of fence was erected at the stadium
to keep supporters separated before and after the match.
</P>
<P>
   Dineen had left the hospital and was going to be taken to the
game and given a dignitary's seat, an Arsenal spokesman told the
British Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   In Ankara, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit urged fans to be
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sports should be an initiative for friendship, not for
fighting,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Jackson St. Track on Probation  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY R. BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The men's cross country and track and
field programs at Jackson State were placed on five years'
probation by the NCAA for numerous violations dating to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment, which limits athletic grants and makes the
school ineligible for postseason championships for two years, was
announced Wednesday by the NCAA Committee on Infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Jack Friedenthal said in a teleconference
that Jackson State was slapped with stiff penalties because the
historically black institution had similar violations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''A number of international athletes received cash for living
expenses. A number of athletes competed while ineligible. The head
coach was found to be engaged in unreasonable conduct,''
Friedenthal said. ''As a result of all of this, the university was
found to lack institutional control.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA made Jackson State ineligible for postseason
competition for the 2001-02 season. The school already imposed a
sanction, making itself ineligible for postseason competition in
2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The committee limited Jackson State to no more than nine
grants-in-aid in men's cross country and track during the current
year, 10 during the following season, and 11 beginning in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The school already had imposed a cut in scholarships for the
program. A total of six scholarships will be cut through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Among the violations, Jackson State athletes used the names of
teammates in order to get around eligibility problems and
participate in track and cross country, the NCAA said.
</P>
<P>
   Former coach Willie McCoy was found to have provided cash,
ranging from $200 to $500, to seven international student-athletes
to pay for meals during holiday periods.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, who retired in July, distributed $7,320 of university
money from 1995-99 to cover room and board for team members
ineligible to receive it, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-year period ending in 1997, McCoy provided cash to
three international student-athletes in small amounts to pay for
the cost of laundry, long-distance telephone calls, transportation
and other items, the NCAA said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NCAA, former Jackson State athletic director
Paul Covington approved the payments.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I signed off for that, that was a terrible oversight on my
part,'' Covington, who retired last spring, said after an
investigation began into the violations.
</P>
<P>
   Several international athletes were also given impermissible
housing benefits and participated in out-of-season practices,
according to the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy's lack of experience may have been the reason for some of
the violations, Friedenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the whole, especially since we were dealing with a
first-year coach that really didn't have any experience ... there
was a lot of stuff done from the goodness of the heart,'' he said.
''Many of the things, like the payment of the funds to help
student-athletes during Christmas vacation, he just didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Freidenthal, however, didn't cut the school any slack.
</P>
<P>
   He said Jackson State did not exercise control over the programs
and NCAA officials will visit the university periodically to see if
things have improved.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson State will have to prepare an annual progress report for
the NCAA as part of the probation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is standard procedure for violations for any schools,''
Friedenthal said. ''The enforcement staff will take the time needed

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, governor expected to allow towns to thin deer herds  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The trees are all chewed up. More than 300
deer get hit by cars each year. Lyme disease is a constant worry.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to leafy Princeton Township -- a wealthy Mercer County
community overrun by an estimated 1,300 deer. That's more than four
times what the 16-square-mile township can comfortably accommodate,
according to wildlife experts.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Senate bill up for a vote Thursday, township officials
would be allowed to bring in sharpshooters to thin the herd and
correct what they say is an ecological imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deer-car accidents have increased over the last 20 years from
30 a year to over 300,'' said Tom Poole, a member of the township's
wildlife committee. ''Forget the fact that it costs an average of
$2,500 to fix the car. It's the danger factor. And, it's a cruel
way for the animals to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole also laments the damage the deer do to the woods. With so
many, they ravage entire stands of trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't replace the saplings that they are destroying in the
woods, where tomorrow's forests are going to be determined by what
the deer are eating today,'' Poole added. ''Pretty soon the woods
are going to be nothing but garlic mustard, which the deer won't
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, A-2129, would allow towns to apply to the Division of
Fish, Game and Wildlife to, essentially, break state hunting rules
and use various methods to kill deer.
</P>
<P>
   While contraception is mentioned in the bill, ''deer
management'' typically means bringing in marksmen, putting down
bait to lure the deer and then shooting them, probably at night.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Princeton Township would likely do, Poole said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd probably have one person who would move each night to a
particular spot,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lund, acting chief of the state's Bureau of Wildlife
Management, said controlled hunts pose no public threat.
</P>
<P>
   Similar programs are conducted in other states, he said, and
''in most cases, the community is not even aware a control
operation is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A community-based management plan has all kinds of checks and
balances, including approvals at various levels, before a community
can put this into effect,'' Poole added. ''This is not the six-pack
crowd running around in your backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed both houses last year, but Gov. Christie Whitman
vetoed it in January, citing public safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, bill supporters have added additional safety
measures, such as requiring county prosecutors to approve the use
of silencers and mandating public notification on when and where
the hunts will take place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're comfortable that the bill now addresses the public
safety issues raised by the governor,'' said Jayne O'Connor,
Whitman's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed the Assembly in March, so if it passes the
Senate Thursday as expected, it heads to the governor's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, a town would first have to apply to the
state for a permit to hunt at night, use high-powered rifles and
silencers and otherwise prohibited measures.
</P>
<P>
   Towns would submit plans for the hunt, including information
about an organization they might hire to shoot the deer.
</P>
<P>
   The bill applies to both suburbs, where deer are destroying
property and getting hit by cars, and rural areas, where they are
damaging farmers' fields.
</P>
<P>
   Airports also could be designated as areas for controlled hunts
if it's determined that deer are a danger to planes taking off or
landing.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates put the state's deer herd at 200,000, double what it
was 20 years ago. Crop damage related to deer has been measured in
the millions of dollars, and about 19,000 car accidents last year
were caused by deer.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the bill have objected to allowing the use of
silencers and nighttime shooting. Animal rights advocates say
allowing more hunting of deer is not a solution. They have
suggested farmers use higher fences around crop fields and airports
and place road reflectors to alert motorists to deer.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Count on Pippen  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Whenever Scottie Pippen disappears, his
Portland Trail Blazers teammates know he won't be gone for long.
</P>
<P>
   Take Tuesday night's playoff game against the Utah Jazz. Pippen
had struggled his previous three games, scoring just 15 points,
including a six-point effort in Sunday's Game 4, which Utah won to
avoid being swept.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen came back with nine points in the first quarter of Game
5. Then he was quiet again until late the fourth quarter, when he
made a series of huge plays, highlighted by his game-winning
3-pointer with 7.3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once it left his hand, it felt good, and after watching the
replay, you just saw the confidence. You knew it was going in,''
teammate Steve Smith said. ''He didn't have particularly great
games the last two or three games against Utah, but then he comes
up with the big game the one we need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen finished with 23 points, nine rebounds, eight assists,
three steals and one block in the 81-79 victory, which sent the
Blazers to the Western Conference finals to face the Los Angeles
Lakers. Game 1 is Saturday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's all-around performance won raves from Phil Jackson, the
Lakers' coach who helped Pippen and Michael Jordan win six titles
when they were in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to think I helped develop that ability,'' Jackson
said Wednesday. ''He's the one that did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, dogged for years by his narcissistic reputation, has
become a model of selflessness in Portland. He doesn't demand the
shot, unless he sees a matchup he can exploit. He calls it a
''luxury'' to have other scoring options on the team, and isn't
bothered when he isn't the focus of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Blazers' 91 games this season, Pippen scored in single
digits 28 times. Yet he never publicly complained about his shots
or the offense one time, preferring to be a $14.8 million role
player.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to do what I've got to do to help us win, and that's
something I've been trying to do all season long,'' he said before
Wednesday's practice. ''Whatever holes we need to be plugged, I'm
going to try to plug them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on his dramatic 3-pointer Tuesday night, his first thought
was to get the ball inside to Rasheed Wallace. But when Utah's
Bryon Russell eased off to guard against the post feed, he took the
best shot available.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scottie's value to all his teams has been that he's a great
defender and more of a playmaker, a decision maker,'' Portland
coach Mike Dunleavy said. ''He made all the big plays down the
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said he couldn't rank his 3-pointer among the most clutch
shots of his career, because he didn't know yet how important it
will turn out to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can only answer that after we win the championship,'' he
said. ''But it was a big shot. It helped us to advance to the next
round, but there's a lot more basketball to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing to be traded out of Chicago last year, Pippen
forced a trade from Houston after he ripped into Rockets teammate
Charles Barkley on national TV. He arrived in Portland with baggage
in tow, but he joined a team that was willing to overlook his
character flaws for a chance at a title.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen not only has avoided tarnishing his reputation further,
he's become the team's trusted leader, especially since the
postseason began. He averaged 12.5 points during the regular
season, but has boosted that to 14.8 in the playoffs. He's also
kept Wallace from getting numerous technical fouls by calming him
down in heated situations.
</P>
<P>
   With Pippen in the lineup, there's no way the Blazers will
repeat their blowup of a year ago, when they lost their cool and
were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing they lacked was just a little bit of guidance,
and I think a lot of the players have leadership qualities, but
none of them was really willing to step up and sort of lead that
task for us,'' Pippen said. ''So I tried to take it upon myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen said there's nothing special about playing Jackson, other
than the chance it gives him for another shot at the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a player, you know how hard it is to get where you are
right now, and you know that these opportunities don't come very
often,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 8, Dodgers 6  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs have more things to worry about
than unruly fans. Like their combustible bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen hit a pinch-hit home run, and Eric Karros singled in
the go-ahead run Wednesday afternoon as the Los Angeles Dodgers
rallied in the ninth inning for an 8-6 victory over the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre also had an RBI in the three-run ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to watch because I believe this club has played a
lot better than its record,'' said Cubs manager Don Baylor, whose
team was booed as the game ended. ''We just can't close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''... We have to reevaluate and see where we are,'' Baylor said.
''We just can't keep going through this.''
</P>
<P>
   At least there were no repeats of Tuesday night, when the
Dodgers brawled with fans after someone hit bullpen catcher Chad
Kreuter and stole his hat. Several Dodgers teammates and coaches
followed Kreuter into the stands, and it took security personnel
nine minutes -- and several tries -- to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Three fans were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.
Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations in
the commissioner's office, made it clear that some sort of
punishment is in order for the Dodgers who were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''There really is never any excuse for going into the stands,''
Alderson said. ''It is not only not acceptable, it exposes players
and other uniformed personnel to risks and liabilities. At any
level, it is not a tolerable response.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs increased security around the bullpens, and there
didn't appear to be any problems Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We turned the page on (Tuesday) night,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's bullpen has blown nine of its 16 save opportunities
(56 percent) this season. It has given up 17 home runs, and has a
7.45 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Rick Aguilera, who has 295 career saves, blew his fourth
save chance Wednesday. He took the mound in the ninth with a 6-5
lead, and promptly gave up a homer to Hansen, the first batter he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to come in and face your teammates and coaching
staff,'' said Aguilera, who also blew a save Sunday. ''It's a
combination of things. Bottom line is somehow, I've got to turn it
around when I'm given the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Hansen's second homer of the season. Both were as
pinch-hitters, giving him eight for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arguably the toughest job in baseball is to come off the bench
and be effective. He's been doing that his entire career,'' Karros
said of Hansen. ''He's one of the most valuable guys we have on the
club. He knows his role and he knows it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera retired the next two batters on flies before being
relieved by Felix Heredia. Heredia (1-1) hit Shawn Green, the first
batter he faced, and then walked Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Karros singled up the gap to score Green, and then Beltre
singled to left, driving in Sheffield for the 8-6 lead. The Cubs
threw out Karros on the play, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills (2-1) pitched a perfect 2-3 of an inning. Jeff Shaw
pitched the ninth for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 5-0 lead after scoring five runs in the
fourth inning, but it came with a cost. Starter Darren Dreifort,
who had an RBI double, hurt his right knee when he slid into third.
</P>
<P>
   He told Johnson he was OK, but he didn't look it in the bottom
of the fourth inning. Dave Martinez scored on Julio Zuleta's
groundout, snapping Dreifort's scoreless streak at 12 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort then loaded the bases and forced in a run with a walk.
Eric Young hit a two-run single to cut Los Angeles' lead to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs got two more runs in the fifth on Willie Greene's solo
homer and Sammy Sosa's sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dreifort slammed his right knee sliding,'' Johnson said. ''He
said it got better, but it obviously affected his rhythm, his
pushoff and everything else. I asked him two or three times and he
said he felt fine. He obviously wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Karros' double in the fourth extended his hitting streak to
11 games. His career high is 17 games in 1995. ... Martinez arrived
for Wednesday's game with his beard shaved. Martinez said Baylor,
who isn't a fan of beards, told him he could keep his Tuesday night
in hopes it would change the team's luck. The Cubs lost, so
Martinez found a razor. ... Bears coach Dick Jauron was the guest
conductor for the seventh-inning stretch.

<HEADLINE> Wrigley Safety Boosted After Brawl  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- And Wrigley Field is supposed to be ''The
Friendly Confines.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, a night game at Wrigley was
disrupted and delayed by unruly fans.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they did more than throw litter. They threw punches
at the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter was in the bullpen Tuesday night
when a fan hit him in the back of the head and stole his cap.
Kreuter gave chase, his teammates followed, and soon there were a
half-dozen or so Dodgers in the stands, trading punches with fans.
The rest of the team stood watching at the first-base wall, a
chest-high brick barrier that separates the bullpen from the fans.
</P>
<P>
   It took stadium security nine minutes -- and several tries -- to
restore order.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would look at this as an incident of some fan. We do not
apologize for the fan,'' Mark McGuire, the Chicago Cubs' executive
vice president of business operations, said Wednesday in announcing
that security in the bullpens would be increased.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fan should not have reached over and tried to grab a
player's hat. That was wrong, and we are embarrassed by the
incident that took place after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took their places in the visitors bullpen like usual
Wednesday without any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Three fans were arrested, charged with disorderly conduct, and
released, with a June 19 court date set. A fourth fan, who ran onto
the field earlier in the game, was charged with trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
in the commissioner's office, made it clear that some sort of
punishment is in order for the Dodgers who were involved.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with this season's crackdown on any kind of fighting
between two teams, ''something involving players and fans will
simply not be tolerated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There really is never any excuse for going into the stands,''
Alderson said. ''It is not only not acceptable, it exposes players
and other uniformed personnel to risks and liabilities. At any
level, it is not a tolerable response.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Robinson, baseball's vice president of on-field
operations, talked with Cubs manager Don Baylor and Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson on Wednesday, and a representative from the
commissioner's office was going to Wrigley to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just wanted to know what I saw, what happened, how many
players were involved,'' Baylor said. ''I just told him I saw a lot
of gray shirts in the stands. It got ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Dodgers said security wasn't adequate Tuesday
night, a claim McGuire denied. There may not have been uniformed
police officers, but there were plenty of off-duty police and
stadium security in the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cubs increased security, starting with Wednesday's
game. Three stadium security officials -- one more than before --
will sit in the bullpen. There will be one person at each end of
the bullpen, and the third will sit in the middle, watching fans
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   Off-duty police officers also will be in the stands, McGuire
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we have good coverage,'' he said. ''We are going to
take the coverage up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional security person sat in the middle of the two
bullpen benches Wednesday, and there weren't any apparent problems.
At one point early in the game, one Dodger turned around and was
talking with fans.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley, with its cozy atmosphere and ivy covered walls, has
been dubbed ''The Friendly Confines.'' But despite the
warm-and-fuzzy image of Cubs fans -- diehard supporters who cram the
ballpark no matter how bad the team, and throw opponents' home run
balls back -- it wasn't the first time for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A game against the Colorado Rockies last May was delayed when
fans, upset over an umpire's call, pelted the field with baseballs,
bottles, coins and cups of beer. Colorado center fielder Darryl
Hamilton said one fan threw a Jack Daniels bottle onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five people were ejected, and the Cubs restricted beer
sales and added security.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, a fan came out of the stands and went after
Cubs reliever Randy Myers when he was on the mound, but the fan
ended up getting the worst of it. Myers, the former Cincinnati Reds
''Nasty Boy'' and student of martial arts, smashed John Murray with
a forearm, jumped on top of him and pinned him to the grass.
</P>
<P>
   All of this, and John Rocker hasn't even made it to town yet.
Rocker, who insulted gays, minorities, foreigners and others in a
Sports Illustrated article in December, makes his first trip to
Wrigley this season May 29.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will definitely have an intensified (security) program when
John Rocker comes here,'' McGuire said. ''Whatever we do today will
be in place, and potentially more than whatever we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem at Wrigley is that the park was built in
1914, when fans were calmer and they came to watch the game, not
sit and drink beer. Because there are no hulking slabs of concrete
separating fans from the bullpen, there's little to stop someone
from reaching over and touching a player -- or smacking him and
taking his hat.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night's incident was an isolated one, according to
the Dodgers' Johnson. Little needs to be done at Wrigley, except
adding some security officers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been all right there for 150 years, I'm sure it's going
to be all right again,'' Johnson said. ''You have wonderful fans
here. It was just a couple bad ones that got out of hand.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska: Approve Redistricting Plan  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alaska has asked the Justice Department to
approve changes to the way it redraws state legislative lines,
including a state law that calls for the use of actual, rather than
sampled, Census 2000 population figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has up 60 days to respond to the May 4th
letter from the Alaska Department of Law.
</P>
<P>
   If the Justice Department does rule definitively on the Alaska
regulations, it would be the first ruling it has issued related to
this year's census and the statistical method known as sampling.
</P>
<P>
   A definitive ruling on the Alaska changes could set a precedent
for other states seeking federal approval for their redistricting
plans, said Phil Sparks, spokesman for the watchdog group Census
2000 Initiative, which supports sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Justice officials can rule on all or part of the legalities of
the changes, or can put off a decision until after Census 2000 data
is released early next year, assistant state attorney general James
Baldwin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyer Steven Pershing, who is involved with
the case, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska regulations took effect last year, but under the
federal Voting Rights Act, the state must win Justice Department
approval before actually going through with redistricting. The act
orders states with a history of voting rights discrimination to
obtain prior approval from the Justice Department before changing
affected state laws.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona submitted its plan earlier this year, but withdrew it
before Justice officials could rule. Meanwhile, Virginia is asking
a federal court to rule that the state does not have to go through
the Justice Department to gain pre-approval for a similar law
calling for the use of non-sampled data.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimated a net undercount of 1.6 percent of
the population in 1990, including minorities and inner-city
residents who tend to vote Democratic. They favor sampling to
account for the missing people.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the GOP opposes sampling, fearing it could put them
at a disadvantage when political boundaries are redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 Supreme Court ruling mandated that raw data must be used
when reapportioning seats in Congress. It is up to states to decide
whether to use raw and sampled numbers when redrawing state
legislative and Congressional district lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see a reason to do sampling,'' said state Rep. Con
Bunde, a Republican who represents suburban Anchorage and
surrounding rural areas. ''We are a very mobile population.
Anchorage is the largest city in the state and we frequently have
people moving in from rural areas and moving out again.''
</P>
<P>
   The current law ''undermines minorities and rural Alaska. What
this does is make the urban-rural divide even greater,'' said state
Rep. Mary Sattler Kapsner, a Democrat who represents remote areas
of southwest Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Leader's Arrest Concerns U.N.  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations expressed concern
Wednesday that the arrest of Sierra Leone rebel leader Foday Sankoh
could complicate arrangements now under way for the release of
several hundred U.N. peacekeepers taken hostage by his forces.
</P>
<P>
   While U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said it was ''a relief'' to
know where Sankoh was, he reflected the overriding concern at U.N.
headquarters over the fate of the peacekeepers, who were among
about 500 seized earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have freed about 150 peacekeepers. In an encouraging
sign, Eckhard announced that the United Nations had been informed
Wednesday afternoon that 80 more detainees had been moved from
Sierra Leone to the Liberian border town of Foya. If their release
is confirmed, that would mean about 270 U.N. peacekeepers are still
being held hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations authorized an 11,100-strong force to help
implement a peace agreement signed 10 months ago between the
government and rebels that ended an eight-year war. After the
hostage-taking and a resumption of fighting earlier this month by
Sankoh's rebels, the Security Council has moved to beef up the U.N.
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Britain on Wednesday circulated a draft resolution that would
increase the peacekeeping force to 13,000 troops, and said it
expected council approval on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials have some justification for expressing concern at
the possible rebel reaction to Sankoh's arrest. When rebel fighters
heard media reports last week that Sankoh had been placed under
house arrest by U.N. peacekeepers, rebels began a spontaneous
advance and clashed with U.N. troops at Rogberi, a key intersection
60 miles east of the capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard stressed that the United Nations was waiting for the
reaction of the Sierra Leone government.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the peace deal, Sankoh was granted amnesty for the
rebels' war atrocities and was given a ministerial-level post in
the government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah as commissioner for
the management of strategic resources, national reconstruction and
development.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials wondered whether there was any alternative
leadership to Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front, and what the
future holds for the 10-month-old peace agreement that the
government and rebels signed in Lome, Togo.
</P>
<P>
   The government could choose to try Sankoh or send him into
exile, or even execute him. Human Rights Watch urged a fair trial
for Sankoh -- even by an international tribunal -- saying he
shouldn't be subjected to ''mob rule'' despite extensive evidence
of his involvement in crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Sankoh's arrest could influence what happens to
the hostages, Eckhard said: ''We are concerned that it could
complicate the arrangements that are under way now concerning the
release of the remaining detainees. It's too soon to say what
impact it will have.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberian President Charles Taylor has been charged by West
African nations with the job of getting the U.N. troops released.

<HEADLINE> Studies: Tobacco Targeting Teens  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cigarette makers have increased advertising in
magazines with large teen readerships since 1998, when they agreed
in a court settlement to not target youths in their ads, according
to two studies released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   State officials who participated in the $206 billion settlement
two years ago said the findings show tobacco companies may be
violating the settlement terms.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general from around the country are now in the
''discovery'' phase of an investigation into cigarette advertising
placements, according to Washington Attorney General Christine
Gregoire.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers said the studies were misleading. One of the
studies was by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and
the other was done by the American Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit
group funded by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing that a tobacco company can do that won't
receive criticism from the special interest groups that have their
own political agenda,'' said Mark Smith, a spokesman for the
Kentucky-based Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 agreement settled lawsuits against cigarette
manufacturers brought by 46 states to recover the costs of treating
sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the settlement forbids tobacco companies from
''targeting'' persons under 18 in their advertising, marketing and
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts study compared cigarette advertising
expenditures in magazines before and after the settlement, focusing
on 19 popular magazines with more than 15 percent of their
readership between the ages of 12 and 17. Fifteen percent was the
level used by the Food and Drug administration in its efforts to
regulate tobacco. Magazines in that category include Rolling Stone,
Glamour, Sports Illustrated and Motor Trend.
</P>
<P>
   Examples included a Rolling Stone issue with teen-age singing
star Britney Spears on the front cover and a full-page Marlboro ad
on the back.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine months of 1999, cigarette makers spent $119.9
million advertising, much of it on brands most popular with young
smokers, in magazines with a significant percentage of teen
readers, the study found. That is almost $30 million more than was
spent in the same magazines in the corresponding period before the
settlement, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar study by the American Legacy Foundation found more
than 70 percent of teen-agers in 1999 had seen cigarette
advertisements often enough to notice them and understand their
content.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements for Marlboro, the favorite brand of young
smokers, reached 89 percent of teen-agers, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The studies used commercial marketing surveys to assess the
popularity of various magazines among young readers. Cigarette
makers say those numbers don't represent who really reads the
publications.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Williamson has pulled all advertising from magazines
with a significant percentage of readers under 21, Smith said,
basing its decisions on demographic data provided by magazine
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris USA carefully researches publications before
choosing to place advertisements where they reach adult smokers but
don't bombard youth, said company spokesman Tom Ryan. The company,
which makes Marlboro, will no longer advertise on the back cover of
any magazine, he added.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton used the studies to call on Congress to
pass strict tobacco laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FDA's hands should not remain tied by Congressional
inaction,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Criticize Sen. Abraham  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats criticized Sen. Spencer Abraham on
Wednesday for a fax from his Senate office telling lobbyists who
support his pro-immigration bill about attacks he faced on the
issue back home in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats complained the fax was political and amounted to a
violation of Senate ethics rules. Government-paid aides are
prohibited from handling political, or campaign, literature.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Abraham, a first-term Republican in a tough
re-election battle this year, said the senator simply wanted to
notify parties interested in the bill's passage about opposition in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   According to a fax obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press,
Abraham's staff sent a copy of an ad that appeared March 19 in The
Detroit News to about 70 supporters of his immigration bill. The
legislation would allow 297,000 more skilled foreigners into the
United States over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which opposes the legislation, was paid for by the
Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and encourages
readers to call Abraham and ''stop the giveaway of American jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham spokesman Joe Davis said the senator's staff has been
sending faxes about immigration issues to the people on the list
for years. He said it was proper to send the ad because it dealt
with the legislation allowing more visas.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is wrong and misleading to have political groups say that
this fax was used for political purposes,'' Davis insisted. ''We
did not imply, ask or tell any of these groups to contribute to our
campaign or any other group.''
</P>
<P>
   But at an April meeting with lobbyists for high-tech companies
that support Abraham's bill, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., asked for donations to Americans for Job Reform, an
organization financing ad campaign to counter the FAIR ads.
</P>
<P>
   Davis denied that Abraham's office was involved in planning the
meeting with Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, said the fax raises questions about Abraham's
involvement in fund-raising for Americans for Job Reform, an issue
advocacy group forbidden by tax law from promoting political
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sen. Abraham's government employees from a government office
are communicating to contributors and would-be contributors for
political purposes,'' Jordan said. ''This is not an innocent fyi.
This is an implicit demand for political dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said at least 12 people the fax was addressed to have
donated money to Abraham's Senate campaign. He said those
individuals and political action committees for the companies they
represent have donated at least $24,475 to Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   Former Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley held a press
conference Wednesday at the request of Abraham's opponent,
Democratic Rep. Debbie Stabenow, calling for an investigation by
the Senate Ethics Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley did not accuse Abraham of any wrongdoing, saying ''it may
well be that Senator Abraham didn't even know this went on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stabenow spokeswoman Carol Butler said Stabenow isn't yet
calling for an ethics investigation.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Unveils New Vend Machines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola said Wednesday it will invest $100
million with a British communications and information technology
firm to make ''smart'' vending machines that will tell bottlers
when they're empty and allow for cashless purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year deal with London-based Marconi PLC is designed to
help Coke bottlers improve inventory management for more than
500,000 machines worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The technology will allow distributors to know such things as
when a machine is empty and which brands are selling best, Coke
spokesman Trey Paris said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the technology will allow for cashless vending -- for
example, allowing a customer to buy a beverage with a credit or
debit card or by charging it to a cellular phone account, Paris
said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, former Coke Chairman M. Douglas Ivester angered many
consumers when he disclosed that the company was studying ways to
remotely raise and lower vending machine prices depending on
weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Paris repeated Coke's earlier assertion that the technology will
not be used to increase prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would never apply it in ways that would take unfair
advantage of consumers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Limits Talks  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- By wide margins, the parliament gave first
approval Wednesday to two measures setting limits on the
government's ability to negotiate key issues with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The measures would require absolute majorities of 61 of the 120
members of parliament to allow changes in the present boundaries of
Jerusalem or to permit Palestinian refugees to return to their
former homes in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet ministers said the opposition bills reflect government
policy. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was notably absent in
both votes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bills would have to survive three more votes and
committee debates to become law, the votes created an
uncompromising atmosphere just as peace talks appeared off to a
fresh start. The Palestinians reacted angrily to the bills, warning
that they will mean the end of peace talks if they become law.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Barak's coalition government joined the
hard-line opposition in voting for the bills. Critics of the
measures charged that its backers are trying to sabotage the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli government knows very well that these laws would
mean the end of negotiations,'' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
said. ''This raises many questions about the real intentions of
this government.''
</P>
<P>
   There were minor clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
Wednesday, with Palestinians throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers,
who responded with rubber-coated steel pellets and tear gas. At
least five Palestinians, one Israeli civilian and two soldiers were
injured in the events, the Israeli army said.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests were far smaller than the riots Monday that
deteriorated into gunbattles that killed three Palestinians. Israel
demanded in peace talks Wednesday that the Palestinians collect all
illegal weapons in the areas under their control, Israel radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees are two of the
most sensitive issues facing negotiators, who hope to sign a peace
treaty by September. The Palestinians want to set up a state, with
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem as the capital. They insist that
refugees who fled Israel when it was created in 1948 have the right
to return.
</P>
<P>
   The bills forced government officials to take hard-line
positions in peace talks, just days after it emerged that top-level
negotiations are under way between Israeli and Palestinian
officials in Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem measure, introduced by hawkish Likud lawmaker
Yehoshua Matza, confirms the expanded boundaries of the city,
including the Arab sections Israel captured and annexed in 1967 and
forbids the government from handing any land or authority there to
an outside body.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy called on members to vote for the
opposition bill, so that there would not be even ''the smallest
shadow of doubt'' that the government rejects compromise over
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The law would scuttle another idea that has been raised -- giving
autonomy to the Palestinian residents of the city. The measure
passed by a vote of 68 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   The second measure, introduced by Israel Katz, also of the
Likud, bans return of Palestinian refugees to communities in what
is now Israel. Agreeing, Cabinet minister Haim Ramon declared that
recognizing the right of some 3 million refugees to return would
''mean the end of the state of Israel'' as a Jewish nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said when the Palestinians bring up the right of refugees
to return to their homes, Israeli negotiators ''reject it
totally.''

<HEADLINE> Private Banking Firm Buys Petco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Petco Animal Supplies, Inc. agreed to be
acquired Wednesday by two private banking firms, for an estimated
$464.2 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   A company organized by Leonard Green &AMP; Partners LP and Texas
Pacific Group will purchase the San Diego-based pet supply company
for $22 per share in cash, Petco said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The firms will also assume about $136 million in Petco debt. The
transaction, which will take Petco private, is expected to be
completed by fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are enthusiastic about the prospects of Petco and excited
to play a role in the company's future growth,'' John Danhakl,

with Texas Pacific, said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase must still be approved by stockholders and federal
regulations. The final agreement is expected to be reached this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The transaction announced today fulfills our long-standing
commitment to deliver maximum value to our stockholders,'' Brian K.
Devine, Petco's chairman, president and CEO, said in a statement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came on the same day that Petco reported first
quarter earnings were up 44 percent to $6.4 million, or 30 cents
per share, compared with $3.6 million, or 17 cents per share, in
the first quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter ending April 29 increased 15 percent to a
record $265.2 million from $229.7 million in the first quarter last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Petco's stock closed at $14.93}, up 25 cents, on the Nasdaq
Stock Market on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Green &AMP; Partners is a private Los Angeles-based merchant
banking firm specializing in organizing, structuring and sponsoring
management buy-outs, privatizations and recapitalizations. The

<HEADLINE> Judge: Gov't OK on Waco Evidence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The FBI may have mishandled some key evidence
related to the deadly 1993 Waco siege, but Branch Davidian lawyers
failed to prove the government intentionally altered or destroyed
any items, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter Smith, who is presiding over a
wrongful-death lawsuit set to begin June 19, said there is ''no
basis'' for him to order the government ''to turn over any
additional evidence or to impose sanctions for actions which
apparently occurred over seven years ago when the evidence was
first collected and collated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Branch Davidians, in a motion filed earlier this
year, contended that the government withheld, destroyed or tampered
with evidence crucial to their lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, the Davidians' lead counsel, asked Smith to
review the complaint and to sanction the government.
</P>
<P>
   During a daylong hearing last month, Smith heard testimony from
a pilot and photographer who were at the site on April 19, 1993, as
well as audio experts for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, plaintiffs contended that some of the
Forward Looking Infrared, or FLIR, footage bore signs of the audio
having been erased.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said on one tape, someone can be heard asking for the
audio to be turned off.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, in his order, said: ''The evidence does not support
erasure, but rather indicates that the audio was never turned on.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, for seven years, has staunchly denied that its
agents fired any shots or that it bears any responsibility for the
fire that raced through the compound several hours into an FBI
tear-gassing operation designed to flush out the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died that
day, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. The government
contends they perished by their own hands. The Davidians say the
government bears some responsibility.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists find pottery kiln at Trenton road construction site  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- An archaeological team monitoring
construction on Route 29 has unearthed a well-preserved pottery
kiln built in the 1770s, a rare find from one of Trenton's biggest
Colonial-era industries.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-by-9-foot brick structure is the oldest kiln discovered
in the city, which grew into the nation's largest supplier of
toilets, china and other stoneware a century later.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (the kiln) is extremely well-preserved and we can see
exactly how it worked,'' said Ian Burrow, vice president of Hunter
Research Inc., an archaeology firm working with the state
Department of Transportation on the Route 29 project. The only
other kilns of this kind uncovered in the United States were found
in Cheesequake, Middlesex County, and Yorktown, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is important not just for Trenton but it will be useful
for archaeological studies all over the region. If an archaeologist
finds some pottery like the ones found here, they will know the
date it was made and where it comes from,'' Burrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of pottery pieces from the kiln have been unearthed,
including chamber pots, teacups, syrup jars and jugs. The items
will be cleaned and catalogued, and valuable pieces will be donated
to area museums.
</P>
<P>
   The kiln itself is too fragile to be moved without risk of
damage and will most likely be preserved in the ground, said John
Dourgarian, a Department of Transportation spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be a great challenge to preserve it,'' Burrow said,
adding that instead, it will be ''preserved in place'' and left for
another generation to study.
</P>
<P>
   The archeologists were to continue sifting through the site
until Friday, extracting as many artifacts as they can find around
the kiln.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is that we get what we can out of there
and then leave it there as it has been for the past 225 years,''
Dourgarian said.
</P>
<P>
   The kiln was built in 1774 by William Richards, a wealthy
Philadelphia merchant who had several business dealings in the
port, then known as Lamberton. The kiln is believed to have ceased
operations when Richards died in 1787.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're learning a tremendous amount about this forgotten port
along the Delaware River,'' said Burrow.
</P>
<P>
   By tracking where the pottery traveled, historians can learn
more about the local economy, which had businesses known for
trading with other American colonies, Europe and the Caribbean,
Burrow said.
</P>
<P>
   The state has dedicated $2.3 million for excavation and research
along the two-mile extension of Route 29, Dourgarian said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, archeologists discovered thousands of artifacts in the
root cellar of a two-story wooden mansion once owned by Richards.
That dig uncovered teapots, wine bottles, animal bones and other
refuse that was disposed of there before the days of curbside
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ''This area of Trenton is a treasure trove of history,'' said
Dourgarian.

<HEADLINE> Edison police officer convicted on bank robbery charge  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal jury on Wednesday convicted an
Edison police officer of stealing $3,500 at gunpoint from a bank in
his patrol district, rejecting defense arguments of mistaken
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Spinello was found guilty on all three charges he faced:
bank robbery, armed bank robbery and using a gun during a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Spinello, 32, of Brick, did not testify during the nine-day
trial. His lawyer told the jury that the 11-year officer was the
victim of ''an unfortunate series of coincidences.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was returned after about six hours of deliberations
over two days.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charge, armed bank robbery, carries up to 25
years in prison, although under sentencing guidelines, the actual
term would be about four years. Combined with a 5-year mandatory
consecutive term on the gun charge, he faces about nine years
without parole when sentenced Sept. 6 by U.S. District Judge Joseph
A. Greenaway Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Spinello gave no reaction to the verdict. When the jury left the
courtroom, he removed his tie, waved to his wife, and was taken
into custody. He had been under house arrest since shortly after
his arrest the day of the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Lawrence S. Lustberg said they were disappointed,
and would discuss whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Spinello is the third New Jersey law officer jailed for bank
robbery in the past few years:
</P>
<P>
   --A former Mercer County Jail guard dubbed the ''pipe bomb
bandit,'' Freddie Feliciano, of Hamilton, is serving more than 10
years in prison after pleading guilty last year to using fake pipe
bombs to rob 16 banks in five states from August to October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   --A former Trenton police officer, Christopher Kerins, pleaded
guilty in 1998 and is now serving 6 1/2 years for seven bank
robberies from November 1995 to April 1996 attributed to the
''camouflage bandit.''
</P>
<P>
   Spinello was arrested shortly after he reported to work Jan. 13,
1999, about an hour after a man not wearing a mask showed a teller
at the First Savings Bank in Edison a revolver and fled with
$3,500.
</P>
<P>
   He was suspended without pay after his arrest and Edison
officials said he would be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Edward Costello said Spinello's future is in the
hands of Mayor George A. Spadoro, who also serves as police
director. The mayor did not immediately return a call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary, who tried the case himself,
maintained that Spinello turned to robbery amid desperation over
debts.
</P>
<P>
   The teller and a customer who saw the bandit escape in a green
Ford Explorer identified Spinello as the robber. The vehicle was
registered to the officer's wife, Angela.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI recovered $3,500 in a nearby condominium that Spinello
rented to one of his brothers. The cash was in the same
denominations as the money taken from the bank, Cleary said: $1,000
in $100 bills, $1,000 in $50 bills, $1,000 in $20 bills, and $500
in $10 bills.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lustberg told the jury that the money was only part of
a larger amount that Spinello had won in an Atlantic City casino
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Lustberg also said that the teller mistakenly identified
Spinello as the robber, and that the customer lost sight of the
robber as they went outside the bank, and erred by saying the
robber got into the green Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   The officer was getting into the vehicle about that time,
Lustberg said: ''Mr. Spinello was, as he openly admitted, in the
wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lustberg also asked the jury to consider whether the officer, in
the space of an hour, could have robbed the bank, stashed the
money, disposed of the clothes worn during the heist, the gun, as
well as the straps on the cash -- none of which have been found --
and reported to work.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 8, Cubs 6  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs have more things to worry about
than unruly fans. Like their combustible bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen hit a pinch-hit home run, and Eric Karros singled in
the go-ahead run Wednesday afternoon as the Los Angeles Dodgers
rallied in the ninth inning for an 8-6 victory over the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre also had an RBI in the three-run ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to watch because I believe this club has played a
lot better than its record,'' said Cubs manager Don Baylor, whose
team was booed as the game ended. ''We just can't close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''... We have to reevaluate and see where we are,'' Baylor said.
''We just can't keep going through this.''
</P>
<P>
   At least there were no repeats of Tuesday night, when the
Dodgers brawled with fans after someone hit bullpen catcher Chad
Kreuter and stole his hat. Several Dodgers teammates and coaches
followed Kreuter into the stands, and it took security personnel
nine minutes -- and several tries -- to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Three fans were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.
Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations in
the commissioner's office, made it clear that some sort of
punishment is in order for the Dodgers who were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''There really is never any excuse for going into the stands,''
Alderson said. ''It is not only not acceptable, it exposes players
and other uniformed personnel to risks and liabilities. At any
level, it is not a tolerable response.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs increased security around the bullpens, and there
didn't appear to be any problems Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We turned the page on (Tuesday) night,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's bullpen has blown nine of its 16 save opportunities
(56 percent) this season. It has given up 17 home runs, and has a
7.45 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Rick Aguilera, who has 295 career saves, blew his fourth
save chance Wednesday. He took the mound in the ninth with a 6-5
lead, and promptly gave up a homer to Hansen, the first batter he
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to come in and face your teammates and coaching
staff,'' said Aguilera, who also blew a save Sunday. ''It's a
combination of things. Bottom line is somehow, I've got to turn it
around when I'm given the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Hansen's second homer of the season. Both were as
pinch-hitters, giving him eight for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arguably the toughest job in baseball is to come off the bench
and be effective. He's been doing that his entire career,'' Karros
said of Hansen. ''He's one of the most valuable guys we have on the
club. He knows his role and he knows it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera retired the next two batters on flies before being
relieved by Felix Heredia. Heredia (1-1) hit Shawn Green, the first
batter he faced, and then walked Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Karros singled up the gap to score Green, and then Beltre
singled to left, driving in Sheffield for the 8-6 lead. The Cubs
threw out Karros on the play, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills (2-1) pitched a perfect 2-3 of an inning. Jeff Shaw
pitched the ninth for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 5-0 lead after scoring five runs in the
fourth inning, but it came with a cost. Starter Darren Dreifort,
who had an RBI double, hurt his right knee when he slid into third.
</P>
<P>
   He told Johnson he was OK, but he didn't look it in the bottom
of the fourth inning. Dave Martinez scored on Julio Zuleta's
groundout, snapping Dreifort's scoreless streak at 12 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort then loaded the bases and forced in a run with a walk.
Eric Young hit a two-run single to cut Los Angeles' lead to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs got two more runs in the fifth on Willie Greene's solo
homer and Sammy Sosa's sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dreifort slammed his right knee sliding,'' Johnson said. ''He
said it got better, but it obviously affected his rhythm, his
pushoff and everything else. I asked him two or three times and he
said he felt fine. He obviously wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Karros' double in the fourth extended his hitting streak to
11 games. His career high is 17 games in 1995. ... Martinez arrived
for Wednesday's game with his beard shaved. Martinez said Baylor,
who isn't a fan of beards, told him he could keep his Tuesday night
in hopes it would change the team's luck. The Cubs lost, so
Martinez found a razor. ... Bears coach Dick Jauron was the guest
conductor for the seventh-inning stretch.

<HEADLINE> Ball Players Fear for Their Lives  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cliff Floyd isn't worried about a fan just grabbing a hat. He
fears for his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think about someone not liking me, walking into the game,
standing up in the stands and shooting,'' the Florida outfielder
said Wednesday. ''It can happen, right? You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Los Angeles Dodgers bullpen went into the stands
and brawled with fans at Wrigley Field, player safety was the focus
in major league clubhouses.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not enough security at games. There are situations
that could be controlled but until a major incident happens nobody
cares,'' Cleveland outfielder David Justice said. ''I hope I'm
retired when a fan actually goes to the limit. But that's what
everybody is waiting for. ... The day is coming when something is
going to happen tragic on that baseball field. I can see it coming.
It's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson of the commissioner's office said players who
went into the stands are likely to be disciplined. The brawl began
when a fan reached into the bullpen and grabbed the cap of Dodgers
catcher Chad Kreuter.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anybody touches anybody they have the right to defend
themselves even if that means going into the stands,'' Toronto
pitcher David Wells said. ''He could be superstitious and that's
the only hat he wears, so there is grounds for that as well. He had
every right to do what he did. He shouldn't be fined or
suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Alderson said there is no situation where players
would be justified for going into the stands, players generally
backed the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, I could see myself getting into it with someone
if they wanted to hit me,'' Atlanta outfielder Brian Jordan said.
''If a fan decides to be stupid and is trying to injure or hurt me,
I'm going to react.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells thinks the first few rows should be kept free from
spectators as a barrier, as some European soccer teams do.
</P>
<P>
   ''The players need to be isolated from the fans, and you have to
have a canopy over them, and you need security,'' Florida manager
John Boles said. ''If you don't have that, you'd better cut back on
the alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati reliever Scott Sullivan said most of the fans by the
Wrigley Field visitors' bullpen are the same every game, and the
players get to know them a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we go to Wrigley, most of the people around us are pretty
familiar faces. Most of the time they joke around with us.,'' he
said. ''People definitely have been getting more vocal using
profanity, which is uncalled for. We're talking about bullpens
across the league. This is my fourth year and there's been a
progression. We're targets, no question about it. We're out in the
open.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit reliever Todd Jones said a sign of baseball's
seriousness with fan abuse will be how much protection Atlanta
reliever John Rocker gets when the Braves returns to Shea Stadium
next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they better do is if anything happens, it's going to have
to be an instant forfeit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without proper security, many players say they'll respond to
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're coming at me with intent to hurt me, I'm going to get
after them,'' Toronto closer Billy Koch said. ''You have to defend
yourself. You can't just say, 'Well this guy is 5-8 and 155 pounds
and your 6-3, 210.' If he comes into my house, onto my field and
attacks me, I'm going to defend myself.''

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Owner Extends Buy Deadline  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A day after extending the deadline for a
prospective buyer to make a down payment on the team, Phoenix
Coyotes owner Richard Burke wasn't worried about the sale falling
through.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any reason to believe they will not come
through,'' Burke said Wednesday. ''Getting the new arena is
critical, and I did this in terms of facilitating, just making that
happen. I haven't gone beyond that to assume, 'What if they didn't
make it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Developer Steve Ellman has been trying to round up investors to
help with the purchase, which must be completed by June 30 with an
additional $17 million cash payment and a $60 million loan
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gretzky's name surfaced last week as a potential co-owner
amid reports that he felt the opportunity was right, but the timing
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every hour that goes by without Gretzky making an announcement
causes me to worry that he's having second thoughts or cold feet,''
state Department of Commerce director of administration Chris Baier
told the Tribune, a newspaper serving suburban Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barnett, Gretzky's agent, did not return a phone call
Wednesday seeking comment on the new time line.
</P>
<P>
   Burke and Ellman originally teamed to build an 18,000-seat
hockey arena as part of a $535 million mall redevelopment in
suburban Scottsdale. But disagreements over financing and the pace
of construction convinced Burke to sell.
</P>
<P>
   If Ellman defaults, Burke would be free to look for other
buyers. One is readily available in Microsoft co-founder Paul
Allen, who wants to move the franchise to Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   But Burke said he hadn't considered options beyond selling to
Ellman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't gone there,'' said Burke, who projects $25 million
in losses for two more seasons in the America West Arena because of
its limited revenue streams and restricted-view seats. ''I've just
tried to approach this from the standpoint of we've got to do
whatever is necessary to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL, which brokered the sale in an attempt to keep the team
in Phoenix, does not consider the extension a setback.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not uncommon for deadlines to become flexible in cases
where more time may be needed to secure any of a number of
components in a multifaceted undertaking,'' NHL spokesman Frank
Brown said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department today ardently stood behind its
proposed breakup of Microsoft, saying in a court filing today that the
government's anti-trust plan would ''undo the harm to competition caused by
Microsoft's illegal conduct.'' In its legal reply to arguments outlined by
Microsoft, the government reinforced its assertion that a breakup was the best
way to prevent anticompetitive behavior by a company found to have acted in wide
violation of federal laws. The government also rejected milder sanctions
suggested by Microsoft.

Israeli Parliament Limits Talks

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- By wide margins, the parliament gave first approval
Wednesday to two measures setting limits on the government's ability to
negotiate key issues with the Palestinians. The measures would require absolute
majorities of 61 of the 120 members of parliament to allow changes in the
present boundaries of Jerusalem or to permit Palestinian refugees to return to
their former homes in Israel. Cabinet ministers said the opposition bills
reflect government policy. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was notably absent
in both votes. The Palestinians reacted angrily to the bills, warning that they
will mean the end of peace talks if they become law.

The House Ways and Means Committee approved the measure 34-4 as previously
undecided committee members flocked to support the Clinton administration. A
showdown on the House floor was set for next week. The Senate Finance Committee
approved the legislation 18-1. In the House, organized labor has waged a fierce
campaign against the legislation, undercutting Democratic support. The bill

whose followers burned, looted, maimed and killed across Sierra Leone was
captured Wednesday by pro-government forces, who shot him in the leg, stripped
him naked and turned him over to government officials. The seizure of Foday
Sankoh, whose Revolutionary United Front has terrorized civilians, prompted
joyous celebrations in the streets of Freetown, where thousands have died during
eight years of civil war. Questions remained whether Sankoh's capture would
speed an end to Sierra Leone's reignited civil war -- or spur his Revolutionary

U.S. Considered A-Bomb on Moon

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The United States considered detonating an atom bomb on the

Chicago physicist says. The secret project, innocuously titled ''A Study of
Lunar Research Flights,'' was never carried out. But its planning included
calculations by the astronomer Carl Sagan -- then a young graduate student -- of
the behavior of the dust and gas generated by the blast. Viewing the nuclear

<HEADLINE> US: Surveillance of Embassies Common  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. surveillance detection teams have
uncovered more than 700 incidents of suspected monitoring of
American personnel and facilities over the last 16 months, a top
State Department official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State David Carpenter testified that the
teams were deployed in January, 1999 after the State Department
concluded that surveillance against U.S. facilities is intense
prior to a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   He said that lesson was learned at the time of the bombings of
two American embassies in East Africa in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, testifying before the House International Relations
Committee, said the presence of the teams has expanded the security
perimeter and the zone of control beyond previous limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The program is still a work in progress, he said, adding that
the administration nonetheless believes that ''it is destined to
become a major aspect of our overseas security defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department Inspector General Jaquelyn Williams-Bridgers,
who also testified, said U.S. officials are trying to collect
information about the various groups which have had U.S. facilities
under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said the surveillance detection teams are no
substitute for having a minimum 100-foot buffer between an official
facility and the nearest street.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we can build embassies meeting the setback and other
security standards, our efforts cannot provide the degree of
security all of us want for our people and facilities,'' Carpenter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., convened the hearing
for a progress report on embassy security upgrades since the 1998
bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kennedy, assistant secretary of state for
administration, said a record $800 million was obligated in the
last fiscal year on embassy security but much remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fully 85 per cent of our facilities do not meet minimum
security standards,'' he said. ''Some are seriously overcrowded.
Most, however have to be replaced...Our goal is to expeditiously
locate into safe facilities more than 22,000 embassy staff in over
220 vulnerable buildings.''

<HEADLINE> Malfunction at Chernobyl Nuke Site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Officials at the Chernobyl nuclear plant
said Wednesday its only operating reactor was working normally
after a malfunction in a turbo generator forced them to halve
power.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reactor is working in a normal regime,'' said Chernobyl
duty officer Andriy Bilyk.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in
1986, reported the malfunction Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials reported details of the power cut Wednesday in
Washington. Bilyk said the report did not reveal anything the plant
had not already reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chernobyl and the U.S. official said no radiation was released.
</P>
<P>
   When the incident was reported on Monday, plant officials said a
turbo-alternator at the plant's only working reactor No. 3 failed
before dawn and was shut down for repairs until evening.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, State Department spokesman Philip Reeker gave a
similar account, calling the malfunction a leak.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said forest fires in Belarus and northern Ukraine had

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Visits with foreign leaders and discussion of
foreign policy are on the agendas for presidential candidates
George W. Bush and Al Gore next week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic vice president, is to meet Monday with
Thabo Mbeki, the South African president who will be on his first
state visit to the United States. Gore and Mbeki co-chair the
U.S.-South Africa Binational Committee dealing with the two
countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican governor of Texas, also is expected in
Washington next Monday for a speech to the American-Israel Public
Affairs Committee, an influential lobbying group. He also plans to
meet Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, said spokesman
Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore addresses the same organization on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is scheduled to meet May 25 in Austin, Texas, with
Mbeki, McClellan said. Mbeki has expressed interest in meeting with
Bush during a visit to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been working to overcome criticism that he is too
inexperienced on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he met for an hour with Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov, who requested the session. That meeting came two days
after Bush made a brief foray into Mexico for a bridge dedication
ceremony and a speech boosting free trade.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore has been deeply involved in foreign
affairs and has met numerous foreign leaders. He has established
close relationships with top Russian officials.

<HEADLINE> Draft Registration Falling  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Nearly one in five young American men are failing
to register for the military draft as required by law, risking
fines and jail as well as ineligibility for a wide array of
benefits including student loans and government jobs, the Selective
Service Administration said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials said ignorance rather than willful resistance
appears to be behind the compliance numbers, which were at 93
percent a decade ago. ''Since 1990 we have seen an erosion of about
1 percent a year,'' said agency spokesman Lewis Brodsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our research has consistently shown that the biggest barrier
to young men's compliance is a simple lack of awareness,'' said
Selective Service Director Gil Coronado. ''It's tragic to see young
men potentially missing out on future opportunities because they
just do not know they are required to register.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The consequences of not registering for whatever reasons, are
enormous,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley, who joined
Coronado at a news conference where they announced the formation of
partnerships with educational associations to get the word out to
young men.
</P>
<P>
   For men born in 1980 who are now 19 and 20 years old, the
compliance rate is about 83 percent, Brodsky said.
</P>
<P>
   A state-by-state survey issued by the agency showed some large
states had low registration levels among those men -- California
with 79 percent and Texas, 77 percent. New Hampshire, by contrast,
ranked highest with 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that all young men living inside the United
States and its territories register with the Selective Service
within 30 days of their 18th birthday. That includes immigrants and
non-citizen residents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The names are gathered in case a national emergency should
require a military draft. Selective Service officials and members
of Congress at the news conference called the system an important
national ''insurance policy.'' They said the all-volunteer
enlistment policy of the armed services is working as intended in
peacetime. The last actual draft was in 1973 near the end of the
Vietnam era.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to register can cost young men their chance at student
loans and grants, job training, government jobs and citizenship for
male immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a felony punishable by up to five years in jail or
prison and a fine of up to $250,000, but such cases are rarely
prosecuted. The last prosecution was in 1985, agency officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To make sure that any draft is as fair and as equitable as
possible, we've got to make sure we reach everyone,'' Brodsky said.
''And it's difficult to know who you're not reaching.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But we suspect, based on the demographics we've seen, that
it's high school dropouts and immigrants'' who are not registering.
Brodsky said the agency is working with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service as well as schools to try to get more
immigrants to register.
</P>
<P>
   The Selective Service survey showed that the states with the
lowest compliance rates for men born in 1980 -- all of them under 80
percent -- are California, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and South
Carolina, all with a 79 percent rate; Texas, 77 percent; Louisiana,
74 percent, and Hawaii, 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The states with the best compliance -- all of them 90 percent or
better -- are New Hampshire, 95 percent; Maine and North Dakota, 93
percent; Iowa and Nebraska, 91 percent, and Minnesota, 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky said there are now 13.5 million men in the Selective
Service data base whose ages range from 18 to 25. Men 26 and older
are not eligible for the draft. An estimated 1.6 million men age 18
to 25 have not complied with the law, he said.

<HEADLINE> New NYC Schools Chancellor Approved  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A businessman with little background in
education was picked Wednesday evening to take over the nation's
largest school system.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education unanimously named Harold Levy, the
interim chancellor, as the man to permanently replace the ousted
Rudy Crew, who lost the job after an ideological battle with
Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can not go this road alone,'' Levy said Wednesday. ''We go
this road only if we have strong partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   He has already managed a step in that direction, with Giuliani
agreeing to reinstate regular meetings with the chancellor, which
were suspended during Crew's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Levy has support from another source as well: mayoral hopeful
and Public Advocate Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harold Levy's ideas, energy and vision made his selection as
chancellor irresistible,'' Green said, predicting the new chief
will reduce class sizes and integrate technology with school work
for the city's 1.1 million public school students.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, 47, was originally selected to serve in January while the
board sought a permanent replacement for Crew. He was granted a
special waiver by the state's top education official, to get around
the rule that only educators can serve.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, he was the only candidate left who still
wanted the post.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who had strongly objected to Levy's appointment as
interim schools chancellor, dropped his opposition Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Levy came to the job from the corporate world, working as
director of global compliance for Citigroup. Before that, he was
chief litigator at what was then known as Salomon Brothers.

<HEADLINE> 13 Die in Indonesia Violence  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- At least 13 people were killed and a
senior army commander injured Wednesday as fighting between Muslims
and Christians intensified in the eastern Indonesian town of Ambon,
officials and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the dead were Muslims, said Malik Selang, an official at
the main mosque Al Fatah. All were shot by gunmen or security
officers trying to disperse the mobs, he said, adding that 40
others had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   One Christian also died and eight others injured during
Wednesday's clashes that erupted in the neighborhoods of Mardika
and Batu Merah, where sectarian fighting first broke out in January
last year, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   A police sergeant and an army corporal also died Wednesday after
being hit by gunfire, a military official said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 people have been killed in 16 months of
sectarian clashes in Maluku and neighboring North Maluku,
collectively known as the Spice Islands, or Moluccas, during Dutch
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   The strife is fueled by old rivalries and more recent complaints
by Christians that Muslim newcomers from other parts of Indonesia
have been taking their jobs and are not respecting local customs.
</P>
<P>
   The latest outbreak came after a sharp drop in sectarian
violence during the past six weeks. Inter-communal fighting abated
significantly in April -- when a dozen deaths were recorded -- and
the first half of May.
</P>
<P>
   Ambon, 1,450 miles east of Jakarta, is the capital of Maluku
province.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Irwan Kusnadi, the local army commander, was injured after
being shot in the cheek during Wednesday's clashes, a military
official said. Some of the soldiers accompanying him were also
injured.

<HEADLINE> Breeder charged with bilking customers of $91,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) -- A dog breeder on probation for theft was
indicted on charges he failed to deliver purebred, highly trained
dogs to customers nationwide, bilking them of $91,000.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick V. Chestnut, 34, either delivered sick, mixed-breed
canines to customers or didn't deliver the dogs at all, Passaic
County prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims include an Illinois woman who paid Chestnut $3,250
for a dog that never arrived, and a California woman who paid
$13,500 for two dogs, one of which had severe physical disabilities
and another that never arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the people were dog-lovers, so they kept the dogs
anyway,'' said Assistant Passaic County Prosecutor Eileen Kane.
''As one victim said, 'I just bought myself one very expensive
house pet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut's home telephone number and the number of his Haledon
business, Chestnut Dog Command, are not listed.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut is serving probation for a 1997 theft conviction and
has been sentenced to probation twice before on theft charges. He
was fined $500 in Totowa Municipal Court in 1994 for neglecting one
of his dogs.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1999, Chestnut defrauded customers in Totowa,
Paterson, Wisconsin, Michigan and California of $91,400, an
indictment said. He put out advertisements in dog magazines
claiming his animals were purebred and trained in the Schutzhund
method, a regimen to train dogs in obedience and home protection.
</P>
<P>
   Paterson couple Darryl and Gathlyn Smoot paid Chestnut $4,500
for a specially trained German shepherd in 1996, but didn't get the
protection they had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said that a contractor came over to their home one day
and was working on the gutters and the dog was just lying in the
kennel,'' Kane said. ''Eventually, the guy just came up and gave
the dog a sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut forged pedigree papers to cover up health problems of
some of his dogs, Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with 14 counts of theft by deception, two counts
of attempted theft by deception, two counts relating to bad checks,
and two counts of forgery.
</P>
<P>
   He was also separately charged Tuesday with theft for allegedly
agreeing to sell a car to a man for $3,200 in June 1999, but never
delivering the car.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Leads Venezuelan Poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- With less than two weeks before his
re-election bid, President Hugo Chavez maintains a 20-point lead
over his closest rival, according to a poll published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Conducted by the private Consultores 21 firm, it found that of
1,200 people interviewed, 51 percent said they would vote for
Chavez while 31 percent favored Francisco Arias Cardenas. The
former army commander helped Chavez stage a failed 1992 coup
attempt, but who now accuses the president of grabbing too much
power.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted from May 9 through May 12 and had a
margin of error of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll comes a day after leaders of an observer team from the
Organization of American States expressed concern over a perceived
lack of public confidence in the May 28 elections. The absence of
an independent firm to audit the printing of ballots and the
computer used to count them was also listed as problematic.
</P>
<P>
   National election officials had planned to hire a firm but said
this week that the lone company that bid on the contract did not
qualify.

<HEADLINE> Alleged INS Spy Trial Opens  </HEADLINE>
By MEG RICHARDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official passed a government
secret to a friend with ties to Cuba for money and to prove his
value as a business associate, a federal prosecutor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Faget, 54, a veteran Immigration and Naturalization
Service official, is charged with violating the U.S. Espionage Act
by revealing classified information and lying about contacts with
Cuban officials. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In opening the prosecution's case, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dick
Gregorie told the jury that as a high-ranking official, Faget had
access to secret government files. Faget was acting district deputy
director in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to have to decide which side Mr. Faget is on,''
Gregorie said. ''We're not talking about communism. This is not
about political philosophy ... whether you believe in the embargo
(against trade with Cuba) or not. This is a Miami case: M-I-A ...
it's about money, information and access.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Edward O'Donnell told jurors that Faget acted
in good faith out of concern for his old friend and would never
have done anything to compromise national security.
</P>
<P>
   When arrested Feb. 17, Faget told the FBI: ''I want you to know
that what I did was to protect my friend. I would do nothing to
jeopardize the security of my country,'' O'Donnell quoted his
client as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI began surveillance of Faget in February 1999 after he
went to a bar and met a Cuban diplomat who the agency suspected was
an intelligence official. A year later, Faget was told as part of
an FBI sting that the Cuban official wanted to defect, and that
that information was classified.
</P>
<P>
   When Faget then used his personal cell phone to alert his
longtime friend, Pedro Font, he did so out of concern for Font's
safety, not to alert Cuban officials, O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Font was meeting that day with top Cuban diplomat Jose
Imperatori, and Faget wanted Font to have the information for his
own protection, O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just listen to the conversation,'' said O'Donnell. ''It's not,
'Listen, so you can tell Imperatori.' It's just the other way
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregorie alleges Font and Faget created a corporation to conduct
business with Cuba, and while Font and other partners put up money,
Faget had nothing to give except his status as a government
official.
</P>
<P>
   Font worked with Faget's father for a government agency that
repressed communism in pre-Castro Cuba, O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mariano Faget didn't need to do anything to cement his
relationship with Pedro Font,'' O'Donnell said. ''Font would give
him the world when he retires. Font loves this man.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Wants Fair Oil Competition  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP ) -- Russia will be more assertive in the Caspian
Sea basin and wants fair competition over pipelines that are being
built or planned to transport growing volumes of oil from the
region to markets in Europe, a senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Andrei Urnov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's
Caspian Working Group, said ''certain outside forces are trying to
weaken Russia's position in the Caspian Basin by driving a wedge''
between Moscow and three nations in the region that were once part
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   They are Turkmenistan, Kazakstan and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   Urnov did not name the outside forces he said were involved but
he clearly was alluding to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been promoting the building of a
$2.4 billion, 1,080 mile pipeline running from Baku, on the western
side of the Caspian through Georgia to the Turkish port on of
Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials want to prevent any Caspian pipelines from
running south through Iran and keep Russia from dominating other
routes. The Caspian is a California-size body of salt water that
may sit on oil reserves of more than 100 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Urnov said under new President Vladimir Putin Russia ''will
resist attempts to reduce its role'' in the region. ''But there
will be no Monroe Doctrine for the region, no dominating role, no
confrontation,'' he told a forum at Johns Hopkins University's
School of Advanced International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1823 President James Monroe told European nations to keep out
of the American continents.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of Russia's increased interest in the Caspian, Urnov
said Putin would make one of his first foreign trips as president
to Turkmenistan next week.
</P>
<P>
   Russia also has been pressing Kazakstan to ship the bulk of its
oil through pipelines crossing Russia to its own ports on the Black
Sea. It has offered to expand one of its pipelines to accommodate
Kazak exports.
</P>
<P>
   Urnov said Russia was not seeking a monopoly on transport of oil
and gas resources from the Caspian and did not oppose a
multiplicity of pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   But he said existing pipelines that go north through Russia were
underused and could be upgraded for less cost than building new
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Urnov also said Russia had completed a bypass pipeline to take
oil from Baku around the breakaway republic of Chechnya where
Russia forces have been fighting rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   He said Russia opposed building any pipelines under the Caspian
until all environmental issues were settled, including any effect
on the sea's sturgeon fish that produce caviar.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Mail Vote Called Success  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The nation's first test of an
all-mail-voting primary election was an unqualified success,
boosting voter turnout to its highest level in a decade despite a
lackluster ballot, state officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think vote-by-mail is here to stay,'' Secretary of State
Bill Bradbury said a day after an election in which 50 percent of
voters participated.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout was the highest for an Oregon primary election since
1988, when 55.1 percent of voters cast ballots. In the last primary
election in 1998, 34.9 of registered voters participated.
</P>
<P>
   Vote by mail was mainly responsible for the increase, Bradbury
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see how you could conclude otherwise,'' he said. ''The
election wasn't exciting and you have to say, 'There must be other
factors here.'''
</P>
<P>
   The figures were unofficial and don't include a small number of
unreadable ballots or others that were misdelivered. Although
critics have said mail balloting could invite attempts at fraud,
State Elections Director Colleen Sealock said no problems were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Oregonians have voted by mail in local elections and special
statewide elections since the early 1980s, but Tuesday's election
was the first full-blown primary conducted exclusively by mail
since Oregon voters abolished polling places two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks fell early Thursday, led by
information technology issues, following a decline on Wall Street.
The dollar was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 194.31 points,
or 1.11 percent, to 17,209.72 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Wednesday, the average closed up 147.22 points, or 0.84
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 108.82 yen, down 0.56 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 109.41 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index opened lower Thursday
after drops in New York on Wednesday led shares in Japanese high
technology issues and major brokerages into negative territory.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 164.83 points
to 10,769.74 at Wednesday's close. The Nasdaq composite index lost
72.61 points to close at 3,644.96.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 20.19 points, or 1.23 percent, to 1,616.26
points. The TOPIX closed up 6.62 points, or 0.40 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar slipped from the
109 yen level in line with its downward trend in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The yen was supported against the greenback by a Japanese
government report revising industrial output data to a 2.4 percent
rise in March above February, reversing its initial assessment of a
1.0 percent drop. The upward revision partly reflected a change in
the government calculation method.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 97.26 yen, down from
98.04 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.7550 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.77 percent. Its
price rose 0.13 point to 100.38.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Troops Push in Eritrea  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKOMBIA, Eritrea (AP) -- Troops, artillery pieces and fuel
tankers poured through this once-bustling market town Wednesday as
Ethiopian troops pushed deep into Eritrea on the sixth day of a
massive offensive to end a two-year border conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate objective was Barentu, 25 miles north of the
border and the command center of Eritrea's army in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Barentu, a provincial capital of about 25,000
people, was imminent, said Ethiopian government spokesman Haile
Kiros, who accompanied reporters to the area. He said the goal was
not to hold the town, but to defeat the opposing army, secure the
territory around the contested border and withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if we want to hold it, we cannot afford to,'' he said as
troops returning from the frontline, about a dozen miles to the
north, cheered and waved green, yellow and red Ethiopian flags.
''If there is anything Eritrea wants to claim, and as long as they
do not do it militarily, we will have talks and try to solve it
legally.''
</P>
<P>
   About 125 miles to the east in the Eritrean capital of Asmara,
government and aid officials told The Associated Press that about
200,000 Eritreans had fled Barentu and the surrounding area, posing
yet another humanitarian crisis in the drought-stricken region.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, the Eritrean government asked local U.N.
officials to seek emergency international aid for Eritreans
displaced by the latest round of fighting that began May 12 with
the Ethiopian drive on the Badme border area southeast of Barentu.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Nhongo, the U.N. resident coordinator for Eritrea, said
the government had requested 700 tons of high-energy biscuits, 150
tons of milk powder and 15 tanker truckers to carry water.
</P>
<P>
   There were no civilians to be seen in Tokombia, only donkeys and
cows that wandered forlornly through the main square of the dusty,
wind-swept town.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers emerged from shops carrying clothing, shoes, soft
drinks, tea and food items, but a 22-year-old company commander
denied they were looting.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people have been fighting the enemy,'' said Abdu Said.
''If you see a lot of these things all over the place, it happened
during the fighting. By nature and by training, we do not go for
looting places.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the artillery pieces seen were four mobile rocket
launchers, with an effective range of 25 miles, loaded and ready to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Abdu predicted the war would end in a short time after the
Eritrean invaders had been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council remained deadlocked on a
resolution that would impose an arms embargo on both countries.
Russia and France want the ban to be limited; the United States and
Britain want it to apply until Ethiopia and Eritrea have signed and
implemented a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In Lisbon, the 15-member European Union, one of the major aid
donors to both nations, called for an immediate stop to the
fighting and an unconditional resumption of frustrated peace talks
sponsored by the Organization of African Unity. Portugal holds the
current six-month EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The war broke out in May 1998 when Eritrea occupied Badme. But
Haile said the border issue was a ''secondary'' issue. He blamed
Eritrea for trying to put a stranglehold on the economic life of
Ethiopia, which became landlocked after Eritrea gained independence
from Ethiopia in 1993 and kept the Red Sea ports.
</P>
<P>
   Most Eritreans view the war as a David-versus-Goliath contest
with the larger Ethiopia, with an estimated population of 61.7
million, determined to dominate upstart Eritrea, population 4
million.

<HEADLINE> Expos 10, Diamondbacks 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero and Peter Bergeron homered and
Jose Vidro hit three straight doubles, leading Carl Pavano and the
Montreal Expos over the Arizona Diamondbacks 10-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The loss assured the Diamondbacks of their first road series
loss since last July. Arizona had gone 16-0-1 over its last 17 road
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored in each of the first five innings and Vidro
tying a team record for doubles. Montreal won its third in a row,
including two straight against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano (4-1) pitched four-hit ball for eight innings. He gave up
Steve Finley's 14th homer leading off the second inning and Tony
Womack's fourth homer with two outs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Pavano struck out a career-high eight and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal got four straight hits off Armando Reynoso (2-4) to
start the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron singled and scored on Vidro's double. Rondell White
singled home Vidro, Guerrero doubled and Lee Stevens hit an RBI
grounder to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   After Finley homered, Vidro restored the Expos' three-run lead
in the bottom of the second with his second straight RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero hit his 12th homer in the third. Bergeron homered and
Vidro and White hit doubles in the fourth for a 7-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso left the game after issuing Guerrero's major
league-leading 11th intentional walk following White's two-out
double. Reynoso allowed 10 hits and seven runs in just 3 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos added three in the fifth off reliever Dan Plesac. Andy
Tracy singled and Chris Widger walked to lead off the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Cabrera followed with a bloop single to center and both
Tracy and Widger scored when Finley's attempt to throw out Widger
advancing to second sailed across the infield and rolled along the
backstop.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera, who advanced to third on the play, scored Montreal's
10th run on a wild pitch by Plesac.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Just 8,766 were on hand for the game. ... Arizona 3B Matt
Williams went 1-for-2 with a walk Tuesday night in his first
rehabilitation start start for Double-A El Paso. ... Expos closer
Ugueth Urbina had one bone chip removed from his right elbow
Wednesday morning. Urbina will follow a 4-6 week rehab program. ...
Pavano struck out seven in his last start. ... Vidro became the
25th Expo to hit three doubles in a game and first since Wilton
Guerrero hit three doubles last June 14 at St. Louis.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Scott Rolen hit two home runs, including a
tiebreaking shot in the seventh inning Wednesday night, and the
Philadelphia Phillies snapped a four-game losing streak with a 5-4
win over the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen's homer in the seventh off reliever Heathcliff Slocumb
(1-3) came after the Cardinals had tied it at 4 in the top of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen also homered in the fifth, giving the Phillies a 4-2 lead
and capping a four-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wolf (3-2) struck out nine in seven innings. The Phillies
beat St. Louis for the first time in five tries this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brantley pitched the ninth inning for his first save since
May 16, 1999. He was activated from the disabled list May 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had overcome a 4-2 deficit by scoring two runs in
the seventh. Eric Davis scored on a groundout and Craig Paquette
came home on a single by pinch-hitter Placido Polanco.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Darryl Kile allowed four runs and 10 hits in
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant hit a three-run homer in the fifth for a 3-2 lead. He
broke an 0-for-13 slump with the long drive to center field.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Rolen homered down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's runs came after it squandered opportunities in
the third and fourth. The Phillies left two runners on in the third
and left the bases loaded in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Renteria opened the scoring in the third with a solo home
run, his eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals made it 2-0 in the fourth on doubles by Eric Davis
and Craig Paquette.
Notes: Philadelphia's Mike Lieberthal singled in the fourth ended
an 0-for-16 slump. He finished the game 1-for-4. ... Mark McGwire
is now 0-for-8 against Wolf with five strikeouts. McGwire has
struggled in this series, going 0-for-6 with three walks and four
strikeouts.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Finds Cocaine Cache  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A police search of a farm near
Colombia's Caribbean coast turned up more than five tons of cocaine
stashed in an underground cellar, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Six men were arrested in the operation, one of the largest
single cocaine seizures ever in the South American country that
produces an estimated 90 percent of the world's cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The search involving police and naval units occurred Tuesday in
San Onofre, a town 240 miles north of Bogota near the Gulf of
Morrosquillo.
</P>
<P>
   Before the raid, cocaine warehoused on the farm was moved by
speedboat to larger ships that carried the drugs toward the United
States, said Jorge Lagos, the state security police director in
Bolivar State.
</P>
<P>
   The huge drug seizure comes as the U.S. Congress debates a
Clinton Administration plan to give Colombia more than a billion
dollars to combat cocaine and heroin trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana flew to the nearby port of Cartagena
on Wednesday to inspect the 5.2-ton stash, which was brought by
helicopter from the farm where it was found.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again we are dealing blows to the great financiers of
violence in Colombia,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The cocaine bricks laid out at the president's feet represent
one percent of Colombia's 520 ton annual production of the drug.
Pastrana put the drug's street value at $1.2 billion, about what
his government hopes to receive from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In December, 1998, police in Cartagena discovered more than 7
tons of cocaine hidden in shipping containers modified to conceal
it. Officials called it the largest cocaine seizure ever on
Colombia soil.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Rebel Leader Captured  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Days after disappearing, the rebel
leader whose followers burned, looted, maimed and killed across
Sierra Leone was captured Wednesday by pro-government forces, who
shot him in the leg, stripped him naked, and turned him over to
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of Foday Sankoh, whose Revolutionary United Front
has terrorized civilians, prompted joyous celebrations in the
streets of Freetown, where thousands have died during eight years
of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Questions remained whether Sankoh's capture would speed an end
to Sierra Leone's reignited civil war -- or spur his Revolutionary
United Front followers to even more violence.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one positive sign, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
announced in New York that Liberia had reported the rebels freeing
another 80 U.N. peacekeepers held by the renegades deep in the
forested interior of this West African nation.
</P>
<P>
   The latest releases, among 500 U.N. personnel captured earlier
this month, were moved to Liberia's remote border town of Foya
where more than 100 of their colleagues had been delivered over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters were gradually ferrying the freed captives to
Liberia's capital, Monrovia, and then to Freetown. The latest
releases brought the number of peacekeepers still in captivity to
around 270.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was captured early Wednesday next door to his home in
Freetown, which he fled May 8 after RUF fighters opened fire on
thousands of demonstrators, killing 19, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of people stood around a pool of blood near Sankoh's
ransacked home Wednesday, discussing his capture in lively tones.
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by civilians, pro-government soldiers confronted
Sankoh and his bodyguards as they approached the house from the
surrounding hills, witnesses said. Gunshots rang out and the rebel
leader was wounded in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, a mob formed. Sankoh was disrobed by the
jubilant crowd and taken to the home of ex-junta leader Johnny Paul
Koroma, who heads the forces that captured Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   A photo taken by one witness showed Sankoh crammed into a
four-wheel drive vehicle, with one captor holding him by the neck
and another gesturing toward the rebel leader as if showing off a
prize.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a victory for Sierra Leone, a victory for common sense
and a victory for the peace process,'' said Koroma's spokesman,
Prince Nicol. The fighters cheered and raised their guns in triumph
in front of their leader's home.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Sierra Leone, a British helicopter flew Sankoh
to nearby Lungi Airport, then to an unidentified ''secure
location,'' where he was being held by Sierra Leonean military
police, said Lt. Cmdr. Tony Cramp, spokesman for the British forces
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The British troops are in Sierra Leone to assist with the U.N.
peacekeeping mission. Britain is the former colonial power in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright welcomed
the arrest of rebel leader Foday Sankoh of Sierra Leone and civil
rights activist Jesse Jackson was planning to depart Wednesday on a
five-nation West Africa tour to promote peace in that country.
</P>
<P>
   As word of Sankoh's capture spread, people rushed into the
streets to rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   ''The masses must decide what to do with him,'' said S.K.
Shyllon, an engineer. ''But I say he is not fit to exist ... He
made the people of this country suffer for nine years.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would happen to Sankoh, government spokesman Septimus
Kai Kai said: ''A lot of these things are being sorted out now. Our
main concern now is that we can ... bring peace to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Sierra Leone believe Sankoh should be stripped of the
amnesty granted in a July peace accord, which also gave the rebel
leader a ministerial position in a power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enough is enough,'' said Amara Bangura, who heard the gunshots
near Sankoh's home and rushed to the scene. ''He has to be tried
for all the atrocities he has committed in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Human Rights Watch called for Sankoh to tried for
mass crimes against humanity committed by his soldiers and
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Foday Sankoh must not be subjected to mob rule,'' said the
group's Africa director, Peter Takirambudde. ''Otherwise, the cycle
of violence in Sierra Leone will only continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was previously captured in 1997, and later convicted of
treason and sentenced to death. His rebels responded by launching
an offensive that culminated with an invasion of Freetown in
January 1999. They were driven out of the city by West African
troops several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh was released to sign the July peace deal. The fragile
accord unraveled this month when Sankoh's rebels seized 500 U.N.
peacekeepers and attacked U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, rebel fighters attacked U.N. peacekeepers in
the northwestern town of Port Loko, U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst
said. One Nigerian peacekeeper was killed and five injured in the
two-hour firefight. Six pro-government soldiers were also killed
and five injured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, British troops killed four rebels in a battle
10 miles east of Freetown's airport, the British military said. The
British, who responded after coming under fire, suffered no
casualties, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   During their eight-year campaign against the government, the
rebels killed tens of thousands of people and mutilated and
dismembered many more in a bid to gain power through intimidation.

<HEADLINE> Deliberation in Rail Killer Case  </HEADLINE>
By C. BRYSON HULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Jurors deliberated the sanity of admitted
railroad killer Angel Maturino Resendiz, the only question left for
them in determining the Mexican drifter's fate.
</P>
<P>
   The jury got the case Wednesday morning, but they already knew
Maturino Resendiz committed the crime with which he's charged -- the
killing of a Houston area woman. Faced with a mountain of physical
evidence, the defense asked the jury to find Maturino Resendiz
innocent of capital murder by reason of insanity.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the jury still had not reached a verdict
after nine hours of deliberations. State District Judge Bill Harmon
ordered the jury sequestered at a hotel for the night and set
deliberations to begin again Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The defense forced the panel to consider only the sanity issue,
after conceding the facts of the case by admitting Maturino
Resendiz, 40, killed Dr. Claudia Benton and eight others during
cross-country travels as a freight-train stowaway.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors must decide whether Maturino Resendiz was sane and
aware that he was breaking the law when he broke into Benton's West
University Place, Texas, home, then raped, stabbed and bludgeoned
the physician to death.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty, Maturino Resendiz would face life in prison or
death by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators tied him to five other killings in Texas, two in
Illinois and one in Kentucky -- all of them near railroad tracks --
during a spree spanning 1997-99.

<P>
   The Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange -- Latin
America's largest -- shed 3.2 percent Wednesday to finish at 14,870
points. Trading volume was well below average at $189 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tuesday's interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve may slow
down the inflow of foreign capital, making it difficult for Brazil
to lower its interest rates,'' when monetary authorities meet next
week, said Carlos Kawall, chief economist at Citibank in Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   ''American investors will seek other safer alternatives like
treasury bonds,'' Kawall added. ''And with a possible weakening of
the real, the government will have no choice but to leave interest
rates as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian real closed weaker against the dollar Wednesday on
very low volumes, with the local currency following New York stock
markets, traders said. The real closed at 1.83 per dollar, compared
with Tuesday's finish of 1.8190.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, regional markets gained and heaved a collective sigh
of relief Tuesday as investors cheered the end of uncertainty.
Analysts said the Fed's hike had been fully priced in.
</P>
<P>
   But comfort was short-lived as investors on Wednesday focused on
the Fed's statement that further rate hikes were likely if
inflationary pressures didn't cede.
</P>
<P>
   Local traders say that uncertainty was sidelining investors, who
were also growing jittery ahead of Mexico's presidential elections
July 2. Opposition candidate Vicente Fox is running neck-and-neck
with the ruling party's Francisco Labastida in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Market jitters also spread to the peso, which weakened against
the dollar. Mexico's currency closed at 9.545 to the dollar,
compared to Tuesday's close of 9.518.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Kennedy Aide Has Porn Conviction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A former aide to Eunice Kennedy Shriver
was convicted Wednesday of distributing child pornography over the
Internet and traveling to Utah to have sex with a 12-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Pearl faces a maximum of 10 years in prison when he's
sentenced July 26.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl, 40, testified he sent images of child pornography to an
Internet companion who turned out to be a licensed therapist and
former police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl's attorney, Robert Breeze, argued his client was entrapped
by the woman, who may have manufactured a case against Pearl
because she hoped to get a job as a cyber-sex cop.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl, who lived in Maryland, was fired when the Kennedy family
learned of his arrest. Shriver is a sister of the late President
John F. Kennedy, the late Sen. Robert Kennedy and Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Recovers From Storm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Thousands of people left
emergency shelters Wednesday following a powerful storm that killed
four people, injured dozens and flooded homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy downpours, combined with winds gusting above 50 mph, also
caused dozens of injuries from flying debris, falling trees, and
highway accidents in parts of the capital and outlying Buenos Aires
Province.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, sweeping in from the South Atlantic Ocean to mark the
approach of the southern hemisphere winter, forced more than 25,000
people to evacuate their homes and left 140,000 people temporarily
without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando De la Rua praised local authorities for a
speedy response to Tuesday's storm, saying fast action blunted the
worst effects. ''The fast reaction of Buenos Aires' government was
crucial to solving the problems caused by the severe weather,'' De
la Rua said in a statement transmitted by news agency Diarios y
Noticias.
</P>
<P>
   Workers cleared away scores of fallen trees and commuters forded
water-clogged arteries Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three children died Tuesday when a tree fell on a shelter in
Rosario, 180 miles northwest of the capital, authorities said. In a
fourth fatality, a 28-year-old man was electrocuted when he stepped
on a fallen power line in Buenos Aires.

<HEADLINE> Devils' Brule May Make NHL Debut  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- After more than five years in the
minors waiting for his chance with the New Jersey Devils, Steve
Brule apparently is going to get it in the unlikeliest of
situations, Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Brule has been penciled in by coach Larry Robinson to make his
NHL debut against the Philadelphia Flyers on Thursday night,
replacing the injured John Madden on the Devils' third line with
Jay Pandolfo and Claude Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just ready to go if they give me the call,'' the
25-year-old Brule said Wednesday after the Devils worked out at the
Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously it's too bad 'Mad Dog' got hurt. That's not the way
you want to get into the lineup. You never want to see someone get
hurt, especially someone as important as 'Mad Dog.' But that's why
I was here, in case someone got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden hurt his right knee in the third period of Game 2 on
Tuesday night after being checked by Keith Primeau and falling
awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
   After an MRI exam Wednesday, the Devils said Madden will not
need surgery. The Devils did not disclose the exact nature of the
injury. They said it is similar to the one sustained by Sergei
Brylin earlier in the playoffs. He was sidelined for three weeks
and missed six games.
</P>
<P>
   Brule has certainly paid his dues with the Devils. Since joining
Albany (N.Y.) of the AHL late in the 1994-95 season, he has played
a team-record 394 games. He holds the River Rats' career records
for goals (155), assists (214) and points (369).
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal native who was the Devils' sixth pick in the 1993
NHL draft had 30 goals and 46 assists in leading Albany in scoring
this season. It was his fourth consecutive 30-goal season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long time,'' Brule said of his expected debut.
''That's in the past, though. You don't think about that. You just
think what is best for the team, and the team winning. You forget
about everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   With Madden as its center, the third line was matched up against
a lot of top lines in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that changes with Brule is a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think when you get the puck you have to go on offense and
when you don't have the puck you have to play well defensively,''
Brule said. ''I think you just have to do your job defensively when
you play against good guys. When you have the puck you want to be
safe, but at the same time you want to go on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Devils defenseman Brad Bombardir said that Brule can do that
without any problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing he can do is put the puck in the back of the
net,'' Bombardir said. ''He's always had a knack for that.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does play, Brule knows what to expect in Game 3 -- a lot of
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's great. That's a good way to get into the game,'' he
added. ''You get into the action. The emotions are there. It's a
good atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a great way to make a debut.

<HEADLINE> Mets 4, Rockies 2  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM NAZIMOWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Leiter pitched eight strong innings and the
New York Mets remained unbeaten in his eight starts, ending the
Colorado Rockies' season-high four-game winning streak with a 4-2
victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (5-0) gave up five hits and matched his season-high with
nine strikeouts, giving him 26 in his last three starts. He has won
four straight starts, beginning with a 14-11 victory at Colorado on
April 30.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco pitched the ninth for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took a 2-0 lead in the third on Jeff Cirillo's two-out
RBI double and Jeffrey Hammonds' run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got one back in the bottom half as Benny Agbayani led
off with a single, went to third on Rey Ordonez's hit-and-run
single to right, and scored on Joe McEwing's RBI single. A one-out
walk to Derek Bell loaded the bases, but Rolando Arrojo escaped
further trouble by striking out Edgardo Alfonzo and getting Mike
Piazza to fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   New York went ahead 3-2 in the fifth after there were two outs.
Alfonzo walked, Piazza reached on an infield single, and Robin
Ventura brought them home with a double to the corner in right.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo got himself into trouble again with two outs in the
sixth. He walked Leiter on a full count, hit McEwing with a pitch
on a 1-2 count, then walked Bell to load the bases after again
getting ahead 1-2. But Alfonzo grounded out to first, leaving the
bases loaded for the second time and ending the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added a run in the eighth when pinch-hitter Jon
Nunnally led off with a double, went to third on McEwing's
sacrifice and scored on Alfonzo's single.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo (1-4), who hasn't won in five straight starts, allowed
three runs on six hits and five walks in six innings, striking out
six.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Rockies haven't won five straight since a seven-game
streak from Sept. 6-12, 1998. ... Colorado 1B Todd Helton missed
his second straight game because of a strained right hamstring. He
is listed as day-to-day. ... Ordonez, in a 3-for-30 slump coming
in, went 2-for-4. ... Franco appeared in his 500th game with the
Mets, extending his club record. ... Rick Reed, who got a
no-decision in Tuesday night's loss, was presented with the team
pitcher of the month award for April before Wednesday's game. Reed
was 3-0 with a 2.21 ERA in five starts last month.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 9, White Sox 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Bernie Williams made sure the New York Yankees
didn't waste another strong outing from a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Williams homered twice, including a grand slam, to back Roger
Clemens and snap New York's five-game losing streak with 9-4 win
over the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre juggled his lineup after the Yankees scored
just 11 runs in their longest losing streak since last May, moving
Williams to the second spot and Shane Spencer to cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Both players delivered: Williams hit a solo homer in the fourth
inning and his eighth career grand slam in the fifth, while Spencer
went 3-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   So did the rest of the lineup. The Yankees, who had gone three
games without an extra-base hit, had seven in the first five
innings to make Clemens' job easy.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (4-3) even delivered an early message, hitting shortstop
Jose Valentin on the right arm in the first inning. The Yankees'
shortstop, Clay Bellinger, was hit in the left shoulder on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of only five runners allowed by Clemens, who struck
out nine and walked none in seven innings. He allowed just four
hits with the only runs coming on solo homers by Greg Norton and
Magglio Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who didn't hold a lead at the end of any inning
during their skid, broke out quickly against Jim Parque (3-2).
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch led off the game with a triple down the
right-field line and scored on Paul O'Neill's one-out double. Jorge
Posada added a sacrifice fly to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored twice in the third when center fielder Chris
Singleton, playing with a bandage on his dislocated right index
finger, dropped Jim Leyritz's line drive for a two-base error.
O'Neill and Posada scored on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Then Williams took over.
</P>
<P>
   After flashing a bunt on the first pitch from the left-handed
Parque, Williams homered into Monument Park for his ninth homer.
</P>
<P>
   New York loaded the bases for Williams with one out in the fifth
against right-hander Tanyon Sturtze. Williams fouled off the first
five pitches before hitting a high fly that barely cleared the
right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Williams took a curtain call, as the Yankees fans finally had
something to cheer after watching their team get shut out in its
last two home games.
</P>
<P>
   In between the two shutouts, the Yankees were swept in a
three-game series in Detroit, prompting a visit from owner George
Steinbrenner. The Boss must have been happier than he was after
watching the Yankees lose 4-0 in the series opener despite getting
eight strong innings from Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ''El Duque'' has two of the five losses in the streak even
though he allowed only three runs in 17 innings. David Cone also
picked up a tough loss, allowing two runs in seven innings of a 2-1
loss Sunday in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez added a two-run double off Jason Grimsley in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Williams has homered from both sides of the plate eight
times in his career, including twice in the postseason. He has done
it twice this season, joining Mickey Mantle (1955-56) as the only
Yankees to do it. ... Williams has 11 career multihomer games. ...
The top four batters in the White Sox order were 0-for-26 in the
series before Ordonez's homer in the sixth. ... The Yankees last
lost six straight games from Sept. 1-6, 1997. ... Bellinger was a
late scratch because of the sore left shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Preparing for Summit  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea resumed high-level
talks on Thursday amid indications that weeks of negotiations may
soon produce an accord on the agenda for a summit of their leaders
in June.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials were upbeat about the prospect of
Thursday's meeting, saying that both sides had made progress in
unofficial contacts on one last pending issue -- the size of the
South Korean press corp for the June 12-14 summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have much time left to the summit. We must wrap up a
deal today in one way or another,'' Unification Minister Park
Jae-kyu said before the meeting opened in the southern sector of
Panmunjom, a neutral border village.
</P>
<P>
   In a report by its overseas news outlet, KCNA, on Wednesday,
North Korea also said ''basic agreement'' was reached on the South
Korean press coverage for the summit in its capital of Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Cabinet-level meeting at Panmunjom was the fifth
since April 22. After failing to reach accord in four rounds of
talks, the two sides last week decided to discuss details through
documents and telephone contacts.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea had proposed sending an 80-member press corp but
North Korea asked that the number be halved. Seoul officials said
the issue would not jeopardize the summit.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea plans to send a 30-member advance team to North
Korea toward the end of this month to prepare for the summit.
Officials said the team will include specialists in security,
protocol and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Local media, quoting unidentified government sources, said the
two Koreas would agree not to use their national flags and songs
during the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reduced protocol is line with the precedent set by East
and West Germany when they started contact to improve ties,'' the
Chosun Ilbo newspaper quoted one unidentified government official
as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The summit would be the first ever between the two Koreas which
were divided into the communist North and the pro-Western South in
1945. Their three-year war in the early 1950s ended in an
armistice, not a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In a luncheon meeting with religious leaders on Wednesday,
President Kim Dae-jung said he would not seek ''too much at a
time'' from the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   High on South Korea's summit agenda are economic cooperation and
reunions of separated family members. North Korea is expected to
raise the U.S. military presence in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials believe that North Korea was driven to
agree to the summit for economic reasons. With its economy in
tatters, the North has been relying on foreign aid to feed its 22
million people since 1995.

<HEADLINE> Russians Recover Pilots' Bodies  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops combing through mountain
forests have found the bodies of two pilots whose plane was shot
down by rebels, the military said Wednesday, one of just a few
aircraft downed in the nine-month war.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, meanwhile, said he was
prepared to negotiate an end to the war with Russian President
Vladimir Putin. Putin has said he could talk with Maskhadov, but
only if the rebels unconditionally surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Troops conducting a search-and-rescue operation in Chechnya's
southern mountains found the bodies of the crew of a Su-24MR
reconnaissance plane that crashed May 7, the office of presidential
aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckage of the aircraft was found two miles from the village of
Benoi-Vedeno.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been established that the plane was shot down during
combat operations and its crew, a pilot and a navigator, were
killed,'' the military said in a statement. ''The bodies of the
dead pilots, the black boxes and the main fragments of the plane
have been recovered from the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels lack sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons, and have
shot down few Russian planes.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's air campaign has remained steady despite the loss of
the aircraft. Air force planes flew 14 combat missions over the
past 24 hours, targeting rebel formations in the mountains in the
south and southeast, the military said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said Russian aircraft also bombed sheep fields and
farms in southwest Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   As the war drags on, the Kremlin has hinted it could be seeking
a political solution. But Moscow demands that the rebels surrender
their weapons and release all Russian hostages -- conditions most
rebel leaders reject.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov has said he is ready to negotiate, but his authority
over the fractured rebel bands is questionable. In a videotape
interview obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, he said he
was prepared to negotiate with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chechen people are tired of eternal wars,'' Maskhadov
said. ''The recent war has been a terrible ordeal for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ''Although I am a military man, I am also the president
and I am ready to do everything to start negotiations to stop this
war. As I was ready for talks with President (Boris) Yeltsin, now
I'm ready for this dialogue with President Putin.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops entered Chechnya in September after
Chechnya-based Islamic militants seized several villages in
neighboring Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in apartment
bombings that the government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Woman Testifies in Atheist Case  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN (AP) -- The only person charged in the disappearance of
atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair said he had been told the woman and
her family were killed, a federal investigator testified in court
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Paul Karr, 52, gave investigators a written statement in
March 1999 that said another suspect, David Roland Waters,
acknowledged he had killed O'Hair and her son and granddaughter,
according to FBI agent Samuel Sykes Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Madalyn O'Hair, son Jon Garth Murray and granddaughter Robin all
disappeared from San Antonio in 1995 along with $500,000 in gold
coins. Investigators believe they were kidnapped and robbed before
they were killed and buried.
</P>
<P>
   An ex-con, Karr is charged with conspiracy to kidnap and extort
money from the O'Hairs. He faces up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Karr told agents he drove Robin O'Hair's car to the Austin
airport and left it there ''to make it look like the O'Hairs, or at
least Robin, had willingly left Austin,'' Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was on the witness stand for about 30 minutes at the end
of the day as the prosecution presented some of its strongest
testimony in the case, although much of it centered on Waters, who
has not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   The agent said Karr also drew investigators a map of a South
Texas ranch where Karr believed their bodies were buried.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 agents searched the ranch in April 1999 but no bodies
were found.
</P>
<P>
   Karr also told investigators Waters recruited him to help the
O'Hairs flee the country to avoid problems with the Internal
Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe Waters masterminded the alleged plot. He
is serving 60 years in prison for stealing from the O'Hair's
atheist organizations and federal gun charges.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' ex-girlfriend, Patti Jo Steffens, testified for about
six hours and detailed bloody shoes she said she found in the
apartment they shared and that before she disappeared Waters
sometimes fantasized about torturing Madalyn O'Hair.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the O'Hairs were dismembered and buried in
55-gallon drums.

<HEADLINE> Arrests Made in 1963 Church Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE BRYAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two former Ku Klux Klansmen were
arrested on murder charges Wednesday in the 1963 Birmingham church
bombing that killed four black girls on a Sunday morning -- a crime
that shocked the nation and galvanized the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas E. Blanton Jr., 61, of Birmingham, and Bobby Frank
Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Texas, surrendered on the state charges and
were jailed without bail. If convicted, they could get life in
prison with the possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have long suspected that Blanton and Cherry plotted
with former Klansman Robert Edward Chambliss to bomb the Sixteenth
Street Baptist Church. Chambliss was convicted in 1977 and died in
prison in 1985. A fourth suspect, Herman Cash, was never charged;
he, too, is dead.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Doug Jones would not say what led to the break in
the case after 37 years. But over the past year, estranged family
members of Cherry have said publicly that he talked of helping
plant the dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Cherry's 47-year-old son, Thomas Frank Cherry,
appeared before the special Jefferson County grand jury but said he
couldn't discuss his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The blast was one of the most horrific crimes of the civil
rights era and came just months after police in Birmingham used
dogs and firehoses to drive back black marchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 15, 1963, blast demolished an outside wall of the
church and killed four girls who were in a basement restroom,
preparing for a youth program: 11-year-old Denise McNair and three
14-year-olds, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson and Addie Mae
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment marked the latest in a series of 1960s racial
crimes in the South that are being brought for prosecution decades
later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Byron de la Beckwith was convicted in the 1963
assassination in Jackson, Miss., of NAACP organizer Medgar Evers.
In 1998, former KKK leader Samuel H. Bowers, 73, was found guilty
in the 1966 firebomb death of Mississippi civil rights activist
Vernon Dahmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one should stop until the people who are responsible are
brought to justice,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Cherry for years have denied any role in the
Birmingham bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Johnson, Cherry's lawyer, said his client is in ill
health. ''He wants the world to know his story, and he thinks he'll
be vindicated,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton and Cherry were charged with eight counts of murder each
-- two counts covering each of the four slain girls. One count was
for intentional murder and the other involved ''universal malice''
because the bomb was placed where it could have killed any number
of people.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the evidence lent itself better to state charges than
to federal ones. He said the capital murder statute on the books in
1963 could not be used because it was replaced in the mid-1970s
after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Wilson, 39, a black man who works for a staffing
services company, said it was unfair that whoever bombed the church
had remained free for decades. ''They should have taken care of
this a long time ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a white resident, Stan Leo, who was 16 when the church was
bombed, questioned the point of pursuing the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry it all happened,'' he said, ''but it needs to be
buried and put aside and let the city go on. Why keep bringing up
the past?''
</P>
<P>
   Widespread revulsion over the killing of girls at Sunday
services added many moderates -- in Birmingham and elsewhere -- to
the civil rights cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Christopher Hamlin, pastor of the church since 1990,
said there is a ''strong sense of some beginning of a conclusion''
to the bombing. ''The city has come a long way in race relations''
since 1963, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial federal investigation into the bombing resulted in
no charges, though the FBI named the four Ku Klux Klansmen as
suspects. After the probe that led to Chambliss' conviction, the
case was reopened in 1980 and 1988, without additional charges. It
was reopened yet again in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, the bombing was the subject of director Spike
Lee's Oscar-nominated documentary ''4 Little Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry was arrested last month on sex abuse charges. Cherry's
former stepdaughter, Gloria Jean LaDow, last year publicly accused
him of assaulting her in Shelby County outside of Birmingham 29
years ago. Cherry appeared in court in Columbiana, Ala. on May 8
and remained free on $50,000 bond until his arrest Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Blanton wrote in a 1997 letter to The Birmingham News that he
was not to blame for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Martin Luther King III, son of slain civil rights
leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said it was
''unfathomable'' it took so long to bring the alleged murderers
into custody.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father's heart was broken when the four little girls who
were dressed for Sunday school were murdered inside the sanctuary
of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in 1963,'' King III said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, a leader of the Birmingham
demonstrations in the 1960s and now a pastor in Cincinnati, said
the charges should have been brought long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FBI, they knew back then what they know now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Unionists Urged To Take IRA Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Protestant unionists in Northern Ireland should
''seize the credit'' for recent progress on IRA disarmament,
instead of blocking the restoration of a power-sharing government
with new conditions, Britain's senior official for the province
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson told lawmakers in the
House of Commons that it now appeared possible to both restore the
government and make ''real, lasting and permanent progress in the
removal of arms from Northern Ireland politics forever.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And I think it's an opportunity that we should seize for fear
that if it slips from our grasp now, we may not be able to recreate
it in the future,'' Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The governing council of the Ulster Unionist Party, which
receives the bulk of Protestant votes in Northern Ireland, meets
Saturday to decide whether to go back into the government.
</P>
<P>
   The government was suspended in February after the Ulster
Unionists threatened to walk out because the Irish Republican Army
had done nothing about disarmament. On May 6, the IRA reversed
direction and offered to open its weapons dumps to international
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Some Ulster Unionists have said that doesn't go far enough. They
also have demanded assurances that the name of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary will not be changed as part of the process of
reforming the police service, and that British flags will fly over
public buildings in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, responding to a question from Ulster
Unionist leader David Trimble, said in the Commons that the IRA
gesture was ''an important confidence-building measure'' but only
the start of a process of silencing the guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to make progress until the time when these weapons are
indeed completely, verifiably, beyond use,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said that ''what is unprecedented about the situation
now is that we have the real prospect both of returning power to
Northern Ireland and at the same time making very real and
substantive progress on arms.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Both these objectives are ones that unionists have rightly
held out for. Now I believe they should seize the credit for the
progress that is being made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling Wednesday in Greenwich, Conn., President Clinton
also urged the parties in Northern Ireland to seize this chance for
peace, which he called ''an opportunity that must not be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a chance to lock in the unprecedented progress that
has been attained and propel the process forward,'' Clinton said in
a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I urge the parties to lift their sights, seize the
possibilities that are within their grasp, and take the steps
necessary to advance the cause of peace.''

<HEADLINE> State Ed upholds rape and other charges against longtime school administrator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PERU, N.Y. (AP) -- A veteran school administrator who spent the
last 12 years as assistant principal for discipline was fired
Tuesday after a state Education Department hearing officer upheld
many of the charges leveled against him by the school board.
</P>
<P>
   The Peru Central School Board made the announcement after
receiving a 73-page decision by SED Hearing Officer Paul S.
Zonderman. The decision upheld many of the 72 charges brought
against Junior-Senior High School Assistant Principal Stephen
Tolosky.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Zonderman described Tolosky as ''sexually
aggressive and adulterous, particularly after a few drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charge upheld by the hearing officer was of
raping a school employee in her home in 1988, a crime never
reported to police and for which the statute of limitations had run
out.
</P>
<P>
   Tolosky was also found guilty of sexually harassing employees,
having an adulterous, 10-year affair with a district employee of
which staff and students were aware; using profanity in front of
students; and income tax invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year district employee was suspended with pay from his
$72,133-a-year job in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Tolosky described the disciplinary
hearings as ''unfair'' and claimed he was not given the chance to
explain or defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four witnesses testified in behalf of Tolosky and the
school district during hearings held between Nov. 30, 1999 and
March 10.
</P>
<P>
   In recommending Tolosky's dismissal, Zonderman wrote, ''To be
sure, the district has searched far and wide to come up with an
expanded list of charges in an effort to discharge'' Tolosky.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, the district produced ''overwhelming
evidence that Tolosky is unfit to be a teacher or administrator in
the school system.''
</P>
<P>
   Peru is 9 miles south of Plattsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Braves 5, Giants 4  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Kevin Millwood pitched seven strong innings, Rudy
Seanez escaped a bases-loaded jam in the eighth as the Atlanta
Braves stretched their winning streak to five by beating the San
Francisco Giants 5-4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta built a 5-0 lead before San Francisco rallied with a run
in the seventh and three more in the eighth. Seanez thwarted the
comeback attempt by getting three outs on two pitches after
replacing Millwood with the bases loaded and the Braves clinging to
a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Crespo hit into a double play, a run scoring on the play,
and Armando Rios ended the threat with a grounder to second. With
John Rocker struggling, Seanez pitched the ninth as well for his
first save, send the Giants to their fifth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves withstood a San Francisco comeback on Tuesday night,
as well, nearly squandering leads of 6-2 and 9-5 before escaping
with a 9-7 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta got seven hits from the first 11 batters to face Kirk
Rueter (2-2), scoring two runs in the first inning and two more in
the second. The San Francisco left-hander settled down and allowed
only one more run before he was replaced after the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood (4-2) was dominating against the Giants, giving up just
two hits through the first six innings. He lost his shutout-bid
when Jeff Kent led off the seventh with his 11th homer into the
left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood left after giving up three singles in the eighth,
including Kent's run-scoring hit. The Atlanta right-hander pitched
high in the strike zone all night, getting only two of his outs on
grounders, and bounced back from his shortest start in more than a
year, a four-inning stint at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had nine hits against Rueter and three more against
reliever John Johnstone, giving Atlanta 43 hits in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Quilvio Veras led of the first with a double into the left-field
corner and scored on Andres Galarraga's opposite-field double off
the right-field wall, his fourth RBI in two games. Jordan, who had
two homers and three RBIs on Tuesday night, followed with a
line-drive single up the middle to bring home Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla led off the second with his third homer of the
season. Rafael Furcal doubled to deep center, moved to third on
Millwood's sacrifice and trotted home when Veras singled.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal used his speed to force the Giants into another throwing
error, leading to an unearned run in the fourth. The 19-year-old
shortstop dropped a bunt to third and wound up at second when Bill
Mueller's throw sailed past first baseman J.T. Snow.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal moved to third on Millwood's second straight sacrifice
and sprinted home when Snow made an ill-advised catch with his back
to the plate on a foul pop-up near the stands, resulting in a rare
sacrifice fly to first.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones saved a run for the Braves in the fourth with
another spectacular defensive play. The two-time Gold Glover made a
diving grab on a liner by Felipe Crespo with Kent at second after a
two-out double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bill Mueller went 2-for-3, extending his hitting streak to
13 games. The longest streak of his career is 17 games. ... Shawn
Estes was bumped up to pitch Thursday's game for San Francisco
against Greg Maddux after Joe Nathan went on the disabled list with
tendinitis in his right shoulder. ... Pat Corrales coached first
for the Braves after Glenn Hubbard underwent surgery to remove
kidney stones. Hubbard is expected to return by this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Source: Seattle Picks Up Henderson  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rickey Henderson, released by the New York Mets
over the weekend, has reached an agreement to play for the Seattle
Mariners, The Associated Press learned Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes a team option for a 2001 contract at $3
million, a baseball source who asked not to be identified told the
AP.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson and the Mariners agreed about eight hours after
baseball's career stolen base leader cleared waivers. The Montreal
Expos also pursued signing him.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was cut by the Mets on Saturday in the midst of a
troubling season. Slumping at the plate and booed by fans at Shea
Stadium, he was feuding with management.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, picked by many to win the AL West, are leading the
division. They will likely use the 41-year-old Henderson as their
regular leadoff hitter and left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson batted .219 with no homers and two RBIs for the Mets.
He stole five bases in seven tries, and has 1,339 career steals in
a major league career that started in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Mariners general manager Pat Gillick said the team's
main interest in Henderson would be as a designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has used Mark McLemore and Mike Cameron as its leadoff
hitters. Stan Javier has played mostly in left field.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known when Henderson, who was still in the New York
area, would join the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson had been upset since the start of spring training
because the Mets wouldn't raise his $1.9 million salary or give him
a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners only had to pay a portion of the minimum salary to
get Henderson -- meaning it cost them about $150,000, with the Mets
responsible for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, after Henderson twice passed through waivers
without anyone claiming him, the Mariners were willing to take a
chance on him -- including a raise -- for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had been interested in Henderson after the 1997 season,
when he was a free agent. Henderson eventually signed with Oakland
and played there for a season before signing with the Mets for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, a 10-time All-Star and the 1990 AL MVP, is regarded
by many as the greatest leadoff hitter in major league history. He
was MVP of the AL championship series in 1989, when he helped the
Athletics on to the World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   Since starting in the majors, Henderson has shifted teams nine
times. He's had four stints with the Athletics, and also has played
for the New York Yankees, Toronto, San Diego and Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday night, Henderson was criticized by Mets manager
Bobby Valentine for failing to run out a long drive -- Henderson
said he thought it was going to be a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Saturday's game against Florida, Henderson shouted at a
reporter who wrote about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''After considering everything that happened last night and this
morning, something had to be done,'' Mets general manager Steve
Phillips said at the time. ''I think the reasons are fairly
obvious. No matter how much talent you have, if you continue to
create problems and situations, you wear out your welcome. We got
to the point where we had to compromise our ideals and what we
expect from our players too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Henderson did not run out a ball on a similar play
against Atlanta, which Valentine noted. Henderson also created a
stir when he and Bobby Bonilla were accused of playing cards in the
Mets' clubhouse during the season-ending, extra-inning loss at
Atlanta in the NL championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, though, said he was not the reason the Mets, the NL
wild-card winner last year, were hovering around the .500 mark this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't cause them to lose. Look someplace else,'' he said
before quickly leaving the clubhouse following a 7-6 loss to
Florida, his final game for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Henderson often has slumped when unhappy.
Last season, he hit .315 with a .423 on-base percentage -- best
among NL leadoff men -- and stole 37 bases.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Opposition Party Splits  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An opposition party blamed for recent riots
has splintered after some members revolted against its top leaders,
accusing them of sedition and Islamic fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   After the revolt Tuesday night, the Islamic-oriented Labor Party
appears to have broken into three factions, likely increasing
President Hosni Mubarak's governing National Democratic Party's
domination of Egyptian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Labor Party had only two seats in the 454-member
Parliament, its members frequently raised questions uncomfortable
to the government in the party's newspaper, such as relations with
Israel, corruption and Islamic values.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdi Ahmed, a movie actor and a member of the party's Central
Committee, organized a rally late Tuesday in Cairo, attended by
hundreds of supporters. The rally named Ahmed as party president to
replace Ibrahim Shukri, who has led the party since its
establishment in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Ahmed's faction accused Shukri and his
followers of changing the party's socialist principles by adopting
the slogan ''Islam is the solution'' and by allowing members of
militant Islamic groups to join the party. The statement was
reported by Egypt's Middle East News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another rally was held simultaneously in a different
part of the capital by Ahmed Idriss, also a member of the 14-member
party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That rally also elected Idriss as party president, accusing
Shukri's leadership of changing the Labor Party ''to a religious
party and forming coalitions with (Muslim) brotherhood and
fanatics.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Shukri held a news conference at the party's
headquarters in which the party's chairman described the rallies as
a ''sabotage attack against an office of the party.'' The party
also issued a statement describing Tuesday night's events as an
''ugly aggression against the law and the practicing of
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The developments came as the Political Parties Committee, a
government watchdog that licenses political groups, began
discussions Tuesday on whether to allow the Labor Party and its
newspaper, the biweekly Al-Shaab, to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The government began considering a ban on the two after Al-Shaab
published an article on May 5, saying a book approved by the
Culture Ministry for publication in Egypt was un-Islamic and
blasphemous. On May 7 and 8, hundreds of Muslim students rioted in
Cairo and clashed with police.
</P>
<P>
   Culture Ministry officials said the book, ''Banquet for
Seaweed,'' by Syrian author Haider Haider, was reprinted as part of
a series of classics of Arabic literature. Literary experts
appointed by the Culture Ministry have said the novel does not
defame religion and should not be judged from a nonliterary
perspective.

U.S. Defends Microsoft Breakup Plan

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In its legal reply to arguments outlined by Microsoft, the
Justice Department today reinforced its assertion that a breakup was the best
way to prevent anticompetitive behavior by a company found to have acted in wide
violation of federal laws. The Justice Department and 17 of the states that
successfully sued on antitrust charges want Microsoft to be broken up into two
companies. One would develop the company's dominant Windows computer operating
system and the other everything else, including Microsoft's Office software and
its Internet services. Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman, said: ''It's
unfortunate but not surprising that the government is attempting to defend its
extreme remedy proposal.''

   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two former Ku Klux Klansmen were arrested on murder
charges today in the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four black girls
-- a crime that galvanized the civil rights movement. Thomas E. Blanton Jr., 61,
of Birmingham, and Bobby Frank Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Texas, surrendered on the
state charges and were jailed without bail. If convicted, they could get life in
prison with the possibility of parole. U.S. Attorney Doug Jones would not say
what led to the break in the case after 37 years. But over the past year,
estranged family members of Cherry have said publicly that he talked of helping

<HEADLINE> Astros, Brewers Game Postponed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Houston manager Larry Dierker lamented the
scheduling quirk that only delayed the stress on his overworked
pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's game between the Houston Astros and the
Milwaukee Brewers was postponed by rain and will be made up as part
of a doubleheader Thursday beginning at 1:05 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Although both teams are in the NL Central, it is the final trip
to Milwaukee this year for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rainout would have helped us if we only had one more game
today,'' said Dierker, who used eight pitchers in Tuesday night's
6-5, 16-inning loss to the Brewers. ''Since we have two more games
to play, all it does is delay things and gets everybody that
pitched last night ready for tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewers pitching coach Bob Apodaca said the rainout might have
cost his staff a slight edge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some guys ready to pitch tonight,'' Apodaca said. ''We
felt if we had an advantage, that would be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said the schedule that has the Astros playing both
series in Milwaukee before the end of May forced the doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is more rain expected tomorrow,'' Dierker said. ''If we
can't get two games in tomorrow, this is our last trip to
Milwaukee. They would have to play a game in Houston that would
have been a home game or we would have to find a mutually
acceptable off day where they were here, or were coming here and we
were somewhere near here. So that complicates things. It's a lot
easier to get the three games in while we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said the unequal number of teams in different divisions
and unbalanced schedules means some division rivals will not meet
down the pennant stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The math doesn't work with 30 teams,'' Dierker said. ''If we
had two 16-team leagues and four four-team divisions, the math
would work great. We could play in our own division early, middle
and late like we used to.
</P>
<P>
   ''With 30 teams and two 15-team leagues, it doesn't work because
you have seven games per day and you've got a team that is off.
You've got a team in the other league that's off and supposedly
they could play each other. I haven't tried to do that math, but
from what I understand, that doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's scheduled starters, Steve Woodard (1-4) for
Milwaukee and Octavio Dotel (1-3) for Houston, will start
Thursday's opener. Jimmy Haynes (5-2) will start the second game
for the Brewers, with Chris Holt (1-6) pitching for the Astros as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Holt was the last of eight Houston pitchers Tuesday night,
pitching 1 1-3 innings and getting the loss.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 9, Reds 6  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Kevin Young was 1-for-15 and facing the
Cincinnati Reds' closer with the game on the line. He got a break
when Danny Graves made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Young put Pittsburgh ahead with a bases-loaded single in the
seventh inning, and Mike Benjamin later added a two-run homer as
the Pirates beat the Cincinnati Reds 9-6 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati lost for only the second time in 10 games due to a
rare meltdown by its bullpen. The Reds had converted their previous
10 save opportunities since April 25.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the bullpen gave up six runs in the last three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our bullpen's been doing such a good job the last 10 or 12
days,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ''But this was one of those days
where they just didn't have it. It's going to happen to the best of
them. They're entitled to a bad one every once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   After Denny Neagle put himself in position to get his 11th
consecutive win, the Pirates sent eight batters to the plate for
three runs in the seventh and a 6-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sullivan (0-2) loaded the bases by giving up John Vander
Wal's pinch double, hitting Luis Sojo with two outs and walking
Jason Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pretty much stunk,'' Sullivan said. ''It was not one
particular thing. It was pretty much everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles then had a gritty at-bat, working Dennys Reyes to a
full count and fouling off two fastballs before taking ball four
low and away, forcing in the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got a tough bullpen,'' Giles said. ''The walks hurt
them a lot tonight. That's uncharacteristic of their bullpen. They
gave us a lot of opportunities by putting guys on with bases on
balls and we were able to come up with some big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Young had the biggest one. Graves relieved and got a 1-2 count
on Young, who barely checked his swing on the next pitch and then
lined a single to center to emerge from a 1-for-15 slump.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got down (in the count) early, he came back with a slider
away and I took it,'' Young said. ''Then he got a sinker up. I'm
sure it wasn't the location he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin added a two-run homer, his first, off Graves with two
outs in the eighth for an 8-4 lead, and Young drove in another run
with a groundout in the ninth, adding to the Pirates' cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Silva (4-1) allowed one hit in 1 1-3 innings after
relieving starter Jimmy Anderson. Jason Christiansen gave up a run
on a double-play grounder in the eighth, and Mike Williams gave up
another run in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates used five pitchers in all as they got their seventh
victory in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, who has won 10 straight decisions in 16 starts since
last Aug. 30, turned a 4-3 lead over to the bullpen after the
sixth. He gave up eight hits -- two of them by Anderson, who
doubled, singled and scored twice, annoying Neagle. The left-hander
angrily threw his glove to the floor of the dugout after Anderson
doubled with two outs in the third and scored on the first of
Sojo's three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati put together a pair of two-run rallies off Anderson,
who once again had problems getting into the flow of things.
Anderson has failed to retire the side in order in the first inning
of any of his seven starts, giving up 10 runs while opponents hit
.444.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young and Sean Casey each drove in a pair of runs as the
Reds went ahead 4-3 after five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Young ran the Pirates out of a chance for the tying run in the
sixth, when he led off with a double and tried to advance to third
as the throw to second skittered away from Pokey Reese. The Gold
Glove second baseman quickly retrieved the ball and easily threw
Young out at third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Pittsburgh has been outscored 33-17 in first innings. ...
Wil Cordero missed a second consecutive game. He has the club's
permission to attend to a family matter in Puerto Rico. ... The
Pirates have had at least one extra-base hit in each of their 38
games. They had an extra-base hit in each of their first 64 games
in 1997. ... Ken Griffey Jr. is shown in Reds pinstripes on the
cover of Wheaties boxes shipped to Ohio stores this week. ... Dante
Bichette, hitting .215, was left out of the lineup for a second
consecutive game. ... Reliever Mark Wohlers, recovering from
reconstructive elbow surgery, threw some split-finger fastballs in
the bullpen. He hopes to be pitching in the minors by the end of
the month.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia-Eritrea Embargo Deal Near  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Security Council members neared a decision
Wednesday night on a proposal for an arms embargo against Ethiopia
and Eritrea following the latest flare-up in their two-year war.
</P>
<P>
   The council met behind closed doors for several hours to try to
resolve differences over the time limit for an embargo, with the
United States and Britain on one side and Russia and France on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Talks adjourned without an agreement so the 15 council members
could consult with their capitals. Another meeting was scheduled
late Wednesday night, and diplomats were hopeful that it would be
followed by a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain proposed that the council review
compliance with an embargo after 12 months. Other council members
proposed a shorter timetable for a review, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, a major arms supplier to both countries, dropped its
objection to an arms embargo Tuesday and joined France and other
countries in demanding a time limit.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-drafted resolution would ban the sale or supply of
weapons, ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary
equipment and spare parts to both countries. It would also ban
military-related training or technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict over the 620-mile border between Ethiopia and
Eritrea -- among the world's poorest countries -- has cost the lives
of thousands of soldiers and civilians on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting forced the World Food Program to temporarily halt
food distribution in Ethiopia's western border area, which could
affect tens of thousands of displaced people.

<HEADLINE> 49ers GM Reports Progress on Rice  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The chances Jerry Rice will finish
his career in San Francisco appear much better. Steve Young's
future, though, remains foggy.
</P>
<P>
   Both 49ers general manager Bill Walsh and Jim Steiner, the agent
for Rice, said they had made significant progress in working out a
new deal for the NFL's career leading receiver after meeting for 2{
hours Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While the sides were closing in on a more salary-cap friendly
contract for Rice, 37, the future of the 38-year-old Young, who has
combined with Rice to form the league's top touchdown-pass tandem,
is still up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said Young, who missed the final 13 games of last season
after a head blow left him with his fourth concussion in three
years, continues mulling over whether to resume his career and
probably won't make a final decision for at least several more
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, a 12-time Pro Bowl selection and the NFL career leader in
touchdowns, receptions and yards receiving, initially balked at the
cap-strapped 49ers' demands that he take a significant pay cut. San
Francisco said it couldn't afford to keep Rice unless he agreed to
renegotiate his contract, which included a $5.49 million cap figure
for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   While attending the team's minicamp last month, Rice said he
would be willing to take a cut in pay and expressed hope he could
finish his career in San Francisco. He also made a point of saying
he could serve as a mentor to the younger wideouts on the
rebuilding 49ers, who are coming off a 4-12 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said he presented the 49ers with a proposal Wednesday
and the 49ers made a counterproposal which included an upgrade to
their original offer. No terms were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've each made some adjustments on incentives and the gap is
closing,'' Steiner said. ''I was pleasantly surprised. This is the
first meaningful meeting we've had on the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said there's a chance a new deal for Rice could be worked
out within the next few days. Steiner is staying in town for five
days and the sides say they'll stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all optimistic,'' Walsh said. ''We had a friendly open
conversation and we're very hopeful that we can reach agreement
soon but I can't guarantee it because things can crop up at the
last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has met several times with Walsh and coach Steve Mariucci
in recent weeks. Walsh said he plans to meet with Young again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't have any sense of what Steve is thinking,''
Walsh said. ''I don't necessarily think he'll reach a conclusion
very soon on whether to play or retire. I'm not sure he's ready for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said the team is willing to be patient while Young
considers his options though he said the sooner there is a
resolution the better. There has been persistent speculation that
Young may choose to play elsewhere if the 49ers, who picked two
quarterbacks in the draft, decide the two-time league MVP doesn't
fit in their plans. But Young, who was married in the offseason,
also could opt to call it a career.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to have a timetable of our own in all these cases. We
have to move forward,'' Walsh said. ''We have such tremendous
regard for Steve, for both of these men that we'll give them all
the time they'd like to have. But at some point, we have to take
the field and that will be by training camp (July 15).''

<HEADLINE> Duchovny Signs 'X-Files' Deal  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fox Mulder will continue his quest for the
truth and alien invaders next season on ''The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duchovny, who was wrangling over his contract and a
lawsuit he filed in connection with the show, has agreed to return
for an eighth year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pleased we were able to come to an agreement that enables
me to remain part of 'The X-Files,''' Duchovny said in a statement
Wednesday. ''Now that all the business issues have been settled,
I'm looking forward to going back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Anderson, his co-star in the Fox series about FBI agents
on the trail of supernatural forces and space aliens, already was
under contract. Chris Carter, the series' creator and executive
producer, struck a deal for another year earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will bring Duchovny more than $20 million, which
includes a lawsuit settlement and $350,000 to $400,000 per episode,
according to sources cited by Daily Variety.
</P>
<P>
   The actor's decision, which came the day before Fox Broadcasting
Co. was to announce its fall schedule in New York, was greeted with
enthusiasm by Carter. He had said previously he could produce the
show without Duchovny but preferred not to.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very pleased and I think with the season finale
cliffhanger it creates great possibilities to take the show in new
directions,'' Carter said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The show wraps up this season on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny, who had been seeking a less grueling work schedule as
well as more money, will not be in every episode for the 2000-01
season, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be ''jumping the gun'' to speculate whether the
show, a mainstay of Fox's schedule, will be back for a ninth year.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations with Duchovny had been complicated by his
lawsuit against 20th Century Fox Film Corp. The suit claimed Fox
gave its own stations sweetheart deals on ''The X-Files'' reruns
when the program should have been sold to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The result, the suit alleged, was that Duchovny was underpaid on
the series' profits. The actor had said he wouldn't return to the
show unless the suit was settled.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the actor said he could not expand on Duchovny's
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he expected the legal dispute to be a non-issue when
filming resumes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I work with real professionals and the work has always come
before any personal feelings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy-minded series, which made stars and magazine
cover favorites out of Duchovny and Anderson, opens with the
insistence that ''The truth is out there.'' The show was the basis
of a successful ''X-Files'' movie that Fox and Carter expect to be
part of a continuing franchise.

<HEADLINE> French Cash Machines Running Dry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- More than 60 percent of the cash machines in France
sat empty Wednesday as striking armored truck guards rejected a key
offer on the ninth day of a protest against unsafe working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with a nationwide cash shortage, merchants have
lowered the minimum amount required to use credit cards. Other
stores have asked clients to pay in exact change.
</P>
<P>
   The truck guards on Wednesday rejected an offer of a $136
monthly pay increase. The guards are demanding a ''risk bonus'' of
$205 per month after a recent series of brutal beatings by robbers.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, a security guard died of injuries sustained in a
May 5 attack in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre, adding more
tension to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   By rejecting the ''take it or leave it offer,'' the unionized
guards risked losing all previous offers, including salary
increases and an early retirement offer, negotiators for the
guards' companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement presented a bill to
parliament Wednesday with safety improvements for guards. The bill,
to be fast-tracked, would force banks and businesses to provide a
parking space for guards that would shorten the distance they walk
to refill cash machines, among other measures.
</P>
<P>
   The guards on Wednesday threatened to step up their protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just suffered a blow,'' union negotiator Jean-Louis Tayot
told LCI television, referring to the latest death of a security
guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to just continue to block the banks of France
in such a nice manner,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Recently Opened Civil Rights Cases  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Other civil rights cases that recently have been
reopened:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --February 1994: Byron De La Beckwith is convicted for the June
12, 1963 murder of Medgar Evers, the first field secretary for the
NAACP. Beckwith had been tried twice before for the crime, but both
trials ended with hung juries. He is appealing the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   --In 1998, Police in Jackson, Miss., reopen investigation into
the 1967 death of Benjamin Brown, who was shot to death by police
during a student protest at Jackson State University. Brown had not
been protesting, and no action was taken against the police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   --April 1998: Police in Natchez, Miss., begin reinvestigating the
1967 death of Wharlest Jackson, treasurer of the Natchez NAACP, who
was killed by a car bomb. Weeks before his death, Jackson had been
promoted to a position at a local tire plant that had previously
only been held by white men. No one was ever arrested for the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   --August 1998: Sam Bowers, former imperial wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan, is convicted for the 1966 murder of Vernon Dahmer. Dahmer,
president of the NAACP in Hattiesburg, Miss., was killed in a

the crime, and three were convicted. The case of another suspect,
Charles Noble, ended in mistrial in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   --November 1999: Charles E. Caston, James Caston and Hal Crimm
are each sentenced to 20 years in prison for the 1970 murder of
Rainey Pool. Pool, a one-armed sharecropper from Midnight, Miss.,
was beaten and dumped in a river. Seven white men were originally
arrested for the crime, but charges were dismissed. Two had since
died, one was acquitted in June 1998 and another pleaded guilty to
reduced charges in 1999. Charles Caston died in prison in March,
2000.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 8, Blue Jays 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Pedro Martinez called it a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't consistent at all,'' he said after allowing three
hits in seven innings Wednesday night as the Boston Red Sox beat
the Toronto Blue Jays 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who pitched a two-hitter against Baltimore last week,
improved to 6-1 with a major-leading 0.90 ERA. He struck out six,
walked two and hit two batters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little bit erratic,'' he said. ''I couldn't spot my
fastball, and it would take off on me. I would throw a couple of
good ones, but then I would struggle with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has given up one earned run in his last 32 innings.
Helped by three double plays, he combined with relievers Brian Rose
and Tim Young on a four-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't look like he had a bad day to me,'' Toronto's Alex
Gonzalez said. ''He kept us off balance all night. He did a really
good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox kept Toronto from homering at SkyDome for just the
second time this season. The Blue Jays are averaging more than six
runs a game at home.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon hit a pair of RBI doubles as Boston finished 6-1 on
their road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though the results were real good today, all the credit
should be given to my teammates. They gave me all the lead I
needed,'' Martinez said. ''I would have been in a lot of trouble if
it was 0-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has outscored opponents 46-10 since All-Star shortstop
Nomar Garciaparra came out of the lineup last Friday because of a
strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox took a 2-0 lead in the first on Nixon's RBI double
and Darrin Fletcher's run-scoring passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Boston added four runs in the third against Chris Carpenter
(3-5). Nixon and Troy O'Leary hit RBI doubles and Carl Everett and
Wilton Veras hit run-scoring singles.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Martinez took a liner off the back of his left leg in the
fourth inning. ''Than God it was the back of the leg because
otherwise I would have a hard time sitting,'' he said. Martinez has
won 14 of his last 17 starts. ... Martinez has pitched 17 straight
scoreless innings. He has gone at least seven innings in each of
his starts this season. ... The Red Sox have won nine of their last
11. ... Boston C Jason Varitek missed his third straight game
because of bronchitis. ... Everett returned to the lineup after
missing five games with strained right quadriceps. Everett was the
DH. ... Plate umpire Mark Carlson ejected Toronto third-base coach
Terry Bevington for arguing balls and strikes. Manager Jim Fregosi
had to hold Bevington back as Bevington jawed with Carlson. ...
Donnie Sadler went 3-for-4 for Boston. ... Boston CF Darren Lewis
left the game in the third inning with a strained left hamstring.
... Gonzalez went 0-for-3.

<HEADLINE> Neighbors of a woman stabbed in Bucks County react with shock, 13-year-old charged as adult </HEADLINE>
By TINA MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORRISVILLE, Pa. (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy accused of stabbing a
33-year-old neighbor and mother of three to death would only have
had to walk about 300 feet from his own apartment, past a
dilapidated playground and a few yards down a tree-lined street to
commit the horrendous crime.
</P>
<P>
   There, he would have turned up a driveway and entered the white,
Cape Cod-style home where Darlyne Jules lived.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to police, Kareem Watts stabbed Jules several
times in the head, face, neck, chest, torso and arm, spattering
blood on a sofa and other living room furniture and leaving her
body under a pile of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't even imagine an adult doing what I saw done to that
young woman. She was stabbed so many times that the officers aren't
even sure how many times she was stabbed,'' Bucks County District
Attorney Diane Gibbons said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, Gibbons said an autopsy revealed the victim was
stabbed more than 60 times. She said she knew of no motive.
</P>
<P>
   Jules's 7-year-old son, Alan Lubin, would later tell police that
Watts entered the home Monday night saying he needed to use the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   At about 11 p.m. Monday, Alan said, he heard his mother
screaming his name and for someone to call police. He went
downstairs and looked into the living room and saw his mom lying on
the couch with Watts on top of her.
</P>
<P>
   He told police that Watts had a knife in his hand and was
stabbing Jules in the chest. She was moving around and screaming,
he told police.
</P>
<P>
   He ran upstairs, called to his mother, and heard Watts respond
that he was helping her with some clothing, he said. The 7-year-old
said Watts offered to get him some candy.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan knew Kareem was lying, he told police. In the morning,
the 7-year-old went back downstairs and found his mother lying
under a pile of clothes with only one leg visible.
</P>
<P>
   His younger brother and his newborn baby sister were also in the
house all night Monday with their wounded and dying mother. After
shaking their mother and seeing that she wouldn't wake up, the boys
ran next door to their mom's friend's house for help.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scary, real scary,'' said Koupa Samuels, 25, who lives in
the two-story brick barracks-style apartment house next to the one
in which Watts lived. ''I know I'm going to be looking for
somewhere else soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other neighbors said they were shocked and surprised by the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect's mother, Janice Watts, told police that she left
the apartment several times during the night to purchase crack
cocaine and that she had also gone looking for her son, who was
upset.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers showed Watts had pleaded guilty to a charge of
possession of crack cocaine in 1998. In the two years since then,
she had violated her probation at least once by using drugs,
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who knew Jules, who was unemployed, said she was a
kind woman who loved her children.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was very nice, friendly, devoted to her kids,'' said Lee
Ann McClease, 26, who was pregnant at the same time as Jules. The
two women talked about having babies; Jules had had her newborn
just over a week before she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was too trusting and too friendly,'' said neighbor Mary
Singleton, 46. She said she hoped the community would come together
in the wake of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Both woman live around about a block from Jules's home.
</P>
<P>
   Watts had a preliminary hearing at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday before
Judge Joanne V. Kline in Morrisville.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked him if he understood. He just shook his head,'' Kline
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   She said Watts showed no emotion during the hearing. He is being
held in a juvenile detention center without bail.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't do it,'' Janice Watts told WCAU-TV. ''I know he
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The house where Jules lived lies nestled in the back corner of a
neighborhood of Cape Cod-style homes. The home is backed by a
supermarket parking lot, and the small playground, containing a set
of swings and a basketball court without a net.
</P>
<P>
   The Americana Terrace Apartments where Watts lived consists of
several two-story brick bunkers and fronts a stretch of road that
neighbors call ''apartment row.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were looking for the murder weapon on Wednesday. Officer
pulled on plastic gloves before they stepped inside the house,
which was surrounded with yellow crime-scene tape.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said all three children were doing fine. The boys were
staying with their father, whom officials identified as John Lubin,
a Willingboro, N.J., truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   Jules, a native of Haiti whose mother lives in Boston, had been
renting the house in the community across the Delaware River from
Trenton, N.J., for about a year and a half.

<HEADLINE> Defense Fails the Knicks  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Patrick Ewing sat at his locker with ice on his
right hand, his right thigh, his left calf and both knees. Not
surprisingly, he wore a pained expression.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we tied it in the fourth quarter, I thought we were going
to win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in the biggest game of the season, the New York Knicks'
defense unraveled down the stretch, and they lost to the Miami Heat
87-81 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat took a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference
semifinals, with Game 6 Friday night at Madison Square Garden. If
New York wins, the series returns to Miami for Game 7 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to get the job done Friday,'' said Ewing, still
seeking his first NBA title at age 37. ''Otherwise it's
summertime.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Knicks must do what they haven't done in the
playoffs since 1998 -- win two in a row against Miami. In 10 playoff
game over the past two years, neither team has managed back-to-back
victories.
</P>
<P>
   More data supporting New York pessimism: There have been 100
previous best-of-seven series that were tied 2-all, and the team
that won Game 5 went on to win the series 84 times.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's an interesting statistic,'' Knicks guard Latrell
Sprewell said. ''This team has played well in adverse situations,
and we're in one now. We'll see what we're made of.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks can force a Game 7, they might have a
psychological edge. They won winner-take-all fifth games in Miami
in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never know what can happen in a Game 7,'' Sprewell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks blamed Wednesday's loss on defense, usually the most
reliable part of their game. The game was tied at 68-all before the
Heat scored 19 points over the final 5:41.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our defense, when we needed it the most, betrayed us,'' coach
Jeff Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of Miami 3-pointers doomed New York. When Allan Houston
collapsed on Alonzo Mourning, Dan Majerle hit an open 25-footer for
a 77-70 lead with 2:30 left. Majerle made a 27-footer over Charlie
Ward to make it 80-73. Bruce Bowen then hit an open 24-footer from
the corner -- his only field goal of the game -- for an 83-77 lead
with 35 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those 3s killed us,'' Ewing said. ''Bowen's 3 was a dagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing outplayed Mourning for the first time in the series,
totaling 16 points and 11 rebounds in 33 minutes. Mourning, who
fouled out, missed 12 of 17 shots and settled for 18 points and
five rebounds in 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Heat outrebounded the Knicks for the fifth time in as
many games, 42-32.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously rebounding is not important to us right now,'' Van
Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by six points at halftime, the Knicks made their first
five shots in the third quarter. Trailing by nine late in the
quarter, Larry Johnson made three baskets to spark a 11-2 run that
tied the score 66-all. Miami missed 11 consecutive shots during the
spurt.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth quarter, Houston took just one shot, Sprewell
went 1-for-6, and the Knicks gave the Heat too many open looks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost our will,'' Van Gundy said. ''We certainly didn't have
enough will to make the stops we needed.''

<HEADLINE> Actors' Union Criticizes Strike Ad  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The fallout from an actors' strike against
commercial producers includes a magazine advertisement that the
Screen Actors Guild says insults women and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was placed in a trade publication called Shoot by a
commercial production firm headed by top film directors Ridley
Scott (''Gladiator'') and Tony Scott (''Top Gun''). It features a
picture of an older, bare-breasted black woman and the headline,
''In South Africa, this is what SAG means.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To service clients, Marcus Nispel is setting up a temporary
office in South Africa, where production is cost effective and
they've never heard of SAG,'' the ad for the Scotts' RSA USA
company says.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, with a reference to high-profile RSA USA commercial
director Nispel, was intended to provoke a reaction and has drawn a
mostly positive industry response, the firm's managing director,
Linda Ross, told Daily Variety.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had some negative reaction about the ad being in
questionable taste,'' Ross told the trade paper. ''It's a bit of
shock value for shock value's sake. But there is a lot of business
at stake here.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ridley Scott, whose ''Gladiator'' is currently the nation's
No. 1 movie, and brother Tony Scott were working out of the office
and unavailable for comment, an employee at RSA USA said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   SAG spokesman Greg Krizman called the ad offensive and said a
protest rally was scheduled for Thursday outside the West Hollywood
offices of RSA USA.
</P>
<P>
   Nispel told Variety the ad was not meant to insult but rather to
draw attention to such issues as runaway production, the term used
to refer to Hollywood production lost to countries in which costs
are lower than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got loads of messages from people who got a good chuckle
about the ad,'' Nispel said. ''I wanted to make it clear that we
can produce in other countries as well as we can here.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors are striking over the pay structure for commercials. They
get a minimum of about $478 for a day's work and get
''pay-per-play'' residuals of roughly $50 to $120 each time a spot
airs on network television. When it comes to cable TV, they receive
a flat fee of $1,000 or less for each 13-week, unlimited run.
</P>
<P>
   With two-thirds of all TV ads now being made for cable, actors
are demanding that pay-per-play be extended to cable. Advertisers
want to extend the flat fee from cable to the networks.

<HEADLINE> Heat 87, Knicks 81  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- One more win, and the Miami Heat will have
vanquished the archrival that ruined their last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Getting two clutch 3-pointers from Dan Majerle and another from
Bruce Bowen, the Heat defeated the New York Knicks 87-81 Wednesday
night to take a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the teams has beaten the other two straight times in
the postseason since the end of their 1998 series, yet that is
exactly what Miami will be trying to do Friday night when the
series resumes at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we have to win one more game. Easier said than done,''
Miami center Alonzo Mourning said. ''We should go into New York
with the attitude that we're down one, not that we have a cushion.
When we have a cushion we tend to relax and exhale and not do
things we need to do in the effort department.''
</P>
<P>
   The key difference in Game 5 was the offensive burst they got
from Majerle, who hadn't cracked double figures in the series since
Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when Jamal Mashburn scored 21 points and Mourning
chipped in 18 before fouling out, Majerle's 16 were huge. Six of
them came on consecutive 3-pointers -- one a heave from 27 feet as
the shot clock expired -- to open a seven-point lead with 1:42 left
that was too much for the Knicks to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen's 3-pointer with 35 seconds left -- his only field goal of
the game -- was the final blow.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 previous best-of-seven series that have been tied
2-2, the team that won Game 5 has gone on to win the series 84
times. That strong statistic now favors the Heat, whose playoff
series with the Knicks went the distance in 1997, 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were looked at as a non-factor in this series,
outmatched,'' Mourning said. ''Through the battles we have
persevered, each and every one of my teammates, and Timmy
(Hardaway) and Dan tonight made some very big plays for us that
made a difference in the outcome of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Majerle shot 5-for-7 from the field with five rebounds, helping
Miami win the rebounding battle for the fifth straight game.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Brown grabbed seven offensive rebounds -- two more than all
the Knicks combined, while Tim Hardaway played perhaps his best
game of the series with 12 points, four assists and just one
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell had 24 points to lead the Knicks, who got just
seven points from their reserves and could not find an offensive
rhythm all night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played well offensively,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy
said. ''This team has to be committed to the importance of
rebounding. That has been the difference in the series. Take
everything else out and that's the deciding factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs hit a 3-pointer to make it a three-point game with
14 seconds left, but Mashburn hit two from the free throw line,
Sprewell missed a 3-pointer and Majerle knocked down two more free
throws with seven seconds left to wrap it up.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came midway through the fourth quarter after
the Knicks had rallied to tie the score 68-68. Mashburn hit a
turnaround, Sprewell got trapped and threw the ball away and
Majerle converted a three-point play on the ensuing fast break to
make it 73-68.
</P>
<P>
   Houston ended a three-minute scoring drought for the Knicks on a
jumper with 2:54 left, and with New York double-teaming Mourning in
the low post he found Majerle for a 3-pointer that made it 77-70
with 2:30 left.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle then hit a 3-pointer from 27 feet as the 24-second clock
expired with 1:42 left. Brown jokingly called it a 50-footer, while
Mourning described it as coming from another area code.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the shot's there, I'm always going to shoot it whether I
make it or not,'' Majerle said. ''I've got the confidence I can
make that shot instead of going to the floor. I can always make
that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning fouled out in the final minute, but his first
disqualification of the series didn't make much of a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Knicks' quick start.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had three steals in the first 3{ minutes and hit his
first four shots and Mourning missed his first five, including a
baffling miss of a wide-open layup after he passed up an open
16-footer. The Knicks quickly took a 14-4 lead, but the Heat closed
to 22-19 by the end of the quarter as Ewing and Kurt Thomas each
picked up two fouls.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat took their first lead of the night, 29-28, midway
through the second quarter on an 18-footer by Anthony Carter, and
Miami led 41-35 at the half after Mashburn went to the line for the
first time in three games and made both free throws with 12 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, playing on a sprained left foot, had one of his best
stretches of the series early in the third quarter, converting a
three-point play and making a 3-pointer in a 12-4 run that gave
Miami an eight-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did the little things that the Tim of old used to do,''
Brown said. ''It's good to see that again. There were times in this
game he took us on his back. If we get him to do that again Friday,
we've got a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's lead grew to nine points later in the quarter at the
expense of Houston, who threw away a no-look pass -- despite being
taken to task by Van Gundy for a similar error in Game 3 -- and then
got burned when Hardaway was isolated against him and blew around
him with a crossover dribble for a layup that made it 64-55.
</P>
<P>
   It was 64-60 entering the fourth and 64-62 after Larry Johnson
completed a 7-0 run with a runner from the lane. Mourning picked up
his fifth foul with 7:36 left, and the Knicks quickly tied it at
66-all by scoring two quick baskets.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Knicks center Chris Dudley saw his first action of the
series, playing one second in the first quarter. ... The fans in
the most expensive seats got on their feet and cheered when two
loud Knicks fans, one wearing a Marcus Camby jersey and the other a
Johnson jersey, were ejected by police early in the second half.
... Hall of Fame center Bill Russell, who presented Mourning with
the Defensive Player of the Year award Tuesday, was in attendance.

<HEADLINE> Indians 7, Tigers 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bartolo Colon's plump body may be slimmer. But
he can still reach a pretty hefty number on another scale.
</P>
<P>
   Colon used his 99-mph fastball to overpower Detroit for 12
strikeouts in seven innings and Sandy Alomar hit a three-run homer
Wednesday night, leading the Cleveland Indians to a 7-2 win over
the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Colon (4-1) allowed just six hits -- five singles -- and made only
one mistake, giving up a solo homer to Juan Gonzalez in the second.
But after that, the right-hander was little match for the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Making his second start since returning from the disabled list,
Colon walked two and got out of jams in the fourth, fifth and
seventh innings with big strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to imagine a kid throwing 97, 98 mph can reach back
for a little extra,'' Indians acting manager Grady Little said.
''But he seems to do that when he gets in a jam.''
</P>
<P>
   It was probably Little's last game managing the Indians. Manager
Charlie Manuel was expected to return for Thursday night's game
against Detroit, less than two weeks after colon surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the plan,'' Little said.
</P>
<P>
   Colon recorded his fourth career double-digit strikeout game,
and first since June 21, 1998, when he struck out 10 New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Colon came into training camp overweight and then pulled a
muscle in his rib cage in an April 15 start. He went on the 15-day
disabled list, and while he was out Colon lost some weight and got
into better shape. The time away also helped his mental condition,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers got a runner to third in the fourth, but Colon struck
out the side.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, he escaped a two-on, one-out mess by striking out
two. Then, in the seventh, Detroit had runners at first and third
when Colon faned Brad Ausmus for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   ''He stuffed it right at us,'' Detroit manager Phil Garner said.
''He was coming at 92, 94 mph but when somebody got into scoring
position, he got it up to 98. That's some serious giddy up, and
that's impressive. He didn't toy with us. He went right at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Fryman, David Justice and Alex Ramirez added solo homers
off C.J. Nitkowski (2-7) for the Indians, 5-1 on their 10-game
homestand and fattening their record against AL Central teams.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson, returning from his five-game suspension for his
part in Detroit's brawl with Chicago earlier this season, struck
out three times against Colon.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just blew it by me,'' Higginson said. ''Tomorrow whoever it
is out there will be 10 mph slower, so maybe I'll have a better
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon isn't all heat, however. He had three pitches working
against the Tigers, who didn't seem to know what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ''What people don't understand,'' Colon said through an
interpreter, ''is hitters are no longer sitting on my fastball. Now
they're guessing breaking ball and I can come back with my fastball
and get some strikeouts.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Indians leading 4-1 in the sixth, Alomar connected for
his second homer in two days, a three-run shot off Masao Kida.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson singled, Ramirez doubled and Alomar lined an 0-1
pitch into the left-field terrace for his second homer.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar was playing in just his 17th game this season. He was on
the disabled list with a pulled hamstring, and before the game was
sensitive when asked questions about sharing the catching duties
with backup Einar Diaz, who has played well this season.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman, who homered and drove in four runs on Tuesday night,
continued to pound Tigers pitching by hitting a homer off Nitkowski
to open the second that tied it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Justice made it 2-1 in the third with his ninth homer and sixth
in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's first homer of the year, 436-foot shot in the fourth
upped Cleveland's lead to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who homered twice in Detroit's 11-9 loss on Tuesday,
led off the second with his seventh homer. But as has been the case
all year for the Tigers, it came with no one on base.
</P>
<P>
   Of Detroit's last 26 homers, 22 have been solo shots.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cleveland is 54-17 against the Tigers since 1994, including
a 32-7 mark at Jacobs Field. ... The four homers by the Indians
were a season high. ... Roberto Alomar and Omar Vizquel received
their 1999 Gold Gloves before the game. Alomar's eighth tied him
Bill Mazeroski and Frank White for the second most for a second
baseman. Ryne Sandberg won nine with the Cubs. Vizquel has won
seven straight Gold Gloves. Only Mark Belanger (8), Luis Aparicio
(9) and Ozzie Smith (13). ... Sandy Alomar's triple in the second
inning was the seventh of his career and fourth since 1994. ...
Detroit starter Brian Moehler is to come off the 15-day disabled
list Friday to start against Boston. Moehler had an appendectomy on
April 22 in Chicago, the same day the Tigers brawled with the White
Sox.
