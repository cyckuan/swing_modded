<HEADLINE> Canadian Cost of Housing Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The falling mortgage rates and low
house prices have enabled more Canadians to own their home than it
has been in years, says a new study from the Royal Bank of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The bank's index shows that the cost of owing a typical starter
house in the first quarter of this year cost 32.9 percent of
median pretax household income, down from 38.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The median household income in the country is 29,200 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic drop of house prices has been in the
westcoast city of Vancouver, today's Globe and Mail newspaper
quoted the study as saying.
</P>
<P>
Though Vancouver is still the most expensive city in Canada to
buy a house, the cost of owing one eats up 52 percent of household
income, 17.7 percent less than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In Canada's largest city of Toronto, the cost of owning a
detached bungalow is the cheapest it's been since the bank started
keeping statistics 16 years ago, the study says.
</P>
<P>
Torontonians with an average starter house paid out 37.7
percent of their household income, down from 43.3 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
In Montreal, affordability also keeps on improving. Montrealers
forked out 32.8 percent, down from 38.5 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that Maritimes is the cheapest region to own a
house, followed by Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,
Quebec and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
In almost every case, it is as affordable as it has been in a
decade, thanks to a drop in mortgage rates, it says. The five-year
mortgage is now running about 8 percent, down from 10.3 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these affordability numbers, sales of new houses
have been extremely sluggish in the country, largely due to the
low consumer confidence.

<HEADLINE> US Increases Pressure on IRA to Restore Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- US President Bill Clinton's senior
aides increased pressure today on the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
and its political wing Sinn Fein to renew ceasefire before the
planned all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland
scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton's adviser on the Northern Ireland policy
Nancy Soderberg said in an interview with BBC radio that as the
all-party talks were coming, there was no justification for the
IRA continuing its campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she told the British government, the
negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland would be real and
substantive.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with BBC radio, Senator Christopher
Dodd, chairman of the US Democratic Party and head of Clinton's
re-election campaign, said he would urge Clinton not to authorize
more US visas for Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, if the IRA
failed to restore its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
He warned: "It's very important that members of the IRA
understand that no president in future will want to pick up this
issue again if we don't take this opportunity we have been
presented with and make it work."
</P>
<P>
BBC TV commented that the two statements clearly implied that
if Sinn Fein is not admitted to the talks on June 10, then the
blame will lie fairly and squarely with the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The timing of these two interventions also demonstrated the
concern from the US that the opportunity for all-party political
negotiations should not be missed, it said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary maintained that the two statements will no doubt
please the British government, which has been insisting that the
IRA must renew its truce before Sinn Fein is admitted to the
planned all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Dublin, Irish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Dick Spring welcomed the US interventions,
which he hoped would help ensure that Sinn Fein could attend the
peace talks in June 10.

<HEADLINE> "Third Force" Splits Over Whether to Back Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The so-called "Third Force"
candidates running in Russia's mid-June presidential election has
fallen apart over whether to support front-running archrival Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The team had consisted of three presidential candidates:
Yabloko bloc chief Grigory Yavlinsky, eye surgeon Svyatoslav
Fyodorov and retired general Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov told the Itar-Tass news agency that the alliance "has
practically fallen apart and will hardly be able to nominate a
single candidate".
</P>
<P>
"A team ceases to exist when one of its members falls out," he
said, referring to Lebed's decision to contest the election as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
Though he has reportedly proposed forming a "national unity
government" with Yeltsin, Fyodorov has not said whether he would
support Yeltsin in the election.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin met Yavlinsky and Lebed earlier this month, raising
speculation that he was offering them posts in a future government
in exchange for their support in the presidential election slated
for June 16.
</P>
<P>
There was also speculation that Yeltsin was offering Yavlinsky
the post of prime minister in return for withdrawing his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said last Saturday that he was joining forces with
Yavlinsky and the Third Force.
</P>
<P>
But Yavlinsky rejected Yeltsin's remarks later that day, saying
that he had neither the intention nor the desire to ally with the
president.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Yavlinsky said that he would contest the election
alone, denying rumors about that he was in negotiations with
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
A new poll by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center released
late on Sunday gave Yeltsin 28 percent of the vote and Zyuganov 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky was favored by 9 percent of voters while Fyodorov and
Lebed got 7 and 6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
If Yeltsin could form a coalition with the "Third Force", or
with Yavlinsky alone, it would provide a significant boost to his
prospects for re-election, perhaps even sufficient to tip the
balance in his favor.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said today that he was still working on forming a
coalition with the Third Force.
</P>
<P>
"I agreed with Lebed and Yavlinsky on the joint coordination of
our election campaign," he said, "and we shall work it out in more
detail."
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that if a coalition could be formed among
the democratic candidates, he would be elected for a second term.

<HEADLINE> Britain May Retaliate Over EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government is planning
to take wide-ranging retaliatory action against the European Union
(EU) if the EU Commission refuses to lift the world-wide ban on
the export of British cattle products.
</P>
<P>
The EU's standing veterinary committee is due to meet in
Brussels on Wednesday to discuss an EU proposal to lift the ban on
British exports of tallow, gelatine and other by-products of
cattle.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission has promised to consider lifting the overall
ban on British beef in stages if Britain's beef producers can meet
strict processing requirements.
</P>
<P>
Senior British officials have warned recently that if the EU
veterinary committee turns down the proposal, the British
government will appeal directly to EU agriculture ministers to
overturn the ban.
</P>
<P>
British ministers are privately discussing contingency plans
for adopting an "empty chair" policy at key EU meetings or to
block votes that require unanimity if there is no early lifting of
the seven-week-old beef ban.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers have ruled out the possibility of
withholding British payments to the EU budget, saying it would
break British law.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind also issued a stark
warning Sunday that Britain was ready to take whatever action
necessary in an effort to get the ban lifted.
</P>
<P>
It would be "very perverse" for any government to obstruct the
lifting of the "wholly unjustified" ban, he said.
</P>
<P>
Government sources predict that the French government would
back a lifting of the EU ban, but the Germans would remain opposed.
</P>
<P>
One EU official has said that the outcome would almost
certainly depend on the Dutch and Belgians.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef exports in April
when the British government admitted that there was a possible
link between BSE or mad cow disease and its fatal human
equivalent, Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Ethiopian Presidents Pledge To Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and his Ethiopian counterpart Negasso Gidada pledged here today to
make continued efforts to promote cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents made the pledge at a banquet held at the
National Palace here by Negasso in honor of Jiang and his
entourage.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Negasso lauded Jiang's visit to Enthiopia as a
landmark event in the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang flew here this morning for a three-day state visit to
Ethiopia to consolidate friendship and promote cooperation between
China and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Your visit to Ethiopia is historic for many reasons," Negasso
noted, saying that it is the first ever visit by a Chinese
president to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ethiopia attaches great importance to its
relations with China, and the Ethiopian people hold the people of
China in very high esteem.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts between the two peoples go back into history," he
said. "Since diplomatic relations were established between our two
countries in the early seventies, the role of Chinese experts in
Ethiopia have been very laudable and the various projects
completed with Chinese cooperation have been indeed extremely
helpful."
</P>
<P>
"We wish to consolidate these relations with your country and
with your great people," Negasso said. "We are very much aware how
much your country is committed to its relations with all
developing countries and how determined you are to promote
equality among all sovereign nations."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang spoke highly of Ethiopia's time-honored
civilization and its long-time struggle against foreign aggressors.
</P>
<P>
He said that in this century, Ethiopia has made outstanding
contributions to African struggle for independence and to the
establishment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"The government and people of Ethiopia have scored remarkable
successes in maintaining stability, developing economy and
improving people's livelihood," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader expressed his confidence that Ethiopia will
make even greater achievements in its search for a development
path suited to its own national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also praised the role Ethiopia has played in seeking
political settlement of regional conflicts and promoting regional
cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
"Our exchanges and cooperation in various fields have grown
constantly closer and broader since the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front came to power," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is ready to join Ethiopia in steadily
strengthening bilateral cooperation in international affairs and
exploring new areas and new approaches of cooperation on the basis
of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"With the concerted efforts and meticulous nurturing by the two
sides, the flowers of Sino-Ethiopian friendship will bloom even
more luxuriantly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the banquet were more than 130 officials from both
sides, including Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen and Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Jiang laid a wreath to the Victory Monument in
the Ethiopian capital with the accompany of Negasso and five
Ethiopian government ministers.
</P>
<P>
This is the second leg of Jiang's ongoing African tour, which
has taken him to Kenya.

ROME, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Europe should play a more active role
in promoting the Middle East peace process, foreign ministers from
11 Mediterranean countries said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, taking part in the Mediterranean Forum, agreed
that a more active role by Europe is crucial to restoring peace in
Middle East and maintaining long-term stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, which ended in the southern Italian town
of Ravello on Friday, was held shortly after the Israeli
bombardment of southern Lebanon which has led to a deterioration
in the situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The forum, held annually since July 1994, also discussed aid
for the reconstruction of Bosnia and further strengthening
cooperation among Mediterranean countries in politics, culture,
the economy and security.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Algeria, Egypt, France, Greece, Italy,
Malta, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Tunis and Turkey attended the

<HEADLINE> China, Africa Bound to Stand Together: Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China deems the relations with Africa as very
special ties of sharing and standing together through thick and
thin.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Jiang
said that China, under the new international situation, is ready
to further strengthen unity and cooperation with African nations
by continuously injecting new contents into China-Africa relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that a purpose of his current visit to Africa is to
assure the governments and peoples of Africa of the
above-mentioned position.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese head of state said that to consolidate and develop
friendly cooperation with Africa constitutes an important part of
China's independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
China has always respected the African nations' choices of
their political systems and development model according to their
own conditions and never interfered in their internal affairs;
China is also against the practice that other countries impose
their own ideology and social development model on African
nations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly support the just struggle of African nations in
safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity and in opposing external interferences. We also support
their efforts in participating in international affairs and
safeguarding their own legitimate rights and interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned about the conflicts and disputes among
African countries and hope that the countries concerned strengthen
consultations and cooperation in order to create favorable
conditions for their respective economic construction and regional
cooperation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said China is willing to conduct
exchanges and cooperation in various aspects with Africa in order
to learn from each other and to consolidate the China-Africa ties
of "equality, sincerity, friendship and common development."
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties they face, Jiang noted, African
countries will realize the goals of development and vitalization
as long as they value and maintain peace and enhance unity and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meles said Ethiopia has been following closely on the situation
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Facing external pressure, he said, it is not easy for African
nations to maintain their independence. He added that foreign
countries often attach many conditions when they grant assistances
to Africa.
</P>
<P>
Under such complicated circumstances, the prime minister said,
the Ethiopian government pursues an independent foreign policy of
peace and development and has adopted its own way of
development. He noted that the current economic policy of Ethiopia
has been successful.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised the foreign policy of Ethiopia. He said Ethiopia
has for a long time strived for the development of Africa and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), thus having won esteem from
African countries and the international community.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the efforts of Ethiopia in developing
friendly relations with its neighbors on the basis of mutual
respect and mutual non-interference and China supports Ethiopia's
efforts in seeking for regional peace and security, Jiang added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-Governmental Council for
Coordination of Information and Communication of Non-aligned
Countries (IGC) is to hold its 13th meeting in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria, from May 27 to 30.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released today by the News Agency of
Nigeria, about 42 of the non-aligned nations are expected to

Information of the Non-aligned Countries (COMINAC).
</P>
<P>
Also expected at the meeting are chief executives of
non-aligned news agencies pool and broadcasting organizations of

<HEADLINE> China To Strengthen Cooperation with OAU: Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here this morning China is ready to strengthen
consultations and cooperation on issues of common concern with the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) under the new international
situation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, in a meeting with OAU's Secretary General Salim Ahmed
Salim, said China welcomes Salim and other OAU officials to visit
China and will send officials to consult with the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the relations between the OAU and China have been
further enhanced since he visited China three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said Jiang's visit comes at a time when Africa has undergone
profound political and economic changes so the visit will further
enhance the long-standing friendly relations between African
nations and China.
</P>
<P>
The OAU hopes that China will play a more positive role in
helping maintain peace and development in Africa, he said, adding
the OAU is willing to establish consultations with China on
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China has always treasured the friendship with
Africa and attached great importance to the roles of African
countries and the OAU in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to consolidate and develop its Africa ties of
equality, sincerity, friendship, unity, cooperation and common
development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, Jiang recalled, the Chinese
government has always supported the OAU's effort to seek political
liberation, national stability and economic development of the
African nations.
</P>
<P>
China also has been against the interference of external forces
into Africa's internal affairs, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the OAU appreciates the support China has given to
Africa's struggle for liberation in the past and the endeavor for
peaceful development at present.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the most urgent task of Africa is to
restore peace and security and the OAU hopes to work with China in
this regard as well as in the OAU and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the OAU hopes to get continued support from
China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Funcinpec Always Respects Constitution: Cambodian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh said today that his party -- Funcinpec will
never do anything against the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec fully abides by the constitution, Ranariddh, who is
President of Funcinpec, the biggest ruling party in cambodia, told
reporters this morning upon his return from a two-week visit to
France.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Funcinpec had never said they would withdraw
from the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Talking about power sharing between the CPP (Cambodian People's
Party) and Funcinpec, Ranariddh said the two parties are planning
to have talks and make assessments of this problem first.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the Law of Nationality, Ranariddh said he, as a
prime minister, will respect the decision made by the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
At present, the National Assembly has been discussing the draft
law of Nationality which the Royal Government had approved.
</P>
<P>
Whether one nationality or two to be included in the law should
be decided by the Cambodian people, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a Cambodia Daily report today, Cambodian Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen said Saturday that the ruling coalition
government will last even if some members of Funcinpec decide to
withdraw from it.
</P>
<P>
Members of Funcinpec have complained that the CPP has not
handed over power at the district level.

<HEADLINE> Jump in UK Interest Rates Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- British base rate could jump to 8.5
percent by the end of next year as monetary authorities counter a
resurgence in inflation, a City economist says today.
</P>
<P>
A vigorous recovery in consumer confidence, boosted by a series
of cash windfalls and faster wage growth will prompt the Bank of
England to urge a significant tightening of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, base rates could rise sharply from the present
level of six percent and the first act of a new government may be
to order an unpopular increase in the cost of borrowing, said
Richard Jeffrey, group economist at Charterhouse.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe that the Chancellor will be forced to
acquiesce to higher base rates later this year, and that they will
rise substantially higher next year, whoever wins the election,"
Jeffrey said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, he still believed that the possibility
existed of a sharp rise in inflation in the second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey expected consumer spending, up 2.3 percent in 1995, to
rise 3.2 percent this year and 4.1 percent in 1997. Consumer
confidence will be boosted by tax cuts, an improving housing
market, and building society windfalls from takeovers and
floatations.
</P>
<P>
Charterhouse believes that the government will achieve its
inflation target of 2.5 percent by the next election. However,
faster wage growth and rising commodity prices are expected to
push it to four percent by the end of 1997 with pressure on retail
prices building up in the second half of next year.

NICOSIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
will meet U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on June
12 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
This was officially announced here today by government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Ghali-Clerides meeting was
originally scheduled to take place in New York, when President
Clerides visits the United States in mid-June. But the U.N. chief
will be abroad during that period.
</P>
<P>
After Geneva, the Cypriot President will fly to Washington
where he will hold talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
June 18 at the White House.
</P>
<P>
During these meetings, the Cyprus problem and various efforts
to achieve a breakthrough in the present stalemate in the
peace talks are expected to be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials, who claimed that 1996 will be a "big push"
for Cyprus, are expected to launch a peace initiative on Cyprus
problem after the Clerides-Clinton meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish-Cypriot community and
the Greek-Cypriot community since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the two communities on the island have
gone into deadlock since the two sides couldn't find common
ground on the basic aspects of the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Deputy Prime Minister on Offset Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Second Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Finance Nasser al-Rowdhan said today
that the offset program being implemented in the country is an
ideal way to attract international companies, expertise and
investments.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the session of a Two-day Kuwait
University-organized Offset Program Forum.
</P>
<P>
The offset program represents responsible partnership
opportunities between the Kuwaiti private sector and the foreign
investors who undertake an obligatory fulfillment or supply for
the governmental sector through contracts that are worth one
million Kuwait dinars (3.3 million U.S. dollars) and who are
obligated to invest 30 percent of the value of such contracts in
local projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the Forum was within the government's efforts to
encourage investment in Kuwait and seek better alternatives for
offset projects.
</P>
<P>
The offset program is chiefly aimed at benefiting from the
expertise of leading foreign firms in establishing key state
projects, obtaining state-of-the-art technology and conducting
studies.
</P>
<P>
It also seeks to create job opportunities for kuwaitis through
executing industrial and trade projects. The minister also
expressed hope that the offset program would contribute to the
development of national human resources through the creation of
various educational and training opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He added that positive results have been achieved since the
implementation of the offset program started by the Kuwaiti
government in July, 1992.

KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is to set up a new
computerized medical data base aimed at improving medical care
efficiency for the 1.6 million residents living in country,
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Abdul Rahman al-Mohailan said in an opening
address to the second national conference on health data today

would quickly obtain a comprehensive file on each patient
visiting him and assist the patients on the required prescription
in addition to various other services including the possibility
of directly contacting other international health centers.
</P>
<P>
Work on the network and its computers was expected to start
within a few months, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 45,000 people go to see doctors in various medical
centers across the country each day in this tiny emirate of 1.6
million people.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the health minister also announced a plan to
establish a satellite medical network to connect with the medical
centers in other developed countries such as the U.S. to enable
doctors here to conduct treatment and diagnoses for a patient
jointly with their counterparts in other countries.
</P>

The executive director of the project, Hana Razouk, said the
establishment of the health data base would be implemented under
international and highly developed specifications.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kawasaki today became the first major
Japanese city to allow foreign nationals to sit an exam to select
municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
The Kawasaki municipal government decided to scrap the
nationality requirement despite opposition from the Home Affairs
Ministry which prefers all public servants should be Japanese
nationals, especially those holding administrative positions.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has argued that only 182 of its 3,500
employees hold administrative positions.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government's personnel department will start
distributing application forms later this month and hold the exam
on June 30, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The scrapping of the nationality requirement, however, is
conditional on a municipal stipulation that foreign nationals will
not be promoted to posts higher than section chief.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Home Affairs Ministry have reportedly
expressed concern about the stipulation, arguing that it
constitutes discrimination against foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Public Transport Workers Strike For Pay In Maputo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- About 800 public transport workers
staged an indefinite strike here today demanding higher wages.
</P>
<P>
The workers are demanding a pay rise similar to that of 1994,
when strikers from the Maputo Public Transport Company pressed
for a 45 percent increase of wages.
</P>
<P>
In the end, some of the workers saw their wages up by 45
percent and the others got a pay rise of as high as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the company Joao Jose complained that the
company's fare is as low as 500 Meticais (about 0.07 U.S.
Dollars), as compared with 1500 Meticais (about 0.2 Dollars) of
the mini buses for one person.
</P>
<P>
He said the company is losing as a result. He proposed to
raise the public transport fare of his company.

<HEADLINE> Clarke Warns He May Not Deliver Big Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke Sunday night gave his toughest warning yet that he
may not be able to deliver tax cuts in this autumn's budget due to
the beef crisis and Treasury revenue forecast error.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said in a BBC interview that the beef crisis had already
cost the government at least one billion pounds (1.5 billion US
dollars) and had severely restricted his scope for tax cuts which
are in jeopardy because of higher than expected public borrowing
and a mistake in tax revenue forecast.
</P>
<P>
He conceded that public borrowing was higher than he had
expected and the Treasury had made a mistake in its revenue
forecasts and had less tax coming in than had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor said his scope for cutting taxes had been
limited by a shortfall in revenues, which meant borrowing was
running above the forecast of 22.5 billion pounds (33.8 billion US
dollars) for the year.
</P>
<P>
Clarke also said that cutting taxes was not essential for a
Tory election victory.
</P>
<P>
"People who think tax cuts equals election victory are, I'm
afraid, seriously mistaken," he said, referring to demands for him
to reduce the basic income tax rate by between one percent to
three percent.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his assertion that the budget would contain tax
cuts "only if we can afford them" and if it was in the interests
of the economy, and added that the public was not "that stupid" to
expect reductions in any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor's remarks alarmed Tory MPs and party
strategists, who are banking on tax reductions as the backbone of
their general election campaign.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses World Drug Body Of Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Drug Law
Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) today accused the International
Nacortics Control Board (INCB) of playing double standard in
terms of the country's efforts against illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
The accusation is made by NDLEA press secretary Abiodun
Adesola in reacting to an allegation by the INCB chief Robert
Gilboa of the United States that Nigeria remained a drug
trafficking nation.
</P>
<P>
Adesola said the United States has sent several congratulatory
messages to his agency for its achievements in fighting against
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
He wondered why after sending those messages, the United
States would still label Nigeria a drug trafficking nation.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. is truly concerned, the government there will
step up its activities at stemming the insatiable drug
consumption habit of her nationals," Adesola said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States has chosen to politicize the
drug issue by pointing accusing fingers at Nigeria in order to
cover up its own shortcomings.

<HEADLINE> UK, U.S. to Jointly Build New Vertical-Launch Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
(MOD) has decided to join an America program of building a second
generation jump jet capable of aircraft launch and vertical
landing, according to a press report today.
</P>
<P>
The British MOD is expected to invest 133 million pounds (about
200 million U.S. dollars) in this joint project in a bid to
replace the Royal Navy's fleet of ageing Sea Harriers fighter
planes.
</P>
<P>
Under the title of the Joint Strike Fighter, the military
experts of the two countries have been given an unique task of
designing a single airframe capable of various roles previously
done by separate planes.
</P>
<P>
The new fighter will be capable of dogfighting like the old
F-16, juddering aircraft carrier launches like he F-18 and STOVL
(short take-off, vertical landing) like the Harrier, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
As the new fighter plane is relatively low cost, both Pentagon
and the British MOD are expected to place a large order.
</P>
<P>
Military experts predict that the new vertical landing plane,
with a potential export market of up to 2,000, is expected to be
the defining aircraft precurement for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, three designs have been put forward and American
officials, assisted by British experts, would choose two of the
competitors to build full-scale aircraft for what is called the
Concept Demonstration phase.
</P>
<P>
After the Concept Demonstration phase, the winning option is
scheduled to begin construction in 2005 with delivery in 2007.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Says Liberian Refugees Should Go Back to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ghana said today it did not want to
encourage an exodus of refugees from war-torn Liberia because the
West African peacekeepers planned to make Monrovia, the capital
of Liberia, a save haven within the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted Ghanaian Deputy Foreign
Minister Mahamed Ibn Chambas as saying that a freighter off
Ghana's coast crammed with thousands of Liberian refugees should
return to Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian vessel, Bulk Challen, was forced to resume its
search for a friendly port in West Africa late on Sunday after
stopping briefly in Ghana's Takoradi Port, being refueled with
its 4,000 passengers being fed and treated by medical workers.
</P>
<P>
A report from the port said that three people had died on the
creaking vessel, a woman who bled uncontrollably and two men who
were killed in an unexpected shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
The next destination of the freighter might be Lagos because
the passengers included 200 Nigerian peacekeeping soldiers from
Liberia, according to port officials.
</P>
<P>
Some international aid workers speculated upon Lome as a
destination, which is the capital of Togo, the nearest port
eastwards after Ghana.
</P>
<P>
But Chambas said the West African peacekeeping force had
already created a safe area in the Liberian capital where the
refugees could go and their security would be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"So there is no reason for there to be a stampede to leave
Monrovia. To accept the passengers on this boat in my West
African country would be to encourage an exodus from Monrovia,
which is absolutely not necessary," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, report said that thousands of Liberians have crowded
around Monrovia's port in hopes of getting onto any departing
boats because of the violence of a festering six-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers say an estimated 20,000 Liberians could now be in
boats in choppy West African waters and they were working out
plans to monitor the coast for those in distress.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Asylum for Liberian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) Monday called for West African countries to
open their door to thousands of new Liberian refugees fleeing
fighting in Liberian capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The UN agency in charge of refugee issues made the appeal after
it repeatedly failed to make Liberia's neighbouring countries
allow some 4,300 Liberian people aboard ships to go on shore.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said the Nigerian freighter Bulk Challege was still
looking for a port to disembark the some 3,600 people aboard who
had been rejected by Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, and the Victory
Reefer was off Sierra Leone which had denied its 700 passengers
landing.
</P>
<P>
High commissioner Sadako Ogata voiced concern about the
situation of these people who have been at sea for some days,
saying "The situation has become desperate. Unless the door is
opened to them, a lot of people, many of them women and children,
may die."
</P>
<P>
She appealed for continued generosity of countries in the
region to grant asylum to the newly-made Liberian refugees, adding
that UNHCR was prepared to help the countries doing so in full
complaince with internationally accepted humanitarian standards.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are more than 750,000 Liberian refugees in
West Africa, 410,000 of them in Guinea, 305,000 in Cote d'Ivoire,
15,000 in Ghana, 4,700 in Sierra Leone and 4,000 in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Intensive Contacts in Beirut on Eve of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz carried out today intensive diplomatic consultations on
the eve of the second meeting of representatives from the five
member states of a proposed committee monitoring the cease-fire
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli occupation forces continued today bombardment
at southern Lebanese villages, which was accompanied by an air
raid, on the second successive day, in an apparent pressure on
this country.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz met with Victor Posovalyuk, Russian special envoy and
deputy foreign minister, in the office here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official announced that his talks with Boueiz
dealt with the cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon
and Israel on April 26 as well as all the details related to the
proposed monitoring and consultative committees.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the advantage of joint efforts between the
countries for the achievement of peace in the region, and
criticized a "U.S. exclusion" in the Middle East politics, noting
"the recent events have affirmed that there is no room for an
exclusive work in the politics in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
On the April 26 understanding which ended 17 days of Israeli
military strikes in south Lebanon, the Russian envoy said, "We
are with the April understanding on principle, despite some
points which we do not agree with."
</P>
<P>
He underlined a necessity "not to give the monitoring
committee any political color," adding that the committee should
"only have a technical nature."
</P>
<P>
Posovalyuk expected that the military escalation in south
Lebanon Sunday would be discussed in the meeting of
representatives from the United States, France, Israel, Syria and
Lebanon in Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz received this afternoon a telephone call from his
Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency reported that
during the telephone conversation, the two foreign ministers
discussed "the ideas and papers they have received on the
composition of the monitoring committee and the way of its work,
in addition to the latest development of the situation in light of
the military escalation in south Lebanon Sunday."
</P>
<P>
Three papers, put forward by the United States, France and
Syria-Lebanon respectively, will be discussed in the second
meeting of the five states' representatives. The first meeting
was held last Friday without any concrete result.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister also held talks with French
Ambassador to Lebanon Jean-Pierre Lafon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli artillery today continued
shelling south Lebanese villages without causing casualties, on
the second successive day following guerrilla attacks at Israeli
occupation forces in which five Israeli soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters carried out this afternoon an air raid at
suspected guerrilla bases between the villages of Loueizeh and
Sejoud in which the helicopters fired at least two air-to-surface
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, launched attacks on an Israeli patrol and an outpost in the
Israeli-occupied buffer zone in south Lebanon Sunday morning,
wounding five Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The attacks, the first since last month's 17-day Israeli blitz
on Lebanon, drew Israel's rapid retaliation by bombardment and
air raid.
</P>
<P>
The question is, however, whether the attacks could be
regarded as a breach of the cease-fire understanding.
</P>
<P>
The April cease-fire understanding banned firing from or at
civilian areas but did not rule out attacks by Hezbollah
guerrillas at Israeli targets in the 15-kilometer wide border
strip and allowed both sides the right of self-defense.

<P>
BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The visit of a group of 47 Bosnian
Croats to a cemetery in the north of the Serb Republika Srpska on
Sunday passed without any incidents, Tanjug news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR Information Bureau said it was the first time since
the end of the war in Bosnia that a large group of people had been
able to cross the former front line without encountering
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the 4th Battalion, U.S. Col. Neal Anderson said
the visit was "a superb precedent for future visits" and would
help to build "confidence that the local officials can work
together."
</P>
<P>
Last month witnessed several clashes between the Serbs and
Muslim refugees who wish to cross into the Serb land to see their
old homes and visit their cemeteries. Two people were dead and a
dozen more injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Anderson said IFOR could not force the Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation into arranging successful visits if they
had not been willing to do so.
</P>
<P>
The group reached the cemetery in open trailers driven by
tractors and mourned for their deceased relatives, the agency
added.
</P>
<P>
While a Franciscan served a Mass at the cemetery, Serb
policeman stood alongside the U.N. policemen and IFOR troops to
prevent for any incident.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said today that Israel Sunday refrained from stern reaction
to Hezbollah attacks in the Israeli self-styled "security zone" in
order to avoid a new flare-up of fighting, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Peres told reporters that Israel replied in a measured way
because it is not interested in any escalation of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He described the two Hezbollah (Party of God) attacks as
"borderline violations" of the understanding reached on April 26
for the ceasefire in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ehud Barak told the Knesset
(parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the
Israeli army's reaction showed it still has freedom of action in
the "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He also said he believed that the understanding may last beyond
the May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes Sunday blasted suspected Hezbollah targets
north of the "security zone" following Hezbollah attacks which
wounded five Israeli armymen, including three
officers, in the "security zone's" northeastern sector.
</P>
<P>
They were the first army casualties since the understanding
that ended Operation Grapes Wrath came into effect on April
27. The five men, all suffering from shrapnel wounds, underwent
surgery in a Haifa hospital Sunday. They are reportedly improving
today.

JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Four Israelis were injured
today, one of them seriously, in militants' attack near the
Jewish settlement of Beit El, north of Jerusalem in the West
Bank, according to an Israel Television report.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred as the militants, reportedly driving a gray
Subaru car, fired repeatedly at a private bus carrying workers of

<P>
Fortunately, the bus was bullet-proof, and no one was
seriously hurt, though two passengers were slightly wounded with
scratches.

The militants then drove to the entrance of Beit El, and
opened fire on the Israelis waiting at a bus stop there,
critically injuring one of them with a bullet in the head and
another one with shot in the back.
</P>
<P>
According to eye-witnesses, the militants managed to get away
in the direction to a Palestinian refugee camp nearby, then they
reportedly abandoned their vehicle and escaped on foot.
</P>
<P>
At this hour, the Israeli army is conducting a massive manhunt
for the militants with helicopters and ground forces, after
declaring the area a closed military zone.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Israeli opposition parties charged that today's
attack is the direct result of the government's policy, blaming
the government for giving up the control of security in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Etain, chairman of the right-wing Tzomet party which
has formed a joint list with the Likud and the Gesher Party in
the upcoming elections, called on the Israeli army to retake the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
told the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee today that there is a possibility of tightening the
closure on the Palestinian autonomous areas because of militants'
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since a series of suicide bombing attacks against Israelis
occurred in late February and March, which killed at least 60
people and wounded over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official earlier told Xinhua that the closure, which
barred tens of thousands of Palestinians from returning to their
jobs inside Israel, would not be lifted until after the Israeli
general elections on May 29.

<HEADLINE> African Traditional Herbs Symposium Opens In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The sixth OAU Scientific,
Technical and Research Commission (STRC) symposium on African
traditional medicinal plants opened here today, calling for
devising means of modernizing traditional medicines in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Uganda's Minister of State for Health
Bart Katureebe while officiating the five-day symposium at the
Uganda International Conference Center in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Katureebe told the meeting that the Ugandan government
recognized traditional practitioners and to this effect a health
review commission had been set up to promote research programs in
the field of traditional medicines.
</P>
<P>
He said the government supported traditional medicine
practitioners by amalgamating them with the western modernized
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Professor Johnson Ekpere, Executive Secretary of the
Lagos-based STRC of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), said
that 80 percent of the people in the world depended on
traditional medicine and medicinal plants for health security.
</P>
<P>
More than two thirds of the world's plant species came from
developing countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
He therefore expressed need for capacity building through
international cooperation in the conservation, development and
standardization of herbal medicines in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will also focus on the development of
traditional medicine and use of traditional drugs in primary
health care and research development of drugs from medicinal
plants in Africa.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 countries are being represented at the symposium,
including Congo, Burkina Fasso, Benin, Cameroon, Madagascar,
Gambia, Egypt, Eritrea, Kenya and Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Kontic, Klein Meet on Economic Development in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic and U.N. Administrator of Eastern Slavonia Jacques Klein
held talks here today to discuss the region's economic recovery
and development.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, Klein had told Kontic that international
community was ready to invest some funds in the region and that
the transitional administration had proposed five projects to
boost the local economy, according to the Yugoslav Information
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Slavonia is situated in the northeastern Croatia
bordering Yugoslavia and is the only one of the four Serb regions
in Croatia that was not occupied by the government troops in 1995.
An agreement signed in November 1995 placed the region under
one-year U.N. administration with the possibility of extending the
transitional period for another 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Klein said that a number of international organizations were
interested in opening offices in the region, which is another
factor in securing the implementation of the basic agreement.
</P>
<P>
Kontic, meanwhile, stressed the importance of efficient
functioning of international institutions in restoring confidence,
security and cooperation of the region's entire population.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that regional autonomy and economic recovery
were specially important and key issues concerning to all, the
secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Kontic and Klein also spoke highly of the reopening of the
Belgrade-Zagreb highway and oil pipeline between the two countries
last Tuesday, regarding it as an important step in the
normalization of the Serb-Croatian relations.

<HEADLINE> Boutros-Ghali Recommends Extension of UN Force in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended a 6-month extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO) at a reduced strength.
</P>
<P>
In a report to Security Council available here today,
Boutros-Ghali said that the impasse reached at the end of 1995
continues in Western Sahara though both the Government of Morocco
and the POLISARIO front profess their commitment to the settlement
plan and to the identification process.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the required willingness does not exist to give
MINURSO the cooperation needed for it to resume and complete the
identification process.
</P>
<P>
The report dated May 8 recommended that the identification
process be suspended until such time as both parties provide
convincing evidence that they are committed to resuming and
completing it without further obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief proposed that the strength of the military
component of MINURSO be reduced from 288 to 230 personnel and the
civilian police component withdrawn except for a small number of
officers to maintain contacts with both sides.
</P>
<P>
However, the United Nations cannot abandon its responsibility
and the international community must remain determined to see not
only peace maintained in the region but every effort made for the
people of Western Sahara to decide on their future status in a way
that will bring lasting peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Western Sahara in northwest Africa was under Spanish rule
before 1976. After Spanish withdrawal, Morocco announced
annexation of the area while the POLISARIO front fought for
independence.
</P>
<P>
With help of U.N. and the Organization of African Unity,
Morocco and POLISARIO front signed a document referred to as the
settlement plan in 1988. According to the document, the people of
Western Sahara would choose between independence and integration
with Morocco in their exercise of their right to
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council established MINURSO in 1991 to verify
the cease-fire and cessation of hostilities, identify and register
qualified voters and organize and ensure a free referendum. The
referendum should have taken place in January 1992, according to
settlement plan. However, it was postponed agains and again
because of the two parties' difference over voter eligibility,
release of political prisoners and other issues.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli was killed and three
others were wounded in militants' attack near the Jewish
settlement of Beit El, north of Jerusalem in the West Bank,
according to an Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred as the militants, reportedly driving a gray
Subaru car, fired repeatedly at a private bus carrying workers of
the Palestinian-Israeli District Coordination Office in the area.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the bus was bullet-proof, and no one was
seriously hurt, though two passengers were slightly wounded with
scratches.
</P>
<P>
The militants then drove to the entrance of Beit El, and
opened fire on the Israelis waiting at a bus stop there,
critically injuring two Yeshiva (Jewish religious seminar)
students from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
David Boim, 17, was wounded in his head by a bullet, while his
friend, Yael Grinban, was shot in the back.
</P>
<P>
Both were rushed to the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where
Boim died from his injuries, while Grinban is still in serious
condition, according to doctors from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to eye-witnesses, the militants managed to get away
in the direction to a Palestinian refugee camp nearby, then they
reportedly abandoned their vehicle, and escaped on foot.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army declared the area a closed military zone
immediately after the incident, and has been conducting a massive
manhunt for the terrorists with helicopters and ground forces.

<HEADLINE> World Information Conference Opens In S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Ye Xingzeng and Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
MIDRAND (South Africa), May 13 (Xinhua) -- The International
Conference on Information Society and Development (ISAD) was
officially opened here by South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
this evening.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 delegates from about 50 countries around the
world attended the opening ceremony of the conference, chaired by
South African Posts and Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Mbeki said the entry into the
information society should not be reserved for the developed
countries only, the debate about the information society was
indeed of relevance to all humanity.
</P>
<P>
Referring to intellectual property, which was an important
pillar in building global information society, Mbeki said the
issue of intellectual property rights continued to be a bone of
contention among the nations and deserved serious and fair
consideration by the international community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said although the path to the information society did not
widen the gap between rich and poor, developed and developing
countries, the realities of imbalance and domination between them
must be dealt with more by empowering the south through
cooperation and openness and mutually beneficial contributions.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the pivotal role the government could play
in the building of the information society, Mbeki also appealed
to private sectors and civil communities to play its role in the
process.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that common strategies should be adopted
to seize the technological opportunities presented today for the
benefit of all nations, developed and developing alike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a speech addressed to the ISAD conference in
Washington via satellite, United States Vice-President Al Gore
announced a five-year project to help provide internet access in
20 African nations.
</P>
<P>
Gore urged the conference to use the opportunity to discuss
how all nations could be full participants in the information
age, finding ways to upgrade the quality of life of the people
across the world.
</P>
<P>
Among dignitaries attended the conference included the
European Union President Jacques Santer, Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology Ben Ngubane, Deputy Foreign
Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad.

<HEADLINE> US Gasoline Prices Up, Increase Pace Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Prices in U.S. gasoline stations
rose slightly in the past two weeks, a sign that the rate of
recent price increases appeared to slow down.
</P>
<P>
The average price, including taxes, of gasoline for all grades
was 137.96 cents per gallon as of May 10, an increase of 1.62
cents a gallon in two weeks, according to the latest Lundberg
Survey, based in Los Angles, of 10,000 gasoline stations.
</P>
<P>
That compares to the average 136.34 cents on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The rate of increase equals the rate in February and is less
than half the rates reported in March and April, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Motorists have seen sharp price increases in recent weeks. But
the most recent jump is lower than that reported during the
two-week period between April 12 and April 26, when the average
national price rose five cents.
</P>
<P>
In California, prices went up eight cents during that period,
compared to less than three cents in the most recent survey.
</P>
<P>
To ease the soaring gasoline prices in the U.S., President Bill
Clinton ordered on April 29 to sell 12 million barrels of oil from
the nation's strategic petroleum reserve, beginning from this
month, and asked the Energy Department to find the real cause
behind the surging of prices.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans in the U.S. Congress also took the advantage to
call for the repeal of a 4.3 cents-a-gallon gasoline tax increase
imposed by the government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In a survey released last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve took
the view that the increase of gasoline prices was likely to be
temporary and would not lead to an overall inflation spiral in the
country.
</P>
<P>
U.S. business leaders also predicted recently that the current
soaring of gasoline prices will be short-lived.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 867 Mln Dlr Stand-By Credit for Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved a nine-month stand-by credit for Ukraine
totaling some 867 million U.S. dollars to back the government's
1996 economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
The government's policies are aimed to resuming the
stabilization and liberalization of the economy. The key policy
objectives are to reduce inflation to about 1-2 percent per month
by the end of this year, to limit the decline of output, and to
realize the country's economic potential.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 program is designed to reduce the consolidated budget
deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP this year from 5 percent of GDP in
1995. For the purpose, the Ukraine government plans to introduce
further structural reforms in 1996 to create conditions for a
sustainable recovery in output so as to accelerate the auctions of
state enterprises with the aim by the end of 1996 of privatizing
at least 70 percent of the shares in a total of 5,000 medium and
large enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The country's program in 1996 is expected to be supported by
external financing official flows of about 2 billion dollars from
multilateral and bilateral creditors.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine joined the IMF in September 1992. Its quota is an about
1,446 million dollar equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF
credit currently totals about 1,503 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's New Cabinet Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today announced four new cabinet ministers to fill
the gaps left by the withdrawal of the National Party (NP) from
the government of national unity on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a press conference in Cape Town,
Mandela said he had decided to move quickly to allow the
appointees to familiarize themselves with their new tasks and to
wind down their business in other departments.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had also taken into account the government's
commitment to rationalize and streamline its activities as much
as practicable.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President and NP leader F. W. De Klerk and Inkatha
Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had been consulted
about the appointments, added the president.
</P>
<P>
The new ministers, whose appointments would take effect from
July 1, are Pallo Jordan, minister of environment affairs,
Geraldine Fraser Moleketi, minister of welfare and population
development, Mohammed Valli Moosa, minister of provincial affairs
and constitutional development, Pennuell Maduna, minister of
mineral and energy affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with the abolishment of the post of general
services minister and merger of agriculture portfolio into the
Land Affairs Ministry, the 27-member cabinet was reduced to 25.
</P>
<P>
However, announcements would be made ''in due course'' to fill
the deputy ministerships left by the NP's withdrawal, said
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the announcement, NP spokesman Johan
Steenkamp said his party welcomed the fact that Mandela had used
the opportunity to introduce ''moderate rationalization'' in the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Steenkamp said the NP was satisfied that the new appointees
already had a certain measure of experience.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese diplomat said
today that the U.N. Department of Public Information (DPI) should
take as its primary task the establishment of a new international
information and communication order based on the recognition of
differences among nations.
</P>
<P>
"To establish a just and equitable new international
information and communication order is the general desire of the
developing countries as well as an important component of the
establishment of a new international political and economic
order," said Counselor Yafei He in a speech delivered at the 18th
session of the U.N. Committee on Information.
</P>
<P>
"The DPI should take the establishment of a new international
information and communication order based on the recognition of
the diversity of the world and the differences among nations as
its primary task," he added.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he said, priority should be given to the urgent
needs of the developing countries, helping them to improve their
infrastructure and narrow the information gap with the developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the use of the Internet and CD-ROMs, he said that while the
effort by the DPI was commendable, such traditional media as
printed matter, radio and television remained indispensable
because many developing countries could hardly keep pace with the
rapidly developing modern information technology due to shortages
of resources, personnel and technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Union Home Minister S.B. Chavan
and Finance Minister Manmohan Singh today went to Srinagar,
capital of Kashmir, to make first hand study of the situation in
the valley in the wake of the destruction of the historic shrine
at Charar-e-Sharief town Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The high-level team is visiting Kashmir on the instructions of
Prime Minister P.C. Narasimha Rao, who himself is also likely to
visit the valley soon, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
The senior ministers would take an aerial view of the burnt-out
town and discuss the situation with Kashmir Governor Gen. K.V.
Krishna Rao.
</P>
<P>
This high-level team is also expected to review the situation
in light of the massive protests by the people all across the
valley in spite of the curfew imposed in all the major towns of
Kashmir following the burning incident Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
It would look into the retaliatory action of the violent crowds
in which temples and government property and houses of migrants
were the prime target of the arsonists.
</P>
<P>
The law and order situation in the valley is being closely
monitored and a decision on lifting the curfew would be taken
Sunday, Director-General of Police of Jammu and Kashmir Sabharwal
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 buildings were set ablaze by violent mobs in
different parts of Kashmir Saturday while protesting against
destruction of Charar-e-Sharief Shrine. In what can be termed as
an aftermath of Charar episode, violent mobs raising anti-Indian
slogans and blaming the security forces for the blaze at the
shrine, burned government buildings, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Army Claims to Have Started Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Croatia said today that its troops
are withdrawing from the separation zones, except those adjoining
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the U.N.-protected Serb-dominated areas,
but U.N. peacekeepers said they could not verify it.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granich said in Croatia's
capital Zagreb that Croatian forces are retreating from all
separation zones except those bordering Serb-held territory in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Granich said the Croatian forces will completely withdraw from
the separation zone in the Knin area, the southern sector of the
U.N.-protected Serb territory, by May 14, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian army will complete its pullout from the separation
zones in the U.N.-protected northern and eastern sectors within
"proper" time, he said.
</P>
<P>
The reports also quoted Granich as saying that international
organizations, especially the U.N. peacekeeping force, are free to
enter and move around in the separation zone in Western Slavonia,
a rebel Serb pocket seized by the Croatia army early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian troops captured Western Slavonia, the
U.N.-protected western sector, on May 1 in their first major
victory over the breakaway "Republic of Serbian Krajina".
</P>
<P>
After fighting a six-month war against the Croatian government
in 1991, Croatian Serbs established a republic of their own on
one-third of the country, which has now been reduced to one-fourth
after the fall of Western Slavonia.
</P>
<P>
While launching the blitz operation to seize Western Slavonia,
the Croatian troops moved into all the separation zones policed by
the U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Gunness, a spokesman for the U.N. Confidence
Rebuilding Operation, said in Zagreb today that U.N. officials
were still unable to verify Croatia's evacuations.
</P>
<P>
Also today, a senior official of the self-proclaimed "Republic
of Serbian Krajina" denounced allegations of Croatian retreats,
saying that Granich was "cheating world opinion."
</P>
<P>
Milan Babich, foreign minister of the republic, said in the
republic's capital Knin that the Croatian forces still occupied
parts of Western Slavonia adjacent to the Serb-held territory in
Bosnia, in clear violation of a truce accord signed by the two
sides in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Babich said the Stara Gradishka and Jasenovac areas bordering
Bosnia which are still held by the Croatian forces are lying
exactly in the U.N.-designated separation zones.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Babich said the Croatian army's special forces are
still stationed in the forest areas near the town of Pakrac in
Western Slavonia and continue to drive Serbs into concentration
camps where inspections by international organizations are banned.
</P>
<P>
The entire peace process in the region will "run into trouble"
if Croatia refuses to pull its troops out of Western Slavonia,
Babich warned.
</P>
<P>
The senior Serb official also promised that Serb forces will
not enter the separation zones if the Croatian army withdraw.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir New Crisis Dashes Hopes of Indo-Pak Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The new crisis in Kashmir arising
from the burning down of the Sufi Shrine in Chrar-e-Sharief town
by militants is likely to dash hopes of improving trade relations
between India and Pakistan under the South Asian Preferential
Trade Arrangement (SAPTA), reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
SAPTA was adopted at the end of the Eighth Summit of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) here on May 4.
</P>
<P>
A number of goods traded unofficially between India and
Pakistan via third countries were included in the list of items
offered for concessional tariffs under the SAPTA and this was
expected to boost bilateral trade, trade sources said.
</P>
<P>
But the tension exacerbated by the Chrar-e-Sharief incident
might dampen the prospects although there is considerable interest
from trade and industry in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling across the Indo-Pak border is of 1.5 billion US
dollars annually, against the official trade of barely 100 million
US dollars in 1993-94. Trade and industry circles on both sides
are keen that this should be regularized, President of SAARC
Chamber of Commerce and Industry S.M. Inam said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Economy Improved: Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Bharat
Mohan Adhikari said the country's economy is showing signs of
improvement as a result of the implementation of various measures
and programs by the CPN-UML government in line with its commitment
to guiding the economy towards independence, competence and
self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ongoing 29th general meeting of the Federation
of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industries Saturday, the
finance minister said as there were significant improvements in
the revenue collection during the first six months of the current
fiscal year, the budget deficit went down by 23.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign grant receipts during the first nine months of the
fiscal year reached 1,090 million rupees (21.8 million US
dollars), an increase of 98 percent over the amount of 550 million
rupees (11 million US dollars) for the corresponding period of
last year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign exchange reserve has reached 42,650 million
rupees (853 million US dollars), an increase of 2,060 million
rupees (41.2 million US dollars) since mid-July 1994, and the
present reserve is sufficient to meet imports for 8.4 months.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the positive signs in the economy in the last
4-5 months, the raised estimation for the growth rate of the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) is four percent as compared to the earlier
estimates of only 2.8 percent, B.M. Adhikari said.
</P>
<P>
The present government places high importance on the role of
the private industrial and commercial sectors in a speedy
development of the national economy, he said. He also expressed
the confidence that the recently published economic policy of the
government would further encourage domestic as well as foreign
investors to invest in industrial and commercial sectors in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Xiong Ni Captures Gold at Alamo Diving Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FORT LAUDERDALE, U.S., May 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Xiong Ni, a
two time Olympic medalist and 1993 World Cup platform champion,
won the men's three-meter spring board title with a total of
666.99 points here today at the FINA/Alamo Diving Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for the world platform champion to win
a three-meter spring board title in just as many weeks. Last week,
Xiong won the event at Dive Canada, the previous stop of the 1995
FINA Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, with a neck injury, led 30 competitors from 16 countries
in the semi-final. But Dmitry Sautin used a well executed an
inward two and a half somersaults in his opening dive to build an
early lead in the final.
</P>
<P>
But Xiong, 1992 Olympic platform bronze medalist and 1988
Olympic platform silver medalist, regained his lead after the
fourth dive and widened it with a dive featuring one and a half
somersaults and three and half twists. In his last dive, he
performed an even more difficult dive with inward three and a half
somersaults only to show that he's also a master on the board.
</P>
<P>
Dean Panaro of the United States won the silver medal with
642.66 points, followed by his teammate Scott Donie. Sautin fell
to the sixth place after a couple of less well executed dives in
the last four rounds of competition.
</P>
<P>
Russian diver Svetlana Timoshinina walked away with the women's
platform title, beating Guo Jingjing of China by only.18
points. She scored a total of 475.20 points and Guo, 475.02.
</P>
<P>
Olympic platform gold medalist Fu Mingxia had the highest score
in the semi-final, but the Chinese team's head coach Xu Yiming
decided to let Guo, a 14-year-old national champion, and another
young diver to enter the final to help them gain more experience
in international competition.
</P>
<P>
Anne Montminy, a Canadian diver coached by Li Yihui, a former
Chinese national team member, won the bronze with 471.48 points.
</P>
<P>
At the end of men's platform synchronized diving, the American
audience were hilarious when the computerized score board showed
Mark Ruiz and Li Kongzheng, an American pair, topped their Chinese
rivals to win the title. But an announcer quickly calmed them
down, saying the scores on the electronic device were wrong,
though not far from the correct results.
</P>
<P>
The official results handed out later showed Chinese divers Xu
Chengliang and Tian Liang narrowly beat Ruiz and Li to win the
title. Xu and Tian scored 313.89 points, followed by Ruiz and Li
with 312.51. Japanese diver Hidekinaito and Chimaki Yasuda
received the bronze with 268.50 points.
</P>
<P>
Divers will compete for medals in women's three meter, men's
platform and women's platform synchronized diving Sunday before
moving to Mexico for the Tormeo de Clavados diving competition.

<HEADLINE> Bear Phase Continues on Indian Bourses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The leading bull operators of
the major Indian financial centers have lost interest in the stock
exchange market, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The major problem faced by the bourses is liquidity. The
transaction volumes have shrunk because of the absence of the
forward trading.
</P>
<P>
The domestics financial institutions and mutual funds have also
deserted the market and the Unit Trust of India, which is a major
player, was reported to be booking profits in some high priced
shares. The foreign investors have also deferred their operations
and they preferred to wait till the market stabilizes, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The market remained in bear orbit for the most of the session
with the sensitive index dipping to 3199.18 at the outset. After
recovering to 3207.42, the index dropped by over 50 points in the
next two trading days and finally closed at 3154.18. After gaining
70 points in the last week, the market lost 49.36 points in the
current week.
</P>
<P>
The bourses of the country have been moving in a aimless manner
for past couple of sessions. The macro-economic fundamentals are
strong but there are no buyers even at the current low level,

<HEADLINE> Former America's Cup Title Winner Reported Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Former winner of America's Cup
race Alan Bond is recovering from serious illness, a local
newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bond, 57, was released from the intensive care unit of the
Royal Perth Hospital on Friday after several days' care for a
blood clot, said the Sunday Telegraph report.
</P>
<P>
Bond's wife of four weeks, Diana Bliss, was quoted as telling
the newspaper that the couple had been dining with friends at a
restaurant when Bond first collapsed in agony on May 3.
</P>
<P>
He was taken to hospital but discharged, only to be readmitted
in pain on May 7.
</P>
<P>
Bond was suffering a lack of blood flow to the bowel, caused by
a clot possible due to heart surgery he had in 1983. His wife
said Bond had been told to take extreme care as the problem could
reoccur at any time.
</P>
<P>
The initial attack on May 3 coincided with the day Bond denied
charges in the West Australian District Court of fraud involving
the purchase of a French impressionist painting, La Promenade.
</P>
<P>
Bond was declared bankrupt in April 1992 after his diversified
property and brewing empire, Bond Corp., crashed into receivership
under a mountain of debt. He later managed to settle the
bankcruptcy.
</P>
<P>
He and his former wife of 37 years, Eileen, divorced after he
was jailed for dishonesty in 1992. The conviction was later
overturned.
</P>
<P>
Bond's Australia II yacht won the America's Cup from Denis
Conner's Liberty in 1983, prompting then prime minister Bob Hawke
to declare an unofficial national holiday with the words: "Any
employer who sacks a worker for not coming in today is a bum."
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the cup had been taken from the United
States. New Zealand's Black Magic performed the same feat Sunday,
wresting the cup in a whitewash five races to nil from Conner's
Team Stars and Stripes.

<HEADLINE> China Never Seeks Hegemonism: Chinese Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China absolutely never
seeks hegemonism and will never threaten or invade other
countries, and this is China's inevitable choice.
</P>
<P>
"China needs a peaceful and stable international enironment for
its development. China opposes hegemonism of any form and it will
never seek hegemonism itself," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the on-going conference of the Asia Society
here, Qian said that in the past century and more, the Chinese
people suffered tremendously from aggression by foreign powers,
and historically, China has never engaged in expansion or
aggression of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Do not do unto others that you do not want others to do unto
you," the vice-premier quoted the ancient Chinese philosopher
Confucius as saying. China will never threaten or invade other
countries, Qian said, adding that instead, China will always be a
positive factor in promoting world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
"This is determined by China's state system and its development
strategy and objectives, and this is an inevitable choice China
has made for the sake of the fundamental interests of the Chinese
people and the people of the world as a whole," the Chinese
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has all along pursued an
independent foreign policy of peace, and its fundamental goal is
to safeguard national unity, state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, maintain world peace and promote common development.
</P>
<P>
China stands for establishing and developing friendly relations
and cooperation with all countries on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian told the some 800 participants who are here exploring
China's relations with its neighbors that the priority of China's
diplomatic work is to actively expand good-neighborly relations of
friendship with its neighbors and to strive for a peaceful and
tranquil surrounding environment for domestic reform, opening-up
and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
China stands for peaceful settlement of international disputes
through dialogues and negotiations and opposes the resort to force
or threat of force in handling state-to-state ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian added that China has made its own contributions over
recent years to facilitating the peaceful settlement of the
Cambodian and Afghan issues and to maintaining peace and stability
on the Korean Peninsular.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has, through friendly consultations,
appropriately settled the territorial issues and demarcation of
its boundary with some of its neighbors, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"Practice has proved that so long as the parties concerned
proceed from the overall interest of maintaining peace and
stability and take into account the long-term interests of their
people, they will be able to find, through patient and friendly
consultations, practical and feasible solutions to however
complicated problems," Qian said.

development and foreign investment plays an important role in
bringing such technology, he said, adding the government,
therefore, has adopted a policy of inviting foreign investment in

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Encouraged to Read More Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua)--More than 20,000 libraries has sprung
up across China's rural areas over recent six months, thanks to a
nationwide campaign to promote readings among Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, or "library construction project" jointly
launched by the Press and Publication Administration, the Central
Committee of the Communist Youth league (CYL), the Committee for
Cultural Development in Impoverished Area and the Peasants' Daily,
has channeled over two million books of various kinds to these
libraries since December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The reading promotion activities are well received by farmers,
a lot of whom have learned one or two latest farming skills which
would help them make more money. Moreover, some rural areas have
seen their cultural life invigorated and social morals improved.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the CYL Central Committee said that they would
organize university students to go to countryside during the
summer vacation to help farmers make best use of the books in
their libraries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the project organizers will launch a prize
competition to award those who have read most books or contributed
most to the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Qualification Test Prepared For Securities Professionals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A unified national exam system will
soon be introduced to ensure China's young securities industry has
qualified professionals.
</P>
<P>
The State Council's Securities Committee has authorized its
executive body, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), to
set qualification exams for people involved in securities
floatation, investment consultation, securities brokerage and
securities software engineerings.
</P>
<P>
Besides granting qualification papers, the CSRC also has the
right to suspend or revoke the professional certificates.
</P>
<P>
The system is to start working as of July 1 this year. People
doing securities business without CSRC certificates will be
gradually phased out of the industry, according to a set of
provisional regulations released the State Council's Securities
Committee here today.
</P>
<P>
The provisional regulations said that CSRC will register those
who have passed the exams and have their names made public.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates that people in the industry can not obtain jobs
at two or more securities-related firms at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Those who fail to find jobs in securities firms within 18
months after they get the CSRC certificates will see their papers
automatically annualed, the regulations note.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese securities authorities have placed standardization
before market expansion. The CSRC said recently that the primary
task for the fledging market is to perfect its current legal
framework and bring the market operations in line with
international practice.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of market has been therefore tightened with the
Shanghai Securities Exchange having punished several
regulation-violating cases in bond trading over recent two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Situation In Somali Captial Becomes Tense Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The situation in the Somali
capital of Mogadishu has become tense again.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu has been relatively calm since early March this year
when the United Nations peacekeeping forces evacuated from the
bullet-riddled city after failing to restore peace to it in a
27-month costly mission. However, there have been reports of
renewed fighting between rival clan militiamen in recent days. At
least 13 people have been killed in three days of fighting.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, eight people were killed during clan fighting in
Bermuda district in southern Mogadishu. Three of them died when
an artillery shell ploughed into the city's Bakaaraha market.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, three people were killed, 10 others wounded and
a vehicle was blown up in a battle at the deserted Mogadishu
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, two more people were perished and several others
wounded in a fighting in the southern part of the city.
</P>
<P>
In the town of Baidoa, where clashes have also broken out
recently, the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) Office has
been closed for a week after Somali gunmen threatened to blow it
up. Officials in the WFP Office say they will go back into
Somalia only when security has improved so that they can work
safely.
</P>
<P>
A group called "the Lions of West Baidoa" has been sending
threatening letters to foreign relief agencies working in the
town.
</P>
<P>
Little progress has been made in the negotiations on national
reconciliation between Gen. Mohamed Farah Aideed, Chairman of the
Somali National Alliance, who controls southern Mogadishu, and
his arch rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of the Somali Salvation
Alliance and self-styled President of Somalia, who occupies
northern Mogadishu. Both of them have declared that they are
going ahead with their own national conference to establish a
government.
</P>
<P>
"Somalia could disintegrate if a government of national unity
was not established within three months," Ali Mahdi Mohamed said
at a press conference in his stronghold in Mogadishu on April 15.
</P>
<P>
"If the Somalis fail to establish a government, the country
will end up in clan-ruled emirates which is much more
disastrous," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two most powerful faction leaders in Somalia have avoided
an all-out war after the pullout of the UN peacekeeping forces
from the Horn of Africa country on March 2 by agreeing to jointly
run the Mogadishu seaport and airport. A committee for the joint
management of the seaport was set up later and the facility
opened to business on March 9. Trade boomed in March and April.
</P>
<P>
The joint management of the airport remains a problem,
however. Different militia groups have carved the airport into a
mosaic of clan "turfs". They have even parceled out sections of
the runway. No planes have landed since the UN peacekeepers
abandoned it early March.
</P>
<P>
Tension is mounting along the Green Line of bombedout
buildings, which divides the capital into the south and the north
respectively for the followers of Gen. Aideed and self-styled
President Ali Mahdi. Heavily-armed militiamen can be seen
milling on both sides of the Green Line.
</P>
<P>
Osman Hassan Ali Atto, a right-hand man and major financier of
Gen. Aideed, has split from Aideed. Reports say this is mainly
because of the "hard line" of the general. Atto complained to
reporters on May 9: "Gen. Aideed wants to isolate Somalia from
the rest of the world."
</P>
<P>
Atto has recently appealed to the faction of Aideed's arch
rival Ali Mahdi for peace. However, observers believe the
split between Aideed and Atto, who is also a powerful Habre
Gedir militia leader, could possibly add fuel to the
hostilities between Gen. Aideed and Ali Mahdi.

<HEADLINE> Progress Reported in Research of Chinese Nation's Origin in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientific methods have proved that
Yuanmou Man, the origin of the chinese nation, lived about 1.7
million years ago and 35 pieces of stone implements have been
found, according to a recent international symposium.
</P>
<P>
Traces of Yuanmou Man were found in 1965 at Shangnabang Village
in Yuanmou of southwest China's Yunnan Province and the discovery
points to China's southwest as an important region of man's origin
and evolution.
</P>
<P>
According to the meeting on palaeoanthropology, since the
discovery of the Yuanmou Man 30 years ago, China has made great
progress in this research field.
</P>
<P>
In September, 1984, a group of archaeologists unearthed another
piece of neck bone fossil of Yuanmou Man, which dates back to more
than one million years ago in the pleistocence epoch.
</P>
<P>
And in recent years, other traces of ancient man were also
found in Kaiyuan and Lufeng county of the province, indicating
Yuanmou is the origin of the Chinese Nation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the invaluable discoveries, Chinese archaeologists
said, they need further data and evidence on Yuanmou Man in order
to perfect their research.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Sino-U.S. relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that it is all the more
imperative for China and the United states to maintain a healthy
and stable relationship at a time when the world is undergoing
profound changes.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the Asia Society's Sixth International
corporate conference, Qian said that both countries are
shouldering great and unshirkable responsibilities for the future
of the world and the destiny of mankind, and playing an important
role in handling and solving major international issues.
</P>
<P>
Given the wide-ranging complementarity between the two
economies, he said the development of mutually beneficial economic
cooperation and trade between the two countries not only serves
the common interests, but also contributes to economic prosperity
in Asia-Pacific and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Noting progress made in Sino-U.S. relations in the past one
year and more, Qian said that the high level contacts between
high-ranking officials have markedly increased, adding that the
two summits between leaders of the two countries in particular
have instilled new vitality for further improvement and
development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-US cooperation in the economic, trade, scientific and
technological and other fields has steadily expanded, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Vice-Premier said, owing to the difference in
the historical background, social system, values, cultural
tradition and level of economic development, the two countries do
have differences on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
This is nothing strange, he said, adding: "what is important is
that under the new situation we should discard the Cold-War
mentality, transcend the ideological differences and have a clear
understanding of the major common interests between our two
countries".
</P>
<P>
As for differences between the two countries, Qian said: "we
should try to address them properly through consultations in the
spirit of mutual respect, non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and seeking common
ground while putting aside differences.
</P>
<P>
"We should do everything to prevent them from hindering and
obstructing the improvement and development of our bilateral
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian viewed the Asia society as a U.S. non-governmental
organization for studies on Asia-related issues and exchanges with
asian countries, saying that it has done useful work to improve
Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that it will continue to do so in this regard," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Direct Foreign Investment in Pakistan Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investment in
Pakistan from July 1995 to March 1996 has doubled that of the
corresponding period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a press conference here today, Syed Mohibullah Shah,
secretary of Pakistan's Board of Investment (BOI), said that a
total of 640 million US dollar foreign investment has flowed into
Pakistan in the first nine months of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He said the direct foreign investment in the country is
expected to reach one billion US dollars by the end of the current
fiscal year ending in June.
</P>
<P>
It would be a landmark in Pakistan's investment history, said
the BOI official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during the 1980s before the Pakistani government
started to implement strategic plans aimed at attracting foreign
investment, the annual foreign capital flow into the country was
only around 130 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the BOI official, about 75 percent of the total
foreign investment has gone to the fields of oil and gas, power
generation, chemical industry, automobile and light industry as
well as food and agro-related industries.
</P>
<P>
Due to successful marketing, he said, Pakistan has drawn
attention of some non-traditional investors to the country, such
as Japan, the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the portfolio investment in the current fiscal
year has dropped to less than half of that in the last fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
On realization of memoranda of understanding (MOU) signed by
both private sector and various ministries of the government, he
said 70 percent of them are moving satisfactorily while the rest
is progressing not as smoothly as it should be.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will adopt new measures to attract more
foreign investment in the shipping, chemical and agro-related
industries. The government will also support and encourage private
investment in manpower training.

<HEADLINE> Energy Cost Pushes U.S. Consumer Prices Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in the United
States climbed 0.4 percent in April as energy costs jumped by the
largest amount in more than five years, U.S. Labor Department
reportd today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the increase of consumer prices was
pushed by the surge in gasoline and other energy products which
accounted for three-fifths of the total advance last month.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, gasoline costs were up by 5.3 percent
in April after an increase of 3.7 percent in March. Costs for
home heating oil, natural gas and electricity also showed big
increases.
</P>
<P>
For April alone, energy costs jumped 3.2 percent, the biggest
one-month rise since October 1990.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, energy prices, which actually fell in 1995,
have been rising at an annual rate of nearly 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food prices climbed 0.3 percent in April, representing a
slowing after a 0.5 percent increase in March.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that excluding the volatile energy and food
sectors, the so-called core rate of inflation climbed a much more
modest 0.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government said in the report that the 0.4 percent
April advance matched the March rise and left consumer prices so
far this year increasing at an annual rate of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
While that is much higher than last year's 2.5 percent
increase, which was the best showing in nine years, economists
have stressed that there are no signs that the surge in energy
prices threatens to spill over into other parts of the economy.
</P>
<P>
A survey of gasoline stations last week showed that the rise of
prices in gasoline stations had slowed to less than half the rates
reported in March and April. U.S. business leaders also predicted
that the surging of energy prices would be short-lived.

BRUSSELS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Council today
expressed "deep concern" over the humanitarian crisis caused by
the factional fighting in the Liberian capital Monrovia and
condemned the violence against civilians and the harassment of aid
operations.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Council said that while it appreciated the
enormous efforts made by neighboring countries to assist the
hundreds of thousands of Liberian refugees, it deplored the fact
that thousands of Liberians are still crammed in precarious
conditions on ships in search of friendly ports.
</P>
<P>
The Council appealed to neighboring countries in West Africa to
give at least temporary shelter to the victims of the Liberian
civil war.
</P>
<P>
It expressed willingness to give humanitarian aid and to cover
the cost of the most urgent needs of the Liberian refugees and the
countries that help them.
</P>
<P>
The Council urged all the Liberian factions to stop fighting
and to put the peace process back on track in order to avoid
inflicting further suffering upon the Liberian people.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expresses Satisfactory over Conclusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' President Glafcos
Clerides described here today as "very satisfactory" the
conclusion of Monday's meeting of the European Union (EU)
Council of Ministers in view of the Cyprus-EU Association
Council which meets in Brussels today.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he was briefed on the EU Council
of Ministers' decision by Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides who
is currently in Brussels to attend EU-Cyprus Association Council
meeting, but he noted that as he has not seen the full
text yet he could not comment on it any further.
</P>
<P>
The President also confirmed that he will attend the EU
summit in Florence, Italy, in June.
</P>
<P>
According to government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides today,
during the EU Council of Ministers' meeting, a compromise was
reached between Greece and the other 14 EU member states who
had held the view that Cyprus-EU accession discussion should be
linked to Turkey's customs union agreement.
</P>
<P>
The 14 states abandoned their view partly due to Greece's
softening of its position on the EU Meda program, which
provides financial aid to 12 of the EU's neighbors bordering
the Mediterranean, including Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said that despite the difficulties faced, Cyprus'
accession to the EU is not threatened, the process of EU accession
requires a lot of consistent hard work.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for full EU membership in July 1990. It
signed an association agreement with the European Community in
1972 and a customs union agreement in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council of Ministers decided on March 6, 1995 to
start accession talks with Cyprus six months after the EU
Intergovernmental Conference.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets US Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the National
People's Congress Standing Committee, Qiao Shi, said here today
that China has had good results in macro-economic controls in
finance and in reforming the financial system over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came during a meeting with a delegation from the
European Advisory Board of the US's Fuji-Wolfensohn International
Inc. here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
When inflation seemed to be getting worse in the first half of
1993, the Chinese government decided to strengthen controls in
finance, adopt a strict monetary policy, and increase reforms of
its financial system, Qiao said, noting that the results had been
good.
</P>
<P>
The financial reforms will continue in the present direction,
Qiao said, adding that China will do a better job in economic
development and in economic system reforms, in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The chairman went on to say that many members of the delegation
are old friends of China and prominent bankers, with a good
understanding of China. He expressed the hope that they will make
suggestions on China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation between China and the US, Japan, and
Europe has had rapid growth over the past several years, but there
are great resources yet to be tapped, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the board of Wolfensohn, Paul Volcker, who is
leading the delegation, voiced his admiration of China's measures
in bank supervision, controlling inflation, and promoting economic
growth. Volcker, who is former chairman of the US Federal Reserve,
said that he was much impressed by China's development and
American enterprises have had more chances to cooperate in China.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that the European Advisory Board of
Fuji-Wolfensohn has decided to hold its 1996 meeting here in
Beijing for the first time, to gain a better understanding of
China's economic and financial progress.
</P>
<P>
The members of the delegation include Toru Hashimoto, president
of Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd, former Australian Prime Minister Robert
Hawke, former British Foreign Secretary Geoffery Howe, and former
UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales in U.S. Down 0.3 percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in U.S. declined by
0.3 percent in April, the first drop in five months, the U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that sales totaled 203.9 billion
U.S. dollars last month, down from a revised 204.5 billion in
March, mainly because the purchases of automobile fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
The revised figure in March showed that the retail sales in the
month advanced by 0.5 percent, much stronger than the department's
initial estimate of 0.1 percent. It surged by 2.1 percent in
February, the steepest in almost three years.
</P>
<P>
The April decline was the first since sales fell 0.2 percent
last October while many analysts had expected a slight increase.
But sales in April were 6 percent higher than they were a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods fell 2.1 percent after jumping 1.2
percent in March and 3.3 percent in February. Auto sale, about
one-fourth of the total retail sales, reported a 2.5 percent drop
following a 0.7 percent increase in March.
</P>
<P>
But nondurable sales posted a 0.9 percent increase on top of
March's 0.1 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales are an important gauge of the U.S. economy, since
they represent one-half of consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe that retail sales growth will be modest
this year, in part because of the debt consumers have piled up
recently. But that belief is tempered by reports of rising wages
that could offset the debt burden.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor

breakaway republic of Chechnya will make "a certain progress"
later this week.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting today of the state commission in charge of

Chechen authorities and to fix the date of the meeting in the

</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said law-enforcement agencies and special task
force units had foiled plans by Chechen rebels to stage major
disturbances during the May holidays.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would sign a resolution in the next few
days to allocate funds for Chechnya which would include a budget
for the operations of law-enforcement agencies there.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, U.S., Japan to Persuade DPRK to Accept Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea, the United States and
Japan agreed Tuesday to continue efforts to persuade the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to accept "four-party
talks" on a peace treaty for the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement at the end of a two-day policy
coordination meeting, policymakers from the three countries said
they shared the view that the convening of four-party talks is the
"most practicable means for replacing the current armistice
agreement with a permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula."
</P>
<P>
The four-party talks, proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton
and South Korean president Kim Young Sam last month, would involve
the DPRK, South Korea, the U.S. and China.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, on South Korea's southern island of Cheju, the
U.S. and Japan also ruled out immediate food aid to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord told a joint
press conference after the meeting: "We have no plans at this
point for additional rice aid to North Korea (the DPRK) or further
easing of economic sanctions on North Korea."
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no change in the U.S. position, which is
that the future of the Korean Peninsula must be worked out between
South Korea and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"We will not talk about peace separately with North
Korea ... although we would like to improve relations with it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Yanai Shunji told the press
conference that his government has "no plans to extend new food
assistance" to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Chung Tae-ik stressed that
"once the four-party talks are realized, all of those issues
including economic cooperation with North Korea will be discussed."
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the three countries said that the Cheju
meeting served as "a very useful and constructive forum" to
discuss the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to hold their next meeting in Japan within the next
few months.

<HEADLINE> 17 Pct of EU Beaches Below Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen percent of the beaches
in European Union countries do not meet the EU's bathing water
requirements, according to a report published today by the
European Commission.
</P>
<P>
The report said that more than 3,000 of the 18,000 bathing
areas surveyed from the Mediterranean to the Baltic either do not
meet the EU's water quality standards or are not sufficiently
monitored to be know whether they comply or not.
</P>
<P>
Inland waters, said the report, are "particularly disquieting"
with more than 1,700 bathing areas, or 30 percent of the total,
not meeting the minimum standars of water quality.
</P>
<P>
A European Commission Directive, adopted in 1975, says that all
member states should have ensured by 1986 that their bathing
waters are in compliance with the requirements set out in the
directive.
</P>
<P>
But the report noted: "Today, 10 years after the deadline, no
member state has complied fully with the Directive."

<HEADLINE> Investigatory Group Looking Into Qingdao "Waste" Case (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A joint investigatory group has
arrived in this coastal city in east China's Shandong Province to
begin a massive in-depth probe into the imported-American-garbage
incident.
</P>
<P>
The 12 members of the group come from the State Bureau of
Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Public Security, the
State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the General
Administration of Customs, and five other departments.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court has also joined the joint effort to
speed things up, an indication that the Chinese attach great
importance to the case.
</P>
<P>
An official with the group says that their job is to get a
thorough picture of the seriousness of the case as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He noted that shipping such a large amount of waste to China
showed that there are a small number of businessmen unscrupulous
enough to stop at nothing to make money, and that the U.S. took
China as a place where they could dump their garbage.
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized that facts have shown that the garbage
exporting country have the most to gain, while the importing
country, the most to lose.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Environmental Protection has reported that,
according to international environmental protection agreements,
the U.S. exported waste to China illegally.
</P>
<P>
The case has aroused a great deal of concern in Beijing and
Qingdao and anger about those who are responsible.

LONDON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- British Aerospace (BAe) and Matra of
France, the two major defense industry groups, have agreed to
merge their missile businesses to create Europe's largest missile
producing company.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached on Monday after three years'

</P>
<P>
Although a BAe spokesman is quoted as saying that the merged
business would be more effective in cometing for missile
contracts, local analysts say that the aim of the merger is to
match the leading American missils makers Hughes and Raytheon.

<P>
FREETOWN, May 14 (Xinhua)-- The Nigerian registered vessel ''
Victory Reefer'' chartered by the West African Peacekeeping Force
(ECOMOG ) docked at 1300 hours gmt Tuesday after the Sierra
Leonean authorities gave permission for the ship to enter the
Queen Elizabeth, the second quay in the east end of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The vessel, with 1500 passengers on board fleeing the civil
war in Liberia, arrived on Sunday but was refused permission to
dock until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Relief agencies officials mounted an emergency assistance unit
to give food water and drugs to some of the sick passengers.
Immigration officials said screening of the passengers will start
in about an hour's time at 1500 hours. They confirmed that the
number of passengers is 1,500, majority of them are Sierra
Leoneans.
</P>
<P>
Many of them have left Sierra Leone as long as 14 to 20 years
undertaking business enterprises there, one immigration
official said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
According to the captain of the vessel, Albanian Born Baci
Qeramedin, the Sierra Leoneans on board were approved and
certified by the Sierra Leone diplomatic mission in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed earlier reports that he was threatened by the
refugees ''at some stages because they were becoming desperate
and wanted to disembark.''.
</P>
<P>
He accused the (Sierra Leone) ''authorities of delaying ''too
much to assist their own citizens which i don't think was good.''
</P>
<P>
Many of the passengers looked weak and dehydrated while
children were mostly malnourished.
</P>
<P>
They were cramped up like sardines, many wearing tattered
clothes while some were with only vests. Many of them were
without shoeless and looked dazed.
</P>
<P>
One of the passengers, Cecilia Dixon swho had been in Monrovia
for close to two years said, '' I shall kiss the soil when i get
out. It's good to be back after such scary moments.''
</P>

A 10 year old siatta parker could not help but cry. ''I cant

<HEADLINE> International Observers Arrive In Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- An advanced group of 32
Norwegian observers arrived in Hebron, West Bank, this morning to
exercise their duty there.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the Israeli government and
the Palestinian Authority, international observers have been
invited to be present in Hebron during and after Israel's
redeployment from the West Bank city. Their main task is to create
a sort of peaceful atmosphere so as to make the 450 Jewish
settlers and some 100,000 Palestinian residents in the city to
live in peace.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern Godal arrived in Israel
Monday for talks with his Israeli counterpart Ehud Barak on the
role and mandate of the international observers.
</P>
<P>
A Norwegian coordinator said today that observers from Denmark,
Italy, Turkey, Australia and Sweden will soon arrive to join the
Norwegian team.
</P>
<P>
The observers will be headquartered at the northern entrance
to the city and are expected to begin patrol Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Israel agreed on the deployment of
international observers in Hebron presumably to show the
Palestinians its intent on ultimate redeployment from the city,
just as the Temporary International Presence in Hebron was
deployed shortly after the 1994 Massacre.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Hebron was a key sticking point in the Israel-PLO
talks on expanding Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians initially demanded that Israel withdraw its
troops from all of Hebron, but later agreed that some Israeli
soldiers stay to guard isolated pockets of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Israel wanted to retain broader control, keeping troops in most
of the city as well as along access roads.

<HEADLINE> Increase in State Development Bank Loans To West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 14 (Xinhua)-- The State Development Bank of China
will provide 54.7 billion yuan in loans this year to central and
west China to fuel local economic development.
</P>
<P>
The loans account for 71.6 percent of the bank's preliminarily
planned quota for 1996 set by the central bank, said SDB president
Yao Zhenyan here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to Yao, SDB loans for central and western parts of
China have been increasing since the national "policy-oriented"
bank was opened in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The bank made a total of 53.5 billion yuan in loans to these
areas in 1994 and the volume climbed to 58.4 billion yuan in 1995,
accounting for 67 percent of SDB's credit that year.
</P>
<P>
In helping less-developed economies in those areas, the central
government has launched a group of large capital projects there in
recent years, including building an automotive base, a
hydro-electric power plant, and a chemical fertilizer plant in
Hubei Province, in addition to the multi-billion yuan Three-Gorge
Dam construction.
</P>
<P>
In southwestern Sichuan and northwestern Shaanxi provinces,
state key projects under construction include the Ertan
hydro-electric power station, the Baoji-Chengdu multi-track
railway, and the expansion project of the Panzhihua Iron and Steel
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
For smoother switching of funds to the projects, SDB opened a
branch in Wuhan, capital city of Hubei Province, and
representative offices in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi and Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan.

<HEADLINE> Black Box of Crashed DC-9 Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Searchers has found one of the
two "black boxes" on the ValuJet DC-9 that crashed in the
Everglades swamp near Miami on Saturday, providing the hope for
the first substantial clues to the cause of the crash that killed
109 people.
</P>
<P>
A police diver wading through the swamp stumbled upon the
flight data recorder late Monday afternoon, the National
Transportation Safety Board said.
</P>
<P>
The data recorder was covered with water to preserve it,
stashed in a cooler and flown to Washington Monday night for
immediate examination.
</P>
<P>
The device could hold vital information in 11 key areas,
including the plane's air speed, vertical acceleration, pitch
altitude, and engine parameters just before it slammed into the
Florida Everglades, a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
official said.
</P>
<P>
Recovery crews planned to continue the search on Tuesday for
the cockpit voice recorder that may hold the flight crew's final
words.
</P>
<P>
They found the jet's two engines and small pieces of debris in
the alligator-infested waters about 15 miles (24 kilometers)
northwest of Miami. They also recovered 30 to 40 body parts on
Monday from the grisly scene, and the search will continue
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eighty homicide detectives including 30 divers were assigned to
the recovery effort. In teams of 10, they donned bio-hazard suits
and waded into the chest-deep muck, using their hands and "feeling
around with their feet" for anything from the Saturday crash, NTSB
Vice Chairman Robert Francis said.
</P>
<P>
The plane plunged into the Everglades after taking off from
Miami International Airport for Atlanta on Saturday afternoon. The
pilot's final words to the air traffic controllers were to request
the location of the nearest airport, Francis said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Executive Vows to Help Gansu More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- M. Brown, vice-president of the
World Bank (WB) visited northwest China's Gansu Province over the
weekend to see how things are going with WB-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
This was Brown's first visit to China since he took the
post. He examined a water conservation project in Yongdeng County
that is expected to help 300,000 farmers in Gansu's dry areas and
had a first-hand look at farmer's living condition in
poverty-stricken Yongjin county.
</P>
<P>
The WB has sent more than 30 delegations here and has promised
440 million US dollars in loans since it established relationship
with the province in 1980.
</P>
<P>
With the help of a WB loan, the province has introduced science
and technology from foreign countries, helping many farmers to
escape poverty and improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
The bank executive visited poor farmers who are to move out of
the Gansu Corridor under another WB-related project.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank will give priority to Gansu in
considering the recipients of its loans because Gansu's living
standard is below China's average.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is quite satisfied with the development of
WB-funded projects in China, and will take applications for
another group of projects in Gansu to Washington.

<HEADLINE> Farewell to Smokes in Beijing's Public Places (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow will mark the start of
hard times for more than two million smokers in the Chinese
capital, when public places just say "no" to smoking tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
A local smoking ban will go into effect tomorrow, and "No
smoking" signs and admonitory slogans will be seen on major
streets, at busy shopping areas, and in public places in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Some 80,000 people will go to the areas to enforce the ban
tomorrow, stopping and fining offenders.
</P>
<P>
The ban was passed by the Municipal People's Congress, the
local legislative body, last December, and has gained wide
support, although half the adult males are still smoking, and the
number of women and teenagers who puff is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
A massive publicity campaign backed by media coverage was begun
several years ago to make people aware of the adverse effects of
smoking and to encourage them to stop.
</P>
<P>
Of course, chewing gum companies have been eager to take the
opportunity to cash in, collecting money that used to be used to
support the habit.
</P>
<P>
Different types of gum began appearing and being heavily
advertised in recent times, selling themselves as "good
companions" to those who want to kick the habit.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of 9,408 citizens found that about 94 percent
endorsed the ban, because they believe that smoking not only harms
smokers' health but also that of people nearby.
</P>
<P>
Officials, government employees, medical personnel, and
teachers have taken the lead in the fight against smoking,
according to the Beijing Patriotic Public Health Campaign
Committee, headquarters of the anti-smoking drive, and about 500
schools, hospitals, department stores, and other units have
adopted measures to become "smoke-free units", according to the
committee.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Belarus to Form Bloc If NATO Expands: Grachev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Belarus may have to form
a military bloc if NATO embarks on its proposed enlargement toward
the east, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev warned today.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Minsk are ready for certain moves in response to
NATO's eastward expansion, he told a press conference after
meeting Belarussian Defense Minister Leonid Maltsev, with whom he
signed accords to boost military ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Grachev said that Russia and Belarus will cooperate to ensure
regional security through a build-up of their armed forces if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister said that Moscow is closely
following the possible admission of Poland and Lithuania into NATO.
</P>
<P>
"Their speedy NATO membership will create a certain
inconvenience for Russia as far as Kaliningrad is concerned. We
would not expect to be cut off from the Kaliningrad special
defense district by NATO countries," Grachev said.
</P>
<P>
Kaliningrad is a Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea bordered by
Poland and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
"If our opinion is not taken into account by the NATO
leadership, the armed forces in western Russia can be strengthened
as a military response," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, Russian defense ministry
officials have also held meetings with senior military officials
from Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. It did not say when
and where the meetings took place.

<HEADLINE> Seven West African States To Form Customs Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- West Africa's bid of regional
economic integration got a new incentive today as seven of the
sub-region's 16 countries decided to form a customs union.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken today by leaders of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) which groups Benin, Burkina
Faso, Cote D'Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo in
Quagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
''This is part of our plan of two-speed West Africa and we are
sure that it will give a major boost to the economic integration
process in the region,'' said an UEMOA spokesman, quoted by the
final communique which reached here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, all the customs levies among the
seven French-speaking West African states will be removed and a
common external tariff applied from January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
And goods produced within the union containing 60 percent of
local raw materials will be tax exempted starting from July 1
this year. This will run for 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also decided that a joint investment code be
implemented by December 31, 1997 and that their law on foreign
trade be harmonized.
</P>
<P>
The UEMOA, in place since January 1, 1995, comprised of all of
France's former West African colonies except Guinea and aimed at
promoting the free movement of people, goods and capital among
the member states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UEMOA states are also members of the larger
Economic Community of West African states formed by all the 16
countries in the West African region.
</P>
<P>
They are Nigeria, Niger, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana,
Benin, Cote D'Ivoir, Senegal, Togo, Liberia, Sierra Leone,
Mauritania, Gambia, Cape Verde and Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The world's poorest region has now realized the urgency of
stepping up regional cooperation which is the only way to for
them to shake off poverty and promote long-term economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Farewell to Smokes in Beijing's Public Places (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Banning smoking from public places is vital to creating a
civilized image for Beijing, because it's China's capital and an
international city," explained Tao Xiping, vice-chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"I think the ban is good because it will help provide a good
model for youngsters," Huang Jingping, a law professor at People's
University, said on TV today.
</P>
<P>
However, one veteran of years of smoking said, "Maybe I'll quit
smoking in future. But, I promise not to smoke in public places
from now on.".
</P>
<P>
Chinese health departments and experts have repeatedly warned
that the country would lose more economically if it allowed the
tobacco industry to grow too rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in 1993 showed that China collected 30 billion yuan
in revenues from cigarette manufacturers, but suffered 65 billion
yuan in losses caused by smoking-related diseases and deaths.
</P>
<P>
For ordinary people, it may not be too difficult to make a
choice between smoking and health, but the tobacco industry, which
employs 500,000 people and has 20 million tobacco growers, not to
mention its 350 million customers, is facing a problem.
</P>
<P>
But some industry watchers believe that local smoking bans will
affect the industry little, and, in order to lessen the harm to
human health, the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau has urged domestic
manufacturers to lower tar content of cigarettes in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can simply avoid contradiction between
smoking and health," said Wang Ping, manager of the Beijing
Cigarette Factory.
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing now is to try our best to develop and
produce low-tar cigarettes, which will lessen the harm to smokers'
health," he added.

<HEADLINE> Senior Law-maker on Revisions of Five Draft Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Xue Ju, chairman of the Law
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said here today
that the committee had suggestions on five draft laws and detailed
revisions.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, the 19th meeting of the NPC Standing
Committee deliberated on the following laws: Statistics,
Prevention and Control of Water Pollution, Lawyers, Vocational
Education, and Application of Scientific and Technological Results.
</P>
<P>
Most of the committee members think the time is ripe for the
legislature to put the drafts into law, according to Xue.
</P>
<P>
The Law Committee called for a more scientific statistics
system with better data and more supervision. Those who use
statistics or data for self promotion will be punished, Xue said.
</P>
<P>
The committee worked out stipulations saying that enterprises
and government institutions emitting waste water above state
standards must work out treatment plans and report them to the
government.
</P>
<P>
Those causing serious water pollution are subject to penalties,
and central and provincial governments must enforce water
pollution controls along rivers.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised draft of Law on Lawyers, judicial
departments, not lawyers' associations, have the right to punish
the illegal activities of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The revised draft law on scientific results provides for
greater punishment for those seeking benefit by fraudulent means.
</P>
<P>
In the field of vocational education, many members of the
Standing Committee oppose it in primary schools, saying the move
might harm the state's compulsory education program.
</P>
<P>
Xue Ju also provided explanations on implementing the
Nationality Law in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> New UN Envoy to Visit Cyprus Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The new United Nations special
representative for Cyprus, Han Sung-joo, former foreign minister
of Republic of Korea, will visit Cyprus in the first week of
June, it was confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides told reporters that
the confirmation was made by spokesman of the U.N. Peace-Keeping
Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) Waldemar Rokoszewski during a meeting
with him earlier today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cyprus News Agency Monday, Han said he
would visit Cyprus in the first week of June. He also expects to
visit other capitals including Athens. He will first stop in New
York to confer with U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
It will be his first visit to the area since taking up his
duties two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali last month announced the appointment of Han Sung-
joo as his special representative for Cyprus, effective on May 1,
to succeed former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark who has served
as special representative for Cyprus since May of 1993. Clark
failed to bring the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides closer to a
settlement during his three-year term.
</P>
<P>
Han, 55, foreign minister of Republic of Korea in 1993-94, is
currently professor of political science and president of the

<HEADLINE> International Observers Arrive In Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- An advanced group of 32
Norwegian observers arrived in Hebron, West Bank, this morning to
exercise their duty there.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the Israeli government and
the Palestinian Authority, international observers have been
invited to be present in Hebron during and after Israel's
redeployment from the West Bank city. Their main task is to create
a sort of peaceful atmosphere so as to make the 450 Jewish
settlers and some 100,000 Palestinian residents in the city to
live in peace.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjoern Godal arrived in Israel
Monday for talks with his Israeli counterpart Ehud Barak on the
role and mandate of the international observers.
</P>
<P>
A Norwegian coordinator said today that observers from Denmark,
Italy, Turkey, Australia and Sweden will soon arrive to join the
Norwegian team.
</P>
<P>
The observers will be headquartered at the northern entrance
to the city and are expected to begin patrol Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Israel agreed on the deployment of
international observers in Hebron presumably to show the
Palestinians its intent on ultimate redeployment from the city,
just as the Temporary International Presence in Hebron was
deployed shortly after the 1994 Massacre.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Hebron was a key sticking point in the Israel-PLO
talks on expanding Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians initially demanded that Israel withdraw its
troops from all of Hebron, but later agreed that some Israeli
soldiers stay to guard isolated pockets of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
Israel wanted to retain broader control, keeping troops in most
of the city as well as along access roads.

<HEADLINE> Anglo-French Relations At Their Best: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Britain and France
have been at their best over the past 50 years, but the two
countries have different views on European integration, British
Prime Minister John Major told a French newspaper in an interview
published today.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with Le Figaro before French President Jacques
Chirac's three-day visit to Britain beginning Tuesday, Major said
that Britain's defense cooperation with France is closer than with
any other country.
</P>
<P>
Britain and France were also in agreement on a common foreign
policy for the European Union (EU), he said, although he added
that such a policy should be adopted unanimously, not by majority
vote among EU member-countries.
</P>
<P>
Major acknowledged that the two countries have different views
on European monetary union and the social policies of an
increasingly integrated Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said that Britain would not join the EU's proposed single
currency and there were no "if" or "buts" about it.
</P>
<P>
Britain would not support "foolish" aspects of integration and
the excessive centralization of power, he said, but nor would
Britain oppose European integration, he added.

<HEADLINE> China States Basic Stance On Global Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MIDRAND (South Africa), May 14 (Xinhua) -- China today urges
the ISAD to make the objective ''global sharing'' more vivid and
concrete with the integration of developed and developing
countries in laying out plans for global informatization.
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made by Hu Qili, Minister of Electronics
Industry and head of the Chinese delegation to the conference, at
the ministerial meeting of the International Conference on
Information Society and Development (ISAD) in Midrand, north of
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mr. Hu said China agreed in principle with the
views expressed in the main theme document of the conference,
which represented an important step towards global
informatization.
</P>
<P>
On the topic of the joint promotion of global
information by the developed and developing countries, Hu
emphasized that special attention should be paid to full use of
the strength of each country, otherwise, the global
informatization would be only a fantasy or a goodwill considering
the inadequate information resources and economic backwardness in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration the uniqueness of each country in
terms of politic, economy, culture and history, he pointed out
that no single informatization model could be directly suited for
all countries.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the bilateral, multilateral and
multi-regional cooperation between the developed and developing
countries should be encouraged in the construction of
information, research and development, application of information
technologies and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that global informatization is a long and
arduous process, the minister proposed that each country bring
its own advantages into full play in order to promote global
participation and the early realization of global sharing.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Mr. Hu stressed conditions and opportunities
should be actively created to further bilateral, multilateral and
inter-governmental dialogues and exchanges to promote mutual
understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
And in this process, the developed countries should take
concrete actions to transfer funds and technologies, such as
carrying out model experiments in developing countries, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the international financial organizations should
also be mobilized to coordinate with different governments and
enterprises in raising funds to support the construction of
global informatization.
</P>
<P>
More than 1000 delegates from about 50 countries around the
world attended the three-day ISAD conference started on Monday.

<P>
"It is very important that my regular consultations with the

<HEADLINE> German's Acknowledgement of IPR Success in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The former bureau chief of the
German patent office, Erich Hausser, said here today that China's
system of protecting intellectual property rights (IPR) over the
past 15 years has been "a kind of miracle".
</P>
<P>
Between 1976 and 1995, while serving as the top German patent
bureau official, Hausser contributed much to the development of
IPR awareness in China. China and Germany signed a "Promoting
Patent Work in China" agreement, based on his proposal, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Hausser is one of six foreign experts and scientists who were
recognized for their contributions to China's science and
technology, agricultural development and IPR protection and
awarded prizes here today. "It's an exciting experience to watch
the development of the system of IPR in China," he remarked at a
ceremony in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China enacted the trademark law in 1983 and the patent law in
1985.
</P>
<P>
"It's a perfect legal system of protection of IPR", he said,
pointing out that the country has achieved in just over a decade
what developed countries have taken dozens of years to do.
</P>
<P>
"You can admit me as a witness for the development of IPR in
China," he said, explaining that Sino-German cooperation was "very
successful."
</P>
<P>
"During a remakably short time of only 13 or 14 years, they
have developed a structure to enforce IPR protection," he said,
pointing out that laws have been amended and implemented, courses
on IPR established, and lawyers and judges trained.
</P>
<P>
Because of a Sino-German patent exchange program, 399 Chinese
were sent to Germany for training by 1993, and Germany has
provided China's patent office with 13 million deutsch marks'
worth of equipment and automated facilities.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, he said that there is no perfect
IPR protection system in the world, including in Europe and
America, and that developed countries should provide developing
countries with aid in IPR.

<HEADLINE> Prostitutes Residence Attacked In South Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU,May 14 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed after a
bomb was thrown at a residence owned by women who sold their
bodies in Bar Ubah junction of South Mogadishu yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitness at the scene, the bomb was thrown by
two men who were suspected to be an Islamic fundamentalists. The
naked bodies of a couple allegedly having an affair inside the
residence were thrown outside the building.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the deceased couple, a middle aged boy and a
girl, were lying in the street for more than eight hours as angry
villagers who several times protested against the prostitution
acts in te area, have refused the burial of the bodies. Streams
of children, women and men have gathered at the scene to see what
is going on and every one has cursed the bodies.
</P>
<P>
The crowd of people has also annihilated dozens of balm and
sacks made kiosks. They also shouted religious words even though
no single Islamic institution is active in South Mogadishu
controlled by General Mohamed Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
There is no orgnization so far that claimed the responsibility
of the attack.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a prostitutes residence attacked in the
almost 100 percent Muslim country of the Horn of Africa. Prior to
the late dictator's regime in Somalia, the prostitutes have had
their official business cards. However, Siad Barre's regime had
banned the practice. Like wise the gunmem, benefiting from the
lawlessness in the country, the prostitutes are gaining more
popularity.

<HEADLINE> China Curbs Loss of State Property </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China has effectively brought the
loss of state property under control, the State Administration of
State Property (SASP) announced at an ongoing national meeting
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Zhigang, deputy director of the state property watchdog,
said that 160 confidential reports by the public enabled the
authorities to prevent losses of state property worth 1.5 billion
yuan (about 178 million US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that better legislation and the efforts to
categorize, appraise and register state assets as well as the
public's increasing awareness of the seriousness of the problem
have combined to help curb the hemorrhaging of state property.
</P>
<P>
A press release quoted official data as saying that assets
appraised by the SASP between 1989 and last year were worth 2.2
trillion yuan, a rise of nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that in the past state property was often lost in the
process of establishing Sino-foreign joint ventures, restructuring
state-owned enterprises into joint-stock companies, and selling
and leasing firms.
</P>
<P>
Loss of state property may reduce the share of state property
in the overall size of all social properties, causing very serious
consequences, Zhu warned, adding that state-owned enterprises
currently account for more than 65 percent of the value of
property held by all enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The SASP said that China's market economy drive has accelerated
the increase in the value of state property, from an average
annual rate of 12.4 percent in the years since 1949 to 14.5
percent since 1980 and 17.9 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that China's state property is now
valued at 5.192 trillion yuan (about 618 billion US dollars), up
from a mere 20 billion yuan when the People's Republic of China
was founded in 1949.

<HEADLINE> Two New Zealand Climbers Feared Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Two New Zealand climbers who had
spent more than three days near the summit of Mount Qomolangma
were feared dead, according to official reports and messages
relayed from the Qomolangma base camp.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali Tourism Ministry said Tuesday that one of them was
36-year-old Robert Hall, leader of an international friendship
expedition to the world's highest summit from the Nepali side.
</P>
<P>
He was earlier reported stranded just below the 8,848-meter
summit, which he had just scaled, but could neither come further
down nor be reached by the support team due to strong wind.
</P>
<P>
Hall's teammate Andrew Harris, also from New Zealand, had also
been missing since Friday after reaching the summit.
</P>
<P>
He was assumed having fallen down somewhere between the summit
and South Col, a pass about 8,000 meters above sea level which
leads to the summit.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Hall attempted to help American climber
Douglas Hansen to descend from the summit on Friday but both of
them failed to reach the last camp due to bad weather. Hansen
reportedly died later.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the base camp said one dead body had been seen on
the northern side above the South Col but identification was still
impossible.
</P>
<P>
A Tourism Ministry spokesman said that despite the rare chance
of finding any survivor, rescue efforts still continued with
searching by helicopters and Nepali mountaineers.

<HEADLINE> Clash Erupts between Israeli Forces, Guerrillas in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A minor clash erupted this morning
between Israeli forces and guerrillas of Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the Israeli self-claimed "security
zone" in south Lebanon, and one guerrilla was killed.
</P>
<P>
The clash came only a few hours before representatives from the
United States, France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon held their second
meeting in Washington to iron out their differences on the
formation of a proposed committee monitoring the cease-fire
understanding reached between Israeli forces and Hezbollah
guerrillas last month.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that the guerrillas
ambushed this morning an Israeli patrol on the road near the
village of Tallouseh, Marjayoun.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, claimed
responsibility for the operation.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite group announced in a statement that its fighters
attacked and damaged an Israeli Merkava tank in the Israeli
occupied enclave as the tank was bombarding the "liberated" areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another group of Hezbollah guerrillas attacked the
Israeli position at Sejoud with rockets and machine guns, causing
casualties and damages to Israeli side, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Tension in south Lebanon has escalated following Hezbollah
militants launched attacks Sunday on the Israeli forces in the
bordering buffer zone. Five Israeli soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, the Israeli forces resumed bombardment at
Iglim Al-Toffah (Province of Apple), a place often used by
Hezbollah's Shiite guerrillas to launch attacks on targets in
south Lebanon and northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The security sources said that the shelling was concentrated
on Jebal Rafih, Sejoud, Mahjoura, Loueizeh, Agmatta and Jebal
Rihan.
</P>
<P>
It is the third consecutive day of the Israeli bombardments at
the maintain area.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters also carried out two air raids targeting
Hezbollah bases in the area over the past two days. However, no
casualties were caused, according to the security sources.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes flew over the Lebanese capital Beirut around
10:55 a.m. (07:55 GMT) today and broke sound barrier to make
terrifying noises.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the monitoring committee's five member
states held the first meeting in Washington last Friday but failed
to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee is to be set up under the cease-fire
understanding reached on April 26, which ended 16 days of Israeli
military offensives in south Lebanon.

</P>
<P>
The world has become a large village and the public sector
could not carry out its duties in this regards without the
assistance of voluntary societies, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that democracy was the appropriate environment for
improving the conditions of rural women and stressed that peace
could prevail if that was to be achieved.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Clear up Property Market Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
decided to take steps to clear up speculation in the private
residential property market and tighten credit, particularly for
foreigners, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said at a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the aim "is to cool the temperature, stabilize
the market, and prevent prices from overshooting."
</P>
<P>
To this effect, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will
issue a directive to enforce the 80 percent financing limit on
mortgage loans, which the banks and other financial institutions
have been observing as a guideline since early this year, and to
restrict Singapore dollar loans to foreigners for the purchase of
residential properties in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
According to a government statement distributed at the press
conference, Permanent Residents (PRs) of Singapore will be limited
to one Singapore dollar loan each, to purchase a residential
property for owner-occupation only, while foreigners who are not
PRs and non-Singapore companies will not be granted Singapore
dollar loans to purchase residential properties.
</P>
<P>
The government will also introduce legislation to tax as income
of the gains from selling properties within three years of their
purchase, extend the existing stamp duties on sales of completed
properties, to cover all sales and sub-sales of uncompleted
properties, and impose an additional stamp duty, payable by the
seller, on sales of residential properties within three years of
purchase, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Prices of all categories of residential properties have risen
sharply in Singapore since 1992. Price increases were especially
steep in 1993 and the first quarter of 1994. In the first quarter
of this year, the private property index rose by 3.7 percent over
the previous quarter, while the latest statistics showed that
residential property prices were still rising.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government's view was that speculation in
residential property "is becoming excessive and unhealthy".
</P>
<P>
"While the rise in prices thus far largely reflects fundamental
factors, the present speculative frenzy risks pushing prices
beyond sustainable levels," the government said.
</P>
<P>
"We should check the overheating of the market before it
develops into a property bubble," the government emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Emperor's Tomb Guarded By Terra Cotta Warriors Excavated in Xuzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have begun
excavating an ancient tomb guarded by terra cotta warriors in
suburban Xuzhou, in east China's Jiangsu Province, according to a
report in China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The 117-metre-long, 13.2-metre-wide tomb was designed for an
emperor of the Western Han Dynasty nearly 2,200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the English language newspaper, experts have known
there was an important tomb at Lion Hill near Xuzhou since 1984,
when more than 4,000 life size terra cotta figures were discovered
there.
</P>

Xuzhou was the hometown of Emperor Liu Bang and capital of the
Chu State at that time.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have found three tombs guarded by clay
figures, the greatest of which is the tomb of Qinshihuang, the
first emperor of China, which is a short distance from the ancient
Chinese capital of Xi'an and has attracted much international
attention.
</P>
<P>
Clay figures were supposed to guard a dead king and ensure his
safe passage to the next world. According to the newspaper, the
most likely occupant of the crypt is Liu Wu who ruled for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, many artifacts have already been
found, including more than 4,000 jade pieces and some weapons,
most of which are made of bronze and are still surprisingly
sharp. The bones of the Chu king, are also in good shape.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the warriors in the Chu king's tomb
are only one-third of the size of the Qin figures.
</P>
<P>
"The tomb complex itself is a world-class exhibit," the
newspaper quoted Yuan Zhongyi, director of the Museum of the
Qinshihuang Terra Cotta Mausoleum. as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Deqin, director of the State Bureau of Cultural Relics,
said that the intricate structure and rich relics "make the tomb

<HEADLINE> FAO Report: Asia-Pacific Region Prone for Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific region is labeled
as "the most disaster-prone region in the world" in a report of
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
The FAO, based in Rome, Italy, released the report to
coordinate with the U.N. specialized agency's Asia-Pacific
regional conference opening Monday at Apia, Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports from Apia, the FAO blames
environmental degradation and rapidly rising population for much
of the Asia-Pacific region's natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
There were about 35 cyclones, floods, droughts or other natural
disasters a year in the Asia-Pacific region, or 60 percent of the
world's total, the FAO report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it noted, the region had eight out of ten of the
world's worst disasters, which caused most damages to the region's
agricultural and food systems.
</P>
<P>
The report called for improved preparedness for natural
disasters to avoid acute food shortages for the large populations
living in the region's disaster-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
As a preparation for the World Food Security conference to be
held in Rome in November, the ongoing FAO regional conference will
debate the report among its participants.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes US Think Twice Before Taking Moves Concerning IPR Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Sanctions or the threat to use them
will do no good to a settlement of the Intellectual Property Right
(IPR) issue between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Cui Tiankai, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, made the
statement here this afternoon at a press conference in reply to a
question concerning the on-going Sino-US consultations on IPR
protection.
</P>
<P>
He said, the Chinese side has already taken major measures to
implement the Sino-US IPR agreement, which is a fact there for all
to see.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the US side will respect the fact, and the two sides
will seek to resolve the issue regarding IPR properly on the basis
of mutual respect, equality and mutual benifit," he said, adding
that it is China's hope that the US side will think seriously
before taking any further moves.
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions or the threat to use them will have serious impact
on the bliateral trade and economic relations," the spokesman
stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Cui, Chinese and US officials held working-level
informal consultations on May 13 and 14 in Beijing on the issue of
IPR.
</P>
<P>
During the consultations, the Chinese side, out of utmost
sincerity, once again made clear the fact that it had already
fulfilled comprehensively the obligations stipulated in the
Sino-US agreement on IPR and that it had already taken a series of
measures and made great successes in protecting IPR.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the spokesman said, the Chinese side briefed the
US side on a number of additional measures it will take for the
purpose of IPR protection.
</P>
<P>
The US side, however, did not make any favorable reactions to
the Chinese side. As a result, the consultations failed to produce
any positive progress so far, Cui said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Mubarak Call for Democratization in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak, during their talks here
today, called for democratization in international relations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said all countries -- big or small, strong or
weak, rich or poor -- should be treated equally and all should
have the right to participate in international affairs and to make
their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
The peoples' right of various countries to choose their
political system and development model should be respected, and
no country should interfere in other countries' internal affairs
under any excuse, they said.
</P>
<P>
Any problems in the world should be settled through dialogues
on an equal basis rather than threats or sanctions, the two heads
of state noted.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Mubarak briefed Jiang on the latest
developments in the Middle East and the Egyptian government's
position on the regional issues.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt has for a long time strived for peace in the
Middle East and there has been progress in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, problems and obstacles still exist
and more efforts are needed from the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Jiang echoed Mubarak, saying that to realize the goal of peace
has become the common desire of the peoples in the Middle East
region and an irreversible historical trend.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that new progress will be made in the
Middle East peace talks as long as the parties concerned work with
each other to remove the obstacles on the basis of relevant UN
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised Egypt, as a major country in the Middle East
region, for having played a positive role in promoting the
peaceful settlement to the Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government has always supported the
Middle East peace process and is happy with the progress achieved
in the peace talks so far.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to make efforts along with Egypt and the
whole international community in seeking a comprehensive and just
peace in the Middle East, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> License Required For Producing Hot-Water Heaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China now requires producers of the
instant hot-water gas heater to apply for licence before their
factories go into operation, to cope with the household
appliance's rising quality problem.
</P>
<P>
As many as 105 producers have gained licenses so far, which 131
producers have applied for, and will not expire until the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Technological Supervision will be
responsible for supervising the implementation of the regulation
and severely punishing those who continue to produce or selling
the products without the permission.
</P>
<P>
Hot-water heaters have become popular household items in recent
years. There were more than 13 million of them in 1994, compared
with 300,000 in 1987. So the number of producers has also risen --
to about 200 across the country.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises produced 4.5 million hot-water heaters last
year. The market capacity, however, was for only about 3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The number of hot-water heater accidents has been on a steady
rise in recent years, which is mainly attributed to the product's
poor quality and faulty handling by consumers.

<P>
Tung's native village is in Nghe, an province on the central

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that China regards Egypt as its most important partner
in the Arab world and even Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, during his talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
said it is a set policy of China to strengthen and develop
long-term friendly relations and cooperation with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he believes that the current visit of Jiang will
help develop the friendly relations and cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral relations have been growing steadily
since he visited China in 1976, adding that there exists no
problem in the development of bilateral ties and that the two
countries can fully understand and support each other.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here Monday on a five-day state visit to
Egypt, said that under the new historical background, to
consolidate China-Egypt friendship will not only benefit the two
peoples, but also promote South-South cooperation so as to set an
example of equal, effective and cooperative ties among developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Egypt are going through an important period of
development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
At this important moment before the turn of the century, China
and Egypt, as countries of influence in the world, should study
how to further enhance bilateral friendly ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese government is ready to establish
21st-century-oriented and stable relations with Egypt on the
principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and
common development.

<P>
The Chinese president, whose visit came just days before the

economic and trade ties with Egypt, adding there are immense
potentials and broad prospect for such ties.

<P>
He told Mubarak that China is willing to explore new ways of
economic cooperation with Egypt and that the Chinese government
will encourage Chinese enterprises to invest in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said China has achieved successes in economic reforms
and his country is undergoing economic reforms as well. He added

in the interests of the Arab world and Africa.

</P>
<P>
The Indonesian president described the speech as "excellent"
when meeting with Zhu here today.
</P>

and good neighbors, have their own strong points and enjoy mutual
supplements in the economic development.
</P>
<P>
He assured no obstacles in carrying out the bilateral trade and
economic cooperation.

undoubtedly promote understandings and strengthen cooperation
between the two countries.

exchanges of visits on various levels for the mutual benefit of

the basic interests of the two peoples but also beneficial to the
peace, stability and prospect in the region.

development, Indonesia's rich oil and gas resources will have a
big market in China, while China's electricity and machinery
equipment are suitable for Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Special Team Fights RMB Counterfeiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A dramatic increase in
counterfeiting the Chinese currency, the renminbi (RMB) has
prompted the establishment of a special team to combat it, the
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 public security officers confiscated nearly 100 million
yuan (about 12 million US dollars) in counterfeit bills, up 30
percent from the previous year, said Chen Qing, chief of the
counterfeiting and forgery department of the Economic Protection
Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
Also, more than 40 million yuan in fake treasury bonds and two
million yuan in counterfeit US dollars were seized by the police
last year, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of crime not only disrupts the country's economic
and financial order but also damages the reputation of the RMB,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The team is made up of senior officials from the People's Bank
of China, the Ministry of Public Security and other departments.
</P>
<P>
The amount of counterfeit bills confiscated is rising,
indicating that the circulation of fake bills has increased since
the fourth issue of RMB in 1989, Chen said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren
met here today with a delegation from Japan Association of
Corporate Executives (JACE) headed by Kensuke Koga.
</P>
<P>
Rong praised the JACE'S efforts in advancing Sino-Japanese
economic co-operation while urging the Japanese business people to
invest more and do more business with their Chinese counterparts,
particularly in China's central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
There has been great progress in Sino-Japanese economic
exchanges and co-operation, Rong said. However, it does not yet
match what the two countries should have done or the economic
strength of the two countries, he stated, adding that greater
potential is yet to be tapped by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the Japanese guests on China's ongoing Ninth Five-Year
Plan, starting this year, Rong said a good beginning has been
registered, with the country recording a sustained, stable and
healthy economic development, featured by decreasing inflation and
increasing foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
During the five-year period, Rong stressed, China will deepen
its reforms in various economic sectors, the reform of state-owned
enterprises, commodities circulation and priority of investment
areas in particular, and accelerate the economic development in
the central and western areas. This is aimed at creating an even
solider foundation for further development in the coming century
through reinforcing the country's agglomerate strength, Rong said.
</P>
<P>
Koga said he was impressed by the economic changes in China in
which the country has been paying more attention to "quality and
effectiveness" rather than mere quantity of products. He also said
he hoped that China would make new achievements in reforming its
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The JACE is one of the four leading economic bodies in
Japan. At the invitation of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, the delegation has come to co-sponsor the
just-concluded China-Japan Economic Seminar.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Child TB Death Rate Near Zero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of tuberculosis (TB)
among Beijing's children has dropped to one-1,000th of the rate
only a few decades ago, and the death rate from this disease among
local children is near zero, according to expert.
</P>
<P>
A national survey on the incidence of tuberculosis shows that
there are no patients of tuberculosis among the group of children
aged 14 and under in this capital city of China.
</P>
<P>
Today's "Guangming Daily" reported that in the period from the
1940s to the early 1950s over half of the local children were
affected by tuberculosis and there were 2,000 tuberculosis
sufferers among every 100,000 children. Each year 180 children
died of this disease.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Prof. Wong Zhaoqi, who has been working on the
control of tuberculosis for 40 years, as saying that the incidence
of this disease is now under control, thanks to a series of
effective measures taken by the municipal departments.
</P>
<P>
These measures included establishing a network to prevent the
spread of tuberculosis among children, conducting inoculation of
new-born babies with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BGG) vaccine and
controlling infection among adults.

<HEADLINE> National Survey On Offshore Islands Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China has completed its first
national comprehensive survey of offshore island resources.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,400 scientists, technicians, and management
personnel from 11 ministries participated in the eight-year
survey. They gained 18.41 million items of data, 8.8 million
samples and more than 50 million words of reports.
</P>
<P>
"The survey covered more than 6,500 islands all over Chinese
territory, except for Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and Hainan," said
Zhang Dengyi, director of the National Oceanographic Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The survey results show that bountiful biological, port and
tourism resources, and various other kinds of natural resources
have been found on the islands and nearby regions.
</P>
<P>
Among the surveyed islands, 433 are inhabited by a total of
about 4.5 million people. The total coastline of islands, covering
an area of 6,691 sq m, is over 12,000 km.
</P>
<P>
Most of these islands are located close to coastal regions, 70
percent of them being less than ten km from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
There are few large islands but many small islands scattered
along the 18,000-km Chinese coastline in the forms of chains or
archipelagos. Islands with an area of less than 5,000 sq m each
account for 98 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Six experimental island development zones have been established
such as that of Changhai in Liaoning Province, Changdao in
Shandong Province and Nan'ao in Guangdong Province. The gross
output of the islands rose to 47.3 billion yuan (about 5.6 billion
US dollars) in 1995 from 11.3 billion yuan in 1988.

<HEADLINE> "Father of Hybrid Rice" Predicts Higher Grain Output for China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese agro-scientist who has
been helping China to tackle the problem of feeding its 1.2
billion people, left here for Tokyo today to receive the Nikkei
Asian Award.
</P>
<P>
The winner is Yuan Longping, who has devoted the greater part
of his life to breeding high-yield hybrid rice, which has won him
the title of "Father of hybrid rice".
</P>
<P>
Yuan, a research fellow at Hunan Province's Academy of
Agricultural Sciences, is believed to have been the first person
in the world to succeed in the cultivation of hybrid rice. His
achievement blazed a new trail for grain production in China as
well as in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old agro-scientist has won a special invention
prize and the title Eminent Scientist from the Chinese government,
a gold medal from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
a UNESCO science prize and the Feinstain Hunger Prize from Brown
University in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember how many awards I have received. The only
wish I cherish now is to help people in all corners of the world
escape from hunger," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yuan, who is also an academician of the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, predicted that China's hybrid rice output is expected
to see a new breakthrough early the next century, in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua before his departure.
</P>
<P>
It is very likely that China will double its present annual
output of 450 million tons of grain by the year 2030, he added.
</P>
<P>
To support his theory, Yuan said that China made two major
breakthroughs in hybrid rice breeding in early 1960s and
mid-1970s, respectively.
</P>
<P>
One was by breeding short-stocked varieties, which raised paddy
rice output by 20-30 percent. The other was the successful
development of hybrid rice, which led to another 20 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing research to boost two stages -- the male sterile
line and restorer line -- will make the output of hybrid rice
climb by an additional 30 percent, he said.

<HEADLINE> "Father of Hybrid Rice" Predicts Higher Grain Output for China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hybrid rice bred by Yuan has been planted on 187 million ha
of land across China, yielding a total output of 280 billion kg,
equivalent to the aggregate national output for two years before
the hybrid rice was popularized in the country.
</P>
<P>
Application of hybrid rice strains raised the per ha yield by
1,800 kg compared with conventional strains.
</P>
<P>
A UN FAO official forecast if hybrid rice strains replaced all
the conventional varieties used in all countries, the present
global paddy rice output would be doubled, enough to feed another
one billion people.
</P>
<P>
Yuan's development was hailed as the "second green revolution"
worldwide. His hybrid rice has been grown in more than 20
countries and regions and has generally given a 20-percent yield
increase to local crops.
</P>
<P>
The worry of "who will feed China" expressed in some media
abroad underestimates the role of science and technology in grain
production," Yuan noted.
</P>
<P>
The development of science has no limits. China expects to
raise its grain output by a wide margin so long as it makes full
use of agro-science in all links of agriculture including soil
improvement and pest control, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that there must be a solution to the
problem of strong worldwide demand for food through the progress
of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The veteran scientist pledged to help every Chinese have enough
to eat by making steady increases in grain output, and said that
he was confident of the goal's accomplishment.

<HEADLINE> Earnest Implementation of Administrative Punishment Law Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's highest
governing body, has urged governments at all levels and central
departments to earnestly implement the Law on Administrative
Punishment, which will come into force October 1.
</P>
<P>
In its latest circular, the State Council said that the
Law is an "important law" that will standardize government
behavior.
</P>
<P>
The circular orders governments at all levels and all
departments to promptly train administrative personnel for
enforcing laws and familiarize themselves with the provisions of
the Law on Administrative Punishment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the governments and departments should also
publicize the law to the general public.
</P>
<P>
The circular notes, "Administrative punishment defined by other
documents will become null and void on the date the Law on
Administrative Punishment goes into effect."
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes the importance of building a "highly efficient
and honest" law-enforcement contingent as a major measure to
implement the new law and improve administrative efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and legal affairs offices of various
departments should undertake to supervise and inspect
administrative punishment measures, it said.
</P>
<P>
"All the various departments of the State Council should study
the introduction of an administrative law enforcement system that
will meet the needs of the socialist market economy," it says.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: India's Major Political Parties Maneuvering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Since no major political parties
could secure a simple majority in the 11th Lok Sabha (lower house)
general elections, they are now busing playing number tricks to
woo as many small and regional parties as possible to form the
next government.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest election results declared by the Indian
Election Commission, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won 161
seats, while the former ruling Congress party and the combined
force of the National Front-Left Front (NF-LF) have got 136 and
111 seats respectively, with all of the three being over 100 seats
short of a clear majority in the 543 seats parliament.
</P>
<P>
Senior leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M)
and Chief Minister of West Bengal Jyoti Basu emerged on Monday
night as the virtual leader and prime ministerial candidate of the
combined force of the NF-LF. Basu could well have the support of
the regional parties which are meeting here today to take their
stand. Several regional parties accounting for 60 parliament seats
have come out openly against a tie-up with the BJP.
</P>
<P>
The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the elections.
It is continuing its efforts to enlist the support of small
regional parties in its bid to form the next government on Monday.
But the mood in the party was not as upbeat as it was a few days
ago, with the Congress deciding to support the formation of a
secular government at the center.

The BJP sources said that the party was working on a formula
for the creation of a broad-based national coalition government at
the center led by its veteran leader A .B. Vajpayee. In order to
facilitate the participation of as many parties as possible,
Vajpayee was likely to issue an appeal to them, making it clear
that the BJP's main issues, in particular, the construction of a
Ram Temple (Hindu temple) at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, would not
be on the agenda of the coalition government it is seeking to
form.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party on Monday expressed its confidence that the
non-BJP coalition would form the government at the center. At the
same time, it did not rule out the possibility of the party
staking its claim for formation of a government.
</P>
<P>
"Anything is possible in politics... all options are open,"
Congress spokesman V.N. Gadgil said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to congress sources, Congress President P.V.
Narasimha Rao was understood to have contacted a number of the
NF-LF leaders on Monday to explore the possibilities of the
formation of a secular government.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party on Monday also came out with a legal
position that in a situation where coalition is necessary, the
existing prime minister, even if his party is not returned with a
majority, is entitled to continue as the head of the government
and is entitled to secure a coalition within a reasonable time.

<HEADLINE> Characteristics of Ancient Corpse Verified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors and archaeologists
have ascertained the age, weight, height and blood type of an
ancient female corpse unearthed in 1980 in the Taklimakan Desert
in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
In 1980 the well-preserved mummified corpse was unearthed in
the Tieban River Delta in the desert, which was part of the Loulan
Kingdom in ancient times. Archeologists nicknamed the corpse the
"Loulan Beauty".
</P>
<P>
Since then archeologists, doctors, biologists and chemists from
ten research institutes in Shanghai and Xinjiang have been doing a
comprehensive study of the Beauty.
</P>
<P>
They have verified that she dated back 3,800 years, was around
40 years of age at the time of her death and was 1.558 m tall
before her death.
</P>
<P>
The Beauty belonged to the ancient European race and her blood
type was O.
</P>
<P>
Dissections show that the Beauty's heart, liver, lungs,
kidneys, bladder, large and small intestines and womb were still
in good shape, but had become hard and shrunk.
</P>
<P>
Grains of black sand were found in her pulmonary abscess. This
indicates that she lived in an area hit by frequent storms.
</P>
<P>
Doctors agreed that the woman was buried immediately after her
death.
</P>
<P>
According to Mu Shunying, honorary director of the Xinjiang
Institute of Relics and Archeology, the reason the corpse was
preserved so well is that the place where it was buried was so
arid, hot and dusty that it quickly became mummified.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was on a platform some eight meters above the ground,
and so, it was not in danger of being flooded, he said, adding
that the coffin pit was one m deep and the body was covered with
sand, reeds and willow branches, which made ventilation and
evaporation easier.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the woman died in winter, which retarded germ
activity, he added.

<HEADLINE> Main Afghan Opposition Denies Alliance with Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of
Afghanistan's Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group) today denied its
reported alliance with the government headed by President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Ghairat Baheer, son-in-law of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and the Hezb
representative in Islamabad, told Xinhua this morning that reports
of Hezb troops' arrival in Kabul were groundless.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports from Kabul this morning, about 1,000
Hezb fighters arrived in the Afghan capital Monday after the
faction announced its decision to rejoin the Rabbani regime.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that as the first phase of the
implementation of a political and military pact signed in
February, 12,000 Hezb troops would be posted in Kabul while
Hezb-i-Islami would be given the posts of prime minister, minister
of defense and minister of finance in the newly-broadened
administration.
</P>
<P>
Baheer strongly denied the existence of such a pact, stressing
that a formal agreement of cooperation between his party and the
Rabbani regime had yet to be singed.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his party officials would soon consult with
three other parties of the four-party opposition alliance on the
possible cooperation between Hekmatyar and Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The four-party opposition alliance comprises Hezb-i-Islmai,
Junbush-i-Melli led by Rashid Dostum, Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili
Group) and Nejat-i-Melli headed by Sibghatullah Mojaddedi.
</P>
<P>
Baheer said that Hezb officials had held talks with Mojaddedi
and would go to Mazar-i-Sharif and Bamian in Afghanistan to
consult with Dostum and Khalili respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Wahdat representative in Pakistan said a
Hezb-i-Islami leader had assured him that Hezb-i-Islami would not
finalize its agreement with the Rabbani regime without taking its
allied parties into confidence.
</P>
<P>
An informed source in Peshawar told Xinhua this morning that
Mojaddedi was going to Mazar-i-Sharif to discuss the delicate
Afghan situation with Dostum.
</P>
<P>
"So far, nobody in Peshawar can confirm the report that
Hekmatyar has rejoined Rabbani's regime," he said.
</P>
<P>
A report from Kandahar, Taliban's headquarters in Afghanistan,
today quoted Taliban spokesman Maulvi Wakil Ahmad as saying that
the military alliance between Rabbani and Hekmatyar would not make
any difference to the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Heavy forces of Taliban have stationed outside Kabul since the
student militia launched a decisive offensive on the capital last
October, vowing to oust the Rabbani government.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar, former prime minister of the Kabul regime, staged an
abortive military coup together with Dostum against Rabbani at the
beginning of 1994. Both Hekmatyar and Dostum had to retreat from
Kabul later.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Furniture Makers To Market Products In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan furniture makers have
decided to travel to Europe on May 18 to market their products,
the local daily ''the New Vision'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
They will visit the United Kingdom, Germany and the
Netherlands as part of a Commonwealth Secretariat-sponsored
project to improve and market Ugandan furniture in Europe.
</P>
<P>
A ban on timber exports in Uganda for the purpose of
environmental protection only allows for the export of wooden
furniture, which is a neglected export in the country.
</P>
<P>
The mission to Europe will be preceded by a one-day seminar on
Wednesday here for the participating furniture firms.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, participants will be given a report on the
European market demands by a consultant from Fintrac Overseas
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The project's principle aim is to diversify Ugandan exports.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's export diversification drive has seen the country's
exports of non-traditional exports more than double from 43,000
US Dollars in 1991 to 91,000 Dollars in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Helicopters Rescue for Missing Climbers Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 14 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The helicopter rescue
operation for four missing climbers on Mountain Qomolangma was
still underway on Tuesday after two survivors were brought here
Monday from the world's highest peak.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a Nepal army helicopter brought American Seaborn
Weathers of a swiss team and Ming Ho Gau of a Chinese Taipei team
along with three other exhausted mountaineers to Kathmandu from
the over 6,000-meter-high base camp of Mount Qomolangma.
</P>
<P>
Weathers, 50, and Gau, 47, were relocated at the base camp
after they lost contact with their teams while descending from the
summit of Mount Qomolangma Friday.
</P>
<P>
Other four climbers were still reported missing after they
conquered the 8,848-meter peak Friday from the Nepali side.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Tokyo and New Zealand said that of the four
missing ones, Yashuko Namba, 47, from Japan and Robert Hall from
New Zealand were already found dead on the mountain but the Nepali
Tourism Ministry here declined to confirm their deaths.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, the Ministry announced that Chinese Taipei
climber Yu Nan Chen, 38, died on a 7,300-meter height after
slipping down 25 meters during his attempt towards the summit of
Mount Qomolangma on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
President of Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) Dawa Norbu
said Monday that the recent accidents on Qomolangma were largely
due to their reaching the summit late in the afternoon and not
having ennough time to return.
</P>
<P>
The missing climers' chances to survive were very dim as they
were exposed to extreme temperatures without oxygen and water, the
president said.

<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-US-French joint venture to
produce nylon and polymer is to be set up in Liaoyang, in
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Costing a total of 140 million US dollars in investment, the
Sanlong Nylon Co. Ltd. will be jointly established by the
Liaoyang Petrochemical Fiber Co. (LYPFC), the US's Du Pont (China)
Holding Co. Ltd. and France's Rhone Poulenc Resin and Fiber
Intermediates, S.A.S.
</P>
<P>
Construction work is scheduled to start early in 1997, and
is expected to be completed during the second half of 1998. By that
time, Sanlong is expected to help the LYPFC lift its annual
nylon output from the current 45,000 tons to nearly 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The LYPFC is the only nylon 66 producer in China. Co-operation
with Du Pont and Rhone Poulenc will help it meet China's
fast-growing demand for nylon.
</P>
<P>
Rhone Poulenc, one of the top ten pharmaceutical and chemical
companies worldwide, now has 12 joint ventures, one wholly-owned
subsidiary and a holding company in China.

<HEADLINE> Shortage of large fine Rubies hurts Thai Jewelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 14 (Xinhua) -- An acute shortage of polished
rubies of larger sizes and of higher qualities, combined with a
continued slum in the main US consumer market, will continue
hurting Thai manufacturers of fine jewelry, industry sources say.
</P>
<P>
This shortage has had a major negative impact on the production
of jewelry set with rubies that have been recording the highest
level of demand in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Gem and Jewelry Traders Association has launched a
major initiative to gain access for such goods directly from
Myanmar and Vietnam, but trade insiders see little hope for
success in these efforts.
</P>
<P>
Rubies available at Mae Sai, a town on the Thai-Myanmar border,
are not suitable for upper-middle to high-end jewelry items.
</P>
<P>
High-quality rubies have also stopped coming from Cambodia's
Pailin area since the United Nations imposed sanctions on Khmer
Rouge.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been made worse when Vietnam imposed stricter
controls on the flow of rubies of high quality and larger sizes.
</P>
<P>
Previously substantial quantities of rubies were smuggled into
Thailand through Laos from Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Import Overseas Nuclear Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Energy Department said
Monday that it will import about 20 tons of nuclear waste from
research reactors in foreign countries to prevent the material
from being used for bombs.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear waste was from the fuel that the United State has
sent overseas over the last 40 years for medical and research
purposes. Now the used fuel is building up and foreign countries
want the United States to take it back for disposal.
</P>
<P>
Much of the material comes from Europe and the rest from
Australia, Asia and South America. It includes about five tons of
highly enriched uranium.
</P>
<P>
The material will be stored in different places in the country
including the Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina, and
the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department says it will take 13 years to import all
the waste and it plans to spend 1.7 billion U.S. dollars over 40
years in Idaho, which is also storing other spent nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
It said most of the cost will be reimbursed through fees to the
foreign companies that hold the material.
</P>
<P>
The United States imported two small shipments of nuclear waste
from five European countries in 1994 and 1995. But the announced
amount is the first large-scale consignment for import.

<HEADLINE> State Automaker Renault to Be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The French government is to sell off
its controlling stake in the country's largest car maker Renault,
cutting its holding from 52 to 46 percent, the finance ministry
said today.
</P>
<P>
The move is the first part of a plan to sell off the
government's entire holding in the company, Europe's sixth biggest
auto maker and for years a symbol of French industry.
</P>
<P>
The government has not given any definite timetable for either
part of the offering, but says the initial six percent stake will
be sold by July in the form of a direct placement with unnamed
investors who will be chosen according to the bids they submit.
</P>
<P>
That will avoid the government having to sell the stock on the
open market at a time when Renault's shares are trading below the
price they were issued at when the first tranche of the company
was privatized in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The privatization is seen as a means for the government to
raise badly needed funds to cut its huge 322 billion franc (62
billion U.S. dollars) budget deficit without having to raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
The government needs to reduce the deficit to three percent of
GDP (gross domestic product) by 1997 to qualify for European
monetary union.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the government could raise up to two
billion francs (about 400 million U.S. dollars) from the initial
six percent sale.
</P>
<P>
Renault chairman Louis Schweitzer hailed the government's
decision, saying that after privatization his company would be
able to make decisions and revise strategic plans as quickly as
its competitors.
</P>
<P>
Renault, Europe's sixth biggest auto maker in terms of market
share, produces some 1.8 million vehicles a year and has
operations in France, Spain, Belgium and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The company produced a net profit in 1995 of 2.14 billion
francs (428 million dollars) on sales of 184 billion (36.8 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the profit was largely due to financial activities -- car
operations lost 1.7 billion francs. Renault's vehicles have been
less competitive abroad due to the high level of the franc.
</P>
<P>
Renualt was nationalized by General Charles de Gaulle in 1945
when the government took it over from its former owners who had
collaborated with the Nazis.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Coffee Exports Hit Five-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's monthly exports of
coffee beans hit their lowest levels since 1989 last month because
of severe drought and frost, the Brazilian Federation of Coffee
Exporters (FEBEC) said today.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the world's largest coffee grower and exporter, saw
exports fall 50 percent in April compared with April 1995 to
512,468 sacks of 60 kilograms. Exports were down 11 percent on the
previous month, an FEBEC report said.
</P>
<P>
Total exports in the first four months of 1996 stood at 2.27
million sacks, 37.5 percent lower than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
For the seventh month in a row Brazil exported less coffee than
its monthly export quota of 1 million sacks imposed by the
Association of Coffee-Growing Countries, the FEBEC said.
</P>
<P>
The lower volume of overseas coffee shipments has led to a
dramatic reduction in coffee revenues for Brazil. Coffee exports
account for more than 5 percent of the country's foreign earnings.
</P>
<P>
April exports brought in only 81.9 million U.S. dollars
compared with the 185.5 million dollars in the same month last
year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Coffee exports for the first four months of 1996 have brought
in 331.5 million dollars, 48 percent less than last year's 641
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Earnings have also been hit by lower prices. Last year, the
price of coffee rose because of a shortage caused by the severe
frosts and drought which hit large parts of Brazil's
coffee-growing regions in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But prices are now falling back again due to expectations that
the next Brazilian coffee harvest will be back to normal.

<HEADLINE> Main Opposition Rejoins Afghan Government: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Hezb-i-Islami, the main Afghan
opposition party led by former Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,
has rejoined the Afghan government, according to a report reaching
here today from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted officials from Hezb-i-Islami as saying that
the first of its 12,000 troops began arriving in the Afghan
capital Monday after the faction rejoined the government headed by
President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
The Hekmatyar-Rabbani alliance was announced Monday by the
Afghan Defense Ministry and was confirmed by top officials from
Hezb-i-Islami based in Kabul, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It added that about 1,000 troops loyal to Hekmatyar are already
stationed in barracks alongside government soldiers in Kabul's
eastern and southwestern suburbs and more are expected to come.
</P>
<P>
A top Hezb commander was quoted as saying that "the deal
between our two parties has now basically been finalized and we
have begun implementing the terms of the accord agreed between
us."
</P>
<P>
As the first phase of the implementation of a political and
military pact signed in February, 12,000 troops of Hekmatyar will
be posted in Kabul while Hezb-i-Islami will be given the posts of
prime minister, minister of defense and minister of finance in the
newly broadened administration.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar and his top officials are expected to arrive in Kabul
soon to take up government posts.
</P>
<P>
But the report did not give the exact date of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
The latest development in the Afghan politics is believed to be
one of the most significant in recent years and expected to
transform the whole political landscape of the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> France Passes Bill on Defense Budget Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- French government, in a move to make
its defense more efficient, decided to set the annual defense
budget for the 1997-2002 period at 185 billion francs (37 billion
U.S. dollars), a government communique said today.
</P>
<P>
The communique, issued after a cabinet meeting passed the
military appropriations bill, said this was one of the defense
reforms President Jacques Chirac announced on February 22 to build
an all-professional army.
</P>
<P>
The bill, to be submitted to parliament for approval next
month, made the future French defense budget 20 billion francs (4
billion dollars) less than the current level.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Alain Lamassoure said the bill would
enable the army to remain deterrent through cooperation with
Britain, Germany and the United States, to promote information
exchange with its main allies, to deploy French forces to overseas
trouble-spots, and to safeguard French interests.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that France would play a positive role in
NATO's structural reforms and uphold a relatively independent
defense system of the European Union within the framework of NATO.
</P>
<P>
France encouraged its military enterprises to merge with those
of other European countries so that they could compete with their
U.S. rivals on an equal footing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the appropriations bill, the French army would order 406
Leclerc main battle tanks, while the air forces and navy would
order 12 and 33 Hurricane fighters, respectively.
</P>
<P>
France is also planning to buy 25 Tiger attack helicopters
jointly developed with Germany, but the first deliveries will be
delayed for two more years until 2003.

ISLAMABAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- About 30 to 40 passengers were
drowned Monday when a bus plunged into a canal in Pakistan's
southern Sindh province, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated bus plunged into Rohri Canal, about 500
kilometers north of Karachi, after one of its tires burst while
crossing a bridge over the canal.
</P>
<P>
Only five people were rescued and three bodies recovered by the
time of the press reports.
</P>
<P>
The rescuing team failed to immediately trace the rest of the
passengers and the bus in the muddy canal, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The actual number of the victims could not be ascertained as
the bus was fully packed with many people sitting on the roof, as
it often happens in the country.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that authorities closed the gates to the canal
to help the rescue and search operation, which involved 15 to 20
divers, two boats and a crane.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Refuses to Sack Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem today rejected demands for the sacking of Defense Minister
Oscar Camilon over alleged arms sales to Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Menem denied arms had been sold to
Ecuador during the border dispute between the country and Peru at
the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
As for Camilon's dismissal, the president said, "If I had to
base my actions on the pressures exerted by the opposition or
certain media who ask for the heads of my colleagues, there would
not be one single minister left."
</P>
<P>
Argentina is one of four guarantor countries of a January 1996
ceasefire between Ecuador and Peru following clashes over a
long-standing border dispute.
</P>
<P>
As well as the sacking of Camilon, the opposition have demanded
a thorough investigation into allegations of arms sales to Ecuador
and have asked the defense and foreign ministers to appear before
congress.
</P>
<P>
President Menem said he is waiting for the results of judicial
investigations into the alleged sales before taking any action.
</P>
<P>
Menem also said that so far he has not received any information
about the Peruvian parliament president's supposed trip to
Argentina to get first-hand knowledge of the affair.

<HEADLINE> Rules for Property Rights Determination Due </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China will soon publish provisional
rules for determining the property rights in job-oriented service
enterprises, the State Administration of State Property announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
An official of the state property watchdog said that the rules
are intended to help ascertain the ownership of property rights in
enterprises set up by state-owned mines, government
departments and institutions, which had invested in the forms of
capital, loans, land or investment in kind. Such enterprises
were meant to provide jobs for redundant workers and the children
of workers of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that China currently has more than
200,000 such enterprises, employing over nine million people. The
enterprises have created more than 20 million job opportunities in
the past dozen years.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the establishment of a socialist market
economy and a modern corporate system have prompted the necessity
to straighten out the relations of property rights ownership
between state-owned enterprises and the collectively-run
enterprises affiliated with them.
</P>
<P>
He cited a large number of cases as showing that unclear
definition of property rights has resulted in many property rights
disputes and seriously disturbed the normal operations of
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He also said that vagueness in the ownership of property rights
has discouraged many enterprises from establishing a modern
corporate system.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Austria's population growth is
slowing down and the age structure is changing fast, says a
forecast based on the country's latest census results.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the results of the 1991 national census
indicated today that the rapid population growth resulting from
massive immigration since the mid-1980s is coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the Austrian population increased by
500,000 people to 8.04 million.
</P>
<P>
But the growth rate is now drastically slowing down. The
forecast projects that the population in 2021 will be 8.38
million, only 4.3 percent higher than the present level.
</P>
<P>
Austria's birth rate averages between northern and southern
European countries. Every Austrian woman gives birth to 1.5
children, as compared with 1.3 kids in southern Europe and two in
north Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Austrians are living longer. The average
life expectancy was 73.3 years for men and 79.7 years for women in
1994. The figures are expected to rise to 79 years for men and 85
years for women in 2021.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Reforms Port of Entry Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Coastal Shandong Province is opening
wider to the outside world by streamlining the work of its ports
of entry.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has a very important position in the country's foreign
trade, boasting 23 ports of entry linking it with over 130
countries and regions worldwide by air, sea and land.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform scheme, the province has decided to
abolish on-board checks of ships entering and exiting the Weihai
and Lanshan sea ports. Instead, all the procedures will be handled
by shipping agents, so that the ships can start loading and
unloading once they are at the ports.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao Port, one of China's major sea ports, has introduced
preferential terms with regards to customs declaration and checks
for importers and exporters which are credited with the title
"trustworthy enterprise".
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the transit of travellers, Weihai Port has
introduced measures aimed at reducing the time for baggage checks,
successfully doubling the flow to 400 persons per hour.
</P>
<P>
The Jinan Airport in the provincial capital and the Qingdao
Airport have expanded check-out areas and set up special channels
to speed up the transit of government and trade delegations and
tourist groups.
</P>
<P>
Last year the province handled over 40 million tons of foreign
trade cargo, a rise of 30 percent over the previous year; plus
about 700,000 containers, an increase of over 40 percent. In
addition, there were over 340,000 entries and exits of passengers,
a rise of over 50 percent.

France's support in its dispute with the European Union (EU) over
the procedure for applying for EU membership.

Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov, who visited France on May

Macedonia's entry because of its refusal to join a regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made it clear that the EU should not force its
applicants to join a region's integration process.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which has insisted that EU membership applicants should
first take part in the regional integration process, had asked
Macedonia to join a regional grouping to be established in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
But Macedonia strongly opposes such a precondition, which it
called "unreasonable" and "impractical."

<HEADLINE> Tyson's Appeal Rejected by Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- WBC heavyweight champion Mike
Tyson was rejected on Monday in his appeal to overturn an early
court order that prevents him from fighting WBA champion Bruce
Seldon in July.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court in Newark, New Jersey ruled unanimously that
Tyson must not fight anyone other than challenger Lennox Lewis of
Briton first until a lawsuit was settled.
</P>
<P>
In his suit, Lewis claimed that he would be the first, instead
of Tyson, to challenge Frank Bruno for the WBC title.
</P>
<P>
With Tyson imprisoned for three and a half years on raping
charges, the WBC title went to Lewis, Bruno and Oliver McCall in
rotation before McCall lost to Bruno anew in September.
</P>
<P>
After defeating Lionel Butler in a WBC-sanctioned bout last
May, Lewis said he should be first to challenge Bruno.
</P>
<P>
But the right was awarded by WBC to Tyson after his release
from prison in March 1995, and Tyson dethroned Bruno expectedly in
a quick bout on March 16 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
After the victory, Tyson and promoter Don King intended to
collect all the heavyweight belts in the world before fighting any
of his title defense bout.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Lewis came out anew to challenge Tyson for
the WBC title after defeating Ray Mercer in a 10-round decision.

<P>
YANGON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is considering to grant one
more offshore block to US oil firm Arco Myanmar INC for oil and
gas exploration and production, the official newspaper New Light

</P>
<P>
The Arco Myanmar INC signed last July a production sharing
contract with the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise of the Ministry
of Energy to explore natural gas at Myanmar's offshore block No.
M-9.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Energy Minister U Khin Maung Thein chaired
a special meeting of the Project Implementation Committee here
Monday, which discussed the possibility to allow the US firm's
operation at the offshore block No. M-7.
</P>
<P>
Seven countries -- France, the US, Britain, Australia, Japan,
Thailand and Malaysia -- have signed production sharing contacts
with Myanmar since it started to invite foreign oil companies to
develop its oil and gas resources in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The undertaking has involved 14 foreign companies under more
than 20 contracts in five offshore and seven onshore areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas sector boasts the largest share of foreign
investments in Myanmar, with the amount standing at 1.435 billion
US dollars out of a total 3.237 billion US dollars at the end of
March this year,

Peru (MOMEP), which starts mid-June.
</P>
<P>
The MOMEP is responsible for monitoring the compliance of the
commitments that Ecuador and Peru assumed on February 17, 1995, to
put an end to the fighting between both countries.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting will also decide on an expansion of
the demilitarized zone on the Ecuadoran-Peruvian border, which is
controlled by foreign military observers.
</P>
<P>
Border fighting erupted between Ecuador and Peru on January 26,
1995, as a result of territorial dispute, which centers on a
340-square-kilometer area in the jungle region known as the
Cordillera del Condor.
</P>
<P>
The disputed area, believed to contain oil and mineral
deposits, has yet to be clearly demarcated as called for in the
1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol. Ecuador rejects the border
settlement included in the protocol while Peru insists on its
validity.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States are the
so-called "four guarantors" of the Rio de Janeiro Protocol.

<HEADLINE> Australia Trials Sole Number for Multimedia Callers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian telecommunications
giant Telstra has begun trials to provide a sole contact number
for a user that has different telephone lines, the newspaper of
The Australian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Telstra Telepath, the first of its kind in
the world, will be put into commercial service by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
It provides a ten-digit number for all personal communication
services for one user, including mobile and fixed-line telephones,
pagers and message machines.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Telstra hopes to upgrade Telepath to provide
facsimile, on-line, voice recognition and smart card services, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the service is a convenience for people living
in a multimedia world, which enables users to dispense with an
array of different telephone contact numbers.
</P>
<P>
When the sole number is dialed, the computer-controlled
switchboard at Telepath can automatically try several telephone
lines in sequence until the user is connected.
</P>
<P>
The user can also set a program that restricts access to
certain lines during a specific period of time. For example, a
user can divert all telephone calls to his home and office to a
mobile telephone set when he travels.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that although there had been trials of
personal communication services in other countries, none had
integrated mobile and fixed networks in the seamless manner
boasted by Telstra.
</P>
<P>
"It transfers the responsibility for locating the individual
from the caller to the intelligence that's in the network itself,"
Telstra Chief Executive Frank Blount said.
</P>
<P>
In its commercial form, Telepath will extend services into
rival networks in Australia, such as Optus Communications and
Vodafone, and overseas markets, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Pope Assassin Asks for Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca, who
attacked Pope John Paul II in 1981, asked the Italian judicial
authorities today to release him since he has completed a
15-year-term of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local television, Agca, 38, said that he
had paid enough for his crime and wanted to be set free and
expelled from Italy.
</P>
<P>
"I request the Pope and the Vatican to make formal
pronouncements on my liberation," said Agca, who shot the Pope
during a general audience in St Peter's Square on May 13, 1981,
wounding him in the stomach and hand.
</P>
<P>
Agca was caught on the spot by Italian police and sentenced to
15 years in prison. Capital punishment is outlawed in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the Pope,
now 75, had already forgiven Agca twice.
</P>
<P>
The Pope, whose life was saved by emergency surgery, forgave
Agca in a speech made four days after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Agca, reportedly a member of a Turkish terrorist organization,
denied once again that his attempted assassination of the Pontiff
was controlled by somebody behind, saying that his action was on
the God's orders, and that he wanted to shoot him as a "desperate
act to make history" but without intent to kill.
</P>
<P>
Agca said he wishes to be released from prison and expelled
from Italy after 15 years of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Agca's lawyer Marina Magistrelli, his mother Muzeyyen and his
brother Adnan have called a news conference in Rome on Tuesday to
present their case for his release. They plan to appeal to
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and the government.
</P>
<P>
But any eventual judicial leniency or presidential pardon will
be complicated by the fact that Agca is wanted in his native
Turkey for the murder of a journalist.
</P>
<P>
According to his lawyers, Agca was a paranoid schizophrenic who
acted as a lone gunman in an attempt to become a hero.

<HEADLINE> Specialists Gather to Discuss Conservation of Crocodiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 specialists from
40 countries and a number of world organizations gathered today in
Santa Fe, capital of the Argentine province with the same name, to
discuss ways of conserving the world's stock of crocodile species.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the five-day event, which started today, will
exchange experience in the biology, health, utilization and
conservation of the 23 species of crocodiles that exist in the
world, all of them in tropical and subtropical areas.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Environment Minister Mdaria Julia Alsogaray presided
over the opening ceremony. As part of the meeting, the minister
will launch a commercial phase of the "Yacare Project," which has
its operational headquarters in the province of Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
During the previous non-commercial phase of four years, more
than 5,000 crocodiles have been hatched in the province of Santa
Fe.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Argentina's Natural Resources and
Human Environment Ministry, the commercial use of crocodile skins
began in the middle of the past century and increased considerably
at the beginning of this century, leading to a dramatic decrease
in the number of crocodiles.

<P>
ALMA ATA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh Prime Minister Akezhan
Kazhegeldin said today that he was satisfied with the smooth
development of the political and economic relations between
Kazakhstan and China.
</P>
<P>
China plays a vital and active role in the Asia-Pacific region,
Kazhegeldin told General Fu Quanyou, chief of general staff of the
Chinese Liberation Army, who arrived here on May 9.
</P>
<P>
Fu, who is also a member of the Chinese Central Military
Commission, said China values relations with Kazakhstan and the
exchange of high-level visits has laid a good foundation for their
steady development.
</P>
<P>
Fu commended a confidence-building border treaty signed in the
Chinese port city of Shanghai last month by the leaders of China,
Kazakhstan, Russia, Kirghizia and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is of great significance and is conducive to peace
and development in both the Asia-Pacific region and the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty effectively sets up a 100-km zone along either side
of their 7,640-km-long borders in which no country shall conduct
any troop movements unless it has notified the other
side. Besides, each country must inform all the other parties of
its basic weapons and armors deployed in the zone.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia to Use New Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia will issue its new
currency in September, removing the old national emblem of the sun
which was opposed by its neighbour Greece.
</P>
<P>
But the move will cost the country some 120 million denars,
Tome Nenovski, deputy president of the country's national
bank said today.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia issued its own currency, the "denar", after declaring
independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Part of the country's new
national emblem, the sun, was in the currency's design.
</P>
<P>
But, Greece opposed the use of the sun as Macedonia's national
emblem -- it represented the ancient Macedonian empire which
covered part of what is now Greece as well as the former Yugoslav
republic -- saying it implied claims on its own province of
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
As part of an agreement last September to end a four-year feud
between the two countries, Macedonia agreed to change its national
emblem and subsequently revised its national emblem and flag.
</P>
<P>
The new currency issue is seen as the latest step in this
change.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Howard Enjoys Higher Support Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- John Howard enjoyed the highest
popularity among voters for any Australian prime minister in over
a decade because of his strong stance on stricter gun control
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The latest Newspoll taken last weekend showed that 67 percent
of voters were satisfied with Howard's performance since he was
elected the prime minister in March. Only 14 percent were
dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
This is the highest satisfaction rate for an Australian prime
minister ever recorded since 1985, when the Newspoll was first
conducted. Howard's satisfaction rate has jumped 17 percentage
points in the past fortnight.
</P>
<P>
Similar popularity was only achieved by former Prime Minister
Bob Hawke in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Howard was regarded as the better prime minister by 60 percent
voters, comparing with opposition leader Kim Beazley who was
supported by 18 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
At the state police ministers' meeting that is underway in
Canberra, Howard managed to force all state and territorial
governments to adopt a nation-wide, uniform gun law and a buy-back
scheme of guns.
</P>
<P>
The move was hailed by local press as a historical achievement.
 The Newspoll also showed that 68 percent of Australians favored
filtering violence content off from TV programs and video games.
</P>
<P>
The massacre of 35 people by a lone gunman in Port Arthur,
Tasmania two weeks ago sparked the call of much stricter gun
control in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that the community had made a decision not to go
down the American path of urban violence where it was a way of
life and could not be rolled back.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government enjoyed the support of 55 percent of
voters, ahead of the opposition Labor Party's 36 percent support
rate.

<HEADLINE> Trade School Enrollment Edges Out Senior Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Enrollment in vocational schools has
surpassed that of senior high schools, just one sign of many that
vocational education in Beijing has made steady headway in the
past 15 years, it is reported here.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Education Commission (BEC), the ratio
of those enrolled in vocational schools to those enrolled in
senior high schools changed from 1:3.6 in 1980 to 3:2 by the end
of last year, said Guo Zhongtian, vice-director of the Vocational
Education Department of the BEC.
</P>
<P>
Guo attributed this reversal and the development of vocational
schools to the close connection between vocational education and
local economic development, and improvement in teaching quality,
the China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 students have graduated from 174 vocational
senior high schools in the city since 1980, when the schools began
to function in China, according to Guo.
</P>
<P>
More than 95 percent of them have attained employment,
representing nearly all trades and professions.
</P>
<P>
Vocational schools also provide junior high school students
with more alternatives for schooling after graduation, although
the first choice for the majority remains entrance into
universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
According to the BEC, about 85 percent of the 240 specialties
offered by vocational schools concern the service sector, which
has achieved rapid progress in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Vocational Service Middle School, one of seven
vocational middle schools which satisfy national standards
regarding teacher qualifications and student grades, has provided
about 30 local hotels and restaurants with 8,000 qualified service
personnel over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Guo said, it's necessary to develop vocational
education to a higher level to meet the continuous growth in
demand for talented people.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, together with Shanghai and south China's Guangdong
Province have led the country in developing vocational education,
according to the BEC.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb PM Reshuffles Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Rajko
Kasagic announced a cabinet reshuffle today, asking several
ministers to step down.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the ministers to leave their posts was their
"insufficient support to the Dayton peace agreement" signed late
last year to end the Bosnian civil war, according to reports from
Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Kasagic was supported by the international
community and he was trying to build a moderate government in
Banja Luka as an alternative to hardliners in Pale, the Serb
stronghold near Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Pressure has been mounting for the step-down of Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic and his military chief Ratko Mladic, both of whom
have been indicted as war criminals by the international war
crimes tribunal in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The Serb prime minister's move was reportedly backed by Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, who accused the two Serb
leaders of keeping the Serb Republika Srpska isolated from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement, Karadzic and Mladic must stay
out of office before the general elections scheduled for September
in Bosnia. The international community has conditioned financial
aid to the Serb side with the step-down of the two Serb leaders
and has rejected to deal with them directly since the Dayton peace
accord was reached last November.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders FAA to Submit Aviation Safety Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today asked the Transportation Department and the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to report within this week what measures they
plan to take to ensure a safe aviation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm determined to do everything I can to make sure American
aviation is the safest in the world," Clinton said following a
ValuJet airliner's crash in an area of Everglades swamp in Miami
Saturday which killed all 104 passengers and five crew members.
</P>
<P>
"Today, all Americans have heavy hearts over another air
tragedy. We send our prayers, our condolences, to the families of
those who lost their lives in the Everglades," the president said.
</P>
<P>
According to White House spokesman Mike McCurry, Clinton's
1997 budget recommends hiring 150 more inspectors and increasing
the training budget by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the accident, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena
said on ABC TV that inspectors were stepping up efforts that began
in February and already had led to changes by ValuJet airline.
"Now we will go further. We are going to get to the bottom of
this," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "It is unfortunate and not helpful for anyone to
be speculating on the cause of the accident. We do not know what
caused the accident."
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration also announced that a
week-long safety checkup of the airline, originally scheduled for
next week, was moved up and extended to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The intensified checkup will include a review of procedures at
six major maintenance centers operated by ValuJet contractors and
of engine maintenance facilities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FAA said dozens of FAA inspectors would visit
ValuJet's 29 line maintenance facilities where minor repairs were
done between flights, and the airline's new Technical Support
Center in Atlanta and at Washington Dulles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investigators are battling in the most difficult
crash scene to search for the wreckage and remains of the victims
in the mud and inky water. They have found the submerged engines
of VeluJet Flight 592 and some disintegrated remains of victims.
But they found it difficult to remove the wreckage from the
alligator-and-snake-infected swamp.
</P>
<P>
The water in the swamp ranged from six inches to five feet deep
and beneath that was muck that could be 30 to 40 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
Navy divers, specialists in underwater salvage recovery, were
bringing sonar equipment with which officials hope they will
locate the data recorders.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the plane's take-off Saturday afternoon at the
Miami International Airport, the crew reported smoke in the
cockpit and cabin and asked to turn back. The plane crashed about
15 miles northwest of the airport.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Strikers, Government Reach Accord on Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government reached an
agreement today with strikers from the IMT Engine and Tractor
Plant in Belgrade to pay the workers overdue salaries in the next
two days.
</P>
<P>
After getting assurance from the government that they could
soon get their January wages, the strikers left the streets of
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
IMT workers today took to the street and rallied in downtown
Belgrade, demanding overdue salaries for the past four months and
resumption of production at the factory, one of the biggest in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Serbian Information Minister Ljiljana Jovanovic said
the government and the strikers had agreed that the IMT would pay
salaries in the next three to four months from the money it earns
from production.
</P>
<P>
She added the government would meet again with IMT workers
Friday for further discussions on the payment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, workers from the biggest factories in the metal
processing and electrical industries in Serbia's southeastern city
of Nis continued their several-day strike, stating similar reasons
as their Belgrade fellow-workers.
</P>
<P>
Strikers staged their walkout in the streets of Nis today,
though their representatives agreed to call off the strike after
the city government pledged Sunday to fulfill most of their
demands.
</P>
<P>
Workers of Angropromet, the biggest trade company in Nis, also
went on strike today.
</P>
<P>
Serbian Trade and Tourism Minister Srdjan Nikolic today called
on the workers to stop striking and go back to work. He told a
local radio in Nis that workers "should not seek a solution to
their problems in the streets, but in the better competitiveness
of their companies."

<HEADLINE> Study: Death Rate From Lung Disease Increases for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The death rate from lung disease
has increased for American cigarette smoking women, according to
a study revealed at a meeting of the American lung Association and
American Thoracic Society today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers reviewed the reported causes of death and diseases
that contributed to the deaths of more than 29 million Americans
during the period 1979 through 1992. They found that 8 percent,
about 2.3 million, had a diagnosis of obstructive lung disease. Of
those 2.3 million, obstructive lung disease was listed as the
underlying cause of death for about 43.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The obstructive lung disease death rate among women increased
from 24.5 per 100,000 in 1979 to 50.9 per 100,000 in 1992, the
study said, adding that most obstructive lung disease is caused by
cigarette smoking. It takes 25 to 30 years to develop obstructive
lung disease.
</P>
<P>
Another new research appeared in the newspaper USA Today said
that cigarette smoking causes more lung damage in women than men,
for women have smaller lungs than men so they have a greater
percentage loss of breathing capacity for a given amount of
smoking.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Cost of Housing Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The falling mortgage rates and low
house prices have enabled more Canadians to own their home than it
has been in years, says a new study from the Royal Bank of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The bank's index shows that the cost of owing a typical starter
house in the first quarter of this year cost 32.9 percent of
median pretax household income, down from 38.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The median household income in the country is 29,200 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic drop of house prices has been in the
westcoast city of Vancouver, today's Globe and Mail newspaper
quoted the study as saying.
</P>
<P>
Though Vancouver is still the most expensive city in Canada to
buy a house, the cost of owing one eats up 52 percent of household
income, 17.7 percent less than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In Canada's largest city of Toronto, the cost of owning a
detached bungalow is the cheapest it's been since the bank started
keeping statistics 16 years ago, the study says.
</P>
<P>
Torontonians with an average starter house paid out 37.7
percent of their household income, down from 43.3 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
In Montreal, affordability also keeps on improving. Montrealers
forked out 32.8 percent, down from 38.5 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that Maritimes is the cheapest region to own a
house, followed by Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,
Quebec and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
In almost every case, it is as affordable as it has been in a
decade, thanks to a drop in mortgage rates, it says. The five-year
mortgage is now running about 8 percent, down from 10.3 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these affordability numbers, sales of new houses
have been extremely sluggish in the country, largely due to the
low consumer confidence.

<HEADLINE> US Increases Pressure on IRA to Restore Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- US President Bill Clinton's senior
aides increased pressure today on the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
and its political wing Sinn Fein to renew ceasefire before the
planned all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland
scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton's adviser on the Northern Ireland policy
Nancy Soderberg said in an interview with BBC radio that as the
all-party talks were coming, there was no justification for the
IRA continuing its campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she told the British government, the
negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland would be real and
substantive.
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview with BBC radio, Senator Christopher
Dodd, chairman of the US Democratic Party and head of Clinton's
re-election campaign, said he would urge Clinton not to authorize
more US visas for Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, if the IRA
failed to restore its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
He warned: "It's very important that members of the IRA
understand that no president in future will want to pick up this
issue again if we don't take this opportunity we have been
presented with and make it work."
</P>
<P>
BBC TV commented that the two statements clearly implied that
if Sinn Fein is not admitted to the talks on June 10, then the
blame will lie fairly and squarely with the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The timing of these two interventions also demonstrated the
concern from the US that the opportunity for all-party political
negotiations should not be missed, it said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary maintained that the two statements will no doubt
please the British government, which has been insisting that the
IRA must renew its truce before Sinn Fein is admitted to the
planned all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Dublin, Irish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Dick Spring welcomed the US interventions,
which he hoped would help ensure that Sinn Fein could attend the
peace talks in June 10.

<HEADLINE> "Third Force" Splits Over Whether to Back Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The so-called "Third Force"
candidates running in Russia's mid-June presidential election has
fallen apart over whether to support front-running archrival Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The team had consisted of three presidential candidates:
Yabloko bloc chief Grigory Yavlinsky, eye surgeon Svyatoslav
Fyodorov and retired general Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov told the Itar-Tass news agency that the alliance "has
practically fallen apart and will hardly be able to nominate a
single candidate".
</P>
<P>
"A team ceases to exist when one of its members falls out," he
said, referring to Lebed's decision to contest the election as an
independent.
</P>
<P>
Though he has reportedly proposed forming a "national unity
government" with Yeltsin, Fyodorov has not said whether he would
support Yeltsin in the election.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin met Yavlinsky and Lebed earlier this month, raising
speculation that he was offering them posts in a future government
in exchange for their support in the presidential election slated
for June 16.
</P>
<P>
There was also speculation that Yeltsin was offering Yavlinsky
the post of prime minister in return for withdrawing his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said last Saturday that he was joining forces with
Yavlinsky and the Third Force.
</P>
<P>
But Yavlinsky rejected Yeltsin's remarks later that day, saying
that he had neither the intention nor the desire to ally with the
president.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Yavlinsky said that he would contest the election
alone, denying rumors about that he was in negotiations with
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
A new poll by the All-Russian Public Opinion Center released
late on Sunday gave Yeltsin 28 percent of the vote and Zyuganov 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky was favored by 9 percent of voters while Fyodorov and
Lebed got 7 and 6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
If Yeltsin could form a coalition with the "Third Force", or
with Yavlinsky alone, it would provide a significant boost to his
prospects for re-election, perhaps even sufficient to tip the
balance in his favor.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said today that he was still working on forming a
coalition with the Third Force.
</P>
<P>
"I agreed with Lebed and Yavlinsky on the joint coordination of
our election campaign," he said, "and we shall work it out in more
detail."
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that if a coalition could be formed among
the democratic candidates, he would be elected for a second term.

<HEADLINE> Britain May Retaliate Over EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government is planning
to take wide-ranging retaliatory action against the European Union
(EU) if the EU Commission refuses to lift the world-wide ban on
the export of British cattle products.
</P>
<P>
The EU's standing veterinary committee is due to meet in
Brussels on Wednesday to discuss an EU proposal to lift the ban on
British exports of tallow, gelatine and other by-products of
cattle.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission has promised to consider lifting the overall
ban on British beef in stages if Britain's beef producers can meet
strict processing requirements.
</P>
<P>
Senior British officials have warned recently that if the EU
veterinary committee turns down the proposal, the British
government will appeal directly to EU agriculture ministers to
overturn the ban.
</P>
<P>
British ministers are privately discussing contingency plans
for adopting an "empty chair" policy at key EU meetings or to
block votes that require unanimity if there is no early lifting of
the seven-week-old beef ban.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers have ruled out the possibility of
withholding British payments to the EU budget, saying it would
break British law.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind also issued a stark
warning Sunday that Britain was ready to take whatever action
necessary in an effort to get the ban lifted.
</P>
<P>
It would be "very perverse" for any government to obstruct the
lifting of the "wholly unjustified" ban, he said.
</P>
<P>
Government sources predict that the French government would
back a lifting of the EU ban, but the Germans would remain opposed.
</P>
<P>
One EU official has said that the outcome would almost
certainly depend on the Dutch and Belgians.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef exports in April
when the British government admitted that there was a possible
link between BSE or mad cow disease and its fatal human
equivalent, Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Ethiopian Presidents Pledge To Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and his Ethiopian counterpart Negasso Gidada pledged here today to
make continued efforts to promote cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents made the pledge at a banquet held at the
National Palace here by Negasso in honor of Jiang and his
entourage.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Negasso lauded Jiang's visit to Enthiopia as a
landmark event in the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang flew here this morning for a three-day state visit to
Ethiopia to consolidate friendship and promote cooperation between
China and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"Your visit to Ethiopia is historic for many reasons," Negasso
noted, saying that it is the first ever visit by a Chinese
president to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ethiopia attaches great importance to its
relations with China, and the Ethiopian people hold the people of
China in very high esteem.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts between the two peoples go back into history," he
said. "Since diplomatic relations were established between our two
countries in the early seventies, the role of Chinese experts in
Ethiopia have been very laudable and the various projects
completed with Chinese cooperation have been indeed extremely
helpful."
</P>
<P>
"We wish to consolidate these relations with your country and
with your great people," Negasso said. "We are very much aware how
much your country is committed to its relations with all
developing countries and how determined you are to promote
equality among all sovereign nations."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang spoke highly of Ethiopia's time-honored
civilization and its long-time struggle against foreign aggressors.
</P>
<P>
He said that in this century, Ethiopia has made outstanding
contributions to African struggle for independence and to the
establishment of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"The government and people of Ethiopia have scored remarkable
successes in maintaining stability, developing economy and
improving people's livelihood," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader expressed his confidence that Ethiopia will
make even greater achievements in its search for a development
path suited to its own national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also praised the role Ethiopia has played in seeking
political settlement of regional conflicts and promoting regional
cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
"Our exchanges and cooperation in various fields have grown
constantly closer and broader since the Ethiopian People's
Revolutionary Democratic Front came to power," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China is ready to join Ethiopia in steadily
strengthening bilateral cooperation in international affairs and
exploring new areas and new approaches of cooperation on the basis
of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
"With the concerted efforts and meticulous nurturing by the two
sides, the flowers of Sino-Ethiopian friendship will bloom even
more luxuriantly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the banquet were more than 130 officials from both
sides, including Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen and Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Jiang laid a wreath to the Victory Monument in
the Ethiopian capital with the accompany of Negasso and five
Ethiopian government ministers.
</P>
<P>
This is the second leg of Jiang's ongoing African tour, which
has taken him to Kenya.

ROME, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Europe should play a more active role
in promoting the Middle East peace process, foreign ministers from
11 Mediterranean countries said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, taking part in the Mediterranean Forum, agreed
that a more active role by Europe is crucial to restoring peace in
Middle East and maintaining long-term stability in the region.
</P>

The two-day meeting, which ended in the southern Italian town
of Ravello on Friday, was held shortly after the Israeli
bombardment of southern Lebanon which has led to a deterioration
in the situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The forum, held annually since July 1994, also discussed aid
for the reconstruction of Bosnia and further strengthening
cooperation among Mediterranean countries in politics, culture,
the economy and security.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Algeria, Egypt, France, Greece, Italy,
Malta, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Tunis and Turkey attended the

<HEADLINE> China, Africa Bound to Stand Together: Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China deems the relations with Africa as very
special ties of sharing and standing together through thick and
thin.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, Jiang
said that China, under the new international situation, is ready
to further strengthen unity and cooperation with African nations
by continuously injecting new contents into China-Africa relations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that a purpose of his current visit to Africa is to
assure the governments and peoples of Africa of the
above-mentioned position.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese head of state said that to consolidate and develop
friendly cooperation with Africa constitutes an important part of
China's independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
China has always respected the African nations' choices of
their political systems and development model according to their
own conditions and never interfered in their internal affairs;
China is also against the practice that other countries impose
their own ideology and social development model on African
nations, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly support the just struggle of African nations in
safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity and in opposing external interferences. We also support
their efforts in participating in international affairs and
safeguarding their own legitimate rights and interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned about the conflicts and disputes among
African countries and hope that the countries concerned strengthen
consultations and cooperation in order to create favorable
conditions for their respective economic construction and regional
cooperation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said China is willing to conduct
exchanges and cooperation in various aspects with Africa in order
to learn from each other and to consolidate the China-Africa ties
of "equality, sincerity, friendship and common development."
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties they face, Jiang noted, African
countries will realize the goals of development and vitalization
as long as they value and maintain peace and enhance unity and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meles said Ethiopia has been following closely on the situation
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Facing external pressure, he said, it is not easy for African
nations to maintain their independence. He added that foreign
countries often attach many conditions when they grant assistances
to Africa.
</P>
<P>
Under such complicated circumstances, the prime minister said,
the Ethiopian government pursues an independent foreign policy of
peace and development and has adopted its own way of
development. He noted that the current economic policy of Ethiopia
has been successful.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised the foreign policy of Ethiopia. He said Ethiopia
has for a long time strived for the development of Africa and the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), thus having won esteem from
African countries and the international community.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the efforts of Ethiopia in developing
friendly relations with its neighbors on the basis of mutual
respect and mutual non-interference and China supports Ethiopia's
efforts in seeking for regional peace and security, Jiang added.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Foreign Minister Pledges Support to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Libyan Foreign Minister
Omar Mustaffa Almuntasser today pledged his country's support to
Cuba while both were under pressure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
According to a Prensa Latina report, the official said Libya's
solidarity with Cuba has multiplied as a result of the recently
increased U.S. trade embargo against the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
The U.S government has been prohibiting, for 32 years so far,
U.S. citizens and business representatives from visiting or
carrying on financial transactions with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The sanction has been tightened up since March, when President
Bill Clinton signed a bill into law allowing legal suits against
other countries' trade relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
A similar bill targeting Libya is reportedly in the making at
U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan Foreign Minister arrived here last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has held talks with Cuban Foreign Minister
Roberto Robaina, Minister for Foreign Investments Ibrahim Ferradaz
and other top Cuban officials.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he favored increased cooperation between
Havana and Tripoli, and expressed Libya's interest in acquiring
Cuban sugar, coffee, tobacco, medicines and medical aid.

<HEADLINE> China To Strengthen Cooperation with OAU: Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here this morning China is ready to strengthen
consultations and cooperation on issues of common concern with the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) under the new international
situation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, in a meeting with OAU's Secretary General Salim Ahmed
Salim, said China welcomes Salim and other OAU officials to visit
China and will send officials to consult with the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the relations between the OAU and China have been
further enhanced since he visited China three years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said Jiang's visit comes at a time when Africa has undergone
profound political and economic changes so the visit will further
enhance the long-standing friendly relations between African
nations and China.
</P>
<P>
The OAU hopes that China will play a more positive role in
helping maintain peace and development in Africa, he said, adding
the OAU is willing to establish consultations with China on
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China has always treasured the friendship with
Africa and attached great importance to the roles of African
countries and the OAU in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to consolidate and develop its Africa ties of
equality, sincerity, friendship, unity, cooperation and common
development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades, Jiang recalled, the Chinese
government has always supported the OAU's effort to seek political
liberation, national stability and economic development of the
African nations.
</P>
<P>
China also has been against the interference of external forces
into Africa's internal affairs, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the OAU appreciates the support China has given to
Africa's struggle for liberation in the past and the endeavor for
peaceful development at present.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the most urgent task of Africa is to
restore peace and security and the OAU hopes to work with China in
this regard as well as in the OAU and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the OAU hopes to get continued support from
China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Funcinpec Always Respects Constitution: Cambodian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh said today that his party -- Funcinpec will
never do anything against the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec fully abides by the constitution, Ranariddh, who is
President of Funcinpec, the biggest ruling party in cambodia, told
reporters this morning upon his return from a two-week visit to
France.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Funcinpec had never said they would withdraw
from the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Talking about power sharing between the CPP (Cambodian People's
Party) and Funcinpec, Ranariddh said the two parties are planning
to have talks and make assessments of this problem first.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the Law of Nationality, Ranariddh said he, as a
prime minister, will respect the decision made by the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
At present, the National Assembly has been discussing the draft
law of Nationality which the Royal Government had approved.
</P>
<P>
Whether one nationality or two to be included in the law should
be decided by the Cambodian people, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a Cambodia Daily report today, Cambodian Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen said Saturday that the ruling coalition
government will last even if some members of Funcinpec decide to
withdraw from it.
</P>
<P>
Members of Funcinpec have complained that the CPP has not
handed over power at the district level.

<HEADLINE> Jump in UK Interest Rates Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- British base rate could jump to 8.5
percent by the end of next year as monetary authorities counter a
resurgence in inflation, a City economist says today.
</P>
<P>
A vigorous recovery in consumer confidence, boosted by a series
of cash windfalls and faster wage growth will prompt the Bank of
England to urge a significant tightening of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, base rates could rise sharply from the present
level of six percent and the first act of a new government may be
to order an unpopular increase in the cost of borrowing, said
Richard Jeffrey, group economist at Charterhouse.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe that the Chancellor will be forced to
acquiesce to higher base rates later this year, and that they will
rise substantially higher next year, whoever wins the election,"
Jeffrey said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, he still believed that the possibility
existed of a sharp rise in inflation in the second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey expected consumer spending, up 2.3 percent in 1995, to
rise 3.2 percent this year and 4.1 percent in 1997. Consumer
confidence will be boosted by tax cuts, an improving housing
market, and building society windfalls from takeovers and
floatations.
</P>
<P>
Charterhouse believes that the government will achieve its
inflation target of 2.5 percent by the next election. However,
faster wage growth and rising commodity prices are expected to
push it to four percent by the end of 1997 with pressure on retail
prices building up in the second half of next year.

<P>
NICOSIA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
will meet U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on June
12 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
This was officially announced here today by government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Ghali-Clerides meeting was
originally scheduled to take place in New York, when President
Clerides visits the United States in mid-June. But the U.N. chief
will be abroad during that period.
</P>
<P>
After Geneva, the Cypriot President will fly to Washington
where he will hold talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
June 18 at the White House.
</P>
<P>
During these meetings, the Cyprus problem and various efforts
to achieve a breakthrough in the present stalemate in the
peace talks are expected to be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials, who claimed that 1996 will be a "big push"
for Cyprus, are expected to launch a peace initiative on Cyprus
problem after the Clerides-Clinton meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish-Cypriot community and
the Greek-Cypriot community since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the two communities on the island have
gone into deadlock since the two sides couldn't find common
ground on the basic aspects of the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Deputy Prime Minister on Offset Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Second Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Finance Nasser al-Rowdhan said today
that the offset program being implemented in the country is an
ideal way to attract international companies, expertise and
investments.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the session of a Two-day Kuwait
University-organized Offset Program Forum.
</P>
<P>
The offset program represents responsible partnership
opportunities between the Kuwaiti private sector and the foreign
investors who undertake an obligatory fulfillment or supply for
the governmental sector through contracts that are worth one
million Kuwait dinars (3.3 million U.S. dollars) and who are
obligated to invest 30 percent of the value of such contracts in
local projects.
</P>
<P>
He said the Forum was within the government's efforts to
encourage investment in Kuwait and seek better alternatives for
offset projects.
</P>
<P>
The offset program is chiefly aimed at benefiting from the
expertise of leading foreign firms in establishing key state
projects, obtaining state-of-the-art technology and conducting
studies.
</P>
<P>
It also seeks to create job opportunities for kuwaitis through
executing industrial and trade projects. The minister also
expressed hope that the offset program would contribute to the
development of national human resources through the creation of
various educational and training opportunities.
</P>
<P>
He added that positive results have been achieved since the
implementation of the offset program started by the Kuwaiti
government in July, 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is to set up a new
computerized medical data base aimed at improving medical care
efficiency for the 1.6 million residents living in country,
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Abdul Rahman al-Mohailan said in an opening
address to the second national conference on health data today
that his ministry is to establish a new computerized medical data
base in order to save time and provide information needed by
various health sectors by linking them to a network named "Afia
Network."
</P>
<P>
He said through this network, a doctor at any medical center
would quickly obtain a comprehensive file on each patient
visiting him and assist the patients on the required prescription
in addition to various other services including the possibility
of directly contacting other international health centers.
</P>
<P>
Work on the network and its computers was expected to start
within a few months, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 45,000 people go to see doctors in various medical
centers across the country each day in this tiny emirate of 1.6
million people.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the health minister also announced a plan to
establish a satellite medical network to connect with the medical
centers in other developed countries such as the U.S. to enable
doctors here to conduct treatment and diagnoses for a patient
jointly with their counterparts in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The executive director of the project, Hana Razouk, said the
establishment of the health data base would be implemented under
international and highly developed specifications.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Kawasaki today became the first major
Japanese city to allow foreign nationals to sit an exam to select
municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
The Kawasaki municipal government decided to scrap the
nationality requirement despite opposition from the Home Affairs
Ministry which prefers all public servants should be Japanese
nationals, especially those holding administrative positions.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has argued that only 182 of its 3,500
employees hold administrative positions.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government's personnel department will start
distributing application forms later this month and hold the exam
on June 30, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The scrapping of the nationality requirement, however, is
conditional on a municipal stipulation that foreign nationals will
not be promoted to posts higher than section chief.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Home Affairs Ministry have reportedly
expressed concern about the stipulation, arguing that it
constitutes discrimination against foreigners.

<HEADLINE> Clarke Warns He May Not Deliver Big Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke Sunday night gave his toughest warning yet that he
may not be able to deliver tax cuts in this autumn's budget due to
the beef crisis and Treasury revenue forecast error.
</P>
<P>
Clarke said in a BBC interview that the beef crisis had already
cost the government at least one billion pounds (1.5 billion US
dollars) and had severely restricted his scope for tax cuts which
are in jeopardy because of higher than expected public borrowing
and a mistake in tax revenue forecast.
</P>
<P>
He conceded that public borrowing was higher than he had
expected and the Treasury had made a mistake in its revenue
forecasts and had less tax coming in than had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor said his scope for cutting taxes had been
limited by a shortfall in revenues, which meant borrowing was
running above the forecast of 22.5 billion pounds (33.8 billion US
dollars) for the year.
</P>
<P>
Clarke also said that cutting taxes was not essential for a
Tory election victory.
</P>
<P>
"People who think tax cuts equals election victory are, I'm
afraid, seriously mistaken," he said, referring to demands for him
to reduce the basic income tax rate by between one percent to
three percent.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his assertion that the budget would contain tax
cuts "only if we can afford them" and if it was in the interests
of the economy, and added that the public was not "that stupid" to
expect reductions in any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor's remarks alarmed Tory MPs and party
strategists, who are banking on tax reductions as the backbone of
their general election campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Drug Law
Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) today accused the International
Nacortics Control Board (INCB) of playing double standard in
terms of the country's efforts against illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
The accusation is made by NDLEA press secretary Abiodun
Adesola in reacting to an allegation by the INCB chief Robert
Gilboa of the United States that Nigeria remained a drug
trafficking nation.
</P>
<P>
Adesola said the United States has sent several congratulatory
messages to his agency for its achievements in fighting against
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
He wondered why after sending those messages, the United
States would still label Nigeria a drug trafficking nation.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. is truly concerned, the government there will
step up its activities at stemming the insatiable drug
consumption habit of her nationals," Adesola said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States has chosen to politicize the
drug issue by pointing accusing fingers at Nigeria in order to
cover up its own shortcomings.

The new fighter will be capable of dogfighting like the old
F-16, juddering aircraft carrier launches like he F-18 and STOVL
(short take-off, vertical landing) like the Harrier, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
As the new fighter plane is relatively low cost, both Pentagon
and the British MOD are expected to place a large order.
</P>
<P>
Military experts predict that the new vertical landing plane,
with a potential export market of up to 2,000, is expected to be
the defining aircraft precurement for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, three designs have been put forward and American
officials, assisted by British experts, would choose two of the
competitors to build full-scale aircraft for what is called the
Concept Demonstration phase.
</P>
<P>
After the Concept Demonstration phase, the winning option is
scheduled to begin construction in 2005 with delivery in 2007.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Says Liberian Refugees Should Go Back to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Ghana said today it did not want to
encourage an exodus of refugees from war-torn Liberia because the
West African peacekeepers planned to make Monrovia, the capital
of Liberia, a save haven within the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted Ghanaian Deputy Foreign
Minister Mahamed Ibn Chambas as saying that a freighter off
Ghana's coast crammed with thousands of Liberian refugees should
return to Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian vessel, Bulk Challen, was forced to resume its
search for a friendly port in West Africa late on Sunday after
stopping briefly in Ghana's Takoradi Port, being refueled with
its 4,000 passengers being fed and treated by medical workers.
</P>
<P>
A report from the port said that three people had died on the
creaking vessel, a woman who bled uncontrollably and two men who
were killed in an unexpected shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
The next destination of the freighter might be Lagos because
the passengers included 200 Nigerian peacekeeping soldiers from
Liberia, according to port officials.
</P>
<P>
Some international aid workers speculated upon Lome as a
destination, which is the capital of Togo, the nearest port
eastwards after Ghana.
</P>
<P>
But Chambas said the West African peacekeeping force had
already created a safe area in the Liberian capital where the
refugees could go and their security would be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"So there is no reason for there to be a stampede to leave
Monrovia. To accept the passengers on this boat in my West
African country would be to encourage an exodus from Monrovia,
which is absolutely not necessary," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, report said that thousands of Liberians have crowded
around Monrovia's port in hopes of getting onto any departing
boats because of the violence of a festering six-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Aid workers say an estimated 20,000 Liberians could now be in
boats in choppy West African waters and they were working out
plans to monitor the coast for those in distress.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Asylum for Liberian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) Monday called for West African countries to
open their door to thousands of new Liberian refugees fleeing
fighting in Liberian capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
The UN agency in charge of refugee issues made the appeal after
it repeatedly failed to make Liberia's neighbouring countries
allow some 4,300 Liberian people aboard ships to go on shore.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said the Nigerian freighter Bulk Challege was still
looking for a port to disembark the some 3,600 people aboard who
had been rejected by Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, and the Victory
Reefer was off Sierra Leone which had denied its 700 passengers
landing.
</P>
<P>
High commissioner Sadako Ogata voiced concern about the
situation of these people who have been at sea for some days,
saying "The situation has become desperate. Unless the door is
opened to them, a lot of people, many of them women and children,
may die."
</P>
<P>
She appealed for continued generosity of countries in the
region to grant asylum to the newly-made Liberian refugees, adding
that UNHCR was prepared to help the countries doing so in full
complaince with internationally accepted humanitarian standards.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are more than 750,000 Liberian refugees in
West Africa, 410,000 of them in Guinea, 305,000 in Cote d'Ivoire,
15,000 in Ghana, 4,700 in Sierra Leone and 4,000 in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Intensive Contacts in Beirut on Eve of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz carried out today intensive diplomatic consultations on
the eve of the second meeting of representatives from the five
member states of a proposed committee monitoring the cease-fire
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli occupation forces continued today bombardment
at southern Lebanese villages, which was accompanied by an air
raid, on the second successive day, in an apparent pressure on
this country.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz met with Victor Posovalyuk, Russian special envoy and
deputy foreign minister, in the office here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official announced that his talks with Boueiz
dealt with the cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon
and Israel on April 26 as well as all the details related to the
proposed monitoring and consultative committees.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the advantage of joint efforts between the
countries for the achievement of peace in the region, and
criticized a "U.S. exclusion" in the Middle East politics, noting
"the recent events have affirmed that there is no room for an
exclusive work in the politics in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
On the April 26 understanding which ended 17 days of Israeli
military strikes in south Lebanon, the Russian envoy said, "We
are with the April understanding on principle, despite some
points which we do not agree with."
</P>
<P>
He underlined a necessity "not to give the monitoring
committee any political color," adding that the committee should
"only have a technical nature."
</P>
<P>
Posovalyuk expected that the military escalation in south
Lebanon Sunday would be discussed in the meeting of
representatives from the United States, France, Israel, Syria and
Lebanon in Washington Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz received this afternoon a telephone call from his
Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency reported that
during the telephone conversation, the two foreign ministers
discussed "the ideas and papers they have received on the
composition of the monitoring committee and the way of its work,
in addition to the latest development of the situation in light of
the military escalation in south Lebanon Sunday."
</P>
<P>
Three papers, put forward by the United States, France and
Syria-Lebanon respectively, will be discussed in the second
meeting of the five states' representatives. The first meeting
was held last Friday without any concrete result.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister also held talks with French
Ambassador to Lebanon Jean-Pierre Lafon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli artillery today continued
shelling south Lebanese villages without causing casualties, on
the second successive day following guerrilla attacks at Israeli
occupation forces in which five Israeli soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters carried out this afternoon an air raid at
suspected guerrilla bases between the villages of Loueizeh and
Sejoud in which the helicopters fired at least two air-to-surface
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, launched attacks on an Israeli patrol and an outpost in the
Israeli-occupied buffer zone in south Lebanon Sunday morning,
wounding five Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The attacks, the first since last month's 17-day Israeli blitz
on Lebanon, drew Israel's rapid retaliation by bombardment and
air raid.
</P>
<P>
The question is, however, whether the attacks could be
regarded as a breach of the cease-fire understanding.
</P>
<P>
The April cease-fire understanding banned firing from or at
civilian areas but did not rule out attacks by Hezbollah
guerrillas at Israeli targets in the 15-kilometer wide border
strip and allowed both sides the right of self-defense.

Croats to a cemetery in the north of the Serb Republika Srpska on
Sunday passed without any incidents, Tanjug news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR Information Bureau said it was the first time since
the end of the war in Bosnia that a large group of people had been
able to cross the former front line without encountering
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the 4th Battalion, U.S. Col. Neal Anderson said
the visit was "a superb precedent for future visits" and would
help to build "confidence that the local officials can work
together."
</P>
<P>
Last month witnessed several clashes between the Serbs and
Muslim refugees who wish to cross into the Serb land to see their
old homes and visit their cemeteries. Two people were dead and a
dozen more injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Anderson said IFOR could not force the Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation into arranging successful visits if they
had not been willing to do so.
</P>
<P>
The group reached the cemetery in open trailers driven by
tractors and mourned for their deceased relatives, the agency
added.
</P>
<P>
While a Franciscan served a Mass at the cemetery, Serb
policeman stood alongside the U.N. policemen and IFOR troops to
prevent for any incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said today that Israel Sunday refrained from stern reaction
to Hezbollah attacks in the Israeli self-styled "security zone" in
order to avoid a new flare-up of fighting, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Peres told reporters that Israel replied in a measured way
because it is not interested in any escalation of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He described the two Hezbollah (Party of God) attacks as
"borderline violations" of the understanding reached on April 26
for the ceasefire in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ehud Barak told the Knesset
(parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the
Israeli army's reaction showed it still has freedom of action in
the "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He also said he believed that the understanding may last beyond
the May 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes Sunday blasted suspected Hezbollah targets
north of the "security zone" following Hezbollah attacks which
wounded five Israeli armymen, including three
officers, in the "security zone's" northeastern sector.
</P>
<P>
They were the first army casualties since the understanding
that ended Operation Grapes Wrath came into effect on April
27. The five men, all suffering from shrapnel wounds, underwent
surgery in a Haifa hospital Sunday. They are reportedly improving
today.

<HEADLINE> Four Israelis Wounded in Militants' Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Four Israelis were injured
today, one of them seriously, in militants' attack near the
Jewish settlement of Beit El, north of Jerusalem in the West
Bank, according to an Israel Television report.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred as the militants, reportedly driving a gray
Subaru car, fired repeatedly at a private bus carrying workers of
the Palestinian-Israeli District Coordination Office in the area.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the bus was bullet-proof, and no one was
seriously hurt, though two passengers were slightly wounded with
scratches.
</P>
<P>
The militants then drove to the entrance of Beit El, and
opened fire on the Israelis waiting at a bus stop there,
critically injuring one of them with a bullet in the head and
another one with shot in the back.
</P>
<P>
According to eye-witnesses, the militants managed to get away
in the direction to a Palestinian refugee camp nearby, then they
reportedly abandoned their vehicle and escaped on foot.
</P>
<P>
At this hour, the Israeli army is conducting a massive manhunt
for the militants with helicopters and ground forces, after
declaring the area a closed military zone.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Israeli opposition parties charged that today's
attack is the direct result of the government's policy, blaming
the government for giving up the control of security in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Etain, chairman of the right-wing Tzomet party which
has formed a joint list with the Likud and the Gesher Party in
the upcoming elections, called on the Israeli army to retake the
initiative.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak
told the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee today that there is a possibility of tightening the
closure on the Palestinian autonomous areas because of militants'
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip since a series of suicide bombing attacks against Israelis
occurred in late February and March, which killed at least 60
people and wounded over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official earlier told Xinhua that the closure, which
barred tens of thousands of Palestinians from returning to their
jobs inside Israel, would not be lifted until after the Israeli
general elections on May 29.

<HEADLINE> African Traditional Herbs Symposium Opens In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The sixth OAU Scientific,
Technical and Research Commission (STRC) symposium on African
traditional medicinal plants opened here today, calling for
devising means of modernizing traditional medicines in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Uganda's Minister of State for Health
Bart Katureebe while officiating the five-day symposium at the
Uganda International Conference Center in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Katureebe told the meeting that the Ugandan government
recognized traditional practitioners and to this effect a health
review commission had been set up to promote research programs in
the field of traditional medicines.
</P>
<P>
He said the government supported traditional medicine
practitioners by amalgamating them with the western modernized
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Professor Johnson Ekpere, Executive Secretary of the
Lagos-based STRC of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), said
that 80 percent of the people in the world depended on
traditional medicine and medicinal plants for health security.
</P>
<P>
More than two thirds of the world's plant species came from
developing countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
He therefore expressed need for capacity building through
international cooperation in the conservation, development and
standardization of herbal medicines in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The symposium will also focus on the development of
traditional medicine and use of traditional drugs in primary
health care and research development of drugs from medicinal
plants in Africa.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 countries are being represented at the symposium,
including Congo, Burkina Fasso, Benin, Cameroon, Madagascar,
Gambia, Egypt, Eritrea, Kenya and Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic and U.N. Administrator of Eastern Slavonia Jacques Klein
held talks here today to discuss the region's economic recovery
and development.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, Klein had told Kontic that international
community was ready to invest some funds in the region and that
the transitional administration had proposed five projects to
boost the local economy, according to the Yugoslav Information
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Slavonia is situated in the northeastern Croatia
bordering Yugoslavia and is the only one of the four Serb regions
in Croatia that was not occupied by the government troops in 1995.
An agreement signed in November 1995 placed the region under
one-year U.N. administration with the possibility of extending the
transitional period for another 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Klein said that a number of international organizations were
interested in opening offices in the region, which is another
factor in securing the implementation of the basic agreement.
</P>
<P>
Kontic, meanwhile, stressed the importance of efficient
functioning of international institutions in restoring confidence,
security and cooperation of the region's entire population.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that regional autonomy and economic recovery
were specially important and key issues concerning to all, the
secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
Kontic and Klein also spoke highly of the reopening of the
Belgrade-Zagreb highway and oil pipeline between the two countries
last Tuesday, regarding it as an important step in the
normalization of the Serb-Croatian relations.

UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended a 6-month extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO) at a reduced strength.

He noted that the required willingness does not exist to give
MINURSO the cooperation needed for it to resume and complete the

The report dated May 8 recommended that the identification
process be suspended until such time as both parties provide
convincing evidence that they are committed to resuming and
completing it without further obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief proposed that the strength of the military
component of MINURSO be reduced from 288 to 230 personnel and the
civilian police component withdrawn except for a small number of
officers to maintain contacts with both sides.
</P>
<P>
However, the United Nations cannot abandon its responsibility
and the international community must remain determined to see not
only peace maintained in the region but every effort made for the
people of Western Sahara to decide on their future status in a way
that will bring lasting peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Western Sahara in northwest Africa was under Spanish rule
before 1976. After Spanish withdrawal, Morocco announced
annexation of the area while the POLISARIO front fought for
independence.
</P>
<P>
With help of U.N. and the Organization of African Unity,
Morocco and POLISARIO front signed a document referred to as the
settlement plan in 1988. According to the document, the people of
Western Sahara would choose between independence and integration
with Morocco in their exercise of their right to
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council established MINURSO in 1991 to verify
the cease-fire and cessation of hostilities, identify and register
qualified voters and organize and ensure a free referendum. The
referendum should have taken place in January 1992, according to
settlement plan. However, it was postponed agains and again
because of the two parties' difference over voter eligibility,
release of political prisoners and other issues.

<HEADLINE> 1 Israeli Killed, 3 Wounded in Militants' Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 13 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli was killed and three
others were wounded in militants' attack near the Jewish
settlement of Beit El, north of Jerusalem in the West Bank,
according to an Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred as the militants, reportedly driving a gray
Subaru car, fired repeatedly at a private bus carrying workers of
the Palestinian-Israeli District Coordination Office in the area.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the bus was bullet-proof, and no one was
seriously hurt, though two passengers were slightly wounded with
scratches.
</P>
<P>
The militants then drove to the entrance of Beit El, and
opened fire on the Israelis waiting at a bus stop there,
critically injuring two Yeshiva (Jewish religious seminar)
students from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
David Boim, 17, was wounded in his head by a bullet, while his
friend, Yael Grinban, was shot in the back.
</P>
<P>
Both were rushed to the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, where
Boim died from his injuries, while Grinban is still in serious
condition, according to doctors from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to eye-witnesses, the militants managed to get away
in the direction to a Palestinian refugee camp nearby, then they
reportedly abandoned their vehicle, and escaped on foot.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army declared the area a closed military zone
immediately after the incident, and has been conducting a massive
manhunt for the terrorists with helicopters and ground forces.

<HEADLINE> World Information Conference Opens In S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Ye Xingzeng and Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
MIDRAND (South Africa), May 13 (Xinhua) -- The International
Conference on Information Society and Development (ISAD) was
officially opened here by South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki
this evening.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 delegates from about 50 countries around the
world attended the opening ceremony of the conference, chaired by
South African Posts and Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Mbeki said the entry into the
information society should not be reserved for the developed
countries only, the debate about the information society was
indeed of relevance to all humanity.
</P>
<P>
Referring to intellectual property, which was an important
pillar in building global information society, Mbeki said the
issue of intellectual property rights continued to be a bone of
contention among the nations and deserved serious and fair
consideration by the international community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said although the path to the information society did not
widen the gap between rich and poor, developed and developing
countries, the realities of imbalance and domination between them
must be dealt with more by empowering the south through
cooperation and openness and mutually beneficial contributions.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the pivotal role the government could play
in the building of the information society, Mbeki also appealed
to private sectors and civil communities to play its role in the
process.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that common strategies should be adopted
to seize the technological opportunities presented today for the
benefit of all nations, developed and developing alike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a speech addressed to the ISAD conference in
Washington via satellite, United States Vice-President Al Gore
announced a five-year project to help provide internet access in
20 African nations.
</P>
<P>
Gore urged the conference to use the opportunity to discuss
how all nations could be full participants in the information
age, finding ways to upgrade the quality of life of the people
across the world.
</P>
<P>
Among dignitaries attended the conference included the
European Union President Jacques Santer, Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology Ben Ngubane, Deputy Foreign
Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad.

<HEADLINE> US Gasoline Prices Up, Increase Pace Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Prices in U.S. gasoline stations
rose slightly in the past two weeks, a sign that the rate of
recent price increases appeared to slow down.
</P>
<P>
The average price, including taxes, of gasoline for all grades
was 137.96 cents per gallon as of May 10, an increase of 1.62
cents a gallon in two weeks, according to the latest Lundberg
Survey, based in Los Angles, of 10,000 gasoline stations.
</P>
<P>
That compares to the average 136.34 cents on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The rate of increase equals the rate in February and is less
than half the rates reported in March and April, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Motorists have seen sharp price increases in recent weeks. But
the most recent jump is lower than that reported during the
two-week period between April 12 and April 26, when the average
national price rose five cents.
</P>
<P>
In California, prices went up eight cents during that period,
compared to less than three cents in the most recent survey.
</P>
<P>
To ease the soaring gasoline prices in the U.S., President Bill
Clinton ordered on April 29 to sell 12 million barrels of oil from
the nation's strategic petroleum reserve, beginning from this
month, and asked the Energy Department to find the real cause
behind the surging of prices.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans in the U.S. Congress also took the advantage to
call for the repeal of a 4.3 cents-a-gallon gasoline tax increase
imposed by the government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In a survey released last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve took
the view that the increase of gasoline prices was likely to be
temporary and would not lead to an overall inflation spiral in the
country.
</P>
<P>
U.S. business leaders also predicted recently that the current
soaring of gasoline prices will be short-lived.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 867 Mln Dlr Stand-By Credit for Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved a nine-month stand-by credit for Ukraine
totaling some 867 million U.S. dollars to back the government's
1996 economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
The government's policies are aimed to resuming the
stabilization and liberalization of the economy. The key policy
objectives are to reduce inflation to about 1-2 percent per month
by the end of this year, to limit the decline of output, and to
realize the country's economic potential.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 program is designed to reduce the consolidated budget
deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP this year from 5 percent of GDP in
1995. For the purpose, the Ukraine government plans to introduce
further structural reforms in 1996 to create conditions for a
sustainable recovery in output so as to accelerate the auctions of
state enterprises with the aim by the end of 1996 of privatizing
at least 70 percent of the shares in a total of 5,000 medium and
large enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The country's program in 1996 is expected to be supported by
external financing official flows of about 2 billion dollars from
multilateral and bilateral creditors.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine joined the IMF in September 1992. Its quota is an about
1,446 million dollar equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF
credit currently totals about 1,503 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's New Cabinet Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 13 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today announced four new cabinet ministers to fill
the gaps left by the withdrawal of the National Party (NP) from
the government of national unity on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a press conference in Cape Town,
Mandela said he had decided to move quickly to allow the
appointees to familiarize themselves with their new tasks and to
wind down their business in other departments.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had also taken into account the government's
commitment to rationalize and streamline its activities as much
as practicable.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President and NP leader F. W. De Klerk and Inkatha
Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had been consulted
about the appointments, added the president.
</P>
<P>
The new ministers, whose appointments would take effect from
July 1, are Pallo Jordan, minister of environment affairs,
Geraldine Fraser Moleketi, minister of welfare and population
development, Mohammed Valli Moosa, minister of provincial affairs
and constitutional development, Pennuell Maduna, minister of
mineral and energy affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with the abolishment of the post of general
services minister and merger of agriculture portfolio into the
Land Affairs Ministry, the 27-member cabinet was reduced to 25.
</P>
<P>
However, announcements would be made ''in due course'' to fill
the deputy ministerships left by the NP's withdrawal, said
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the announcement, NP spokesman Johan
Steenkamp said his party welcomed the fact that Mandela had used
the opportunity to introduce ''moderate rationalization'' in the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Steenkamp said the NP was satisfied that the new appointees
already had a certain measure of experience.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Diplomat on UN Information Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese diplomat said
today that the U.N. Department of Public Information (DPI) should
take as its primary task the establishment of a new international
information and communication order based on the recognition of
differences among nations.
</P>
<P>
"To establish a just and equitable new international
information and communication order is the general desire of the
developing countries as well as an important component of the
establishment of a new international political and economic
order," said Counselor Yafei He in a speech delivered at the 18th
session of the U.N. Committee on Information.
</P>
<P>
"The DPI should take the establishment of a new international
information and communication order based on the recognition of
the diversity of the world and the differences among nations as
its primary task," he added.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he said, priority should be given to the urgent
needs of the developing countries, helping them to improve their
infrastructure and narrow the information gap with the developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
On the use of the Internet and CD-ROMs, he said that while the
effort by the DPI was commendable, such traditional media as
printed matter, radio and television remained indispensable
because many developing countries could hardly keep pace with the
rapidly developing modern information technology due to shortages
of resources, personnel and technology.

<HEADLINE> Japan Faces New Threat of Higher Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan, Asia's leading economic
power, is facing a new threat: rising interest rates, which may
also have an impact on the U.S. and other markets.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that for two years, the
Bank of Japan has been trying hard to drive short-term interest
rates down to a scant 0.5 percent in an effort to prod the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that the Japanese central bank will probably
raise interest rates within a month because the country's economy
has revived, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But the bank also faces a dilemma: Raise rates too quickly and
it could snuff out what is still a fragile upturn. Keep rates too
low, though, and inflation could emerge as a serious threat,
forcing harsher monetary tightening later.
</P>
<P>
Some say the country's retail activity is showing signs of a
"significant surge." And unemployment is expected to drop further.
The Nikkei 225-stock index has been up 48 percent since last
summer.
</P>
<P>
Japanese exporters do not like rate raising either, because
their profits are closely tied to currency rates. The value of
the U.S. dollar has fallen about 4 percent against the yen
during the past month, trading now at about 105 yen, from nearly
109 in April. Some big exporters lost billions of yen in
profits, according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
Overseas as well, the prospect of a Japanese interest-rate
boost causes concern. Many economists contend that low Japanese
rates in 1995 contributed to something of a global liquidity
bubble. Essentially, investors have taken the money from
Japanese banks and placed in the U.S. financial market.
</P>
<P>
Now many people may fear that the Federal Reserve of the U.S.
may consider boosting interest rates later this year at the
prompt of the action of the Bank of Japan.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The fourth round of
oil-for-food talks between the U.N. and Iraq would not reach a
deal before U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's return
from a visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said today that the
secretary-general had spent a great deal of his weekend in
discussion on the oil-for-food formula both in person and on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that there was still some work to
be done and he hoped a memorandum of understanding would be
concluded when he got back from his trip to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali started his visit to Moscow this afternoon and
will return to New York at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its invasion
of Kuwait in August 1990. The long-term sanctions have crippled
Iraq's economy and brought many hardships to its people.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted Resolution 986 in April 1995 to
allow Iraq to export 2 billion dollars' worth of oil in six months
for the import of food, medicine and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretariat and Iraq began talks on the implementation
of the resolution in February and no deal has been reached yet.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Make 4-Day Visit to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac is
to make a four-day state visit to Britain from Tuesday, with the
BSE shadow following the French president closely during the
visit.
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who is the first French president to visit Britain in
12 years, is expected to voice solidarity with his British host
Queen Elizabeth II and will be pressed to support a partial
lifting of the European Union (EU) ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The Buckingham Palace announced recently that Queen Elizabeth
will serve British beef at lunch soon after Chirac arrives in
London by Eurostar train.
</P>
<P>
A senior British government official has strongly indicated
that France, which was the first European country to declare a ban
on British beef, would back a lifting of the seven-week-old ban.
</P>
<P>
However, French officials have reportedly ruled out a dramatic
initiative saying that any premature, over-hasty measure could
prove counter-productive if it did not restore consumers'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day visit, Chirac will hold talks with British
Prime Minister John Major Wednesday to exchange views on various
issues from the beef crisis to European integration.
</P>
<P>
The French president is also to make a rare address to both
houses of the British parliament and hold talks with business
leaders.

<P>
BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) declined today a Bosnian Muslim demand for the
release of seven Muslims accused as terrorists by the Serb
authorities.
</P>
<P>
An IFOR officer who asked not to be named said they had
rejected the demand from the Muslim side.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb News Agency SRNA said today Vice President of
the Muslim-Croat federation Ejup Ganic had requested the release
of the group in talks with IFOR Deputy Commander Gen. Jean
Heinrich.
</P>
<P>
Heinrich informed Ganic that an investigation was under way to
determine the circumstances of their arrest.
</P>
<P>
According to SRNA, the seven Muslims were arrested in the
Bosnian Serb territory and they were under the Serb police
detention.
</P>
<P>
It said the Muslim group, which was arrested in the village of
Planinci near the eastern Bosnian Serb town of Zvornik on May 10,
was armed with explosive devices, firearms and cold steel.
</P>
<P>
The group has confessed to the Zvornik Public Security Center

<HEADLINE> Quebec Premier Rules Out Snap Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 13 (Xinhua) -- Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard ruled
out today a snap election though the Canadian federal government
had entered into a court case aimed to stop Quebec province from
holding another referendum.
</P>
<P>
Montreal lawyer Guy Bertrand has filed a legal case in the
Quebec Supreme Court against the Quebec government's claim to a
right of unilateral secession. The case just opened today in the
city of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian federal government is stepping in to say that
Quebec independence can only be achieved through the consensus,
under the Canadian Constitution, of Ottawa and other Canadian
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec provincial government is arguing that independence
can be achieved following a Yes vote in a referendum, and that
international law says that people can vote themselves
independent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier press reports suggested that the Quebec provincial
government might call a snap election over Ottawa's intervention
of the legal case.
</P>
<P>
Following an emergency cabinet meeting today, Premier Bouchard
declared that no snap election will be called in his province.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing of a government is to govern," Bouchard told a
new conference today, which was carried live by the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Quebec will maintain its course of policy, that is, economy,
job creation and reconciliation among all Quebeckers, the premier
stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, Bouchard said that he will put a motion before
Quebec's National Assembly, urging all members to say that Quebec
can indeed vote themselves independent.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard also said that he has canceled a meeting this week
with Premier Jean Chretien. The meeting would be a "confrontation"
to be held now, he added.

<HEADLINE> Klein: Real Progress Made in Normalizing Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 13 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official said here today
that real progress had been made in the implementation of the
agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, United
Nations Transitional Administrator in Eastern Slavonia Jacques
Klein said that as long as all the interested parties supported
the initiated process, which was the case at present, the peace
plan signed late last year for the region would be implemented.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the Dayton agreement, representatives of the
local Serbs and the Croatian government agreed at the end of last
year that the Serb-dominated region would be placed under U.N.
administration for one year, with the possibility of extending the
transitional period for another year.
</P>
<P>
Klein mentioned the reopening of the Belgrade-Zagreb highway,
which passes through the region, as well as the reopening of the
oil pipeline and telephone lines with Croatia in the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing right now, he stressed, was to carry
out demilitarization in the region.
</P>
<P>
Klein said he expected the demilitarization to start in the
next few weeks and troops from various countries would be deployed
in the region to safeguard the local population.
</P>
<P>
He said he had proposed to the Council of Europe to open its
office in the region, which, in his view, should show the locals
that there was international support behind all activities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia is the only Serb region in Croatia which is
still under the Serb control. All the other three parts were
seized by force by the government troops last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the reconstruction of the region, Klein said
that the European Union had already offered 40 million ECUs and
the U.S. government 9.7 million dollars for reconstruction

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Tougher Penalties for Juvenile Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called for tougher measures against juvenile violence.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked for stiffer penalties and improved cooperation by
police. Authorities should exchange information, work together on
investigations and keep better track of gang members, he said at a
ceremony on combating gangs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton proposed legislation to restore a ban on guns in
schools and allow juveniles to be prosecuted as adults for drug
conspiracy, violent crimes and crimes involving guns.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has on many occasions talked of the need to address an
alarming increase in juvenile crimes at a time when overall crime
in the nation tends to go down.
</P>
<P>
Warning gang members, Clinton said the message today is clear:
"We mean to put you out of business, to break the backs of your
organization, to stop you from terrorizing our neighborhoods and our
children, to put you away for a long time."
</P>
<P>
The FBI has reported that while overall crime fell 2 percent
last year and violent crime fell by 4 percent, there was a 22
percent increase in the murder rate among teen-agers between 1990
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno gave Clinton a report that says 95
percent of the nation's largest cities and 88 percent of smaller
cities are experiencing gang-related crime.
</P>
<P>
Reno said crime may be falling overall, but youth crime has
been rising since 1985.
</P>
<P>
She said one of the toughest parts of the youth violence
program and problem is the fight against the gangs. Reasonable
estimates indicate that there are now more than a half million
gang members in more than 16,000 gangs on the streets of the
cities, she said. There were 580,000 gang-related crimes in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Auto Parts Industry Booming in Jilin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Auto parts and accessories
manufacturing has become fast growing industry in northeast
China's Jilin Province, where headquarters of the First Automotive
Work (FAW) Group is based.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 100-plus factories have been set up in the province,
producing 1.1 billion yuan (130 million US dollars) worth of auto
parts and accessories a year.
</P>
<P>
The FAW, one of China's largest auto makers, gets 40 per cent
of its supporting parts from these neighboring enterprises,
ranging from machinery to electronics and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
When China's auto industry came into being in the 1950s, there
were only eleven auto parts producers in Jilin, with an annual
output value of two million yuan (235,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In later 1980s when FAW listed the development of light-duty
vehicles and sedan cars on its top agenda, local auto parts
industry began springing up, and has emerged as the pillar sector
in some cities.
</P>
<P>
Booming auto parts industry has drawn overseas capital and
techniques, with a dozen joint ventures being built.
</P>
<P>
The province has mapped out development programs for supporting
industries, and decided to pump 1.7 billion yuan (200 million US
dollars) into technical renovations and developing new
products.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Host Next Miss Universe Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 14 (Xinhua)-- The next miss universe pageant
will be held in Joahannesburg, South Africa, organisers of the
event announced yesterday at the close of this year's contest in
Windhoek, capital of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The pageant was held in Africa for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Windhoek, Miss USA, 21-year-old
Chelsi Smith, walked off with the title. Miss India, Manpreet
Brar, 21, was the second and Miss Canada, Lana Buchburger, 20,
took the third place.
</P>
<P>
The Windhoek pageant cost the government of Namibia and local
sponsors an estimated 16 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors spent 6.94 million u.s. dollars on accommodating,
transporting, feeding and entertaining the 82 beauty queens,
according to estimates by Miss Universe Incorporated.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the high cost of staging the pageant in the Philippines
resulted in public demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Miss Universe President Marty Brooks said planning for the South
African show would begin tomorrow. enditem

<HEADLINE> Banks Repaying Central Bank's Refinanced Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Major Chinese banks are paying back
</P>
<P>
refinanced loans to the People's bank of China (PBC), the
country's central bank, in response to its tightened monetary
policies.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Bank of China (BOC), the country's biggest
foreign exchange dealer, said that up to last weekend, BOC has
repaid 10 billion yuan to the central bank, doubling the central
bank's projected figure to withdraw refinanced loans from the bank
during the first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The People's Construction Bank of China (PCBC) has paid back 2
billion yuan in the January-April period. But an official with the
biggest capital construction bank assured that there would be "no
problem" for PCBC to fulfill the loan repayment of five billion
yuan demanded by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
PCBC last year cleared up 16 billion yuan of its debts to the
central bank, contributing greatly to the country's anti-inflation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawing refinanced loans from the state banks has become
one of major means for the PBC to reduce money supply and cut
money stocks built over the past few years. It plans to withdraw
30 billion to 50 billion yuan from refinanced loans in the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the central bank has witnessed a sharp increase in
individuals saving accounts and a considerable amount of cash
withdrawed from circulation, the money supply, the most important
indicator of China's financial situation, kept staying high as
35.9 percent during the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The excessive money supply has aroused central bank's concern,
and its vice governor Chen Yuan vowed last weekend to place
stricter control over credits and lendings.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the credit squeeze expects to remain
throughout the year since the current financial situation still
leaves much to be desired.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Popularizes Labor Contract System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- This leading industrial city in
southwest China is to introduce the labor contract system to
enterprises of all ownerships this year, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
The system will not only be carried out at state-owned,
share-holding, township-run, foreign-funded, privately-owned and
individually-run enterprises but also be introduced to government
departments and institutions.
</P>
<P>
As the earliest city to practise the labor contract system,
enterprises in this city began to sign contracts with the
employees as early as 1986.
</P>
<P>
So far, 450,000 workers, or 30 percent of the total workforce
in the city, have signed labor contracts with their employers.
</P>
<P>
The city government urged local enterprises to implement the
labor contract system step by step. Many enterprises have signed
contracts ranging anything from five to 10 years with senior
workers, key technicians and demobilized soldiers.
</P>
<P>
A new employment mechanism has been built at some large
state-owned enterprises including the Chongqing Iron and Steel
Company, leading industrial firm in the city.
</P>
<P>
It is reported the contract system will be spread to all parts
of the country by the end of next year except a very few special
cases.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says Israeli Confiscation of Arab lands Contrary to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's permanent representative to
the U.N., Nabil al-Arabi, affirmed that the confiscation by Israel
of some occupied Arab lands in East Jerusalem is contrary to peace
and the Fourth Geneva Convention and does cast doubts on Israel's
ability to keep its pledges.
</P>
<P>
This came in his interview with the "Sawt Al-Arab" radio of
Egypt today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Arabi revealed the most important items of a draft
resolution prepared by the Arab group at the U.N., chiefly an item
calling on Israel to revoke its decision to confiscate 53 hectares
of land in Arab (East) Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Al-Arabi called the Israeli decision illegal, adding that the
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali would submit a report
on this question to the U.N. Security Council within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Al-Arabi made it clear that he did not expect the U.N. Security
Council to pass a relevant resolution during the consultations due
to take place tomorrow between the U.N. Security Council members
tomorrow, because the U.S. was still against such an idea,
preferring that the confiscation by Israel of occupied Arab lands
in East Jerusalem should be tackled within the Palestinian-Israeli
peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> I Would Discuss Possible Beijing Bid for 2004 Olympics,  Samaranch (Updated) WTTC241 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 14 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch,
president of the International Olympic Committee, said here Sunday
that he would discuss here with Chinese sports officials about a
possible Beijing bid for hosting the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased and happy to be in the People's Republic of
China once again and with my old friends from China," the IOC
chief said upon his arrival here this morning. Samaranch is
scheduled to attend the closing ceremony of the 43rd World Table
Tennis Championships Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
"We would discuss in this place the possibility that Beijing
can bid for the Olympic Games of the year 2004," said Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
Beijing had failed in its bid for the 2000 Olympics, losing
narrowly to Australia's Sydney in the September 23, 1993 final
voting by IOC.
</P>
<P>
The president said he would also talk with Lollo Hammarlund,
the newly elected president of the International Table Tennis
Federation (ITTF), on the issue of adding more table tennis events
into the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
"We have to discuss with the international federation, with the
new president. And maybe after leaving Tianjin I would tell the
result of the conversation."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch also said that he expected to see a strong Chinese
table tennis team at next year's Olympic games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Table tennis, which was first introduced into Olympic games in
Seoul in 1988, has already had men's and women's singles and
doubles events in the Olympic summer games.
</P>
<P>
The ITTF is lobbying to have men's and women's team events onto
the Olympic program.
</P>
<P>
The IOC president was met at the Tianjin airport by Wu Shaozu,
China's Minister of the State Sports Commission and President of
the Chinese Olympic Committee, He Zhenliang, a member of the IOC's
executive board, Xu Yinsheng, Vice-minister of the sports

<HEADLINE> Israeli Newspaper: Ukraine Sold Missiles to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel was aware of and
protested the Ukraine's sale of eight SS-N-22 missiles to Iran
several months ago, Jerusalem Post today quoted a senior defense
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the anti-ship cruise missile is
capable of flying at 2.5 times the speed of sound at a very low
altitude, thus evading radar detection.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of those weapons systems that, following the
disintegration of the Soviet Union, we were all afraid would
eventually reach the wrong hands," said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin brought up the issue
when he met U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this month. "We
used our channels to protest to the Ukrainians," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added that the missiles present no immediate
danger to Israel, unless they can be modified for air or land
launch.
</P>
<P>
Last week, during his visit to Kiev, Clinton reportedly
discussed Ukrainian-Iranian arms deals with President Leonid
Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims that Iran poses the greatest threat to its
security. Earlier this year, Israel demonstrated against,
especially through the Americans, Russia's decision to sale
Nuclear reactors to Iran.

<P>
TIANJIN, May 14 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, met here Sunday afternoon with Juan Antonio Samaranch,
President of the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also the Honarary Chairman of the organizing
committee of the 43rd World Table Tennis Championships here,
welcomed the IOC chief to attend the championships closing
ceremony Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The assistance offered by the IOC and the International Table
Tennis Federation (ITTF) had been a key factor leading to the
success of the championships, Li said. He expressed gratitude to
the IOC chief on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
Sports events and competitions are only something temporary
while friendship is ever-lasting, Li said. The high-standard
performance and sportsmanship displayed by players during the
championships will undoubtedly be a big promotion for table tennis
and other sports in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two things are needed for hosting a major sports event --
well-planned and well-done preparation and high-standard sporting
level of the host country, Samaranch said. The successful hosting
of the world table tennis championships here demonstrated again
that China is capable of hosting even larger international
sporting events, he said.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Wu Shaozu, Minister of the
State Sports Commission and President of the Chinese Olympic
Committee, He Zhenliang, Member of the IOC Executive Board, Gao
Dezhan, Adviser to the Organizing Committee of the World Table
Tennis Championships, and Zhang Lichang, Mayor of Tianjin and

<HEADLINE> Table Tennis Faces Dark Future, ITTF Committee Chief WTTC244 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 14 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Table Tennis, which nowadays
features more spin and faster speed of the ball, has a bleak
prospect, an International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) official
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The future of table tennis is very dark," Zarco Dolinar,
Chairman of the ITTF's Science Committee, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Decades ago, in Europe we could see tennis tables in every
hotel, every school and even along the streets," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now they all disappeared. The spin destroys many infected
youth who would excel in the table tennis world," he said. "That's
a tragedy."
</P>
<P>
And to obtain powerful spins, some players resort to harmful
glues, he said.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Kim Taek Soo was disqualified from the men's
singles competition after he was found to apply on his racket a
glue which contained excessive level of toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
In last four to five years, Dolinar said, problems emerged
which had negative influence on the game.
</P>
<P>
"They include the tremendous speed of the ball, a very high
tension of nets and smaller dimension of the table," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the most serious is, the chairman pointed out, the
spin, rotating up to 140 to 170 circles per second.
</P>
<P>
"The very popular and familiar home ping-pong is now full of
deception with spin as a fundamental, essential method to win
points," said Dolinar, a doubles gold-medalist at the 1954 world
championships.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the ball's enormous velocity and rotation are
cutting short the racket-to-racket play, resulting in fading media
attention and dimishing interest of young players.
</P>
<P>
"Pure challenge accounted to only 12 to 18 percent of the
overall playing time," he said. "That is only ten minutes for a
one-hour match."
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming a sport of service," he commented.
</P>
<P>
The higher speed of the ball may also be harmful to the sport,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"You can't see bullet flying," he said. "And we are not cats
and haven't that level of response."
</P>
<P>
As the leader of the ITTF Science Committee, he vowed to fight
on to eradicate these "unhealthy elements" from the sport.
</P>
<P>
He said he had proposed for higher nets, enlargement of the
table and use of bigger balls in order to reduce the tempo of the
matches.
</P>
<P>
A witness of the sport's progress in half a century, Dolinar
also saw the vanishing sportsmanships and goodwill in
international competitions.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Holds Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Belarus today held its first
post-Soviet parliamentary elections and a referendum called by
President Alexander Lukashenko on whether to enlarge his powers,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko, who won a landslide victory last year on pledges to
root out corruption, lower prices and integrate with Russia, has
accused the current parliament, or the Supreme Soviet, of having
blocked all his reform attempts.
</P>
<P>
Lashing out at his opponents, Lukashenko urged his people to
vote in the elections and support his bid for greater powers and
closer links with Russia in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
In the referendum, voters are asked to say "yes" or "no" to the
country's economic integration with Moscow, new state symbols,
official status for the Russian language and more powers for the
president.
</P>
<P>
Pollsters forecast that Lukashenko will get most support in the
referendum and that the competition for the 260 parliamentary
seats will be very intense as there are nine candidates for each
seat.
</P>
<P>
Belarus, a former Soviet republic, is a landlocked country
lying between Russia and Poland.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Holds Parliamentary Elections, Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Belarus opened polling stations
early today for its 7.53 million voters who are to elect the
republic's first parliament since the breakup of the Soviet Union
in December 1991.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament's 250 seats are sought by 2,340 candidates.
The present Supreme Soviet, or parliament, was elected in the
Soviet era in 1990. All former Soviet republics had elected their
parliaments by that time.
</P>
<P>
News reports reaching here quoted official statistics as saying
that 43 percent of candidates run as independents, and the rest on
tickets of 14 parties.
</P>
<P>
Most of the candidates have been nominated by the Belarus
Communist Party and the Popular Front, a movement of national
liberal opposition.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls suggest that the two parties may win most of the
votes. Forecasts give 12 percent of the vote to communists and
nine percent to the Popular Front.
</P>
<P>
Other political parties with possible chances of getting
parliament seats are the Agrarians, the Democratic Party, the
social democratic movement Gromada and the Liberal Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
Also today, a national referendum is held on conferring to the
Russian language an equal status with the Belarus language, change
of national symbols, economic integration with Russia and
amendments to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is conducted on an initiative of Belarus
President Alexander Lukashenko, who insists on amending the
constitution to empower the President to dissolve the parliament.
</P>
<P>
This item of the referendum has met fierce opposition in the
present parliament and the Popular Front, a major political
force.

<HEADLINE> High Interrest Rates Reduce Zimbabwe's Breeding herd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 14 (Xinhua) -- High interest rates that are
prevailing on Zimbabwe's money market will derail efforts by
commercial farmers to rebuilt the cattle breeding stock,
according to the Commercial Cattle Producer's Association.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the association Paul d'Hotman was quoted
today by +the Sunday Mail+ as saying if interest rates were not
immediately reduced to as low as 15 percent, the breeding herd
would be further reduced.
</P>
<P>
With this year's drough, most cattle farmers would slaughter
their herd to raise money to pay off their overheads and this
could see serious shortages of beef by September, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was anticipated that with the current high level of
destocking the national breeding stock would be reduced to as low
as 450,000.
</P>
<P>
The breeding herd, which stood at 640,000 in March 1991, went
down to 525,000 in 1993 as a result of massive destocking during
the severe 1992 drought.
</P>
<P>
About 250 million Zimdollars (USD 30 million) over the next
three to five years was needed to rebuild the breeding stock, he
said, adding the money should be disbursed immediately to avoid the
further slaughter of cattle.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Technical transformation Pays Off in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Technological transformation has
enhanced the economic strength of large- and medium-sized
enterprises in Inner Mongolia, an underdeveloped but energy-rich
region in north China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the region poured 12.4 billion yuan
(about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars) into technical innovation on
3,000 projects.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the region has seen an increase of 20 billion yuan
in industrial production value, 5 billion yuan in fixed assets and
4 billion yuan in profits and taxes.  Over 70 percent of those
was achieved through technical innovation.
</P>
<P>
To date, 70 percent of equipment at hundreds of industrial
enterprises approach the level of some developed countries in the
1970s or 1980s. Those have developed 4,000 new products of modern
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
As the backbone of local industry, over 70 percent of the
large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have undergone
technological transformation. About 90 percent of the 71
newly-built enterprises resulted from such technical upgrading.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, foreign investment has been used to introduce
up-to-date production lines for garment, foodstuff processing,
cable for mining purposes and storage battery.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia's successful experience in this regard is
considered a model for underdeveloped regions, those primarily
inhabited by minority ethnic groups in particular, to develop
local economy with less investment and quick results.

<HEADLINE> Israel not to Reverse Land Expropriation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
said today that Israel will not reverse its decision to
expropriate some 550 dunams (about 136 acres) of land in east
Jerusalem despite criticism from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Rabin made the remarks during the weekly cabinet meeting in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meretz ministers and even some Labor Party ministers including
Tourism Minister Uzi Baram urged the government to cancel the plan
which they said will harm the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to Communications Minister Shulamit Aloni of the
Meretz party, Rabin and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer
promised today that any future expropriation would be with the
concurrence of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
PLO official in east Jerusalem Faisal Husseini this morning
also called on the Israeli government to cancel the expropriation
plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the plan is killing the peace process and will
have bad results for anyone.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.N. Security Council convened in a special
session to hear the Arab League case against the Israeli land
expropriation plan in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, called for by the Arab League at the request
of the PLO, condemned Israel over the issue. The Council is
scheduled to have another session on Monday.

LHASA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Japanese Co-operative protocol
says scientists of the two countries will set out for a joint
on-the-spot investigation into the wild fauna on the west side of
Hengduan mountain this winter.
</P>
<P>
This is another major step taken to reinforce all-round
protection of wild life in the Tibetan plateau, through
intensified overseas co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gu Bingyuan with China's Tibetan Plateau Biology
Research Institute and Prof. Noriyukio Ohtaishi with the Japanese
Hokkaido University, who had conducted a series of ecological
research in Tibet, are to lead the long-distance expedition.

Endowed with unique natural conditions of numerous mountains,
lakes and a spectrum of vegetation, Tibet represents an almost
intact ecological environment, which allows great varieties of
wild birds and beasts.
</P>
<P>
More than local 100 species are put under State-level
protection. Those include some species of fauna that grow only in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, local government has made pains-taking efforts
to protect the rare species.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Gu, who led a joint investigation of black-necked crane
with the U.S. Crane Species Foundation from 1991-93, asserted that
well over 70 percent of the world's existing black-necked cranes
survive the winter in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
That conclusion is of great significance for protecting the
rare bird facing imminent danger of extinction.
</P>
<P>
A joint expedition by the Tibet Plateau Biological Research
Institute and the U.S. Association of Wild Animals, which took
place in northern Tibet, had also obtained highly valuable
materials on more than 30,000 wild animals.
</P>
<P>
China expects to intensify co-operation with overseas wild life
protection organizations, Prof. Gu said.

BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The following is today's economic
news in brief.
</P>
<P>
 More Ports in Hainan
</P>
<P>
South China's Hainan Province is to construct six more new
ports this year to increase its cargo handling capacity to meet
the surging demand of trade.
</P>
<P>
The largest one among them is the Jinpai port which will have a
capacity of 30.47 million tons a year.
</P>
<P>
 Jiangxi Orange
</P>
<P>
A large orange market is under construction in Xinfeng County,
close to the Beijing-Kowloon railway in east China's Jiangxi
Province. The location is well-known for its production of
orange. Storage and processing of oranges will also be available
at the market. It is the first one of its kind in the province.
</P>
<P>
 New Concept of Flight
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Administration of China has officially
redefined the concept of a regular flight. Now the departure time
of a scheduled passenger plane is defined as the "cabin closing
time". Under the new definition, the door of the plane must be
shut upon the time set on the timetable and the plane must take
off within the following 15 minutes. This is to separate the duty
of the ground service with that of the air traffic control so as
to guarantee the punctual and safe take-off of the plane.

<P>
TIANJIN, May 14 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Deng Yaping and Qiao Hong
wrested back here Sunday the women's doubles title four years
after they lost it at the 41st World Table Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
The top seeds beat their teammates and defending champions Liu
Wei and Qiao Yunping 3-1 in the event's final at the 43rd

<P>
Deng, who beat Qiao Hong on Saturday to snatch the singles
crown, teamed up with her final rival for a golden pair formed
with the world's top two singles players.
</P>
<P>
But it still drew much effort from the reigning Olympic doubles
champions to battle for a 21-19, 21-17, 17-21, 21-19 victory.
</P>
<P>
The triumph boosted Deng's medal tally to four, three
of them gold.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that the pair won the W.J. Pope
Trophy. They won the trophy at the 40th championships held in
Dortmund, Sweden, in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Highlights Role of Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Begun
Khaleda Zia today underscored the need for maintaining the
tradition of family structure in the country to attain social

prime minister highlighted the role of families in developing
fellow feelings and sense of responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> First Port for Oil-tanker Cleaning Built in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first base for cleaning
foreign oil-tankers has been built in Zhoushan harbor in eastern
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The base, jointly developed by the Zhejiang Zhoushan Harbor
Ship Engineering Company and a Hong Kong company, has conducted
the cleaning work for 33 oil-tankers from overseas, most of which
are super-tankers with the carrying capacity above 200,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
So far, the base has earned more than 2.5 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, following the economic boom of East Asian
countries, huge amount of oil have been consumed and shipped out
from Persian Gulf regions.
</P>
<P>
China also imports large amount of crude oils to meet the fast
growing demand of domestic users, which are mostly located in the
eastern coast regions.
</P>
<P>
Located not far from Shanghai, the country's largest industrial
and economic center, and important international sea routes, the
oil-tanker cleaning base is expected to play a big role.

<HEADLINE> China Complete Clean Sweep in Table Tennis Worlds WTTC250 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 14 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Kong Linghui beat fellow
Chinese Liu Guoliang at the men's singles final to complete a
Chinese clean sweep of the gold medals at stake at the 43rd World
Table Tennis Championships Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
This is the seocnd time for Chinese to sweep championships
titles, following their giant triumph at the 1981 championships in
Novi Sad, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Kong, who upset defending world champion
Jean-Philippe Gatien of France and Swedish star Peter Karlsson in
his way to the final, crushed his penholding teammate 17-21,
21-16, 15-21, 21-14, 21-10.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who outlasted world No. 3 Jan-Ove Waldner in five sets at
the quarter-finals, clinched the opening set with better footwork
and heavy forehand smashes.
</P>
<P>
Kong, three months Liu's senior, won one set back with
well-placed shots and forehand loops.
</P>
<P>
Kong then tried to slow down the rhythm with close-to-the-net
returns and serves to Liu's backhand. But Liu kept his own pace
and put it 2-1 with merciless fast attacks.
</P>
<P>
After Kong erased a six points deficit to make it 12-all at the
fourth set, Liu was getting obviously nervous and made a few
errors to go into the decider.
</P>
<P>
Kong kept on his momentum and jumped to 13-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who seemed to lose confidence, made a string of unforced
errors to concede the title.
</P>
<P>
Chinese chopper Ding Song shared the third place with his
teammate Wang Tao, who reached the semi-finals after South Korean
Kim Taek Soo was disqualified Saturday for using a banned glue.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Fishery tribunals have recently
been added to the people's court at municipal and county levels in
Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province, to handle different kinds of maritime
disputes.
</P>
<P>
As the largest fishing ground in China, Zhoushan city has more
than 11,000 fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the number of disputes arising from fishing
has increased in the wake of a reform of managerial system.
</P>
<P>
However, these disputes had to be solved at courts in
neighboring Ningbo or Shanghai cities as local courts had no
tribunal on fishery matters.
</P>
<P>
The newly-built tribunals at Zhoushan will handle civil
maritime cases involving a sum of less than 50,000 yuan each.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Calls for Economic Takeoff of Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- China will strive to narrow the
economic gap between its coastal regions in the east and the
inland regions in the west, vice-premier Wu Bangguo said during
a recent inspection tour in northwest China's Gansu and Qinghai
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said the Party
and the central government will offer favorable treatments toward
western China in fund allocation, project approval, and other
economic policies during the country's Ninth Five-year Plan
period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Wu fully confirmed the achievements made by the two provinces
he had visited, saying that Gansu and Qinghai has experienced very
rapid economic growth during the past few years. However, due to
historical, geographical and policy reasons, the regions' economic
progress has lagged behind that of the east, he said.
</P>
<P>
In such a sense, the vice-premier said the party and government
have been encouraging the economically booming areas to actively
help the relatively poor western areas. Meanwhile, the latter
should make full use of their abundant natural resources and labor
forces and speed up their own growth with an improved market economy
and investment environment.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local governments to raise economic efficiency
instead of merely pursuing the growth of output value. Massive
reform measures should be taken to strengthen competitiveness of local
State-owned enterprises on the market.
</P>
<P>
Those money-losing enterprises with poor management or showing
no sign of recovery may be allowed to go bankrupt or be annexed,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier, who had worked with industries in Shanghai
for years, also referred to some useful measures to improve
production efficiency, such as paying the attention to product
quality, reducing the stock-piling of shoddy goods and speeding up
the circulation of funds.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Tighten Control of Gem Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
announced a plan to establish a state gems corporation as the
single government authority to regulate the country's gem
industry, according to the local press.
</P>
<P>
The state-funded corporation is designed to consolidate the
mining, manufacturing and marketing of gems as well as to
coordinate efforts to crack down on smuggling of precious stones
out of the country, the latest issue of "Vietnam Investment
Review" magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
Although financed by the government, the corporation will not
be placed under direct government management. It will have all
the functions of a gem trading enterprise and will bring under its
control both gem companies and gem appraisers, the magazine quoted
a senior official source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is rich in precious stones. Rubies and sapphires as
well as semi-precious stones like topaz, aquamarine, amethyst,
topaz, opal and zircon are all mined in the country. But diamonds
and emeralds have not been found in Vietnam yet.
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted the official source as saying that the
government expects the corporation to be able to bring Vietnam
into the world gem market.
</P>
<P>
As the country witnessed a rapid growth of the gem industry, it
also suffered losses from rampant gem smuggling, according to the
magazine.

<HEADLINE> Debts To Harm Economic Development In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kampala, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will possibly risk a
financial crisis because of its heavy detbs, local newspapers
have reported.
</P>
<P>
Uganda now has a debt of 3.1 billion US Dollars, of which 65
percent are from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
The country has to pay 200 million US Dollars to the IMF as
debts service from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan economists warned that Uganda's economic reform,
which has seen an average annual increase of six percent in Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in the past nine years, would suffer
badly in the next four years from the heavy debts burden.
</P>
<P>
The debts would also affect investment both local and foreign
in the country, they said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's health sector would also suffer from the debts. The
country by 1998 will spend about 51 million US Dollars on the
sector, more than a quarter of the 200-million-US-Dollar debts
service.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's aggregate health indicators remain mong the worst in
sub-Saharan Africa, thought it has the third best immunization
record on the continent.
</P>
<P>
In the last two decades, over 60 percent of Uganda's
recurrent expenditure has depended on grants and interest-free
loans from the outside world. enditem

<HEADLINE> Ding, Kim Stun Table Tennis Worlds (Take 1)  By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie WTTC251 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 14 (Xinhua/OANA)-- Ding is the king and Kim is
down.
</P>
<P>
The giant-killing Ding Song, crowned as the king of choppers,
helped host Chinese team to a second-time clean sweep of titles at
the 43rd World Table Tennis Championships which closed here on
Sunday. While South Korean Kim Taek Soo, the only non-Chinese
into the men's singles semi-finals, was forced into a stunning
exit one day earlier for using a banned glue.
</P>
<P>
Peter Karlsson, Jean-Michael Saive and Jorgen Persson all fell
under the wicked racket of the 24-year-old Chinese, who was once
thought to be "hopeless" as an "out-of-date" defensive player.
</P>
<P>
Ding, who can serve different spins and is good at follow-up
smashes after chopping defense, routed world No. 9 Karlsson at
China's 3-2 win over Sweden in the men's team final. He then
produced the biggest upset with a straight-set victory over
Belgium's world No. 1 Saive in a singles second rounder.
</P>
<P>
Saive, bidding to better his second placing from last
championships, found his ferocious attacks crumble under Ding's
consistent chops and merciless counter-offense in less than 40
mintues.
</P>
<P>
Ding, ranked 21st in the world, outlasted 1991 world champion
Jorgen Persson of Sweden, billed as the most experienced European
in dealing with chopper, at the third round.
</P>
<P>
"Ding is now the best chopper in the world," said Chinese coach
Lu Yuansheng, the man behind Ding's rise into stardom who had
added more attacking play into his defensive style.
</P>
<P>
"Ding's transition from chopping to attacking, or vice versa,
is smooth and quick," Lu said. "His chopping is very tricky. If
he plays cut with backhand, it doesn't spin. If he chops away
from the table, it has a lot of spin. Anyone who returns his chop
a bit high is done."
</P>
<P>
Chen Xinhua, a chopper who helped China win the men's team
title at the 1985 championships and now plays under England's
colors, hailed Ding as a hope for the defensive style.
</P>
<P>
"Ding's style is unique and advanced," the English top player
said. "That't the way the choppers should learn."
</P>
<P>
Kim Taek Soo, the last South Korean left in these
championships, was thrown out by the ITTF after a post-match test
of his racket found it contained a banned solvent "at a level
several times above the permitted limit."
</P>
<P>
After a futile appeal by South Korea's table tennis
association, the fifth seed became the first player disqualified
from world championships for such an offense. China's Wang Tao,
Kim beaten opponent at the quarter-finals, was promoted to set up
the all-Chinese semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Wang was not happy, though, to see Kim ousted this way. "I
will play because I am asked to, but after all, I was beaten," he
said after being informed of Kim's exit on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kim wasn't the first offender caught in these championships.
The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) disclosed on
Saturday that 24 cases of illegal glue use had been found in about
200 racket tests conducted so far and four rackets had been
confisticated.
</P>
<P>
The sport's world governing body looked puzzled at why Kim used
a banned glue instead of any of 20 or so glues approved by the
ITTF.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Democratic and Republican parties are responding to
the American public's growing appetite for a third political party
with quiet attempts to keep third parties and independents off
state ballots.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. expands fight with Japan in trade war, seizing two
Japanese fishing boats in the Pacific-Ocean Sunday for alleged
fishing.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Iran's top nuclear official has indicated that his country
intends to build about 10 nuclear power plants in the next two
decades, but denied charges by the United States that Iran is
trying to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- For the past four years, the United States has sought to
keep out of the war in ex-Yugoslavia by encouraging Europe and the
United Nations to take the lead, but with U.N. peacekeeping
mission seeming to teeter on the brink of collapse, Washington
could be closer than ever to being dragged into the war, one way
or the other.

"Either glues, approved or illegal, can enhance speed and
spin," said ITTF executive vice-president Yap Yong Yih. "I can't
tell which is more effective, but one thing is clear -- the banned
glues are harmful to health."
</P>
<P>
The host team thus came to sweep all the seven titles, a feat
they achieved in the 1981 championships in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao turned out the most titled man in the Tianjin event
after teaming with Lu Lin to retain their men's doubles title on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese top paddler, who anchored China to win the men's
team top honor on Monday, later paired up with Liu Wei for a
third traight mixed doubles title.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Kong Linghui, who upset defending champion
Jean-Philippe Gatien of France at the fourth round, took the men's
singles gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Deng Yaping and Qiao Hong, the backbone of the title-winning
Chinese women's squad, finished one-two at the singles.  They
also won the women's doubles title on Sunday, four years after
losing it at the 41st world championships in Chiba, Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, the clean sweep can hardly prove China as dominating
as in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Europeans men players did not win a gold medal
here, they are still the arch rivals for us Chinese," said Xu
Yingsheng, the newly elected ITTF vice-president.
</P>
<P>
"Top European players like Saive, who plays close to table,
take initiative in attacking and can do loops both forehand and
backhand. This game represents the tendency of table tennis,"
said Xu, who is also the president of China's table tennis
association.
</P>
<P>
Xu said European women players, who now play more like men,
expecially in doing loops, will be a force to reckon with for the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"European women have caught up very fast, they will threaten
the Chinese position sooner or later," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Hunan &AMP; Hubei to Prepare for Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Chunyun, one of the two
newly elected vice primers of China, has urged the nation to get
prepared for the fight against floods in the coming rain seasons.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also the head of the State's Flood Control Headquarters,
made the call during his inspection in central China's Hunan and
Hubei Provinces over the past week.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Jiang told local officials that flood control
is the most urgent task and should be given the priority in the
government work agenda, as heavy floods are likely to happen in
the regions along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
River this summer, especially in the Jingjiang River in Hubei and
the Dongting Lake in Hunan, according to weather forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Jingjiang River, a major tributary of the
Yangtze River, was silted up and a section of its dikes
collapsed. More than 100 ships were stranded there until the water
course was dredged.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, the whole Jingjiang dike, which is close to Wuhan,
captial of Hubei Province and the largest industrial center in
central China, survived one of the heavest floods that occured
along the Yangtze River in hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that after 40 years of construction, the city has
been more capable of combating floods. But he said officials at
all levels must keep on alert and step up anti-flood measures to
avoid losses caused by floods of any scales.

<HEADLINE> PWC's Legal Panel Holds Meeting in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Most of the existing laws and
ordinances in Hong Kong will basically remain unchanged after 1997
so as to ensure a smooth transition in the region, said a senior
Chinese official here today.
</P>
<P>
Shao Tianren, convenor of the legal panel of the Preliminary
Working Committee (PWC), made the point following the conclusion
of the first session of a two-day meeting of the PWC's legal panel
which started here today.
</P>
<P>
Shao, a legal expert in China, said that only those laws and
ordinances in Hong Kong which contradict the Basic Law will have
to be changed.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, members of the PWC's legal panel focused
their discussions on the panel's work report to be submitted to
the 5th Plenary Session of the PWC in June, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, members of the panel also examined some of the
existing ordinances in Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Shao, a total of five ordinances including the
Government Flying Service Ordinance, the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary
Police Ordinance and the Essential Service Ordinance were examined
at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Shao said that it was the panel's preliminary view that the
five ordinances examined could be used as the laws of the future
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) as no contents in
the ordinances had been found contradicting the Basic Law except
for some of the names in the ordinances which are tinted with the
colonial colors.
</P>
<P>
The legal panel is a sub-group under the PWC, which provides
opinions and suggestions on the existing Hong Kong laws and
ordinances for the reference of the Preparatory Committee for the
Hong Kong SAR, which is due to be set up next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Shao, the legal panel has so far examined some 400
out of the 600-plus existing laws and ordinances in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that the examination of the remaining laws and
ordinances is expected to be completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Shao said that the legal panel had adopted a vary prudent
attitude towards the examination of the existing Hong Kong laws
and ordinances.
</P>
<P>
The basic policy guiding the panel's work is to keep the
existing Hong Kong laws and ordinances unchanged so as to ensure a
smooth transition in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Shao, it was the first time that the PWC's legal
panel held its meeting in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Members of the legal panel arrived here on Thursday for the
13th meeting of the panel.
</P>
<P>
During their stay here, members of the legal panel have made
wide contacts with the people from the local legal society in
order to listen to their views and suggestions, said Shao, adding
that such contacts would do good for the panel's work.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Wins Spanish Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Michael Schumacher led from start to
finish with his Benetton-Renault to win the Spanish Grand Prix in
Barcelona Sunday and take over the lead in the drivers standings.
</P>
<P>
Johnny Herbert in a Benetton-Renault was second with Gerhard
Berger in a Ferrari third. Damon Hill with a Wiilliams-Renault
came in fourth, losing second in the final lap after a spin.
</P>
<P>
Hill came to the Spanish Grand Prix with a two-race winning
streak and lost the lead to Schumacher, now with 24 points. Hill
has 23 now.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher won the first race of the season after initially
being disqualified over a fuel controversy. In the last two races
he was third and spun out, the first driver out of the San Marino
Grand Prix two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
This time there was no trouble, taking advantage of just two
pit stops compared to three by the other top finishers.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher had the pole position and took the lead immediately
and gradually pulled away. He was the last of the leaders to pit
and he was about 10 seconds ahead of Jean Alesi when Alesi's
Ferrari blew an engine and went out after 25 laps.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time this year a Ferrari failed to finish a
race, both Berger and Alesi coming in the top six in the first
three races.

<HEADLINE> No More "IOU"s to Farmers: Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will provide
sufficient funds for the State purchasing of farm and side-line
products this year and give no "I-Owe You"s (IOU) to farmers,
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Funds provided by banks to purchase farm and side-line products
must not be used for other purposes, Zhu, concurrently governor of
the central bank, told a national telephone conference on the issue.
</P>
<P>
While the summer harvest is getting near, whether the work can
be carried out successfully or not will have a direct impact on
this year's agricultural and economic situation, and will become a
key link for the country to scale down inflation effectively, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier urged both the central and local authorities
to "attach great importance to the work" and handle the
agriculture funds properly.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the State has adopted a series of
policies and measures to supply sufficient funds for purchasing
farm and side-line products, and few "IOU"s occurred during the
period, Zhu said, adding that farmers were basically satisfied
with the results, which was good for developing farm production.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu said, the problem of diverting the designated
funds for other purposes got to be very serious during the past
two years, forcing the banks to lend much greater amount of loans
to fill the gap. "The central bank has to expand money issuance
yearly, which is very bad for controlling inflation," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government will tighten the control on the use
of funds and banks will provide loans strictly in line with the
amount, prices and stockpile of farm and side-line products, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
Subsidies offered by local governments for buying agricultural
and side-line products must be appropriated from their budgets or
from grain risk funds established in different localities and
should not be provided by banks, Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Grain purchase and supply enterprises must not use the
designated funds for other purposes such as capital construction
and businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Banks are not allowed to use the funds for other commercial
purposes, either, while the Agricultural Bank of China and the

<HEADLINE> No More "IOU"s to Farmers: Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 14 (Xinhua-OANA) -- The Chinese government will
provide sufficient funds for the State purchasing of farm and
side-line products this year and give no "I-Owe You"s (IOU) to
farmers, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Funds provided by banks to purchase farm and side-line products
must not be used for other purposes, Zhu, concurrently governor of
the central bank, told a national telephone conference on the issue.
</P>
<P>
While the summer harvest is getting near, whether the work can
be carried out successfully or not will have a direct impact on
this year's agricultural and economic situation, and will become a
key link for the country to scale down inflation effectively, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier urged both the central and local authorities
to "attach great importance to the work" and handle the
agriculture funds properly.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the State has adopted a series of
policies and measures to supply sufficient funds for purchasing
farm and side-line products, and few "IOU"s occurred during the
period, Zhu said, adding that farmers were basically satisfied
with the results, which was good for developing farm production.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu said, the problem of diverting the designated
funds for other purposes got to be very serious during the past
two years, forcing the banks to lend much greater amount of loans
to fill the gap. "The central bank has to expand money issuance
yearly, which is very bad for controlling inflation," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year, the government will tighten the control on the use
of funds and banks will provide loans strictly in line with the
amount, prices and stockpile of farm and side-line products, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
Subsidies offered by local governments for buying agricultural
and side-line products must be appropriated from their budgets or
from grain risk funds established in different localities and
should not be provided by banks, Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Grain purchase and supply enterprises must not use the
designated funds for other purposes such as capital construction
and businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
Banks are not allowed to use the funds for other commercial
purposes, either, while the Agricultural Bank of China and the
Agricultural Development Bank should work cooperatively to manage
the funds properly, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said that the central authorities will
regularly examine the use of funds by enterprises, local
governments and banks to guarantee no "IOU" slips in the purchase
of farm and side-line products.

<HEADLINE> Iran Praises Russia for No Compromise with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran here today praised Russia for
its stance in the recent U.S.-Russian summit over Moscow-Tehran
nuclear cooperation, saying that the Iranian-Russian relations
would be further expanded in the future.
</P>
<P>
Iran is well aware of Russia's stance on the issue and its
commitment to complete Bushehr nuclear plant designed for
peaceful purposes, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for
Euro-American Affairs Mahmoud Vaezi said this morning at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi believed that Tehran-Moscow relations would further
broaden in various areas in the future, saying that Russian
Foreign Minister Andrei Kozirev, in a message to his Iranian
counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati, had stressed the need for further
expansion of mutual and regional cooperation as well as Iran's
role in settling regional disputes.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his recent visit to Moscow, Vaezi said the talks
he had with Russian officials gave him an impression that Russia
was not willing to sacrifice its own interests for boosting ties
with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had suffered a
humiliating setback in imposing trade sanctions on Iran and in
persuading Russia to cancel its contract for sale of nuclear
reactors to Iran.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Russian President Boris Yeltsin had
assured Clinton during the summit that Russia would not offer
Iran the centrifugal technology that can develop weapons grade
uranium. He said that he would abandon the proposed sale to
Tehran of a gas centrifuge that could be used for making nuclear
weapons and would delay, at least temporarily, the sale of two
nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton said that Washington would continue to
insist that Iran was trying to acquire nuclear weapons and
continue to oppose Russia's sale to Iran of nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran Thursday denied the alleged intention of buying
a gas centrifuge to enrich uranium from Russia shortly after the
U.S.-Russia summit in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Reza Amrullahi, Vice-President and head of the Atomic Energy
Organization of Iran (AEOI), said that the one-billion-dollar
nuclear power contract signed between Iran and Russia did not
include such an equipment.
</P>
<P>
Vaezi today also said that Clinton had raised an unfounded
claim he had succeeded in convincing the Russians to cancel a
contract for sale of equipment used for enriching uranium while
no such a contract had ever existed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon his talks in Russia on the Caspian Sea legal
regime, Vaezi said that both Iran and Russia insisted that
representatives of the five Caspian Sea littoral states should
meet to formulate a new legal regime for the world's largest
inland sea before signing an oil contract.
</P>
<P>
On Tehran-Paris ties after recent developments in France, he
said it was expected that the already friendly relations between
the two countries would further grow. He also mentioned the
remarks of Jaques Chirac about Iran after his victory in the
presidential elections and that of Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani in his congratulatory message to Chirac,.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent remarks made by a British government
spokesman on "important" negotiations now under way between
Tehran and London, he said the two sides have so far held four
rounds of negotiations to solve their problems. But he did not
specify details of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent demands of the European Union from
Iran concerning the British author Salman Rushdie, he said that
Iran's stand in this respect was clear. It was the fatwa issued
by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that could
be neither revoked or changed by anybody, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that President Rafsanjani, the Majlis
Speaker and other senior authorities of the country have time and
again announced that Tehran had never sent and would not send any
body to kill Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
On his recent talks with Tajik officials to solve the crisis
there, he said three rounds of talks had been held so far between
the Tajik government and opposition groups and that another
meeting was due to be held between the belligerent parties in the
near future followed by the fourth round of talks in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Medvedev Wins Hamburg Tennis Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Andrei Medvedev
defeated Goran Ivanisevic to retain his German Open title, taking
just 78 minutes to win 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 Sunday in Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The 12th seeded Ukrainiain celebrated by walking into the
stands to embrace girlfriend Anke Huber, new coach Boris Breskvar
and members of his family after claiming his first title in a year.
</P>
<P>
The match, played in windy conditions, failed to match the
occasion as fourth seed Ivanisevic was unable to offer any kind of
challenge. He made 43 unforced errors and put less than half his
first serves into play.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev showed far better control than his unhappy opponent,
but had to do little more than keep the ball in play for most of
the match.
</P>
<P>
In the final set, particularly, Ivanisevic found nothing went
his way. Down 0-2, 15-40 on his serve and in total despair he
handed his racquet to a ball girl, and on the next point he missed
the ball completely and spent most of the change-over staring at
the ground.
</P>
<P>
But despite his disappointment, and after sitting with his head
wrapped in a towel for several minutes as Medvedev celebrated,
Ivanisevic still found it within himslf to joke with the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev won a total of 254,000 U.S. dollars for his victory,
and Ivanisevic won 133,800 dollars.

ISLAMABAD, May 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan military leadership will
meet soon to discuss the war threat from India in the wake of the
destruction of a Muslim shrine and a mosque in India-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) and the Defense
Committee of the cabinet will meet on May 16 and 18 separately to
discuss the situation arising out of the burning of Sheikh
Nuruddin Shrine in Charar-e-Sharif and matters pertaining to
overall security environment, informed sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The JCSC meeting, to be chaired by Chairman Air Chief Marshal
Farooq Feroz Khan and attended by the three chiefs will review the
situation prevailing on the Line of Control (LOC) and the measures
being adopted to beef up the security arrangements in the areas
located on the Pakistan side of LOC, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the meeting would take stock of the tension
between Pakistan and India after the Indian leadership made
"belligerent" statements against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We have always exercised restraint but it should not be
construed as our weakness," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the meeting was also likely to discuss
the issue of increase in the defense budget due to the threats
emanating from India.
</P>
<P>
It had almost become difficult for Pakistan to curtail its
defense budget in such a situation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Committee of the cabinet, to be chaired by Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto and attended by foreign and defense
ministers, JCSC chairman and three services chiefs, would discuss
