<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Declines in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. construction spending
dropped by 1.8 percent in May, the worst showing in more than
three years, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that construction spending totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 585 billion dollars, compared
with 595.7 billion in April.
</P>
<P>
The 1.8 percent decline, which followed 0.3 percent gains in
both April and March, was the worst since a 3 percent drop in
January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The drop in May was led by a 6 percent decrease in government
construction to an annual rate of 131.3 billion dollars. It was
also the worst decline since January 1994. Spending for highways
and streets, schools and public buildings all fell.
</P>
<P>
Non-residential commercial construction also fell by 0.6
percent to a rate of 160.4 billion dollars in May, led by declines
in spending for hospitals, private school and college buildings
and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, residential spending edged down 0.2 percent to a
rate of 253.6 billion dollars. A 1.1 percent drop in single-family
spending offset gains in spending on remodeling and apartment
construction.

<HEADLINE> EU Scheme to Boost Investment in Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
launched a pilot scheme to tackle the insufficiency of private
capital investment in small and medium-sized European enterprises
which are technologically innovative.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, in collaboration with the European Investment
Fund, enters a semi-vacuum where lack of private capital
investment has always been regarded by the EU as a main barrier to
innovation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EU notes that small and medium-sized enterprises could
offer the prospect of the technology-led growth Europe needs to
help reduce unemployment and raise competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the program is to encourage venture capital
operators to invest in these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was proposed by Edith Cresson, the EU commissioner
responsible for innovation, research and education. It is part of
the First Action Plan for Innovation, adopted by the Commission,
the EU's executive body, at the end of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Sell 25.3 Tons of Ivory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Botswana will sell 25.3 tons
of ivory from its 30-ton stockpile following the downlisting of
elephant population to Appendix II of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species, Botswana Commerce and
Industry Minister George Kgoroba said today.
</P>
<P>
The planned sale represented the maximum allowed by CITES for an
experimental phase of the downlisting in the trade of ivory, Kgoroba
said.
</P>
<P>
The Botswana ivory is to be shipped to Japan for sale through that
country's Ivory Carvers' Association, he said.
</P>
<P>
The shipment of the ivory to Japan will only take place in about 18
months, once Botswana has put in place measures to safeguard the ivory
and control poaching.
</P>
<P>
Kgoroba warned that any increase in poaching and illegal trade in
ivory could end with Botswana's elephant population being placed
back on CITES' Appendix I.
</P>
<P>
Much of the ivory in Botswana's stockpile is of uncertain origin
since it was seized from international poachers at border posts.
</P>
<P>
Kgoroba stressed that Botswana would abide by the conditions laid
down by CITES for the ivory sale to enhance its bid to trade in all
elephant products.
</P>
<P>
Botswana reportedly has an elephant population of nearly
80,000, and the population is increasing by five percent a year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Security Cooperation Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai confirmed today the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
has resumed security cooperation with Israel following a series
of secret contacts.
</P>
<P>
Appearing before the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, Mordechai said Palestinian and Israeli security
forces had resumed the cooperation which has been halted for more
than three months since Israel began building the controversial
Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the security cooperation led to the tuning
down of Palestinian rioting in Hebron recently with fewer
protesters joining clashes with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Local media disclosed today that the security cooperation was
the result of a series of secret contacts, including the one
between Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and
PNA deputy Chairman Abu Mazen two weeks ago. PNA leader Yasser
Arafat held talks with Israeli Army security official Brigade
General Herzl Getz last Saturday in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Israel reportedly agreed to relocate a
controversial monument erected by Jewish settlers at the junction
of the Morag settlement in Gaza, in memory of a soldier killed in
last September's bloodshed. The monument triggered violent
Palestinian protests that spread later into Hebron.
</P>
<P>
But Mordechai still complained that the security cooperation
was still not complete and hoped the two sides would continue
negotiations in order to achieve full resumption of the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the two sides are negotiating over the
opening of an airport and seaport in the Gaza Strip. He said
Israel must stand firm on strict security control at the Gaza
airport because Israel fears that the PNA could use the airport to
acquire weapons.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said that the resumption of security
cooperation was a positive step toward restarting the deadlocked
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. They noted that the Palestinian
side no longer conditioned the resumption of security cooperation
on Israel's halt to the Har Homa construction.
</P>
<P>
In another positive development, Israel Radio said that
Israeli police Inspector-General Assad Hafetz has been invited by
his Palestinian counterpart to visit Gaza late this month. The
visit is expected to focus on further security cooperation on
fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of South Lebanon where Israel is bogged down in a
tough guerrilla war with Hezbollah forces, Mordechai reiterated
that he was opposed to the idea of unilateral withdrawal of
Israeli troops. But he confirmed the press reports about his
proposal put forward during a recent tour to Paris that France and
United States forces could replace Israeli troops in South
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said Israel has no intention of remaining in the
occupied South Lebanon, and its troops would be happy to leave if
the Lebanese army, supported by French or U.S. forces, could be
redeployed in the area.
</P>
<P>
However, opposition lawmakers doubted the feasibility of the
Mordechai proposal. Labor's lawmaker Shlomo Ben Ami said this was
a non-starter, because Syria opposes any presence of international
forces in Lebanon, and will not agree to let Israel off the hook
before reaching full Israeli-Syrian peace.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Anti-TB Drugs Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A four-day seminar on production,
marketing, distribution and quality control of anti-tuberculosis
(TB) drugs in South Asia opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Attending the seminar are TB control managers, drug quality
controllers and doctors from Nepal, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka,
all members of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC), which also groups Bhutan, Bangladesh and the
Maldives.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the seminar organized by the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Tuberculosis Center, Nepali Health Secretary Sriram Poudel said
regular supply of good quality anti-TB drugs is very important for
the success of national TB control programs.
</P>
<P>
He said recommendations from the seminar will help the
government develop a suitable strategy for the management of
anti-TB drugs, which is the basic requirement for effective TB
control not only in this region but all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The world today has about 10 million TB patients, and one
million people die of TB every year in South Asia alone.
</P>
<P>
Director of the SAARC Tuberculosis Center Dr. Dirgha Singh Bam
said the primary strategy of TB control is based on the ability to
quickly identify and cure new TB patients in the community.
</P>
<P>
Regular drug supply needs concerted efforts to guarantee
procurement of anti-TB drugs of assured quality at affordable
prices and to make sure that drugs are distributed to patients on
time, said Dr. Bam, adding that short course chemotherapy is
proved to be a highly effective treatment for TB patients.

return to China hosted by Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Liu Guijin.

international disputes, particularly those left over from history
between nations.

<HEADLINE> Engine Overhaul Venture Formed in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Pratt &AMP; Whitney (P&AMP;W) and SIA
(Singapore Airlines) Engineering Company (SIAEC) formed a joint
venture to overhaul and repair JT9D, PW4000 and CFM56 engines in
Singapore in a major effort to expand their respective service
businesses, the SIA announced here today.
</P>
<P>
It said that P&AMP;W, a United Technologies company, will own 51
percent of the venture, while SIAEC, a fully-owned subsidiary of
Singapore Airlines, owns the remaining 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
The initial work force and management for this venture will
come from SIAEC's current engine overhaul shop, with P&AMP;W providing
the general manager and specialist support.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture company will be P&AMP;W's exclusive Center of
Excellence facility in the Asia-Pacific and Indian subcontinent.
And the initial focus of the joint venture will be on P&AMP;W's PW4000
and JT9D series engines and the CFM56 engine built by CFMI, all of
which are currently used to power aircraft in Singapore Airlines
fleet.
</P>
<P>
The facility will expand into servicing other engine models in
the future, if this is considered to be financially viable, the
SIA said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Over 20 Palestinians Wounded By Israeli Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 Palestinian
protesters were wounded by rubber bullets and tear gas during
clashes with Israeli soldiers in Hebron today, according to a
report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The clashes started when a group of youths broke away from a
procession of several hundred Palestinians, called by political
and religious leadership in Hebron to protest posters pasted on
the Palestinian stores over the weekend depicting Prophet
Mohammed as a pig writing the Koran.
</P>
<P>
Despite condemnations by Israeli leaders of the insulting
poster, the incident is still stirring the feelings of the
Palestinian Moslems. The protesters threw rocks and petrol bombs
at the Israeli troops who responded with rubber bullets and tear
gas. One of the wounded was in serious condition after being hit
by bullets on the head.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli side, a border policeman was seriously wounded
by an explosive device and another lightly hurt.
</P>
<P>
A general strike will be observed in Hebron Wednesday as
further protest against the posters. The Jewish settlers are
due to hold an emergency meeting tonight to discuss how to
deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
The city witnessed last month more than 10 days of
violent clashes between the Palestinian residents and Israeli
troops. The Palestinians protested against the U.S. Congress
decision to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeing force
operating in Liberia known as ECOMOG announced today it has arrested
15 persons involved in voters registration fraud and warned of severe
penalty for offenders.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted an ECOMOG statement as saying "Since
the commencement of the voters registration on June 24, a total of 15
unscrupulous persons have been arrested by ECOMOG for engaging in
various nefarious activities capable of marring the good conduct of
the registration exercise."
</P>
<P>
"Details of the criminal conducts showed that ECOMOG arrested five
persons in different parts of the city for compiling illegal voters
registration in the name of their party, while five others were
arrested for double registration," it said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, two others were arrested while
attempting to sell their voter's cards to officials of a political
party whose headquarters they went to solicit buyers.
</P>
<P>
The statement said three others were arrested "for either posing as
voters registration officer or intimidating other citizens with threat
of bodily harm at a registration center for not proclaiming a
particular party".
</P>
<P>
It said another culprit, who escaped leaving behind an election
commission registration record book in his bag, is at large.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, which has vowed to keep security in the west African
country to ensure a free and fair election, said it suspected the
register was "stolen for dubious reasons".
</P>
<P>
Liberia's post-war election is scheduled for July 19 and campaign

<HEADLINE> China Renames Kowloon Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kowloon Customs House has been
renamed "Shenzhen Customs House", according to the General
Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"The renaming of the Kowloon Customs is an indication that
China has resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and
that the Chinese government adheres to the solemn promise of 'one
country, two systems' and 'Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong',"
said a senior official from the Chinese Customs.
</P>
<P>
The Kowloon Customs House was opened in 1887, with the office
of the customs house based on the Hong Kong island while its
border posts located on Kowloon Boundary Street and a small island
near the Hong Kong island.
</P>
<P>
But after the new territories of Kowloon peninsula was forcibly
leased to Britain in 1898, the border post had to be moved to
Shenzhen. In 1949 after the founding of New China, the Chinese
Liberation Army took over the Anti-Smuggling Headquarters in
Shenzhen of the Kowloon Customs House and on the same date, the
office of the Kowloon Customs House declared to accept the
leadership of the Central Government.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government at the time declared that Hong Kong is
the Chinese territory and the Chinese government would not
recognize the three unequal treaties forced upon China by
colonialists. On December 14, 1950, the Central Government decided
to open a customs house (in Shenzhen), retaining the name "Kowloon
Customs House" and moving the office from Hong Kong to
Shenzhen. So the Kowloon Customs House is the only customs house
that did not use its place name.
</P>
<P>
A renaming ceremony will be held on July 2 in Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Australia Faces New Round of Price Cuts on Telephone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The new era in Australia's
telecommunications started today and so did the discount phone
deals.
</P>
<P>
It's Australian communications deregulation day, when the
country's telephone duopoly, namely Telstra Corp and Optus
Communications is blown away and the industry is open to all
comers.
</P>
<P>
The reforms are designed to promote competition and benefit
customers substantially through lower overseas call prices so as
to improve overall economic efficiency by encouraging the
efficient use of, and investment in, telecommunications, according
to an official Industry Commission report.
</P>
<P>
AAP Telecommunications, Australia's third largest
telecommunications company but still relatively unknown outside
the industry, blasted into the public domain with its offer of up
to 55 percent and 60 percent off the costs of national and
international calls, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Telstra Corp today offered a half-price STD happy hour between
5 PM to 6 PM.
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of high profile phone call deals consumers can
expect to see more of, said Richard Alston, Minister for
Communications and the Arts.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, the country's major
telecommunications companies Telstra and Optus charge five times
what calls cost to provide.
</P>
<P>
The commission said deregulation should force international
call charges down from an average of 1.11 Australian dollars to as
lower as 47 Australian cents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian Communications Authority had its
first meeting today and granted carrier licenses to AAPT, Primus
Telecommunications, Optus and Telstra Multimedia.
</P>
<P>
It said another two licence applications are being considered.
 Australian telephony is dominated by Telstra with about 80
percent of the market. Optus entered the telecommunications market
only six years ago when partial reforms led to Optus entering as
the second legislated carrier.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Threatens Not to Attend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash threatened today not to participate in the upcoming
U.N.-led direct negotiations between the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sides if he is not informed of a document beforehand.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader made the remark before a meeting
of the self-styled parliament in the Turkish-occupied part of
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"If they (the U.N.) intend to give us a document of an unknown
content, I think I will not go to New York," Denktash was quoted
as saying by the Turkish Cypriot radio Bayrak. The document is
expected to be presented to both sides at the start of their talks.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot parliament convened today to discuss the
Cyprus question and the U.N.-sponsored face-to-face negotiations
between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Denktash, which
are to be held near New York from July 9 to 13.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said he has asked U.N. resident representative in
Cyprus Gustave Feissel to tell him of the content of the document,
but received no reply so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, Denktash claimed that the idea of
presenting the two sides with a document came after a meeting
between Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides and U.N.
secretary-general's special representative for Cyprus Diego
Cordovez.
</P>
<P>
Denktash also claimed that the document will be put forward in
an expression of support to President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of the northern third of the island in the wake
of an pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side unilaterally declared a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in November 1993,
which was recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash held two informal meetings in Nicosia in
October 1994 under the U.N. auspices, which ended in
deadlock. They have not met ever since.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The social and economic contacts
between east China's thriving Jiangsu Province and Hong Kong are
expected to be closer thanks to today's opening of a new airport
in Nanjing, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Lukou Airport opened for service today, with a total of 30-plus
flights, including two to Hong Kong, departing or arriving at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
Jointly funded by the Civil Aviation Administration of China
and the Jiangsu provincial and Nanjing governments, the airport,
with state-of-the-art telecommunications, navigation, and air
control equipment, is capable of handling Boeing 747s.
</P>
<P>
Chen Huanyou, secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of
the Communist Party of China, told Xinhua today that the economic
and cultural exchange between Jiangsu and Hong Kong in recent
years has been more and more frequent.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has been one of the key trade partners for Jiangsu,"
Chen said. In the past two years, the trade volume between Jiangsu
and Hong Kong exceeded three billion US dollars, accounting for
more than one fourth of the provincial's total.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, some 14,424 enterprises involving funding
from Hong Kong have been registered in the province. The
contractual Hong Kong investment in Jiangsu totaled 18.7 billion
dollars, of which 8.36 billion has been used.
</P>
<P>
"Now that Hong Kong has returned to the motherland, we will
strengthen our cooperation under the prerequisite of mutual
benefit and giving play to each other's advantages," Chen said.

with words spoken during the handover ceremony, or by counting
down from 10 to 0, just as millions of capital city residents had
done at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
The capital today remained drenched in a sea of lanterns,
decorations, flowers and banners commemorating the Hong Kong
return.
</P>
<P>
National flags were flying on every street and hutong, or
alley. Last week, Mi Huiming put a flag, which she bought together
with her neighbors, outside her house. "It is a typical way of
celebration for ordinary Chinese people," Mi said.
</P>
<P>
Buying miniature sets of the national flag and the
bauhania-patterned flag of the new Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region has been a year-long fad in the city. Local
flag peddlars feel blessed. One, stationed at Tian'anmen Square,
reportedly sold over 2,500 flags on a single day.
</P>
<P>
No. 49, Dongtangzi Hutong, is the spot where the Kowloon
Extension Agreement was signed in 1898, which further ceded the
Hong Kong New Territories to Britain. Today, a group of residents
there performed the "yangko" dance, a traditional rural folk
dance.
</P>
<P>
"Yangko dancing is the best way we can find to express our
joy," said one 65-year-old.
</P>
<P>
"What I feel most deeply is that weak countries will never
realize equal status with the world," said Zou Yuan, a retired
government official. "Only a powerful country and the return of
Hong Kong could wash away the humiliations experienced by the
Chinese."
</P>
<P>
It was just a few seconds after midnight last night when
Beijing Hospital for Gynecology and Obstetrics announced the birth
of the first baby born since the return of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Celebrations Continue in Nanjing To Greet HK's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 1 (Xinhua) -- On the first day after Hong Kong's
return to the motherland, the festivities were still going strong
throughout Nanjing, where the ancient Qing Dynasty signed the
Treaty of Nanking 156 years ago which ceded Hong Kong to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people gathered for a grand open-air
concert in a downtown square this morning, to welcome Hong Kong's
return.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is home at last. This washes away the traces of the
156-year humiliation, and every Chinese can't help feeling proud
and elated," said Wang Peiyu, an instructor at a yangko dance
school in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Standing behind Wang, were student buglers from a primary
school. "Hong Kong's return has enabled us to realize that only
when our motherland gets strong can it free itself from invasion
and humiliation," said Li Jia.
</P>
<P>
Another large-scale celebration was held in the city this
afternoon to observe the historic homecoming and encourage the
audience to remember China's 156-year period of national
disgrace.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian parliament, the
House of People's Representatives, today endorsed the proclamation
providing for the establishment of the National Reserve Petroleum
Depot Administration.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the importance for the establishment of
the ARPDA arises from the need to set up a legal body responsible
for the construction of national depots and storage of national
petroleum reserve.
</P>
<P>
During the deliberation of the proclamation, participants said
the establishment of the administration is essential to withstand
petroleum shortages that might surface due to natural or man-made
disasters.
</P>
<P>
They said countries like Ethiopia, land-locked and lacking in
petroleum resources, should give due attention to storing
petroleum reserve that at least lasts them from 3-6 months,
adding that Ethiopia presently uses seven depots across the
country with a capacity of 29,900 cubic liters of petroleum which
could cover supplies for only 10 days. enditem

<HEADLINE> Gala at Opium-Burning Site To Welcome Hong Kong Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DONGGUAN, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong homecoming celebration
party at Dongguan today featured singing, dancing and fireworks
because of the history standing behind the city, and the
significance it represents in this historic day.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of Hong Kong's return, what first came into
the minds of the people in Dongguan is to send the good news to
their perished great and great-grandfathers, who have died in the
resistance battles against British colonialists over a century ago.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people gathered here, in a square called
"peace" in Humen of Dongguan city in southern China's Guangdong
province, to take part in the gala party to welcome Hong Kong back
with a variety of performances.
</P>
<P>
Standing behind the performing stage in the square were relief
sculptures, which showed the viewers what happened 158 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The national hero Lin Zexu led the move to burn more than 1.15
million kilograms of opium confiscated from British smugglers in
Humen then, the very beginning of a long-lasting resistance
against the international invaders.
</P>
<P>
But people at the party said they would rather look ahead into
the future. "We are fully convinced that Hong Kong, the orient
pearl which catches worldwide attention, will become all the more
brilliant after returning to the embrace of our motherland," said
Zhang Guoying, deputy secretary of the Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Sitting next-door to Hong Kong, the former opium-burning site
is booming with more than 10,000 joint ventures, with 90 percent
of the investment coming from Hong Kong investors.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri today expressed his warm congratulations to China on
resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and his wish
for enhanced economic ties with this booming town.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister extended the good wishes a day after Hong
Kong, the once-lost Chinese territory returned to its motherland
following 156 years of British rule.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection trip to the Toshka Canal project which is
under construction in the Western Desert, Ganzouri told Xinhua
that he had sent congratulatory telegrams first to Chinese
Premier Li Peng and then to Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwua on the historic event.
</P>
<P>
"It is a really wonderful thing for China and different
countries all over the world, especially Egypt because our country
is one of the most friendly to China," said the Egyptian premier.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa had flown to Hong Kong to
attend the celebrations at midnight on June 30 marking the
inauguration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to cooperation prospects between Egypt and
China, Ganzouri said that he is optimistic that bilateral ties and
trade and economic ties in particular, will be boosted in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt has invited some Hong Kong businessmen to come
here to explore joint projects.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are going to have these companies to deal with us
in the Mediterranean port city of Sharq el-Tafreaa and on the
Sinai peninsula. We expect some companies will come here very
soon," he added.
</P>
<P>
The volume of trade exchange between Egypt and Hong Kong has
reached 380 million U.S. dollars within the past three years,
according to Egypt's Consul General to Hong Kong Ali Maher el-Dali.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from Hong Kong to Egypt has quadrupled
from 4,500 in 1993 to 18,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri visited China in late April in a bid to boost trade
between the two countries. Egypt and China are preparing to
establish a free trade zone in Suez city, about 150 kilometers
southeast of Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Law Becomes Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The controversial law
overhauling the federal welfare system of the United States went
into effect today, with the states ready to take over assistance
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law signed last year, able-bodied adults must get
a job within two years of receiving their first assistance check
or be dropped from the rolls. All recipients will be dropped from
the rolls after five years of assistance.
</P>
<P>
The law dismantles the existing federal welfare structure,
converting those programs into block grants for the states, which
will be able to set their own welfare rules and manage their own
programs. All the states have submitted their assistance plans to
the federal government -- except two that sought delays on
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
Welfare recipients who receive food stamps must find at least
part-time employment within three months of qualification for the
food-stamp program.
</P>
<P>
Congress is remedying one provision that would have denied
benefits to legal immigrants. Under the fine print in legislation
passed by the House of Representatives and Senate last week,
benefits are being restored to nearly 500,000 legal elderly and
disabled immigrants.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton signed the welfare bill last August
despite heavy fire from advocacy groups for the poor and religious
organizations that contended it was a brutal measure that would
pull the financial rug from under many poor people, especially
children.
</P>
<P>
He had vetoed two previous welfare reform proposals passed by
Congress. But, under pressure to remove a dangerous election-year
obstacle, he signed the third measure, which sought to end a
61-year-old New Deal guarantee of cash assistance for the poor.

<HEADLINE> US Gives Green Light to Merger of Boeing, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) announced today it will not block the large
merger of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., which would
create the world's largest aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
While confirming the widely expected decision, an FTC official
said the merger would not substantially decrease competition for
either military or civilian aircraft manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
The FTC indicated that McDonnell Douglas ceased to be a
competitive factor in the market for commercial jets. Last year,
the company won only 4 percent of new airplane orders.
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger deal between the two aerospace giants is
considered as less of a merger and more of a buyout of McDonnell
Douglas by Boeing. Last December, Boeing announced to offer some
13.3 billion U.S. dollars in stock for McDonnell Douglas, based in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
The deal would create a civilian- and military-aircraft
powerhouse with more than 200,000 employees and projected annual
revenues of 48 billion dollars. It would have 65 percent of the
world jetliner market, almost double the share of its only rival,
Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium.
</P>
<P>
European Union antitrust investigators continue to review the
merger to ensure it complies with the trade bloc's rules.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the European regulators and Boeing face a
Friday deadline for a vote by the antitrust advisory panel of the
European Union in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the deal also needs the shareholders approval from
both companies before the merger can take effect. Shareholder
meetings are scheduled for July 25.

WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved the third annual loan under the Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) for Togo in an amount
equivalent to some 30 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan is provided in support of the Togolese government's
1997 economic program. The loan is available in two semiannual
installments, the first of which is available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Togolese government's 1997 program is designed to correct
the weaknesses that occurred in 1996, particularly in the fiscal
consolidation efforts, and to accelerate the implementation of the
agreed structural reforms. For 1997, the country's real GDP is
expected to grow at a rate of 5.8 percent, the inflation rate is
to be reduced to 3.9 percent on average for the year, and the
current account deficit is to be narrowed to 6.6 percent of GDP,
from 8.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Togo joined the IMF in August 1962. Its quota is about 76
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently
totals some 82 million dollars.

UNITED NATIONS, July 1 (Xinhua) -- As global tea production is
expected to be lower and demand is likely to remain stable in
1997, consumers will face higher world tea prices, the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said today.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka and in most tea producing countries of Africa,
extremely dry weather adversely affected crops, particularly in
Kenya where production in the first quarter was about 37 percent
lower than in the same period in 1996, according to a FAO report
available here today.
</P>
<P>
The report was prepared for the meeting of the
Intergovernmental Group on Tea in Bali, Indonesia, on July 2-4.
</P>
<P>
World tea production reached a record level of 2,691,000 tons
in 1996 and was 3 percent (about 75,000 tons) higher than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Harvests were larger in almost all major tea producing
countries in 1996, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
In India, production increased by 4 percent to set a new record
of 778,900 tons, In Africa, Uganda reported an increase of 26
percent, Malawi of 8 percent and Zimbabwe of 6 percent.

successive studies which showed the existence of 180 illegal
video houses in the city.
</P>
<P>
During the raids carried out on the basis of search warrants
issued by courts, 57 of the suspected sites either couldn't be
found or had stopped operation, he added.
</P>

According to Mulatu, a similar crackdown in November last year
had resulted in the seizure of 42 video decks, 26 tv sets and
many video cassettes. Eleven of the 42 offenders were fined.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Peace Talks to Resume Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOSHKA, EGYPT, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said here today he hopes the Palestinians and Israelis
would succeed in agreeing on resuming talks for peace within the
coming few days.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters during a trip to the construction site of
the Toshka Canal, about 900 kilometers south of the capital,
Mubarak said the Palestinian and Israeli sides had been making
contacts during recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The canal is designed to carry Nile water to irrigate part of
the Western Desert in an ambitious land reclamation project of the
Egyptian government.
</P>
<P>
The president declined to reveal what was going on during those
secret contacts between ranking Israeli and Palestinian officials,
which also involved his political advisor Osama el-Baz.
</P>
<P>
Baz, who was accompanying the president on the inspection tour,
refused to elaborate on the current contacts, saying that too much
talk could aggravate the peace crisis at such a delicate moment.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that his scheduled weekend trip to Israel has
been postponed due to the lack of a breakthrough in the deadlocked
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has intensified its mediation efforts after U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross failed to bring the two sides back to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the recent U.S. Congressional resolution on
moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the
president dismissed the move as "unwise" and likely to "add fuel
to the fire."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also ruled out the possibility that the U.S. is to
cease its aid to Egypt, as proposed by the U.S. Appropriations
Subcommittee on the ground that Egypt has stiffened its position
toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We have close friends in the U.S. Senate who are appreciative
of Egypt's position in this part of the world and on the peace
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was Egypt, and no other country, that opened the doors
before the peace process in the region," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In response to a decision by several Arab countries to boycott
the upcoming Doha Economic Summit which will include Israel,
Mubarak said each country should make its own decision in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
But the president refused to say if Egypt will go to the Qatari
capital in November for the Fourth Middle East and North African
Economic Summit.
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing will depend on the circumstances existing
before the convocation of the summit," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel attended the third conference in Cairo last November.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- A grand reception in celebration of
Hong Kong's return to China was held on Tuesday evening at the
Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the reception, Chinese ambassador Li Fenglin noted
that "the oriental shining pearl" that had been forcibly occupied
by British colonialists for one and a half centuries has at last
returned to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"The principle of `one country, two systems' is a basic
guideline for our government to run Hong Kong", Li said. "The
Chinese government has solemnly announced to the whole world that
a special administrative region in Hong Kong has been
astablished."
</P>
<P>
More than 700 Russian and foreign guests attended the
reception, including assistant of foreign affairs of Russian
president Sergey Prihoduko, Chairman of the committee of foreign
affairs of State Duma Vladimir Lukin, other leaders of the Russian
State Duma, Russian representatives and friends from all walks of
life and foreign diplomats from various countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua news agency Lukin said that China
has given the world a good lecture, and the Chinese people are
lucky to have such a great man as Deng Xiaoping. He solved the
historical problem through the principle of "one country, two
systems".
</P>
<P>
Lukin also expressed his confidence in Chinese leadership who,
he said, is able to maintain the prosperity and steadiness of Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders Down for 2nd Time in 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
declined by 0.7 percent in May, the second time in three months,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that U.S. factory orders totaled a
seasonally adjusted 323.3 billion dollars in the month.
</P>
<P>
The decline followed a revised increase of 1.4 percent in
April and a decrease of 1.7 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
In May, orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at
least three years -- fell by 0.7 percent. Decreases in orders to
steel mills, aircraft plants and computer manufacturers more than
offset gains to makers of communications equipment and
shipbuilders.
</P>
<P>
The nondurable orders also dropped by 0.7 percent in the month.
The largest decreases in nondurable goods came in paper and rubber
products and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the backlog of unfilled orders at factories were
unchanged following decreases in April and March. That's a sign
that manufacturers were keeping up with the flow of new orders and
that there's little danger for now of inflation-causing delivery
delays and shortages.
</P>
<P>
Factory shipments -- a measure of current production --
declined 1 percent, also the second drop in three months.
Inventories rose 0.4 percent, the 10th increase in 11 months.
</P>
<P>
The report fit well with economists' belief that overall
growth, after soaring at a decade-high 5.9 percent annual rate in
the first quarter, slowed dramatically to around a 2 percent rate
in the April-June period.

<HEADLINE> PLA HK Garrison Praised by Local People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's major Hong Kong newspapers all highlighted the arrival
of PLA Hong Kong Garrison, with their coverage focusing on the
greetings received by the troops.
</P>
<P>
A special report on the Garrison in Hong Kong Daily News said,
"The citizens have a good impression of the PLA troops, and
consider them quite modern. Despite the torrential rain when they
arrived in Hong Kong, they still maintain good discipline and fine
appearance."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Economic Daily said, "on July 1, many people thronged
to the barracks at Tamar to have pictures taken with the PLA
solders. A primary school pupil said that as Chinese, the PLA
soldiers looked kind to him. The boy's father, a Mr. Lam, said he
had confidence in the PLA Garrison and believed they will act
according to law."
</P>
<P>
Although Hong Kong has been immersed in rains for days, many
local residents stopped while passing the PLA barracks, to have a
better look of the soldiers on guard.
</P>
<P>
Chan Tsing Hwa, who has lived in Hong Kong for five decades and
participated in the Anti-Japanese War, said with emotion, "A
country must have an army. It is a matter of course that the PLA
should be stationed in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Chan now still has a piece of splinter in his body, a leftover
from the war more than half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
Wong Tin Hwa, 28, has his own opinion. "Although I don't know
much about the PLA Hong Kong Garrison, I understand that a country
cannot maintain stability without armed forces. Of course, Hong
Kong needs troops to defend itself after returning to the
motherland."

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Government officials and strategists
here said they believed that Hong Kong would more efficiently
bridge Fujian Province's economic exchanges with Taiwan, though
they preferred them to be done in a direct fashion across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Lin Shouqi, vice-president of the Provincial Statistical
Bureau, said that over 54 percent of the 2.2 billion US dollar
Taiwan capital influx last year into the province along the coasts
of Taiwan Straits came via Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Also, 70 percent of Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong were bought
in China's inland.
</P>
<P>
"Having returned to China, Hong Kong can better facilitate
Taiwan investments' transfer to the mainland," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the mainland and Taiwan should engage in
direct cooperation, and the return of Hong Kong was expected to
boost the trend of establishing these ties.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhu Tianshun, a Taiwan research specialist with
Xiamen University in Xiamen City, said that the implementation of
the "one country, two systems" policy in Hong Kong will give the
people of Taiwan more faith in the realization of the long-awaited
reunification.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Gives First Press Conference After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said here
today that he is full of confidence in Hong Kong's prospects and
would make every effort to maintain the economic competitiveness
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center this afternoon, Tung, who was sworn in as the
HKSAR Chief Executive early Tuesday morning, told over 400 Chinese
and foreign journalists that the smooth handover of Hong Kong has
given the HKSAR a very good start.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong had been very fortunate to have a large
central delegation led by President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li
Peng here to attend the handover ceremony and the ceremony marking
the founding of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that President Jiang Zemin had reaffirmed again
that the principle of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" with a high degree of autonomy would
remain unchanged for a long, long time, and that the Basic Law
will be observed by all departments of the central government and
all the provinces as well.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good message for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, he said, he had had opportunities to
meet many dignitaries from different countries, with whom he
established some friendships and shared the confidence in the
future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions on the Sino-British relationship, Tung said
it is very important for Britain and China to maintain good
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had had "very useful discussions" with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook while
they were in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese and British governments should put aside the past
and look forward to the future," he said, adding that "very good
signs" have appeared for future Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
Replying to another question, Tung said that the international
business community in Hong Kong will have as great a future as the
Chinese community, since Hong Kong will remain a cosmopolitan and
his government is determined to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the return of Hong Kong has provided a
successful example for solving international problems left over by
history, and will also help China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of laws and amendments passed by the British Hong Kong
Legislative Council in the two and three weeks before the
handover, Tung said that these laws and amendments would have
long-term implications for the local community, but some of them
were passed "without proper study" and "certainly without proper
consultation".
</P>
<P>
"Each of these laws and amendments is being studied by the
administration, and we will do what is necessary to protect this
community," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Hong Kong and China's interior areas
share the same long-term interests, and Hong Kong people should
have a better understanding of their motherland.

Stephanopoulos and the Visiting Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov held talks here today on bilateral relations, the
situation in the Balkans and Sofia's accession to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their talks, President
Stephanopoulos said that there was great margin for developing
closer economic relations and increasing exchanges between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's entry into NATO and EU would help consolidate peace
and stability in the region and show that the Balkans could be part
of the community and contribute to the economic development and
integration of Europe.
</P>
<P>
In response, Stoyanov hailed Bulgarian-Greek ties as "always
excellent."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for an intensification of talks
between the two countries and referred to the possibility of
bilateral cooperation on major joint plans as well as in the culture
sector.

<P>
HARARE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Education Minister
Gabriel Machinga today inaugurated the country's national
association of distance and open learning (ZINADOL) which will
coordinate and oversee the activities of distant education and
correspondence institutions.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day meeting in Harare, Machinga said in spite of the
incredible development in education, millions of people of
different ages in both developing and industrialised countries
were still deprived of an opportunity to learn.
</P>
<P>
Since independence in 1980, he said, the Zimbabwean government
realised that universal education was not easy to achieve simply
through conventional approaches which entailed building more
schools, training more teachers, buying and providing more
textbooks.
</P>
<P>
ZINADOL is expected to monitor the operations of distance and
open learning institutions in Zimbabwe, as wells as to assist in
the training of personnel and to ensure the development of
quality instructional materials.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry had been working together with other
ministries, the university of Zimbabwe and commercial
correspondence colleges to provide alternative complementary
education to primary school leavers, as well as further education
opportunities to youths and adults.
</P>
<P>
ZINADOL would facilitate networking with other distance and
open learning institutions and similar bodies in the sub-region,
he added.

WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- More American children are
starting their education earlier and completing it with college,
but many of them are also likely to smoke or use drugs, a
government report released today says.
</P>
<P>
The report, compiling previously released statistics about
children, said more young people were attending early education
programs and graduating from college.
</P>
<P>
They were also getting immunized against childhood diseases and
were less likely to die during infancy and childhood.
</P>
<P>
However, the report found that more adolescents smoke and take
drugs than in the past.
</P>
<P>
It suggests the nation look for more accurate ways to measure
the number of homeless and poor children.
</P>
<P>
Ordered by President Bill Clinton, the report was compiled from
data contributed by federal agencies, including the departments of
Agriculture, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and

According to his report, the state revenues and expenditures
were "basically consistent" with the 1996 budget approved by the
top legislature.
</P>
<P>
State revenues increased in a considerably high rate, which was
2.7 percentage points higher than that of the expenditures.
</P>
<P>
However he also reported that the central government had a 1996
fiscal year deficit of 60.88 billion yuan, though it was 558
million yuan less than budgeted.
</P>
<P>
He said state revenues totaled 426.5 billion yuan in 1996, 8.37
billion yuan more than budgeted and 10.3 percent more than those
of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Among the total state revenues, the central government directly
collected 366 billion yuan, or about 86 percent. The rest were
turned over by various local governments.
</P>
<P>
He also said that state expenditures were 487.4 billion yuan
last year, 7.8 billion yuan more than budgeted and 7.6 percent
more than those in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Among the total state expenditures, the central government
itself spent 215 billion yuan, which is three percent less than
budgeted. Tax refunding and subsidies to local governments
totaled 272.2 billion yuan, 5.6 percent more than those targeted.
</P>
<P>
The financial minister said that the state budget for the 1996
fiscal year was basically well exercised. But he also pointed out
that problems existed.
</P>
<P>
Besides a rather-huge deficit, the problems he mentioned
included appropriation of tax revenues, unauthorized tax
exemptions, and escaping, avoidance and delay of the payment of
tax.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Pledges to Purchase Grain at Protective Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji pledged
that the state will buy grain open-endedly at protective prices
after completing the purchase ordered by the state in order to
keep the grain prices on the market stable and protect the
interests of grain growers.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier made the pledge during an inspection tour of
Henan and Anhui provinces in June 25-30.
</P>
<P>
He repeatedly told grain growers in the two provinces that the
state would not lower the purchasing prices of grain and that it
will see to it that grain growing would be profitable.
</P>
<P>
He assured grain growers that the state will purchase the grain
it had ordered at the prices fixed by the State Council last year
and will purchase grain other than that ordered by the state at
the standard price fixed by the State Council, which was 0.69 yuan
per kilogram for wheat in Henan and 0.675 yuan in Anhui. The grain
ordered by the state will be purchased at 0.76 yuan per kilogram
for wheat in Henan and 0.75 yuan per kilogram in Anhui.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier made the pledge following a declining trend in
grain prices on the market after the good harvest of summer grains.
</P>
<P>
He said he was impressed by the summer harvest in central
China, but warned against the declining trend in grain prices,
which, he said, would hurt the grain growers.
</P>
<P>
He urged localities to learn from past lessons and take
immediate steps to stabilize grain prices.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Agricultural Development Bank to provide enough
funds for grain purchase and use well the grain risk fund which
has added up to 15 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said greater efforts should be made to increase grain
storage capacity and the state would provide lower-interest loans
in this regard.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Pushes Construction of Regional Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Energy ministers from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) urged here today
the speeding up of construction of a trans-ASEAN gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day ASEAN Energy Ministers' Meeting, the
ministers agreed that it is without doubt that ASEAN countries
need to be linked by a natural gas network to ensure the long-term
energy security of the region.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN came up with the idea of building an 8,000-kilometer
undersea gas pipeline three years ago. The network, at an
estimated expense of 11 billion U.S. dollars, would connect
Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia, the region's net gas exporters,
with gas importers including Thailand, Singapore and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The study for the feasibility of the plan undertaken by ASEAN
and a European consortium had been finished by July 1996 and a
final report was submitted to the energy ministers last year.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the ministers also agreed to include Cambodia,
Laos and Myanmar which would be admitted to ASEAN this month in
the planned gas pipeline network.
</P>
<P>
The network, planned to be completed within 10 years, will spur
the increased trade in natural gas within the region, the
ministers said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore,
Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Johnson and Devers Set to Compete in Athletics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
GENEVA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- American world champions Michael
Johnson and Gail Devers are almost sure to be given the wild cards
to take part in the World Athletics Championships in Athens next
month even though they have not qualified directly.
</P>
<P>
Athletics sources said on Wednesday that reigning champions
would be granted wild cards for the championships for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
Although world 200 and 400 meters star Johnson and sprinter
and hurdler Devers have not been picked for the American team
after missing the recent U.S. trials, the sport's governing body,
the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF), is set to
open the door for them.
</P>
<P>
While IAAF general secretary Istvan Gyulai said on Wednesday
that no final decision had been made about wild cards for the
championships, one leading athletics source in Lausanne said: "I
think you will find that there is a majority of people in the IAAF
who are in favour of this and it will be in place by Athens.
</P>
<P>
"Not all athletes and officials like the idea but it is seen
as a way of making the world athletics championships different
from the Olympic Games. It helps top athletes who are injured and
missed national trials to make the event. It basically improves
the championships as a show."
</P>
<P>
The United States has strict rules on qualification for world
championships and Olympics. Only the top three in the national
trials qualify for the team.
</P>
<P>
Double Olympic champion Johnson, world 100 metres hurdles
champion Devers, decathlete Dan O'Brien and women's world 100
metres champion Gwen Torrence all missed their trials because of
injury.

<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
and the Chinese People's Armed Police Force have vowed to
strengthen the army and guarantee security for the country as it
moves toward reunification and rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the general departments of the PLA have been
reviewing Jiang Zemin's speeches at the handover ceremony in Hong
Kong at midnight June 30 and at a public gathering in Beijing
yesterday to celebrate the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that Hong Kong's homecoming would not have been
possible without the constant efforts of new China's three
generations of leadership, guided by the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's great concept of
"one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
They said Hong Kong's smooth transition gave them greater
confidence in the country's reunification cause.
</P>
<P>
Officials from various PLA military area commands said one of
the most important signs of China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong is the PLA's presence in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They added that to safeguard the state sovereignty and national
dignity, a country should strengthen its overall national power
and its system of defense.

BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun said
today during a visit to a Beijing-based space breeding center that
space experts and agronomists should increase cooperation in
cultivating fine-quality seeds in a move to promote agriculture in
China.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the achievements in developing improved

</P>
<P>
Space breeding is part of the national seed-development
project, and plays an important role in promoting the rural
economy and environmental protection, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China began in 1987 to experiment with growing new varieties of
crops in space, using retrievable satellites which took seeds of
more than 400 strains 200-400 km into the sky to see what effects
space had on them.

<HEADLINE> France to Reflect on Africa Policy in Open Way: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- France will reflect deeply on its
Africa policy, which is characterized by its military and
political alliance with countries that were formerly French
colonies, said French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine today.
</P>
<P>
"The government, as the president of the republic, thinks that
the era of unilateral intervention in Africa has passed," said
Vedrine at the French Senate.
</P>
<P>
He said that France should "reconsider in an open way, being
turned toward the future and the new elites," its relations with
France.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of France should be global and take into account,
with an open spirit, the countries and English-speaking Africa,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that this did not mean that France would abandon
its African allies, but was a "redefinition of the whole of our
political, diplomatic and military actions on this continent."
</P>
<P>
On France's policy toward the on-going conflict in the Congo
Republic, Vedrine said that it was to "assist militarily all
foreigners" who wanted to quit the country, and diplomatically
provide mediation to the two warring factions while not letting
France get caught in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
France's Africa policy has been greatly shaken by the war in
former Zaire, and the newly erupting conflicts in the Congo
Republic and the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
France has deployed 1,850 soldiers in the Central African
Republic, 835 in Chad, 600 in Gabon, 520 in Cote d'Ivoire, 1,300
in Senegal, and 3,250 in Djibouti.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A grand theatrical performance was
held in the Great Hall of the People here tonight as part of the
ongoing nationwide celebrations to hail the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Among the more than 10,000 audience members were Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and senior leaders Qiao
Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong Yiren.
</P>
<P>
The curtain was raised on the stage at the Great Hall of the
People amid the replaying of President Jiang's declaration
yesterday of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
"Ode to The Return of Hong Kong" was the theme of the evening,
which is designed to reflect, through songs and dances, the
changes that have taken place in the territory in the past 150
years and to express the nation's joy over the end of a
century-old humiliation, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The colorfully-decorated stage is on most occasions used for
the chairing of major political meetings.
</P>
<P>
A replica of a Chinese white dolphin, the designated mascot for
the handover event, was hanging overhead, carrying in its mouth a
bauhinia flag -- the emblem of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The gala was co-sponsored by the Ministry of Culture, the
Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, and the General Political
Department of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
"Recounting the past will help to make the audience aware that
only a strong and prosperous China could make Hong Kong's return
possible," said Tian Junli, chief director of the performances.
</P>
<P>
An ancient poem about homesickness was recited to stir up
patriotic fervor. When young performers held up signs bearing the
words "Love the motherland, love Hong Kong, love mama," the
audience burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
Traditional dragon and lion dances, as well as Beijing Opera,
were other highlights of the evening. Jackie Chan, one of the
guest celebrities from Hong Kong, demonstrated his kungfu skill
and sang along tonight with 2,800 fellow actors and actresses.
</P>
<P>
A moving recitation eulogizing late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping's historic contributions to accelerating the
reunification with the concept of "One Country, Two Systems"
concept was the high point of the night.
</P>
<P>
"After watching the show, I felt from the bottom of my heart
that the Communist Party is indeed the pillar of our country,"
said a teacher from the Shuncheng Road Primary School.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Denounces Turkish Parliament's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Assembly here
today denounced a recent Turkish Parliament decision to renew for
another six months the presence of the U.S. and British forces on
Turkish territory.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Ghanim Aziz Khaddori, acting chairman of the
Iraqi parliament, attacked the decision adopted last week as
"unjust, interfering in the Iraq's internal affairs, violating its
sovereignty and independence and contradicting the U.N. Charter
and international law."
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraqi News Agency, Khaddori stressed
that the joint force was established under a bilateral agreement
between the U.S. and its other allies that has nothing to do with
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq is illegal,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The acting chairman warned that the continuation of Ankara's
interference in Iraq's internal affairs does not serve Turkey's
national interests, and it will negatively affect its future
relations with Iraq and the Arab world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the
Turkish parliament's decision reflects Turkish politicians'
insistence on practicing the policy of bringing harm to Iraq and
its national security.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iraq holds Turkey fully responsible
for its "harmful" policy towards Iraq, which indicates Turkey's
"sorrowful non-respect" for the good neighborly relations,
international law and the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of U.S. and British troops on Turkish territory
to patrol the "no-fly" zone in northern Iraq threatens the
security and sovereignty not only of Iraq but also of Turkey, the
spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq ended, the U.S., France,
Britain and Turkey built a joint air force and set up a "non-fly"
zone in northern Iraq to protect Iraqi Kurds from attacks by Iraqi
government troops.
</P>
<P>
France withdrew from the joint force at the end of last
year. The zone is patrolled at present by U.S. and British troops
which have their bases in Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Respond Warmly to President's Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people from various walks
of life have responded warmly to President Jiang Zemin's speech
made at a public gathering in Beijing yesterday to celebrate the
return of Hong Kong -- an historic event which has aroused a
strong sense of patriotism throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Feng Jicai, a noted writer in Tianjin, said the return of Hong
Kong to the motherland begins a new chapter for China on the road
to prosperity and national strength.
</P>
<P>
He said that the return of Hong Kong also symbolizes China's
growing power and its regaining of self-respect after more than
half a century's struggle for reunification led by several
generations of the CPC leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said Jiang's speech was a call to all Chinese around the world
to work in one mind and one heart to invigorate the Chinese nation
and make always stand aloft among nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
79-year-old Wang Shen, who wrote the song "Sing the Praises of
Our Motherland" which was popular here 40-some years ago, said
that in the 19th century a poor China with a weak government
could not prevent British imperialists from occupying Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), the country has grown much stronger since the refrom
and opening up, and that being a powerful country was the
prerequisite for China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Abbot Bao Han in the Dabei Temple, a Buddhist temple in
Tianjin, said that to be a Buddhist one must love his country and
be faithful to his religious beliefs. He stressed that an
individual's patriotism should be his first priority.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong marks a milestone in China's
reunification process. It has inspired a love for the motherland
among religious people, who have pledged to contribute more to the
prosperity of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yan, a student from Nankai University, said the older
generations of revolutionaries are responsible for the founding of
New China and the construction of socialism, and the present-day
young intellectuals should strive to make China stronger.

garment and other materials increased by 0.27 percent, 0.01
percent and 0.09 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Vows to Guarantee Safety of Mir Crew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin pledged Tuesday to take every necessary measure to
ensure the personal safety of the three crew members in the Mir
space station and the normal operation of the station itself.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Interfax news agency, Chernomyrdin
said the health and safety of the two Russians and one American on
board the space station must be taken into consideration in the
first place when repairing the station, damaged in a docking
accident on June 25.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Mission Control said the situation on Mir is
"stable", and crew members "are working as planned".
</P>
<P>
The accident happened when a cargo craft, Progress, was docking
with Mir and mildly collided with the station. A scientific module
in Mir was holed during the collision and had to be closed.
</P>
<P>
Though part of the space station's oxygen was released and the
power system was damaged, the three astronauts survived the
accident unscathed.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated that Russia will keep the promise
of building the Alpha international space station to replace the
aging Mir, the world's only space station, at the turn of the
century.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Appoints Stepashin New Justice Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday appointed Sergei Stepashin Justice Minister of the
Russian Federation and dismissed the former minister, Valentin
Kovalyov.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted an official source as saying
the decision was made during today's meeting between Yeltsin and
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, 45, who has headed the Administrative Department of
the Russia government since November, 1995, was director of the
Federal Security Service in 1994-1995. He stepped down from the
latter post after the Chechen guerrilla's raid on the southern
Russian town of Budennovsk in mid-1995 which claimed more than 100
lives.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin on Monday appointed Georgy Kylikov acting Justice
Minister, sacking Kovalyov who was suspended following a sauna sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president also issued a decree today appointing
Mikhail Kislyuk, the governor of Kemerovo region, director of the
Russian Federal Service for the Regulation of Transport Natural
Monopolies.
</P>
<P>
Kislyuk takes over the post from Aman Tuleyev, whom Yeltsin on
Tuesday formally relieved of his duties as Minister for
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Affairs, and appointed
him governor of the Kemerovo region, Siberia, the only governor
appointed in Russia by the presidential decree.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Takes Measures to Protect Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said here
today that the Philippine Central Bank has moved swiftly to
protect the peso following the announcement that Thailand has
devaluated its baht.
</P>
<P>
"The Central Bank has intervened effectively in this regard to
the floating this morning of the Thailand baht, which, of course,
created some negative spillover effects on the Philippines," Ramos
said.
</P>
<P>
The intervention, Ramos said, includes the raising of the
overnight interest rates to 24 percent and the buying of U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time that the country has raised its overnight
interest rates. Earlier this year, the country's overnight
interest rates stood at 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is just overnight that the peso has been effectively
protected from speculative attacks by some quarters as a result of
the spillover effects of the baht being attacked and depreciating,
he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the peso has remained steady at a rate of 26.35
pesos to one U.S. dollar at mid day today, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
"As we have been reporting, the peso during the past 12 months
has been fluctuating within a very, very narrow band range of
about 0.5 to one percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos recalled that during the Mexican financial crisis in
February 1995, the Philippine peso was also under attack, but
because of the proper intervention of the Central Bank, the entire
banking system and the government, the peso remained steady.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Becomes Sixth F-16 Fighter Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has produced its first
locally-made F-16 fighter, and become the sixth nation making the
F-16.
</P>
<P>
The other five producers are the United States, the
Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Samsung Aerospace Industries Company spent 1.126 million
U.S. dollars in facility investments and employed a workforce of
4,000 experts over the past three years for the development of a
South Korean version of the fighter, the KF-16.
</P>
<P>
With the production of the fighter, South Korea's technological
levels in fighter production-management and test-evaluation have
reached 90 percent and 60 percent of those of advanced nations
respectively, Yonhap News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Defense Ministry plans to arm its air force with a
total of 120 F-16s by 1999: twelve directly imported in the first
phase, 36 assembled in South Korea in the second phase and 72
locally produced on permit from the licensee, Lockheed Martin
Corporation, the original F-16 maker in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The first KF-16 fighter, modelled after a U.S. Air Force
version, the F-16 C/D block 52, has an engine thrust of 29,000
pounds, 6,000 pounds more than existing F-16 fighters.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM Rebuffs President's Appointment Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino
today turned down a request by President Sali Berisha to appoint a
new interior minister after the serving incumbent fled the country.
</P>
<P>
Berisha last Tuesday demanded that one of his close aides, Azem
Hajdari, replace Belul Celo, who left Albania Wednesday, said a
statement issued by the prime minister's press office.
</P>
<P>
Fino, whose Socialist Party defeated the Democratic Party of
Berisha in last week's parliamentary election, described the
request as illegal.
</P>
<P>
He said that the president's appointment of a minister without
the prime minister's recommendation was not in line with the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Despite Celo's departure, he remained interior minister since
he did not offer a letter of resignation, Fino said. He added that
even if the post were vacant, Hajdari would not be a suitable
nomination.
</P>
<P>
The spat between the prime minister and the president comes
amid continuing tensions in the capital following the socialist
party's victory in the elections.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech on Monday, Berisha conceded the defeat of
his party and called for the restoration of order to the country
which was gripped by unrest and violence earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
But the president did not say whether he would step down. He
had hinted on several occasions after the turmoil began in March
that he would resign if his Democratic Party should lose to
leftists in the election.

<HEADLINE> Vengeance for Killed Vendor May Be Motive Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Vengeance for a killed vendor could
be the motive behind Tuesday's grenade bombing in Pasig City,
Metro Manila, police said today.
</P>
<P>
Chief Inspector Nilo Jambalos, Pasig City police chief, said
his men suspected a group of being responsible for the explosion
that occurred later Tuesday afternoon before a public market.
</P>
<P>
One person was killed and 27 others injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Jambalos did not reveal the name of the group, but said the
group could have taken vengeance for the shooting of a vendor in
the same market several days ago.
</P>
<P>
Jambalos did not identify the victim in that alleged shooting.
He added that his men are intensifying a campaign against illegal
vendors in the market.
</P>
<P>
Pasig City Mayor Vicente Eusebio said that the incident had
nothing to do with the celebration today of the 424th anniversary
of Pasig City.

<HEADLINE> France Supports Plavsic's Struggle With Other Bosnian Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed support for
Bosnian Serb president, Biljana Plavsic, in her confrontation with
hardline Serb leaders who are pressuring her to resign.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said
Plasvic "has shown in the past her willingness to participate in
the peace efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
He also recalled France's demand that the Republika Srpska, the
Serb sub-state which takes up half of Bosnia, should "conform
itself to the peace agreements signed in Dayton and Paris."
</P>
<P>
"France would not tolerate the participation in the political
life of Bosnia by persons convicted by the International Criminal
Tribunal (in the Hague). The appearance of war criminals before
the Tribunal is for us a major concern," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb ruling party, the Serb Democratic Party, has
asked the Bosnian Serb parliament to remove Plavsic from
presidency because of her recent dismissal of Interior Minister
Dragan Kijac.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic accused Kijac of refusing to cooperate with the
international police force, and having disbanded, without
consulting her, an intelligence and counter-espionage unit of an
anti-terrorist police brigade in Banja Luka, the northwest Bosnian
city controlled by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
She also charged Kijac, who is believed to be close to former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, of organizing trafficking
and "turning the country into a private game preserve."

investment in Guangzhou came from Hong Kong, which is also the
entrepot for 80 percent of Guangzhou's exports.

has increased, hailing it as a sign for a recovery in the sector
and also as the beginning of a new cycle of economic prosperity

CHONGQING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Young Pioneers in Chongqing today
launched paper boats on a voyage from the Yangtze River to Hong
Kong, bringing with them the good wishes of children of this
largest municipality for children in Hong Kong that has just
returned to the motherland after more than a century and a half.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River was calm today. Under a bridge across the
Yangtze River in Chongqing, small paper boats were sailing towards
Tianmen one after another. Leading the fleet was a color paper boat,
trailing with colorful baloons. On the sail were inscribed with
"Hong Kong, Mother welcomes you".
</P>
<P>
"Every paper boat carries a good wish for Hong Kong," said
Huang Xiaoyan, a six grader whose vessel led the fleet on its long
journey. "I'm sending my greetings to the children in Hong Kong
with this paper boat and I wish Hong Kong a more brilliant future."
</P>
<P>
The most eye-catching creation is a remoted-controlled colorful
speed boat decorated with a national red flag and a regional flag
of Hong Kong. The owner was Zhao Xin, a senior middle school
student who won a number of national model vessel competitions.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased to participate in the event as part of my
activities to greet the return of Hong Kong," Zhao said. "I wish
Hong Kong will continue to develop and greet the future with a
brand new outlook."
</P>
<P>
The activities took place in the ports of Chongqing, Fuling and
Wanxian. Nearly 2,000 Young Pioneers participated in the
activities that launched 1,997 paper vessels, according to Hong

ALGIERS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat arrived here today on a brief visit to
Algeria, it was reported by the Algerian news agency.
</P>
<P>
He was greeted at Algiers airport by Algeria's National
People's Assembly Speaker Abdul Qadir Bin Saleh, Foreign Minister
Ahmed Attaf, and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed Algerian sources, Arafat will hold
talks with Algerian President Liamine Zeroual on the latest
international developments, regional issues, and the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
They will examine impediments in the peace process, and the
Judaization policy pursued by Israeli authorities in the occupied
Arab territories, particularly occupied Jerusalem. The two sides
will also discuss the prospects of enhancing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Algerian observers pointed out that the situation in the Middle
East is quite grave at present as the peace process has reached a
dead end because of Israel's extremist policy.
</P>
<P>
They said Arafat is pinning hopes on the international
community, including the Arab states, to bring pressure to bear on
the Israeli government, and to urge it to abandon its
security-for-peace formula and to accept the land-for-peace
principle instead, and to implement the Oslo peace accord and
related UN Security Council resolutions.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia's top border guard official
today depicted bright prospects and quick problem solving along
the Russia-China border.
</P>
<P>
General Andrei Ivanovich Nikolayev, the head of Russian Federal
Border Guard Bureau (FBGB), said the development of state
relations between Russia and China will "necessarily" lend
positive influence to the border situation.
</P>
<P>
Nikolayev expressed his satisfaction about the present
situation along the multi-thousand-kilometer border between the
two large countries. He said: "All the problems that occured in
boundary areas can now have a swift settlement through friendly
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the three unprecedented agreements on
mutually defending the border, mutual trust in military affairs
and cuts in border military presence, signed in 1995 between
Russia and China, have yielded good results. Illegal
border-crossings had reduced by five-sixths in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"It is pleasing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nikolayev said the task of the FBGB was not to keep Russia
apart from neighboring countries, but to enhance contact with
them. The border guards' main mission was not to battle but to
prevent armed action and crime.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Pursue Policy of Peaceful Coexistence: King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Nepali King Birendra said here
today that the Nepali government will continue pursuing a foreign
policy based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and
promote sub-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nepal will make efforts to consolidate economic diplomacy in
conducting international relations and thus further its economic
interests, the king said when addressing a joint session of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said the country will undertake steps to help the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) take measures
to handle core economic issues for the common benefit of its
members and promote the concept of sub-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC groups Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
Birendra stressed that his government will look into every
alternative to resolve the problem of Bhutanese refugees.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese of Nepali origin fled to Nepal via
India in 1989 and they now live in eight camps in eastern Nepal,
causing many social and security problems.
</P>
<P>
The king said the visits of the Nepali prime minister to
Britain and Pakistan, those of the presidents of China and Germany
to Nepal last year, and the recent trip of the Indian prime
minister to Nepal have resulted in the strengthening of
traditional, close and friendly bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said his government believes that cooperation with Nepal
from the friendly donor countries will continue.
</P>
<P>
The 12th session of the Nepali Parliament began on June 26,
with the passage of the budget for the coming 1997-98 fiscal year

<HEADLINE> Huge Tanker Aground in Tokyo Bay Leaks Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A Panama-registered oil tanker loaded
with 250,000 tons of crude oil ran aground near the port of
Yokohama this morning, spilling a large amount of oil into Tokyo
Bay.
</P>
<P>
The spilled oil from the 147,012-ton Diamond Grace caused a
slick five kilometers long and three kilometers wide, sources from
the Maritime Safety Agency (MSA) said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan's top shipping company
which operates the tanker, said that by 12:55 p.m.(local time),
the ship had leaked about 11,000 kiloliters of oil.
</P>
<P>
The oil leak was stopped at 1:00 p.m., the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
After the accident occurred, the MSA immediately mobilized 10
vessels, including patrol ships, from its Yokohama regional branch
to fight the spill.
</P>
<P>
The MSA vessels have set up oil fences and are conducting
cleanup operations, the MSA officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) also dispatched
three tugboats and other vessels to help spread oil fences in the
bay.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto met with representatives from
government agencies to discuss the oil spill and ways to minimize
its damage. They decided to set up a central emergency management
task force.
</P>
<P>
The 322 meters long and 58 meters wide tanker, built in 1994,
was carrying crude oil from the United Arab Emirates to a refinery
owned by the Mitsubishi Oil Co. Ltd., in Kawasaki near Yokohama.
</P>
<P>
It is the second oil spill in Japan's sea area this year. In
January, a Russian tanker split in two and sank in the Sea of
Japan off the western coast, dumping an estimated 5,000 kiloliters
of fuel oil and fouling hundreds of kilometers of shoreline.

<HEADLINE> Gemstone-Trading Liberalized in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
liberalized trading in gemstones by introducing new licenses to
enable Zambians and foreign investors participate fully in the
mining of the precious stone in the country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Deputy Minister of Mines Kaunda
Lembalemba at a press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Lembalemba said that the new move has been tailored to benefit
and enable indigenous Zambians participate in exploiting and
enjoying the natural wealth endowed to them as it is dangerous to
only let foreign nationals exploit the wealth of the nation at
the expense of the local people.
</P>
<P>
Even villagers will be allowed to mine sections of their areas
endowed with gemstones, he said.
</P>
<P>
The time has gone when it was a big crime to trade in
gemstones since now any Zambian who wishes to trade in this
mineral needs only to obtain a gemstone sales certificate by
paying a total of 198,000 kwacha (150 US Dollars) in registration
fees, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Gemstones is one of the non-traditional products which is
boosted by the Zambian government for export.

<HEADLINE> Kowloon Customs Is Renamed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- An official ceremony was held
today in the southern city of Shenzhen to rename the customs there
"Shenzhen Customs". The point was previously known as "Kowloon
Customs."
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin did the honor of providing characters for
use on name-board of the customs house. His calligraphy
reads: "Shenzhen Customs, People's Republic of China".
</P>
<P>
The name change emphasizes China's resumption of exercise of
its sovereignty over Hong Kong, while the maintenance of a customs
post at the boundary of the Special Administrative Region with
Shenzhen provides practical evidence of central government
adhering to its principle of "One country, Two systems."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Qian Guanlin, Director General of the
General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic
of China, reiterated that Hong Kong Customs will retain its
independence in administration and the GAC will not interere with
such activities.
</P>
<P>
"Trade between Hong Kong and the inland areas will be regarded
as external trade between two different tariff areas under one
sovereignty state," Qian pointed out, adding that Hong Kong
investors in inland areas will continue to enjoy whatever
preferential treatment is granted to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Qian also stressed that Hong Kong is not subject to the Customs
Law of the People's Republic of China nor the regulations which
are applied by inland customs.
</P>
<P>
"On that basis, customs authorities of inland areas can develop
a good relationship with their Hong Kong counterpart, forging
closer links and having frequent exchanges of information "
explained Qian.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Party Talks Put on Hold in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish Institute of Democracy
and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) has abandoned the inter-party
talks initiative because of what Times of Zambia today reported
as the disorganization displayed among opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
IDEA representatives Berhetesfu Constantinos and Nobby Ngobane
left here on Tuesday abruptly after a stormy meeting held here on
Monday, during which the opposition parties allegedly refused to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Michael Sata, National Secretary of
the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), as saying
that "they have gone back to Sweden but have left a warning that
the inter-party talks will not take place unless the opposition
reform and these parties will have to take the initiative to call
IDEA back."
</P>
<P>
The opposition Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) President Roger
Chongwe was quoted as attributing the departure to the failure by
political parties to agree on an agenda.
</P>
<P>
He insisted the National Patriotic Coalition (NPC) grouping 12
opposition parties has merely offered proposals and not
conditions for the proposed talks but the government has not
given its counter proposals to form the basis of the talks.

<P>
BONN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- German economy will expect a growth of
about two percent this year, falling short of the 2.5 percent
predicted by the Bonn government, an economic research institute
said today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the export boom and a big improvement in trade balance,
Germany will still fail to overcome the weakness in economic
growth and investment both this year and next, said the
Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research in its latest
economic report.
</P>
<P>
According to its forecast, the economic growth for next year
will remain at two percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the institute also saw no improvement in the job
market, predicting that Germany will still expect double-digit
jobless rates of 11.4 percent this year and 12.1 percent in 1998,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Ready to Strike in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Soldiers of the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) massed in Sierra Leone are capable of
flushing out the coupists in that country, the force commander
has said.
</P>
<P>
The troops are only awaiting the go-ahead to strike, said
ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu on Tuesday, who
arrived from Liberia where the multi-national force has been
operating for about seven years.
</P>
<P>
"We have the capability of flushing out those people if and
when we are directed to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, the ECOMOG is waiting for the time of two
weeks given the ministerial committee by the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) to dialogue with the coupists,
after which other steps including an embargo and the use of force
will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
Malu said, "we are not in Sierra Leone doing the type of job
we are doing in Liberia. We have not occupied the country for
security. we were there before the coup."
</P>
<P>
"What we did was to reinforce the troops in that place to
protect ourselves. As a matter of fact, we have not gotten any
operational order to go in to reverse the coup," he said.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS foreign ministers in a communique on June 26 resolved
that within two weeks, a committee comprising Nigeria, Ghana,
Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire should consult with the coupists in
Sierra Leone after which an embargo and force to unseat the
coupists will be used.
</P>
<P>
The coupists led by Major Johnny Paul Koroma have to either
resign and install elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah till July
10 or will face the wrath of ECOMOG troops currently occupying
part of capital Freetown, including the international airport.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said today
that the military had stopped its offensive against the rebel Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) as of Tuesday night in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly press conference, Ramos said he was informed by
the Armed Forces' Chief of Staff Gen. Arnulfo Acedera that the
military had ceased its offensive against the MILF guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Ramos appealed to the MILF leadership to resume peace talks
with the government to forge a lasting peace, saying he hoped the
halt of the military offensive will help resume the peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the past two weeks, the military carried out an all-out
assault against MILF rebels who were accused by the government of
being involved in many kidnap-for-ransom incidents in central
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The military offensive killed more than 100 rebels, soldiers
and civilians and forced more than 65,000 residents to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The offensive, during which a major MILF camp was taken by the
government troops, also prompted the MILF to pull out of the sixth
round of its low-level peace talks with the government scheduled
for the end of June.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Taylor Escapes Assassination Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Liberian warlord and one of
the country's presidential candidates, Charles Taylor, has
escaped an assassination bid in Monrovia, the capital, barely 17
days to the general elections.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG on Tuesday said three persons, including Managing
Director of the Liberian Forestry Development Authority, Madison
Wion, had been arrested in connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
Wion had been found to be involved in the assassination
attempt and "he has confessed both in writing and on tape about
his full involvement in the plot to kill Taylor," said the
statement issued by Biola Lawal, press secretary to the ECOMOG
force commander.
</P>
<P>
"We are now putting together all the necessary document to
transfer the case to the Justice Ministry for further action," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The clarification, the statement said, became necessary to put
to rest the anxiety among Council of State members, the
Transitional Legislative Assembly and members of the public, who
over the past few days have expressed concern over the arrest of
the suspects.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated that the ECOMOG was not in Liberia to
intimidate anybody, but to perform its security duties as well as
prevent criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG cannot fold its arms where individuals are planning to
assassinate political figures like Taylor, especially because of
the security implications," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force has repeatedly promised to provide
security to the Liberian populace, and politicians campaigning in
the hinterland in particular.
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident, about 15 other Liberians have been
arrested by ECOMOG for electoral malpractices since registration
of voters started in the country.

<HEADLINE> hkhk-Advisers on Hong Kong Affairs Accomplish Mission (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held here this
morning to mark the end of the term of the advisers on Hong Kong
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ceremony, Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said that the
historic contributions made by the advisers to the grand event of
the return of Hong Kong to the motherland "will go down in history
and will always inspire our future generations."
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed the hope that the advisers will continue to
contribute to building the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) in their posts in future.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the ceremony held in the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center were T.k. Ann Tse-kai, and Henry
Fok Ying Tung, vice chairmen of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Lu Ping,
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State
Council (HKMAOSC), Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the HKSAR,
and Zhou Nan, director of Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency
(HKBXNA).
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, HKMAOSC and HKBXNA decided to jointly invite
representatives of Hong Kong people from all walks of life to be
advisers on Hong Kong affairs, in an effort to do work better
concerning the smooth transition and the handover.
</P>
<P>
The decision was considered a major step to encourage the Hong
Kong people to participate in managing Hong Kong affairs during
the transitional period. Four groups of 186 people served as the
advisers.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to China is a historic event for the Chinese
nation, as well as a significant event for the world as a whole,
he said, adding: "All the advisers have contributed to and are
also witnesses to that event."
</P>
<P>
He praised the advisers for the suggestions they had made on
major matters during the late transitional period, the efforts
they had made to publicize the Basic Law, and plenty of
down-to-earth and good work they had done.
</P>
<P>
'"It has proved that advisers on the Hong Kong affairs
constitute an important force of loving the motherland and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"With the termination of the transitional period and the
establishment of the HKSAR government, the glorious mission of the
advisers has been successfully accomplished," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice premier, it had always been a matter of
great concern to late leader Deng Xiaoping to enable the Hong Kong
people to take part in managing Hong Kong affairs and to create
conditions for "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"The gradual participation in Hong Kong affairs by Hong Kong
people stressed by Deng Xiaoping also constitutes a guideline for
our work during the transitional period," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the establishment of the Basic Law Drafting
Committee, the Advisory Committee for the Basic Law, the
Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the
HKSAR and the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR constituted a
form through which to rely on the Hong Kong people to handle the
Hong Kong affairs and to pave the way for "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" in a broader sense.

<P>
A series of activities including consulting activities
organized by the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) of the
Preparatory Committee (PC) for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and the PC, and the application for
the candidates for the Selection Committee were one aspect
involving the participation by the Hong Kong residents. They also
won the support and understanding of Hong Kong affairs advisors,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"We are impressed by the unprecedented enthusiasm of the Hong
Kong people about electing candidates for the First Chief
Executive of the HKSAR, as well as the Provisional Legislative
council (PLC)," he said
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the active participation of people from all walks of
life in Hong Kong as masters of their own destiny, preparations
for forming the HKSAR proceeded smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the HKSAR marks the end of the history in
which Hong Kong was ruled by a foreign country and the start of a
new era of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", he said.
</P>
<P>
From now on, Hong Kong will be governed by the Hong Kong people
who have become masters of Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR Government, composed entirely of permanent Hong Kong
residents and comprising the administrative, legislative and
judicial departments, has been set up. Under the leadership of
Tung Chee Hwa, the leading body of the HKSAR Government has made a
very good start in operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of "the Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" principle requires the involvement and the concerted efforts
of more than six million Hong Kong residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all advisors to continue to work hard at their posts
and play their roles in future.
</P>
<P>
At present, Qian said, the whole world is observing the
implementation in Hong Kong of the "one country, two systems"
policy, which is an unprecedented great mission.
</P>
<P>
"We will encounter various kinds of problems in implementing
this policy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Central Government of China is firm and unshakable in its
determination to implement the "one country, two systems" policy.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that with the support of people across
China and the concerted efforts of Hong Kong people, the "one
country, two systems" policy will certainly succeed.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was presided over by Zhou Nan, director of the
Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Qian had a picture taken with all the
advisers.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Prevent Disease Outbreak in War-Torn Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine health workers are now
taking all possible measures to prevent an outbreak of any disease
in the war-torn towns in Mindanao, the southern Philippines,
Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica said today.
</P>
<P>
Reodica said in a statement that medical teams on 24-hour
service are conducting disease surveillance and case treatment in
evacuation centers housing those who were displaced by recent
fighting between soldiers and Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
Reodica said cases of diarrhea, sore eyes and rabies are on the
rise in some evacuation centers, adding that her department will
send more doctors, nurses and sanitary engineers to these centers.
</P>
<P>
Reodica's announcement came a day after President Fidel Ramos
declared eight towns in the provinces of North Cotabato and
Maguindanao as calamity areas.
</P>
<P>
She said the number of the displaced who temporarily camped in
evacuation centers has soared to 65,500 after fierce clashes
between government troops and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Reodica said she will personally assess and oversee the
situation in at least 81 evacuation centers in North Cotabato,
which house about 39,000 people, mostly children.
</P>
<P>
Health officials are also conducting massive vaccination of
children against measles and other diseases, chlorination of
drinking water and intense health education and information.
</P>
<P>
So far, Reodica said, there is no reported outbreak of any
disease despite cases of illness being reported.

PARIS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton Tuesday published a report on
information trade, in which he adopted an extremely liberal
attitude toward government regulation of free flow of information
on the Internet -- no censorship of the contents and no regulation
of exchange of information worldwide. This will have a strong
impact not only on the United States, but also on the whole world.
</P>
<P>
-- Accused since July 1996 of "genocide" and crimes against
humanity, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has been
living safely in a house outside Pale, 15 kilometers from
Sarajevo, under heavy protection of Serb security force, from
which he is still controlling the Serb territory to the smallest
details through telephone conversations with his followers,
according to an officer of the NATO peace consolidation force SFOR
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Tuesday called on the
Socialist Party deputies not to take "untimely" positions by
blaming the government for the closure of Renault Vilvoorde auto
plant in Belgium, because that would encourage "certain parties"
in the majority -- by which he apparently referred to the
Communist Party, to raise their tone when criticizing the
government.
</P>
<P>
-- The number of automobiles sold in France dropped by 30.7
percent in June compared to that in May, amid a serious crisis of
the French auto market, where the registrations of new cars
decreased by 23.7 percent in the first half of 1997, compared to
the second half of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A combination of heavy buying,
positive economic news and the potential of a large cash injection
from offshore catapulted the Australian sharemarket to another
record closing high today.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trade the benchmark all ordinaries index was
24.7 points higher at 2,745.9, eclipsing the previous record of
2,725.9 points set on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reynold &AMP; Co senior broker Peter Struk said the market was
perplexed by today's strong performance.
</P>
<P>
"No one expected it to be up by 25 points ... there's some
speculation around that when the market reopens in Hong Kong there
will be some overseas buying interest, notably London and
Australia," Struk said.
</P>
<P>
Traders also said the firmer close on Wall Street had set the
tone for today's solid market performance.
</P>
<P>
A broker said the mid-morning announcement by ratings agency
Mood'y Investor Services on the positive outlook for Australia's
credit rating had helped sentiment, but had not substantially
moved the market.
</P>
<P>
Retail stocks benefited from data from the Australian Bureau of
Statistics, which showed a 2.9 percent lift in retail trade in
May.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index finished 38.8 points higher at
4,329.8 while the all resources gained 13.8 points to 1,523.1.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, National Australia Bank was up 37.1
cents at 19.39 Australian dollars, Commonwealth was up 17 at 16.01
Australian dollars, Westpac gained six to 7.97 Australian dollars
and ANZ was five firmer at 9.91 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Traders said investors chasing yields and betting on a cut in
official interest rates were buying into the major banks.
</P>
<P>
On the resources front, market bellwether BHP gained 31 cents
to 19.83 Australian dollars and diversified miner Rio Tinto piled
on 50 cents to 22.97 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index closed 0.1 point higher at 1,465.6 while in
Sydney gold bullion closed a 332.10 US dollars per fine ounce --
down from 333.75 US dollars Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> NPC Standing Committee Reviews Auditing Report For Fiscal Year 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The 26th session of China's Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee here today
reviewed a report on last year's budget by Guo Zhenqian,
Auditor-General of the State Auditing Administration.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Qiao Shi attended the
session, which was presided over by Wang Guangying, Vice-Chairman
of the NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
in his report, Guo said that the country's financial condition
improved with the growth rate of revenues exceeding that of the
GDP for the first time in 1996. Generally speaking, he added,
implementation of the central budget in 1996 was good, and in
addition to revenue increases, expenditures were effectively
controlled and better used.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal year 1996 the central government's total revenues
were 2 percent more than expected, while expenditures were 1.6
percent more than expected, and the deficit 558 million yuan (some
69 million US dollars) less than expected.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, there were still problems in the
implementation of the central budget last year, including a lack
of strictness and standards, ineffective revenue management, and
illegal tax reductions and remittances.
</P>
<P>
He said that new methods, including strengthening
tax-collecting, standardizing special financial allocations from
the central bank to various local authorities, improving
management of the central government's special investment plans
for infrastructure, and improving the approval system for budgets
should be used to deal with these problems.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Assessment Boosts Australian Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
firmer against the U.S. currency, gaining strength from the
release of an upbeat Moody's Investors Service report, but it was
still haunted by the specter of potential interest rate movements.
</P>
<P>
The local unit finished in Sydney at 75.48 U.S. cents, after
trading in a range of 75.06 to 75.53 U.S. cents, and up from 75.21
U.S. cents late in local dealings yesterday.
</P>
<P>
One dealer said the catalyst for the day's strength was a
Moody's report which said the outlook for Australia's Aa2 rating
was improving.
</P>
<P>
The dealer said the local unit was now "basically on hold"
while it awaited the outcome, expected tonight, of the U.S.
Federal Reserve's two-day meeting on monetary policy and potential
movements in interest rates by its domestic equivalent, the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
</P>
<P>
The two countries' equivalent official rates are level at 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The markets do not expect the Federal Reserve to increase
rates. Yesterday, the RBA held its monthly meeting, but was silent
this morning about monetary policy. The RBA eased rates four times
in the past 12 months with the last easing on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Citibank economists Stephen Koukoulas and Annette Beacher said
the Australian dollar remained vulnerable to an easing, but was
positively influenced by the favorable outlook from Moody's.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended in Sydney at 86.47 Japanese yen, up
from 86.7, and at 1.317 Deutsche marks from 1.3141.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Not to Hand back Nationalized Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government has
no plans to return nationalized schools to their owners, Deputy
Chief Minister and Minister for Education, Omar Ramadhani Mapuri,
has said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today from Zanzibar, while
winding up the debate on the Education Ministry's estimates for
1997/98 in the House of Representatives in the town of Zanzibar,
Mapuri said on Monday the schools were nationalized to provide
free education for children in the Isles after the January
Revolution in 1964.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the former owners could come back and
open new private schools in the Isles.
</P>
<P>
The deputy chief minister said the current Zanzibar laws do
not allow nationalization and that people should feel free to
open private schools to help educate the islanders and increase
admission of pupils.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mapuri said public schools have been unable to
satisfy the demand due to shortage of classrooms.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there has been a shortage of teachers
especially those handling science subjects. Classrooms are
congested and teachers are compelled to handle the overcrowded
classes, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, some other developing countries have been
also experiencing a similar problem due to the existence of
universal primary education aimed at fighting illiteracy in
respective nations.
</P>
<P>
On combating shortage of science teachers, Mapuri revealed
that talks are underway to bring in qualified teachers from
Nigeria to teach science subjects and geography subjects which
also lacked competent teachers.

<HEADLINE> Tradings Triple on Egyptian Stock Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The volume of tradings on the
Egyptian stock markets hit 12 billion Egyptian pounds (3.5 billion
U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year, almost tripling the
volume of the same period in 1996, the Egyptian Gazette reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The volume of shares traded in the first half of last year was
3.3 billion pounds (970.6 million dollars), according to Abdel
Hamid Ibrahim, chief of the Capital Market Authority that governs
operations of the stock exchanges in Cairo and Alexandria, a
northern coastal city.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference Tuesday that the newly-issued
securities including bonds and shares have risen to 9.1 billion
pounds (2.7 billion dollars) in the first six months of 1997 from
7.6 billion pounds (2.2 billion dollars) in the January-June
period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of deals for the first half of this year, he said,
totaled 675,000, against 270,000 during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of companies undertaking these deals
surged to 289 from 262 last year.
</P>
<P>
To address a sharp price hike on the market at the start of the
year, the authority has put a 5 percent limit on daily price
movement.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the market has been falling in what brokers
see as a "correction."

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Ugandans have fled
their homes in western Bundibugyo District to eastern Congo as
rebels are terrorizing civilians there, informed sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
World Harvest missionaries based on Uganda-Congo border
estimated the number of the fleeing people between 20,000 and
30,000, but a United Nations' report put the number between 5,000
and 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program said it will send a
team to assess if further food and other needs are necessary
after 60 tons of maize and other supplies have been sent to
Bundibugyo.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Katumba Wamala, acting commander of the Second
Division of the Ugandan army, said the dispersed rebels of the
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) are terrorizing civilians.
</P>
<P>
The ADF is a rebel group acting in western Uganda. It sent 250
rebels in mid-June to Bundibugyo and tried in vain to isolate the
district from the other parts of Uganda and use it as a
bargaining chip against the government, Colonel Katumba noted.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Banks in China Give Good Report on Yuan Business (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded banks in Shanghai
say that their months-old business in Chinese currency is going
well, hoping that China's central bank can raise the ceiling of
their funds in Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has since last
December approved nine overseas-funded banks in Shanghai to deal
in yuan-based business on a trial basis in the city's Pudong New
Area, an emerging financial and trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The nine banks are the Citibank, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
Ltd., the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, the Daiichi Kangyo Bank, the Sanwa Bank, the
Standard Chartered Bank, the Banque Indosuez, and the
International Bank of Paris and Shanghai, a joint-venture between
France's Banque Nationale de Paris and the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Most of the banks have moved their Shanghai branches to Pudong
to qualify for dealing in yuan business. Since March 27, six of
them have offered yuan-based services.
</P>
<P>
Loans account for a major part of the banks' yuan business,
which also includes accepting deposits, providing guarantees, and
trading in treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
An official with PBC Shanghai says that the trial yuan business
of the overseas-funded banks has been going well and that no major
problems have been reported. To date nearly 140 overseas-funded
enterprises have opened yuan accounts at the Shanghai branch of
Japan's Sanwa Bank alone.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Banks in China Give Good Report on Yuan Business (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In interviews with Xinhua, the banks have expressed a common
wish to increase the amount of yuan funds at their disposal in
order to expand business.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Kiyoshige
Akamatsu, said that in less than three months Japanese-funded
enterprises have applied for about 300 million yuan in loans, as
opposed to the ceiling of 30 million in its disposable yuan funds
permitted by the PBC.
</P>
<P>
He explained that after a certain amount of funds are deducted
for other purposes, only 50-70 percent of the funds can be used
for loans. He added that overseas banks also have difficulty in
attracting yuan funds, because their sources of Chinese currency
deposits are limited to overseas-funded enterprises registered in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Overseas bank executives also note that their business in the
interbank money market is restricted by a maximum of 30 million
yuan allowed for by the PBC.
</P>
<P>
Akamatsu said that he is confident about the bank's prospects
in yuan business and that he expects yuan-based services to make
up about 10 percent of his bank's portfolio, as opposed to the 1
to 2 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
The overseas banks agree that at the current stage of
development, cooperation with Chinese banks far outweighs
competition in the yuan business, and that they hope for more
cooperation with Chinese banks.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Shanghai's Bank of Communications and Japan's Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd jointly offered 45 million yuan in loans to a
company here.

<HEADLINE> African Banks Urged to Be More Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- It is high time for African banks
to restructure their operations and be privatized in a bid to
compete more effectively in the global economy, Kenya Finance
Minister Musalia Mudavadi has urged.
</P>
<P>
The huge challenges facing African bankers currently are how
to keep pace with the changing world, he was quoted by today's
Kenyan Times newspaper as speaking at the first Commonwealth
Africa Banking seminar at Mombasa on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the banks should entail moving away from
the use of controls, including credit directives and
administrative interventions, so as to allow the banks a greater
role in the mobilization of savings, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that the economic reforms launched by the
Kenyan government four years ago have started yielding fruits
which are reflected in the reduction of inflation rate and the
stabilization of the Kenya Shilling.
</P>
<P>
Due to the economic reforms, the exchange rate in the eastern
African country is now market-driven apart from the tariffs being
restructured, he added.
</P>
<P>
"More important was the fact that the measures which made the
(Kenyan) economy more open, competitive and efficient have
stimulated progress in all spheres of economic activity," he
said.

LIMA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Congress President Victor
Joyway Rojas and other senior officials attended a reception
hosted today by the Chinese Embassy here to celebrate the return
of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Juan Castillo said that the handover ceremony
has been well organized. After more than 150 years of colonial
rule by Britain, Hong Kong was returned to the motherland, which
is a good thing for the people of both China and Peru.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful settlement of Hong Kong should be attributed to
the idea of "one country, two systems," said an expert who used to
work in China.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas Chinese, who attended the reception, said the
return of Hong Kong had showed the strength of an emerging China.

<HEADLINE> Little of Lusaka's Refuse Collected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Only about 14 percent of the total
waste in Lusaka is collected, according to a local paper "The
Post" today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a joint report by the Environmental
Council of Zambia (ECZ) and Lusaka City Council (LCC) as saying
that out of 243,000 tons of domestic, commercial and
institutional waste generated per year in the capital city, only
30,000 tons are collected and disposed of.
</P>
<P>
ECZ Senior Inspector Peter Zulu said here on Tuesday that the
refuse uncollected causes numerous problems for the city.
</P>
<P>
"Lusaka is now known as the 'garbage city' and this
uncollected refuse is responsible to a large extent for waste
pollution, leading to outbreak of diseases like cholera and
dysentery in compounds," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The ECZ/LCC report cited lack of refuse collecting vehicles,
inadequate manpower and little training for the refuse collection
managers as some of the reasons for the city's inability to
collect garbage.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Lusaka has 19 vehicles for the
exercise with only eight functioning while the total work force
is 270, making it impossible to effectively cover the city.
</P>
<P>
Another serious problem is the deficiency in solid waste
storage in places like markets, residential areas, bus stops,
medical institutions, commercial and industrial areas, causing
refuse to be littered in all places.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Population Figure Corrected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has a population
of 37.9 million, which is lower than the 1991 official count,
according to preliminary estimates taken from last year's census.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the Central Statistical Service (CSS) on
Tuesday, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The CSS said it expected the total population to be more than
42 million people, based on the census in 1991, when South
Africa's total population was estimated to be 38 million.
</P>
<P>
The census' 96 preliminary figures, which focus mainly on the
size of the population, were released yesterday.
</P>
<P>
But the CSS said statistical information on population groups,
language, education and income among others still had to be
processed.
</P>
<P>
It said a special post-enumeration survey indicated an
undercount of 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This means that about seven people in every 100 across the
country were not counted. We accordingly adjusted the preliminary
estimates upwards," the CSS said.

<HEADLINE> Law on Sub-Standard Imports Hailed in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Vice President George
Saitoti has hailed a new legislation to curb dumping of shoddy
goods as announced in this year's budget, saying it will now give
local manufacturers an edge over imported goods.
</P>
<P>
The new anti-dumping law will check the importation of goods
and ensure sub-standard goods are not allowed into the country,
while the local firms will get the chance to compete fairly, he
was quoted by today's "Kenyan Time" newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of Kenya's economy has allowed the
unchecked imports of sub-standard commodities in the country,
forcing many local industries to close since they cannot compete,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many Kenyans have been forced into unemployment
following the closure of the firms, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also commended the new measures that have been put in place
to check the illegal diversion of foodstuffs destined for other
parts of the world into the eastern African country.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reinforces Forces in Hebron to Prevent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- More Israeli troops have been
deployed in the flashpoint city of Hebron in brace for possible
escalation of Palestinian rioting, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reinforcements were sent to Hebron following Monday's
violent clashes in which two Israeli soldiers were wounded by
pipe bombs thrown by Palestinian rioters.
</P>
<P>
One of the wounded soldiers remained in serious condition in
Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital, while the other suffered only
light injuries. About 20 Palestinian protesters were wounded,
one of them seriously, by rubber bullets fired by Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The commander of Israeli forces in Hebron, Colonel Gadi,
reviewed the security situation overnight to prepare for the
escalation of violence. He accused the Palestinian police of not
attempting to stop the rioting, adding that his forces would
react with an "iron fist" to new violence.
</P>
<P>
Army Radio reported that Hebron troops had been ordered to
use more force to quell riots, though the Army's Central Command
denied any new orders had been given.
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of violence was triggered by a provocative
leaflet which depicted the Islamic prophet Mohammed as a pig
writing the holy Koran. The leaflets were pasted on Palestinian
storefronts in Hebron over the weekend by a Jewish woman from
Jerusalem, who is now under police custody.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and President
Ezer Weizman have apologized for the provocative leaflet, which
has also sparked anger among Israeli Arab community.
</P>
<P>
Arab lawmakers and community leaders are to hold a meeting
Thursday to discuss their response to the leaflet. An Arab
committee has called on the government to remove all Jewish
settlers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, especially those in
the center of Hebron.

TEHRAN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The collapse of the Taghiabad
bridge on the Qarchak Varamin route, southern Tehran, left four
dead and five injured Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that as a result of
this incident several spans of the bridge collapsed. A pick-up
truck and an automobile traveling on the route were buried in the
rubble.
</P>
<P>
However, the reasons for the collapse of the bridge has not yet
been determined, according to an official of the fire brigade of
the city.
</P>
<P>
Three relief and rescue teams from the fire brigade rushed
to the scene of the accident as soon as it happened and
operations to clear the rubble continued until after midnight.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the bridge had been constructed by
a contractor and a consultant engineer in the private sector and
the responsibility for its collapse lies primarily with them.
</P>
<P>
He said the collapse could be attributed to the excavation work
and laying the foundation of the linking roads.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has lodged a court complaint against the
consultant engineer and the contractor, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Negative View of CIS Immigrants in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A significant number of Israelis
have largely negative views of immigrants from the Commonwealth
Independent States (CIS), according to a latest poll conducted by
the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that a third of Israelis were "frightened" by
the immigrants, and that more than 40 percent think that they get
too much help from the government, while 63 percent are against
encouragement of mass immigration from the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Some 700,000 Jews have immigrated to Israel from the former
Soviet republics since the beginning of this decade.
</P>
<P>
The immigrants, most of whom are intellectuals, including
high-tech personnel, engineers, doctors, have made considerable
contributions to the socio-economic development of the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
But the native Israelis claim that the immigrant inflow
has caused high rate of unemployment and crimes.
</P>
<P>
The poll touched off an uproar in the Knesset (Israeli
parliament) Immigration and Absorption Committee (IAC) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Natan Sharansky, chairman of the CIS immigrants party
Yisrael B'aliyah, expressed bitterness at the findings, calling
it "the saddest thing that's happened to me in the 10 years
I've been in Israel."
</P>
<P>
Sharansky, who is also minister of industry and trade, said
that, of all the "unpleasant thing" going on in the country
today, "the saddest and most painful is to see the poll results
which clearly show Israelis reject immigrants."
</P>
<P>
Sharansky noted that he was "shocked" by the poll's findings,
and stressed the important contributions made by the immigrants
to the Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
He complained that immigrants were now being seen as a
"foreign, dangerous, competitive, and threatening minority." He
added that the stigmas concerning immigrants from the CIS today
were more serious (now) than in the past, with the talk of a
"strategic threat," a Russian mafia, and even of a possible
takeover of the country.
</P>
<P>
He charged that the Israeli society now not only ties crime
and prostitution to new immigrants, but also attaches such
stigma to leaders of the Jewish community from the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Naomi Blumenthal, chairwoman of the IAC said that the episode
of Zvi Ben-Ari, who is under investigation allegedly for mafia
crimes, has worsened the standing of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"Every other Russian immigrant is suspected of being a
mafioso. As a result, businessmen from the CIS will think twice
about investing here," she said.
</P>
<P>
Blumenthal added that the survey results showed the failure
of efforts to educate the public about the subject.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli public has not yet internalized the fact that the
state has no raison d'etre without immigration," she warned.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Abolishes Fixing of Mid-rate for Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Thailand has,
as of today, abolished the practice of fixing daily the official
exchange rate for the Thai currency baht, according to the Thai
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand said in a statement released today the
baht would now be allowed to trade under managed float and that
the mid-rate would no longer be fixed on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
On the last trading day, June 30, the mid-rate to the US dollar
was fixed at 25.79 baht, four satang up from the previous fixing
last Friday. The actual trading is normally at around 26 baht to
the dollar, as against about 25 baht a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the move is aimed at stabilizing the
baht, preventing heavy speculation and easing fears of a
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the central bank admitted that the move would
drive the value of the baht down in the next few days, but the
currency will pick up and stabilize in the long run.
</P>
<P>
The bank will publish from time to time the exchange rates
between the baht and foreign currencies for use as a reference
rate in the conversion of foreign currencies into baht.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that allowing the baht to float will lead to
the depreciation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the central bank has resisted pressure to devalue
the baht and economists are divided over if a baht devaluation
would benefit the economy.

<P>
SHENYANG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The choosing of civil servants by
an examination system is an important reform in the means of
selecting or promoting government officials and is being more
widely used in China, according to Liu Jialin, the director of the
Ministry of Labor's Enrollment Through Examination Department.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remark at a recent conference in Dalian, the port
city in northeast China's Liaoning provinc. He explained
that China adopted the policy three year ago and most of the
country's provinces, autonomous regions and major cities have
opened their doors wider to people who want to compete for a
position in the country's mammoth government operation.
</P>
<P>
With the growth in the use of the policy, the instances of
corruption that used to occurre during the selection process has
declined, giving the general public a greater sense of
satisfaction, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that next year implementation of the policy will extend
to town or township governments, institutions, and the financial
sector. He emphasized that the quality of new finance officials is
crucial to the healthy development of the country's market

<HEADLINE> Boeing, Airbus Compete in Sale of Aircraft to India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-based Boeing company and
the Europe-based Airbus company have entered a fierce competition
in selling their aircraft to India.
</P>
<P>
Air India's bid to buy three 200-seater aircraft has acquired a
new dimension with Boeing offering B767-200 as a better
alternative to A310 of Airbus which was under active
consideration, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned airlines of Air India has already had eight
A310s of Airbus, manufactured by the European Consortium.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing company has made a strong pitch for the order by
stating that B767-200 has a longer range than A310 while the price
is cheaper and the maintenance cost comparable.
</P>
<P>
Air India has planned to buy three more A310s to its fleet of
eight in view of the savings in cost on account of training and
spares. By using the same type of aircraft, the company would cut
on time and cost involved in training pilots and engineers.
</P>
<P>
The argument was valid since the number of planes being
purchased now is low, the official quoted Airbus representative as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The value of the deal is estimated to be around 250 million
U.S. dollars for the three planes. However, for obvious reasons
neither Airbus nor Boeing is willing to disclose the best price
they can offer. Tougher competition would result in a better offer
for Air India, yet it may take a long time, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in India Positive: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in India is
positive for the first time since December 1995, according to the
May-June 1997 survey by the National Council of Applied Economic
Research (NCAER) of 526 units in the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey was specially undertaken for "Business World", the
fortnightly business magazine, which will publish the findings in
its forthcoming issue, it is learnt here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 526 units was based on investment climate,
financial position, capacity utilization and overall economic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The improvement is seen across sectors, regions, scale of firms
and type of ownership.
</P>
<P>
However, there are variations in the degree of improvement,
suggesting that the perceived improvement would need to be
sustained to be translated into actual improvement in business
decisions, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicates that slack demand conditions in the
domestic market may induce firms to seek export markets more
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
Generally, exports in 1997-98 are expected to perform better
than in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Newspapers Hail HK's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Newspapers here have hailed the
return of Hong Kong to China, saying July 1, 1997, is of great
significance in world history.
</P>
<P>
Several newspapers here in Sinhalese or English issued
editorials or articles on the ceremony marking the handover of
Hong Kong to China which took place at midnight in Hong Kong on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial, Sri Lanka's leading national newspaper the
Daily News today said, "All Sri Lankans irrespective of their
clan, creed or politics will welcome this historic transfer of
Hong Kong to its motherland and wish the people of Hong Kong and
China success in their united march toward a still better future."
</P>
<P>
"Residents of Hong Kong have welcomed the transfer and the
business community has shown no anxiety," it said. "Actually,
prospects for Hong Kong look brighter."
</P>
<P>
"Citizens of Hong Kong together with their compatriots in the
mainland can now look toward a brighter future as China is set on
a path that would make it the world's strongest nation in the next
 millennium," the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
The leading Sinhalese-language national newspaper the Dinamina

China is a significant event in world history.

<P>
It adds that all Sri Lankans heartily welcome the return of
Hong Kong to its motherland China as the return would undoubtedly

</P>
<P>
in an article published in Tuesday's Daily News, Chairman of
the Sri Lanka Association for International Understanding S. D.
Bandaranaike said, "Today, China is much stronger, but is still a
developing country. Hong Kong returned to China on July 1. Macao
will follow suit in 1999 and the Taiwan question will surely be
solved and China's reunification will be realized."
</P>
<P>
"By that time a unified stronger China will make an even
greater contribution to mankind," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Another signed article in the same newspaper on Tuesday said

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economic Slowdown Bottoms Out: MAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The current slowdown in
Singapore's economic growth has bottomed out and the country's
gross domestic product (GDP) should grow between five and seven
percent this year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said
in a report.
</P>
<P>
The MAS said in its just released 1996/97 annual report that
economic growth in the third quarter of last year was the lowest
point in a boom-and-bust economic cycle -- a 10-year low of 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that viewed in the context of past business
cycles, the current slowdown in economic growth appears to be of
moderate severity. The slowdown of 1996 was "slightly deeper" than
a similar one in 1992, but "far less severe" than the slump in the
mid-1980s, it added.
</P>
<P>
As for the prospects for this year's growth, the MAS said the
favorable outlook for the world's major economies and global
electronics demand suggests a recovery in economic growth in the
second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
One of the positive sign for the Singapore economy was the
increasing shipments and new orders for electronics goods in the
United States, it said. The United States is a key driver of the
Singapore economy, soaking up about a quarter of the Republic's
domestic exports.
</P>
<P>
However, the MAS acknowledged that the electronics industry
remained vulnerable to the downside risk of a persistent glut in
production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Among the other economic sectors, construction growth should be
boosted by a strong pipeline of projects, said the MAS, noting
that last year, the value of contracts awarded amounted to around
13 billion US dollars, compared to the 11-billion-US-dollar level
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Singapore's financial services sector is also
likely to see buoyant growth, mainly because of strong expansion
in foreign currency banking activity, it said.

<HEADLINE> India to React to U.S. Decision on Export Curbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- India is expected to have its
formal response to the U.S. decision to impose export curbs on its
three scientific establishments -- the Bhaba Atomic Research
Center, the Indira Gandhi Center for Atomic Research and Indian
Rare Earths Limited.
</P>
<P>
India's formal response to the U.S. decision is to be made
after the return here of Minister of State for External Affairs
Salim Shervani today from the United States, Foreign Office
sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The United States charged in the decision that the three
establishments have been involved in developing weapons of mass
destruction or the missiles used to deliver these weapons. A
spokesperson of the U.S. Embassy here said that henceforward any
export to these three establishments would require a "special
license."
</P>
<P>
Prior to Shervani's visit, Washington had already imposed
similar export restrictions on India's Bharat Electronics Limited
(BEL).
</P>
<P>
America's decision on export curbs is considered here as
double-standard, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They accused Washington of failing to show the similar
consistency with the countries which receive more sensitive items
toward the production of dual-use technology.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the decision is a unilateral violation of the 1984
Indo-U.S. memorandum of understanding on science and technology,
which obliges both governments to consult and inform each other
about proliferation-related activities that companies in either
country might take, they noted.

WARSAW, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Newspapers in Poland gave wide
coverage of Hong Kong's return to China and expressed optimism
about its future.
</P>
<P>
The Gazeta Wyborcza daily today carried an article by a Polish

era of colonial rule over East Asia, and of humiliation and
suffering of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
The article said that "Hong Kong's return is a happy and
satisfactory" event, for it meant that China would further
accelerate the pace of modernization and reform.
</P>
<P>
The Forum weekly on Sunday hailed China's resumption of the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as ending China's
humiliation at the hands of the British and an opportunity for
further development of the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
"I think Hong Kong's future will be even brighter (after its
return)," former prime minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski said in an
article published in the latest issue of the monthly magazine
"Dzisiaj."
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's stability is not only in the interests of
China, but also in the interests of the world economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Permanent Representative
to the United Nations, Qin Huasun, held a grand reception this
evening to celebrate the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the reception, Qin said July 1, 1997 was a day of
great historical significance and a day forever memorable for the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
On this day, he said, the national flag of the People's
Republic of China and the flag of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region were solemnly raised, marking the resumption
of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong by the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Hong Kong, the humiliation which the Chinese
nation had been subjected to since the Opium War in the 1840s was
wiped out and the long cherished wish of the Chinese nation was
fulfilled, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people, home or abroad, all feel proud of and were
elated at this great event of the century.
</P>
<P>
Qin said after the return of Hong Kong, the Chinese government
will unwaveringly implement the basic principles of "one country,
two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "a high
degree of autonomy" to ensure the long-term stability and
prosperity in Hong kong.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the return of Hong kong was not only an
epoch-making event in China's modern history, but also an
important step toward the thorough eradication of colonial rule in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful settlement of the Hong Kong question on the basis
of the "one country, two systems" concept provides the
international community with a model of thinking for the
resolution of disputes left over from history, Qin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Futian Wholesale Market in
Shenzhen City in south China's Guangdong Province has become a new
method to sell farm produce.
</P>
<P>
The market held its first auction on June 28 just after opening
for business in a move that is seen as an important way to move
farm products. Officials from the ministries of agriculture and
internal trade, along with local traders and businessmen from Hong
Kong even attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale market has a floor space of 90,000 sq.m. It was
built at a cost of 300 million yuan and is believed to be the
largest multi-purpose wholesale market in China.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that auctions are a good way to do business
and that commodities here will be packed and weighed according to
international standards. And there will be strict quality control
measures as well to bring the market in line with international
practices.
</P>
<P>
The market is operated by the Shenzhen Farm Produce Co. Ltd
which also runs the city's Buji Farm Produce Wholesale
Market. Most of the vegetables consumed by Shenzhen's three
million people, as well as nine percent of the fruit, and 40
percent of cereals and edible oils are handled by the Buji
Wholesale Market. It sold 1.3 million tons of goods in 1996 and
had 6.88 billion yuan in sales.

HONG KONG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A giant sculpture called
"Ever-Blooming Bauhinia" presented by the Central Government as a
gift to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), has
drawn a lot of spectators.
</P>
<P>
Although the area leading to the site of the sculpture located

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Amends Laws for More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday amended
three laws designed to give foreigners the right to acquire
property in the country.
</P>
<P>
The amendments were aimed at encouraging foreign investment in
the ailing real estate sector as well as boosting the overall
economy, according to the Bangkok Post today, quoting government
spokesman Varathem Rattanakorn.
</P>
<P>
The three amendments, subject to parliament approval, will
allow those foreigners who marry Thai people to buy one rai of
land (6.25 rai to the hectare), same as overseas investors who
bring more than 25 million baht capital (960,000 U.S. dollars) to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Currently Thai women who marry foreigners lose their property
rights.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendments, however, investors who do not use the
land within two years will forfeit their holdings and it would be
sold by the director-general of the Land Department.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners would also be allowed to buy up to 100 percent of
condominium units in each project in Bangkok with the condition
that the common area of the condominium project which houses
central facilities does not exceed five rai.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners would also be allowed to rent land on a 99-year
lease replacing the existing 30-year contract, according to the
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Records First Trade Surplus in 30 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea turned in a trade surplus
of 98 million U.S. dollars last month for the first time in the
last 30 months, keeping the trade deficit for the first half of
this year at under 10 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the monthly report of the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, exports last month increased by
9.2 percent to 12.346 billion dollars while imports were contained
at 12.249 billion dollars, up just 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the trade surplus on a customs clearance basis
took the total accumulated trade deficit this year to 9.359
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The turnaround in trade from a perennial deficit is the result
of improving performance by leading sectors such as
semiconductors, petrochemicals and iron and steel, ministry
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The effect of the appreciation of the Japanese yen is expected
to begin surfacing in the third quarter of this year, thus making
South Korea's export prospects even brighter, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The international competitiveness of South Korean products has
suffered in the global market with the yen depreciating from 109
Yen to a dollar to 123 in April. More recently in May, the
exchange rate has been around 119 yen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends Plans for New Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States today defended
plans by its Energy Department to begin controversial new
underground nuclear weapons-related tests Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman John Dinger told a news briefing
that the experiments would not violate a global test ban.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that subcritical experiments are...
consistent with the provisions of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would hope that other countries would comply with the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, just as we are," Dinger said.
</P>
<P>
However, 44 congressmen last week urged the Clinton
administration not to go ahead with the experiments, saying that
they violate the spirit of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the U.S. is setting a precedent for other
countries to conduct similar experiments.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department plans two experiments this year and four
more next year. The first, code-named "Rebound," will take place
in Nevada.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Newspaper Hails HK Return as Historic Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 2 (Xinhua) -- China's resumption of the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong from July 1 is a historic
handover, and there is every reason to expect Hong Kong to forge
ahead in the days to come, the Rising Nepal newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali national newspaper said in an editorial that the
Basic Law guarantees the Hong Kong people a high degree of
autonomy and they are now the masters of their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that considering the Hong Kong people's
vitality, dynamism, business acumen and entrepreneurship -- which
helped transform Hong Kong to one of the world's financial centers
-- there is every reason to expect Hong Kong, as a Special
Administrative Region of China, to forge ahead in the days to
come.
</P>
<P>
The editorial noted that the handover sounded the death knell
of the last remnants of foreign rule in China, or almost, since
China still has two years left to exercise its sovereignty over
Macao.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Might Fight Tyson Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield said Tuesday
that a third fight with Mike Tyson, who had bitten him on both
ears, was possible once Tyson has proved he has mended his biting
way.
</P>
<P>
"I would never say I would never fight him," Holyfield said in
Atalanta of a third fight with Tyson, who chomping their World
Boxing Association championship rematch to a bizarre end in Las
Vegas last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, he hasn't proven he can control his attitude,"
Holyfield told CNN. "Time will tell. If time permits, and two
years down the road Mike has proven he can control himself, and
he's fighting... I would never say never."
</P>
<P>
Tyson's career was on hold on Tuesday after the Nevada State
Athletic Commission temporarily suspended him and frozen his 30
million-dollar purse pending further disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who also charged across the ring at Holyfield after he
was disqualified, made an abject apology on Monday. He said he
wouldn't appeal any punishment, but pleaded for a chance to redeem
himself.
</P>
<P>
The commission was expected to impose a fine of up to 3 million
dollars and ban Tyson for some time.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, 34, said he hoped to fight again in November, but
did not mention an opponent.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield said he was heartened by Tyson's apology, which some
cynics saw as a mere bid to lessen his punishment.
</P>
<P>
"He made a big step," Holyfield said. "Any time someone can
admit they were wrong there's a chance they can change."

garrison of People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>

Since being delivered to the Hong Kong PLA troops, a total of
12 helicopters produced by HAC have been thoroughly tested,
registering 21,000 take-offs and landings and clocking up 5,000
hours of safe flying, said Guo Jingshan, chief designer of
HAC. Six of the helicopters entered Hong Kong as part of the PLA's

HAC undertook the task of supplying the garrison with
helicopters for eventual service in Hong Kong back in 1992 when
the central government announced that the detachment's equipment
should be both state of the art and domestically made.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper said today that Hong Kong's return to China marked
the end of the era of colonialism and gave sustenance to his
country's anti-drug trafficking war.
</P>
<P>
The Opium War in China 150 years ago reminded him of the war
against drug-trafficking that his country is facing today, Samper
told the press on his return from the Hong Kong handover
ceremony. He attended the ceremony as president of the
non-aligned movement.
</P>
<P>
Samper said that the drug problem in China at that time was
caused by forced drug consumption and was solved only when China
refused to accept opium deliveries and restricted drug consumption.
</P>
<P>
In a similar way, the drug trafficking problem in the world
today can be solved only when industrialized countries impose
restrictions on drug consumption in their countries, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China will
provide a good opportunity for mutual growth of tourism
industries, today's China Daily quoted a senior tourism official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to welcome the first group of Hong Kong
tourists in Beijing after the territory's return, Cheng Wendong,
vice-director of China National Tourism Administration, said the
handover will enhance "Visit China '97" -- the country's current
campaign to attract overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
"We will work together with our counterparts in Hong Kong to
promote the development of our country's tourism industry," the
national English newspaper quoted Cheng as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Hong Kong tourists, taking an Air China flight,
arrived yesterday in Beijing, where almost every street and major
building were decorated with banners and posters celebrating Hong
Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
The tourists planned to attend several celebrations in Beijing,
according to a tourism official.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, the local tourism department yesterday welcomed
the first Hong Hong tourist group to enter the province by sea
after the return.
</P>
<P>
Also yesterday morning, Hong Kong Dragon Airlines' first flight
to Beijing after the return of Hong Kong arrived in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Carrying about 200 passengers, the aircraft bore a "B", which
represents China's international aircraft, replacing Hong Kong's
"VR."
</P>
<P>
The passengers -- including airline representatives, Hong Kong
officials and tourists -- were warmly received by officials from
the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
According to Stanley HC Hui, CEO of Hong Kong Dragon Airlines
Ltd., all of the company's airplanes will carry the "B" within two
or three months.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nevada boxing authorities
Tuesday made their first decision to Mike Tyson that the infamous
fighter was temporarily suspended for biting Evander Holyfield
during their heavyweight title bout.
</P>
<P>
The suspension is a preliminary move until the commission meets
next week to determine its final action. Tyson was not present at
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The commission voted 5-0 to serve Tyson with a complaint
Tuesday and sign a waiver that would enable the disciplinary
hearing to begin on July 8.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Tyson's 30 million U.S. dollars purse was frozen. By
law, boxing commissioners can only fine Tyson up to 10 percent of
his purse, or three million.
</P>
<P>
Tyson apologized to everyone from the judge who sentenced him
for his rape conviction in Indianapolis to boxing fans all over
the world for behavior that even he himself couldn't explain.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, meanwhile, said Tyson's apology was "a good
gesture." However, the 34-year-old boxer expected that Nevada
officials should hand down a stern penalty.

<HEADLINE> Three German Players Storm into Wimbledon Quarterfinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany took three of the eight
final spots as Boris Becker, Michael Stich and their young
compatriot Nicolas Kiefer produced a spectacular stride into the
quarter-finals of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Kiefer, a former junior Wimbledon finalist,
created the most dramatic upset by snatching a stunning 6-2 7-5
2-6 6-1 win over world number three Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Making his Wimbledon depute, Kiefer beat Alexander Volkov and
the 13 seed Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine on his way to the fourth
round, but his latest performance was easily the best result of
his senior career and also ensured the most Germans in the last
eight at a grand slam in the Open era.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's clashes with third seed Kafelnikov, the German
young player jumped at his experienced opponent from the beginning
with powerful smashes and won the first two sets 6:2 7:5. But
Kafelnikov, also 1996 French Open Champion, made a successful
comeback by winning the third set 6:2.
</P>
<P>
After several rain-breaks, the refreshed German youngster staged
more fierce attacks and finally snatched the crutial fourth set
6:2.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Becker's straight sets victory over 9th seed Marcelo
Rios of Chile and and Stich's earlier four-set victory over
Australian doubles expert Mark Woodforde once again demonstrated
that the two former Wimbledon champions also have a good chance of
pocketing another Wimbledon trophy.
</P>
<P>
Todd Woodbridge, who ousted world number two Michael Chang in
the second round meanwhile, earned his first appearance in a grand
slam singles quarter-final by defeating compatriot Pat Rafter 6-7
6-4 7-6 6-3. Britain's Greg Rusedski and France's Cedric Pioline
also sailed into the quarterfinal clashes by beating their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
World number one Pete Sampras and defending champion Richard
Krajicek remained locked in a battle with 12th seed Patrick Rafer
of Chile and British number one Tim Henmen as their matches were
suspended because of dusk.
</P>
<P>
In the women's events, world number one Martina Hings, third
seed Jana Novota of Czech Republic, fourth seed Iva Majoli of
Croatia and Spanish tennis veteran Sanchez Vicario booked their
places in the women's singles quarterfinal battleground. Russian
promising young girl Anna Kournikova also cruised into the

WASHINGTON, July 1 (Xinhua) -- More than one-fourth of the food
produced in the U.S. is tossed out unused or goes uneaten on the
plate, U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a report today.
</P>
<P>
The USDA study estimated that food lost in retail stores,
restaurants and people's homes in 1995 amounted to more than 96
billion pounds -- one quarter of the total U.S. food supply of 356
billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
The vast bulk of the food is lost in people's homes, where food
spoils in the refrigerator or is tossed uneaten into the garbage
can, and in restaurants and other food service industries. Homes
and food service sites accounted for 91 billion pounds of lost
food.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 5.4 billion pounds was lost in retail groceries
through overstocking, discarding of perishable items such as fresh
produce and dairy products, and food removed for bypassing its
"sell-by" date.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the lost food was fresh fruit, vegetables, milk
and grain products such as bread and sweeteners, USDA found.
</P>
<P>
The USDA study examined only losses in homes, stores and food
service establishments, leaving out losses on the farm or at the
wholesale level.
</P>
<P>
The study said recovery of even 5 percent of the wasted food
would provide enough for 4 million people to eat for a year. And
in terms of trash, the study estimated that if 5 percent of the
annual losses were recovered, taxpayers would save 50 million
dollars in solid waste disposal costs.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of agriculture Dan Glickman, who planned to
discuss the study at a national food recovery conference in
California today, said its findings were important because the
only previous estimates of food loss were 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
He also has planed a national food recovery summit in
Washington in September to further highlight the problem and
possible solutions.

NEW YORK, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street were mixed
Tuesday, with blue-chip shares rising as new data reinforced hopes
the Federal Reserve won't see a need to raise interest rates this
week or in the near future.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 49.54 to 7,722.33, after
giving back a 75-point morning gain and rebounding in the late
session.
</P>
<P>
Reports released on the day suggested some moderation in
factory activity and construction spending, giving a boost to the
bond market first.

Now few observers expect this week's Fed meeting to produce any
change in the central bank's key lending rates.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume was heavy at 539.41 million
shares down slightly from Monday's busy pace.
