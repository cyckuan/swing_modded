<HEADLINE> US Employment Costs Gain at 4-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Employment costs in the U.S.
increased by 2.9 percent in the second quarter of this year, the
highest gains in more than four years, the U.S. Labor Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The gains of American's workers pay in the quarter was higher
than the 2.8 percent increase in the 12 months ended in March and
the highest since a similar 3.2 percent gain in March 1992.
</P>
<P>
The report said that wages and salaries rose 3.2 percent in the
year ended in June, up from 3.1 percent in the 12 months ended in
March.
</P>
<P>
Benefit costs were up 1.8 percent, the same as during the 12
months ended in March.
</P>
<P>
During the second quarter, total compensation rose 0.8 percent,
the same as during the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's Employment Cost Index released today is
one of the two government reports being watched closely this week
for signs of inflation. The employment report with its earnings
component is to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. economy was expanding rapidly during the April-June
quarter, many analysts expect the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise
short-term interest rates next month to insure slower growth and
keep price increases under control.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices in the U.S. had been rising at a 3.5 percent
annual rate during the first six months while they rose only 2.5
percent during whole year of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Employment Cost Index is regarded as the best measure of
labor costs, which represent two-thirds of the price of a product.
The index indicates whether payroll costs are rising so fast as to
force consumer price increases.
</P>
<P>
Although pay represents about three-fourths of total
compensation, many analysts contend the index provides a better
gauge of inflation pressures than the monthly average hourly
earnings report because it also includes benefit changes.

<HEADLINE> Fourth Doping Case Announced in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian swimmer Nina Juvaneskaia
failed her doping tests, said Michele Verdier, spokeswoman of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 200-meter backstroke swimmer "will be excluded from all the
Olympic-related events till the 2000 Sydney Games", Verdier said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a unanimous decision made by the IOC executive board
under the recommendation of the medical commission," the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Juvaneskaia, who failed to make the final in the Games, was
tested positive to Bromanta, a class A stimulant related with
Mesocarbe.
</P>
<P>
So far, Juvaneskaia became the fourth athlete caught red-handed
of taking drugs at the Games, and also the third from the Russian
Olympic delegation.
</P>
<P>
Early on Saturday, two Russian Olympians and one Lithuanian
cyclist were caught of taking the same banned drugs at the Games.

<HEADLINE> G-7, Russia Adopt 25 Measures Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Group of Seven (G-7) most
industrialized states and Russia today adopted a package of 25
measures to combat terrorism after a one-day conference on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The practical steps include restriction of terrorists' freedom
of movement, control of fund-raising for terrorist groups and
improvement of exchange of information.
</P>
<P>
But a declaration issued after the meeting did not mention of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's call for economic sanctions against
Iran, Iraq, Libya and Sudan for their alleged support for
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The foreign and interior ministers of the eight countries said
in a declaration forerunning the text that they "invite all states
to adopt these measures so as to impart greater efficiency and
coherence to the fight against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The ministers call on all states to expand training of
anti-terrorism personnel, make sure of security of all means of
transportation, including mass transportation like train, bus and
subway trains and cargos transportation, and accelerate research
on methods to detect explosives.
</P>
<P>
All the countries in the world could adopt standard bomb
detection systems in their airports and passenger planes in
consultation with the International Civil Aviation Organization,
and to increase international cooperation in checking terrorism
through signing bilateral or multilateral treaties, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The eight countries urged all countries in the world to act
against any organization that supports terrorism, prevent
terrorists from using "electronic or wire communications systems
and networks to carry out criminal acts," and tighten control on
firearms.
</P>
<P>
They called on all states to "refrain from providing any form
of support, whether active or passive, to organizations or persons
involved in terrorist activities."
</P>
<P>
The ministers urged all countries "to take strong measures to
prevent the movement of terrorist individuals or groups by
strengthening border controls and controls on issuance of identity
papers and travel documents."
</P>
<P>
They also warned all countries against letting terrorists take
advantage of the right of asylum "for terrorist purposes."
</P>
<P>
They appealed for the exchange of information on "actions and
movements of persons or groups suspected of belonging to terrorist
networks."
</P>
<P>
Such information also includes the use of communications
technologies by terrorists and "the threat of new types of
terrorist activities including those using chemical, biological,
nuclear material and toxic substances," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve De Charette announced at a press
conference today that a team of experts will be formed by the end
of the year to draft a new convention against terrorist bombings
and threats to public transportation.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Take on Second Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Working one job just doesn't seem
to be enough for a growing number of American workers.
</P>
<P>
The Investor's Business Daily reported today that nearly 7.7
million people are holding down two or more jobs. Last year, about
6.2 percent of the U.S. work force was moonlighting, and that
proportion seems to be holding up in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, by comparison, there were about 4 million Americans
working more than one job -- 5.2 percent of the employed at that
time, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper also noted that the Republican Party has seized upon
their growing numbers as a signal that something is amiss under
President Clinton's watch.
</P>
<P>
Since January 1994, a year after Clinton took office, the
number of multiple-job holders has risen by more than 1 million,
the GOP-led Joint Economic Committee said in a recent report
questioning the health of the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, some research shows that more moonlighting does not
necessarily mean that those Americans cannot make their ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Much of the increased moonlighting is among women, and their
motivation does not appear to be completely economic, according to
the paper. Some said they simply enjoyed their second job and
others said they wanted to get extra work experience.
</P>
<P>
But still more than half of multiple-job holders still work for
economic reasons, although the work force has been joined by more
college-educated professionals.

PYONGYANG -- The visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto to Yasukuni Shrine on Monday is an intolerable insult to
the peoples of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
and other Asian countries, said the Korea Central News Agency
(KCNA) in an commentary today.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's claim that he went to the place which enshrines
many World War II criminals in his private capacity cannot
disguise the insidious attempt of the Japanese reactionaries to
revive militarism and to realize the ambition of re-invasion, the
commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, the first serving prime minister to pay homage to
the controversial shrine since 1985, had paid regular visits to
the Tokyo-based Shinto religious place before, the latest being on
August 15 last year in the capacity of international trade and
industry minister.

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes Retaliatory Measures Against Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today proposed an EU-wide regulation to retaliate against the
so-called Helms-Burton law of the United States.
</P>
<P>
An EC spokesman said the proposed regulation would prevent
European companies from cooperating with any lawsuits brought
under the Helms-Burton law and other similar laws.
</P>
<P>
He said the regulation must be approved unanimously by European
Union (EU) foreign ministers before becoming law.
</P>
<P>
In a separate decision, the EC -- the executive arm of the EU
-- has begun gathering information required to create a "watch
list" of U.S. citizens and companies that file lawsuits against
European firms.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the EC proposals, EC Vice-President Sir Leon
Brittan said that the Helms-Burtion law "offends and attacks
America's trusted allies, damages business confidence in the
U.S. and beyond and establishes a dangerous precedent that the
United States itself will come to regret if other countries follow
it in the future."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton
Act in March but decided, under strong pressure worldwide, to
suspend for six months Title III of it, under which lawsuits could
be filed in the United States against foreign companies that
invest in U.S. properties confiscated by the Cuban government
after the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Congress last week also passed a so-called D'Amato Bill to
punish foreign companies that do business with Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
EU foreign ministers agreed on July 15 to a list of options for
retaliation against the U.S. legislation, including bringing the
dispute to the World Trade Organization, visa requirement for
U.S. businessmen to enter EU countries, a watch list of
U.S. companies filing lawsuits against European firms, and an EU
retaliation legislation.

<HEADLINE> EC: 14 Countries Have Applied for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 14 countries have to
date addressed application for membership to the Council of the
European Union (EU), including all 10 EU associated countries of
central and eastern Europe, according to the European Commission
(EC).
</P>
<P>
The 14 applicant countries are: Turkey, Cyprus, Malta,
Switzerland, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia,
Lithuania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The EC said today it was preparing its opinions on the
applications from the countries of central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Turkey's application, the EC's opinion was given
on 20 December 1989; opinions on Cyprus and Malta were given on 30
June 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid European Council held in Spain last December asked
the EC's opinions to be published "as soon as possible" after the
conclusion of the inter-governmental conference, which is aimed to
update and amend the Maastricht Treaty on political and economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
The opinions will provide both an analysis of the applicant's
current situation and an assessment of the progress they can be
expected to make before accession, taking account of the evolution
of the EU's acquisitions and the changing situation in the
applicant countries.
</P>
<P>
The EC said that the opinions would likely be published in the
second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the possible duration of negotiations and
time needed for ratification, the earliest realistic possibility
for the next enlargement would be in the years immediately
following 2000, it said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Reduce Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank official said on
Tuesday the Zimbabwean government should reduce the budget
deficit to five percent of Gross Domestic Product to realise
rapid economic growth, reduce rising unemployment and attract
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
An ban economic consultant, Tony Addison said Zimbabwe, with a
souring budget deficit of 10.1 percent of GDP, will not be able
to boost both local and foreign investment and achieve
significant economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe was in the same situation as was Malaysia 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said political commitment was needed to reduce government
expenditure, which would in turn result in the reduction of
inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The government has had to borrow from the domestic market to
finance the deficit and this has led to a high inflation rate of
about 24 percent and an interest rate of about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Addison said, ''Zimbabwe is at a critical junction. It has to
reduce its budget deficit now. It failed to reduce the budget
deficit to the targeted level of five percent and this is the
reason why the interest rate is still as high as 30 percent.''
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank had to withdraw
162.5 million US Dollars in September last year because Zimbabwe
had failed to reduce the deficit to five percent of GDP in the
1994-95 fiscal year.enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Businessmen Warn Against Gov't EMU Decision Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) has warned the government that its determination to
delay a decision on the country's membership of a European
Monetary Union (EMU) may be damaging British interests.
</P>
<P>
In a private evidence to the Treasury select committee, the CBI
said that although it has previously supported the government's
"opt-out" policy on the EMU, it has now believed companies could
benefit from greater certainty.
</P>
<P>
"At Maastricht, the CBI welcomed the UK's opt-out, but now the
value of increased certainty about the scenario may outweigh the
opt-out's benefits in terms of policy flexibility," the Financial
Times newspaper quoted the evidence as saying.
</P>
<P>
The CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce are preparing to
set up the first joint working group to assess the impact on
business of the UK joining or staying outside the EMU.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that the move reflects fears that
competitors in France and Germany are stealing a march on Britain
in their preparations for the EMU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Treasury select committee said in a report that
more MPs were increasingly confident that the "EMU would go ahead
within the next few years at least with an inner core of members."
</P>
<P>
The committee argued that more information should be given
about how the decision on the EMU would actually be taken, saying
"clear guidance on how the decision will be taken would remove one
element of uncertainty for all involved."
</P>
<P>
It also warned the government that without this decision,
British business could be at a disadvantage because the transition
period was likely to pose considerable problems for them.

<HEADLINE> Protesting African Refugees Hold Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- About 300 refugees from 12
African countries protesting outside the Pretoria office of the
United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) since Monday
marched to the union buildings this afternoon after police
threatened to arrest them.
</P>
<P>
The refugees spent the night on the pavement in front of the
UNHCR offices in central Pretoria, protesting against their
deportation without having found countries in which to resettle.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, spokesman for the refugee group Denis
Kimwana Nakeya from Zaire told reporters that the demonstration
would continue until the refugees' demands were met.
</P>
<P>
The refugees demanded that the UNHCR and the South African
government delay their deportation while assisting them to resettle
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Nakeya said the refugees' plight had so far been ignored by
the South African government, the U.N. and other bodies.
</P>
<P>
However, police spokesman Dave Harrington said the protesters
were contravening a law which prohibited a gathering of 12 or
more people without permission from the city council.
</P>
<P>
Police received complaints from the public that the refugees
were blocking the road and pavement outside the UNHCR office and
that they posed a health risk. no ablution facilities exist in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were given five minutes to disperse or face
arrest. Police told them that being arrested could mean
deportation to their countries of origin.
</P>
<P>
Nakeya said they would present a memorandum listing their
grievances to a government official at the union buildings.
</P>
<P>
The memoranda asking for assistance would also be presented to
nine other countries, including the United States, Canada,
Australia, Switzerland, Belgium and Norway.
</P>
<P>
Among the protesters included refugees from Angola, Ethiopia,
Burundi, Ghana, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon and Liberia.

<HEADLINE> Britain Seeks Curbs on EU Foreign Policy Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
reaffirmed its long-standing stance that the European Union's (EU)
common foreign and security policy can be made more efficient
without introducing majority voting.
</P>
<P>
In a six-page submission to the Inter-governmental Conference
on EU reform, the British Foreign Office insisted that the veto
power for each member state should not be abolished in a bid to
enhance the formulation of a common foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
While endorsing the idea of appointing an external
representative of the EU, the Foreign Office also proposed strict
terms of reference for such a representative.
</P>
<P>
The document made it clear that such an official would be kept
on a fairly tight rein by the 15 EU member states and he would
also be answerable to member states through the foreign minister
of the EU presidency state.
</P>
<P>
The official would be responsible for the "external
representation of agreed policies" and "conducting political
dialogue with third countries," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The representative would have the right to speak for the EU,
but not the right to vote or propose new policies at foreign
ministers meetings, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office paper also noted that five or six diplomats
should be seconded from the member states to the secretariat of
the European Council to help with planning and analysis.
</P>
<P>
The group would help prepare the agenda for foreign ministers'
meetings, set out policy options and recommendations, and give
early warning of impending crises.
</P>
<P>
However, the Foreign Office said in the document that member
states would have "no formal obligation" to pass on sensitive
information to the council secretariat.

JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Officers of the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) said today that they were shocked by the disclosure
of Israel Air Force (IAF) secrets in the latest issue of Jane's
Defense Weekly, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious British weekly showed a full map of Israeli
Air Force deployment throughout the country. It not only
revealed the bases, but also the names of squadrons, types
and quantity of the aircraft stationed at each base.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly, the Israeli Air Force has a
total number of 699 planes and helicopters. It also has a
secret base in Beit Shemesh, which houses Israel's
surface-to-surface long-range Jericho missiles.
</P>
<P>
IDF sources wondered how the authors managed to get their hands
on so sensitive details of the air force.
</P>
<P>
The IAF acknowledged that much of the information is accurate
and potentially damaging. At the same time they noted that some
of the details are out of date and the most tightly guarded
sensitive information still remains top secret.
</P>
<P>
Israel boasts of the most powerful air force in the Middle
East.

<HEADLINE> EU Increases Banana Tariff Quota for Non-EU States, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
decided today to increase by 353,000 tons the tariff quota for
bananas imported from non-EU countries and non-traditional ACP
(Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific) suppliers, bringing the
overall quota in 1996 to 2,553,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The EC said this decision was taken on the basis of the
assessment that for 1996 there will be an increase in European
Union (EU) demand due primarily to its latest enlargement.
</P>
<P>
But the EC added that the increase did not include the
additional 72,440 tons already decided to offset the impact of
tropical storms Iris, Luis and Marilyn earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC's forward estimate for bananas in 1996, EU
production will total 750,000 tons, while traditional imports from
ACP countries will reach 680,000 tons. Net consumption in the EU
will be 4,030,440 tons this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Women Workers Suffer Most in Employment in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Women workers all over the world
suffered more than men in the economic recession of recent years,
the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report published today by the Geneva-based
International Labor Organization, the newspaper said that women
worked longer hours for lower pay, earning between 50 and 80
percent of men's wages worldwide.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in two-thirds of industrialized countries,
the jobless rate for women has been from 50 to 100 percent higher
than for men.
</P>
<P>
Although women are playing an increasing role in the formal
economy, many jobs for them are part-time or in the unregulated
informal sector where opportunities for discrimination and
exploitation are rife, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said, "Increasing employment opportunities for women is not
sufficient. There must be action to improve the terms and
conditions of such employment."
</P>
<P>
The report recommended the enforcement of international labor
standards to ensure the principle of "comparable worth by
providing equal pay for work of equal value," greater security for
part-time workers, and "appropriate" labor market regulation to
protect women.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Concern over Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians today
expressed their concerns over a possible expansion of the
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, saying such a move
would sabotage the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meeting in the West Bank town of Bethlehem, members
of the Palestinian Council (PC) discussed the Israeli
government's intention to lift the settlement building freeze
imposed by the previous Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli bulldozers will not only bulldoze the Palestinian
lands in the West Bank, but will also bulldoze the peace process."
PC member Saleh Tamri said.
</P>
<P>
Several PC members urged President of the Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat, who attended the meeting, to break up
peace negotiations with Israel if the settlement activity is
renewed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian reactions came after a meeting Monday between
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the settlement
leaders, who emerged optimistic from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
While refusing to make any promises at the meeting, Netanyahu
reportedly gave the settlement leaders one concrete piece of
advice, saying "loud declaration can sometimes sabotage the
actual implementation of plans."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peace Now, a left-wing organization, today charged
that despite the lack of concrete promises, the government was
already working to increase the settlements.
</P>
<P>
The organization pointed out that the plans of building two
new roads in the West Bank announced by National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon Monday is the government first move to
expand the settlements.
</P>
<P>
However, Sharon dismissed the sharp criticisms and defended
the plans which call for the beginning of construction of
the trans-Samaria and the Atarot highways in the West Bank
before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said that the planned roads were important for the
Israeli security, and would reduce traffic conjunctions for
Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He also claimed that both roads were planned by the
previous government led by Labor Party chairman Shimon Peres.

<HEADLINE> UK to Privatize 2,500 Prison Service Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,500 jobs in Britain's
Prison Service will be taken over by the private sector under
proposals to privatize information technology in the jail system,
said a local press report today.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans, called Project Quantum, the service's finance,
personnel and inmate records system would be removed from the
public sector and handled by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to save 50 million pounds (78 million US
dollars) a year, to cut the Prison Service's 1.6 billion pounds
(2.5 billion dollars) annual budget by 30 percent and to "reduce
head-count."
</P>
<P>
About 100 firms have expressed an interest in the privatization
contract, worth about 150 million pounds (233 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Firms taking over the work are even to be offered office
accommodation in prisons and at Prison Service headquarters in
London.
</P>
<P>
The administration of the Prison Medical Service and of prison
shops may also be privatized. However, services to prisoners by
uniformed staff, medical facilities, education, domestic services
and prison farms and industries are specifically excluded.
</P>
<P>
The report said that if the project goes ahead, it will be the
largest transfer of Prison Service jobs to the private sector, and
it has angered staff who fear that security will be compromised.

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion Defeated in Olympic Badminton Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Susi Susanti of
Indonesia failed to retain her crown when she was beaten by old
rival Bang Soo Hyun of South Korea in straight sets in the
semifinals of the Olympic badminton tournament here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bang downed the Indonesian 11-9, 11-8 and gained the final
berths to play against Mia Audina of Indonesia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"At 7-5 in the second set, my racket string broke and since
then I made some errors," said the 24-year-old Indonesian. "The
draft was no excuse. Bang played better than I did today," added
Susanti, who defeated Bang in the final of the Barcelona Games for
the title four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Susi, is the greatest player in badminton history by taking all
the major competition titles and has been ranked the world number
one for nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
Susanti said possibly she would play badminton for another year
or two, after losing her semifinals today.
</P>
<P>
In the thrilling semifinal match that was keenly contested,
Bang, many times beaten by Susanti in major events, played a
consistent game and finally won the match, taking advantages of
Susanti's unforced mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"I studied all her technics, and I can cope with her play
today," said the joint third seed Bang who won the South Korean
Open and All-England Open this season.
</P>
<P>
Teenager Mia, a talented player for the future, found the going
tougher than she might have expected as she swept aside the
Europe's only women's player Camilla Martin of Denmark 11-6, 9-11,
11-1, winning the berth to meet Bang in the finals.

<HEADLINE> New ECOWAS Chairman Start Working for Peace in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Barely 72 hours after his election
as chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), Nigeria's Head of State Sani Abacha has embarked on
moves to restore peace to the war-torn Liberia, a source told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The source said, quoting reports from the presidency in Abuja,
capital of Nigeria,General Abacha today summoned leaders of the various
warring factions to a meeting in the city.
</P>
<P>
Although the agenda of the meeting was not immediately known,
it was surely connected with the search for a lasting solution to
the seven-year-old civil war at the next meeting of the ECOWAS
committee of nine on Liberia which will come up before August 18.
</P>
<P>
The source told Xinhua through telehpone that two of the
warlords, Charles Taylor of the National Patriotic Front of
Liberia (NPFL) and Alhaji G.V. Kromah of the United Liberation
Movement (ILIMO-K), were already in Abuja at the time of the
summon, while Roosevelt Johnson and George Boley, the other two
most important figures in the Liberian crisis, are now in exile
and are expected to send representatives.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha's initiative is coming on the heels of the
sharp discussions among heads of state and government at the
ECOWAS summit which just ended in Abuja at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, split was caused at the weekend summit
by the suggestion from some member states that the organisation imposes
sanctions against the warlords as a way of enforcing peace and
facilitate the conduct of hitch-free elections in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Gambian military Head of State yahya Jammed, who moved the
motion,also called for the establishment of an ECOWAS war crime
tribunal to try war mongers and perpetrators of the genocide
which has reduced the country to rubbles.
</P>
<P>
He chided his colleague heads of state who allow their
territories to be used as transit points for shipment of arms and
ammunitions in support of the devastating war in Liberia, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
Jammeh was in Abuja till Monday to put pressure on
General Abacha to do something urgent towards a last resolution
of the crisis, the source said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council decided today to authorize the deployment of 100 military
observers in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium in
Croatia for an additional period of six months ending January 15,
1997.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously today, the Security Council
noted that the military observers were a part of the United
Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja
and Western Sirmium (UNTAES).
</P>
<P>
The UNTAES was established by the Security Council on January
15, 1995 as a peacekeeping operation for an initial period of 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Following the Basic Agreement signed by the Croatian government
and the local Serb community on November 23 last year, Eastern
Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium would be integrated
peacefully into Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAES's objectives were to bring the region, demilitarized
and secure, under the sovereign control of the Croatian
government; to retain the multiethnic character of the region; to
promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents; to
enable all refugees and displaced persons to enjoy the right to
return freely to their homes; and to promote redevelopment and
reconstruction of the region.

SEOUL, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea granted 50,000 U.S.
dollars to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) last month to finance its
purchase of weather forecasting equipment, a government official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Seoul provided the money out of its inter-Korean cooperation
fund on June 18 at Pyongyang's request, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The WMO has also provided 10,000 U.S. dollars out of its
emergency fund to the DPRK's meteorological equipment purchase in
view of the severe flood damage it suffered last year. The
organization also asks other member countries to help the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Flood damage in the DPRK last year was attributed partly to
poor weather forecasting techniques, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Pyongyang have been exchanging meteorological
information through the WMO and international conferences for
several years.
</P>
<P>
South Korea became a WMO member in 1956 and the DPRK in 1975.

<HEADLINE> French Foreign Minister to Visit Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The French Foreign Ministry today
confirmed Algerian media reports that Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette will visit that country on Wednesday and Thursday at the
invitation of his Algerian counterpart Ahmed Attaf.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by a French foreign minister to Algeria in
three years, is hailed by Algerian media as the beginning of the
normalization of the relations between the two countries,
according to Agence France Presse reports from Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been tense since
Algeria's presidential election in November 1995. Algeria accused
France of interfering its internal affairs by urging the holding
of legislative elections immediately after the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
France, being Algeria's major aid supplier offering 5-6 billion
francs (1-1.2 billion U.S dollars) each year, is deeply worried
about the spreading of the Algerian Islamic extremism into its own
territory.
</P>
<P>
De Charette is expected to discuss with Algerian leaders the
question of air transportation between the two countries and the
service to be offered by the Algerian national carrier Air Algeria
to some airports in France, according to the AFP.

<HEADLINE> China Finishes 1-2 in Olympic Men's Springboard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Xiong Ni of China finally won his
first Olympic gold medal after being beaten by Amercian Greg
Louganis in the 1988 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Xiong, who finished second to Louganis in Seoul and third
behind teammate Sun Shuwei and American Scott Donie at Barcelona
in the men's platform, totalled 701.46 points to take the 3-meter
springboard title, which is also the first Olympic springboard
title for China.
</P>
<P>
His teammate Yu Zhuocheng had ensured the gold medal for China
earlier as he outdived defending champion Mark Lenzi of the United
States by 4.44 points.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Ni, the last diver on the springboard, made a brilliant
dive of inward three and a half somersaults in tuck position,
which gave him 87.72 points and the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the final round of the six-dive final, Lenzi
collected a high 92.40 points. But that was still not enough for
him to make up the deficit in the previous five rounds.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zhuocheng, who made his first appearance in Olympic Games,
finished second at 690.93 points, followed by Lenzi in the third
place with a total of 686.49 points.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very glad that I won the first springboard gold for my
country," said Xiong Ni, "there was a fierce competition between
my teammate and I, but the most important thing is that China
takes the gold."
</P>
<P>
Lenzi, who had a layoff after the 1992 Olympics, said that he
didn't perform well today. "It seemed that my ability of
resisting the pressure decreased."
</P>
<P>
"Xiong Ni is a very good diver and it is his third Olympics. He
is deserved for the gold."
</P>
<P>
It was the second diving gold China won at the Centennial
Olympics. Defending champion Fu Mingxia won the women's 10-meter
platform title on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Help Resolve Burundi Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been asked
to appoint a representative to work with other leaders in an
attempt to resolve the conflict in strife-torn Burundi, President
Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his official Pretoria residence,
Mandela said this request has been made by leaders in the
southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said a South African envoy will be working with
leaders such as former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, who is
attempting to bring about peace in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Burundi's Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya
was ousted and replaced in a coup by military-supported former
head of state Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
Civil fightings between Burundi's Hutus and Tutsis have
reportedly claimed the lives of an estimated 150,000 people in
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has condemned the military coup, saying it will
not recognize the new government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandela said he has already discussed the situation
in Burundi with Southern African Development Community (SADC)
Chairman, Botswana President Ketumile Masire, and other African
leaders.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that South Africa will not want to act outside
the SADC or the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
"We will prefer to act through these bodies. It is our firm
policy that we should not act as individuals. We should always
act in a coordinated manner," added the president.

BUCHAREST, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Defense Minister
Gheorghe Tinca and his British counterpart Michael Portillo signed
here today three memorandums of understanding on the promotion of
cooperation in arms production and on British troops training in
Romania.
</P>
<P>
Meeting Portillo today, Romanian President Ion Iliescu called
for the prevention of creating contradictions among those applying
for NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu added that it is wrong for NATO to accept the central
and eastern European countries in batches, stressing that NATO
should consider the demands of all applicant countries and guard
against discremination.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Romanian Defense Ministry today, Portillo
said NATO hopes that Russia understands that NATO is neither in a
hurry to admit new members, nor malicious towards Russia. NATO
will have talks with countries that are approaching the criteria
for membership by early next year, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Hosts the U.S. team led the field
of eight with a leading score of 99.200 points after the
synchronized swimming's team technical routine on the sport's
opening day at the 26th Summer Olympic Games here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are now poised for the first ever Olympic gold
medal in the team event which is to be decided after the free
routine is held on the final day Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ranked lower to the Americans after the opening session were
Canadians with 97.933 and Japanese on 97.667.
</P>
<P>
With its unique technical program featuring "The Peacocks"
which drew big applause from the crowds, China, fifth at the World
Cup this time last year here, finished sixth with 94.600 points.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese swimmers complained over sober sound for the music
played for their program today. The official tape was prepared by
the organizers with an original tape brought here by the competing
team.
</P>
<P>
"I almost heard nothing about it at the start," said Guo Cui,
the leading swimmer of China's eight-member squad.
</P>
<P>
"We found this during our pre-competition training and had
talked to the organizers a few times before. But the problem was
still here today. I don't know what had happened," said Chinese
coach Yan Liheng.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm happy with our swimmers' performance today and with
the applause from the crowd. Our swimmers did what they could,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Though recognized by FINA, the sport's world governing body, in
1952, synchronized swimming became an official Olympics Games
event only 32 years later, at the Los Angeles Games in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Solo and duet competitions were held at the Seoul and Barcelona
Games. But the team event is making its Olympic debut at the 1996
Games here as the only descipline of the sport on the program.
</P>
<P>
So far, only three countries have won Olympic medals in
synchronized swimmig: Canada, Japan and the United States.

ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Reigning world and World Cup table
tennis champion Kong Linghui made up his singles humiliation by
combining with Liu Guoliang to win the Olympic men's doubles title
in an all-Chinese final on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked player, who was upset by South Korean Kim
Taek-Soo in a singles match on Sunday, found his flair and form in
the 21-8, 13-21, 21-19, 21-11 victory over Wang Tao and Lu Lin,
reigning world champions and 1992 Olympic gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
Kong and Liu, who have been pairing up for less than one year,
overcame their veteran teammates with angled shots and
counter-attacks to win the first set.
</P>
<P>
Trailing at 5-11, Wang sprained his right ankle and needed five
minutes of outside medical attention.
</P>
<P>
Wang and Lu made it one-all after the younger Chinese duo made
quite a few offensive errors.
</P>
<P>
Kong and Liu, both at age of 20, never gave a chance to their
rivals, who failed to unleash their trademark top spin play and
fast counter-attacks.

CAIRO, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs

</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange Market
(KSEM) increased by 16.8 percent from December 1994 to the mid of
this month, a financial expert said today.
</P>
<P>
Board chairman and managing director of the Securities Group
Badr Fahd Al-Humaidhi said that during the period, the KSEM index
was up from 1365.7 points to 1595.8 points, an increase of 230.1
points or 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Trading during the first half of this year was also remarkable,
he said. The hike level is higher than the major world stock
exchange markets increase as compared with the Dow Jones
industrial average, which was 10.5 percent, the British Financial
Times index, 0.6 percent, the Japanese Nikkei index, 13.4 percent
and the Hongkong market, 9.41 percent, the board chairman said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's Permanent Committee of the Investment
Authority agreed on setting up new projects with total investments
of 163.2 million U.S. dollars and total capital of 63.5 million
dollars. The projects will provide 1925 work opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed on setting up a storage project at the
free zone in al-Amriya with a total capital of 250,000 dollars. It
is designed to story medical herbs and read-to-wear clothes and
shoes, according to the latest issue of the Middle East Economic
Weekly, which was published today.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Goweili

<HEADLINE> New Homes Sales in US Down Sharply in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes in the U.S.
dropped by 5.3 percent in June as mortgage rates hit a 14-month
high, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said sales of single-family homes totaled
734,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, down from a revised
775,000 a month earlier. It was also the lowest since 713,000 last
March.
</P>
<P>
The revised total sales of new homes in May, which were
initially estimated to be 828,000, were still the highest since a
784,000 rate last February.
</P>
<P>
The new home sales remained strong in the country so far this
year. Sales topped 700,000 for the sixth straight month, the first
time that has occurred since late 1986 and early 1987. And sales
during the first six months were 18.9 percent above those during
the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The department reported earlier that sales of previously owned
homes also fell in June, the first drop since last January
although the sales in the first six months were up 10 percent from
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales of new homes in June shot up 26.6 percent in
the Northeast and were up 1.4 percent in the West. But the gains
were offset by a 29.3 percent plunge in the Midwest, the steepest
since a 39 percent decline in January 1994, and a 4.8 percent drop
in the South.
</P>
<P>
The decline of sales in both new and existing homes is an
obvious indication that the housing market in the U.S. is cooling
down due to the rising of mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 30-year,
fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.32 percent in June, compared with
8.09 percent in May and 7.03 percent last January.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the nearly 1.5 percentage point increase since
January would add about 100 dollars to the monthly payment on a
100,000 dollar mortgage.
</P>
<P>
With sales remaining high, a downward trend would ripple
through the overall economy because of fewer purchases of related
goods such as construction materials, appliances and other home
furnishings.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Dong Soars in Olympic Badminton Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Joint third seed Dong Jiong of
China stunned the Malaysian veteran Rashid Sidek in straight sets
to enter the men's single finals in the Olympic badminton
tournament here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, who currently ranked first in the world, will meet
in the final arch-rival Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen of Denmark who
overwhelmed reigning world champion Heryanto Arbi of Indonesia
15-11 15-6.
</P>
<P>
"My strategy worked well and I tried to keep attacking and
breaking Rasid's defence," said the Chinese number one who won
last season's China and Thailand Opens and Chinese Taipei Open
this year. He said he was confident to win the title.
</P>
<P>
After leading 4-3, Rashid's high shots to the back of the court
were saved by Dong's accurate playcings and leaping smashes in the
first game. Dong took the set 15-6.
</P>
<P>
The second set went into a see-saw game when the Malaysian
stepped up his pace and played aggressively. But at 9-5 in favour
of Rasid, the Chinese started to go for his powerful smashes and
managed to catch up with his fatigued opponent 10-10 and continue
to a 17-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
After saving one match point and closed the score at 16-17,
28-year-old Rashid gave up the 52-minute match 16-18.
</P>
<P>
Arbi gave the noisy Indonesian supporters a relief after
leading 9-4 in the first with his formidable jump-smash and quick
attack.
</P>
<P>
But two-time All-England champion Larsen, who is in top form at
age of 30, slowly exerted his grip with superb wristy flicked
overhead drops and contrilled slices and sealed the game 15-11.
</P>
<P>
In the second, the Dane continued to put pressure on Arbi and
pulled his opponent around the court before ending the match with
a 15-11 and 15-6 victory.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women spikers routed
their German peers with three-straight sets to secure a semifinal
berth in the Olympic volleyball tournament here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have met our goal of entering the last four in the
tournament," said Chinese coach Lang Ping, former ace spiker who
orchestrated her teammates to win five world titles in a row from
1981 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
With the win of 15-12, 15-8 and 15-8, the Chinese nationals
will face the winners of Russia and the Netherlands in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
The Germans leapt ahead to lead all the way 6-3, 8-5 and 12-11
with fierce back-court attacks before the Chinese rallied back
through solid blocks over the net and turned over the table to
their merit.
</P>
<P>
Beefed up with the first set victory, the Chinese spikers
sealed the competition without serious challenge from the Germans.
</P>
<P>
"The Germans had a comfortable opening and hindered our
attacks through serves and blocks," admitted Lang Ping who took
the helm of the Chinese national squad one and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
"With more efforts attained to blocks, we controlled the game
later till the end of the competition," the coach said.

<P>
LUANDA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Commission of the
Angloan Peace Process decided today that the deadline for the
UNITA troops quartering will be extended for 15 days to August
15.
</P>
<P>
The move taken by the Angolan joint commission is to ensure
that there will be enough time for all former UNITA soldiers to
gather at assembly points.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the number of the quartered
UNITA soldiers has reached 57,000 by now.
</P>
<P>
During the peace negotiations between the Angolan government
and the UNITA, the former rebel group declared it had more than
63,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations special representative based in Angola
Blondin Beye said today that the UNITA generals to be integrated
into the army of national unity will arrive here soon, adding
that the joint commission is satisfied with the result.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the joint commission will hold a

<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Minister of Information
and Culture Walter Ofonagoro said today he is optimistic that
peace will be restored to Liberia within next year.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a Liberian delegation in Abuja, capital of
Nigeria, the minister stressed that Liberians need to commit
themselves to regional efforts to resolve the crisis in their
country, according to a television report today.
</P>
<P>
He said the cooperation of all Liberians is critical to the
resolution of the crisis, pointing out that the international
community is becoming impatient with the recalcitrance of some of
the personalities involved in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the Liberian crisis has dominated
discussions in the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) because it is hampering efforts to realize the ideals of
the sub-regional body.

<HEADLINE> US Welcomes Mexico's Cooperation in Drug Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
welcomed the Mexican government's cooperation in the fight against
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a press
briefing here that the Mexican government "has recently extradited
11 individuals to the United States, including four drug
traffickers."
</P>
<P>
"The Mexicans have also deported two other individuals wanted
in the United States, including Juan Garcia Abrego, who was on the
FBI's Ten Most Wanted List," Burns said, adding that these actions
"are unprecedented."
</P>
<P>
"It's a dramatic departure from historic Mexican policy," the
spokesman noted, referring to the fact that the Mexican government
had not been willing until last year or so to extradite their
nationals to stand trial in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Burns stressed that the Clinton administration regarded the
move as "a very good signal of the determination that the
(Mexican) president is bringing to this effort with us."
</P>
<P>
"And we will continue to work with him," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also disclosed that senior U.S. and Mexican
officials were meeting at the White House to discuss tougher
measures against drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Seeks Help to Extinguish Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today fought with raging
forest fires, as the world responded coolly to the country's
appeal for help.
</P>
<P>
While the fires in Adana, southern Turkey, have been
completely extinguished, the forest fire in the Soke district of
Aydin has been reported to be under control on three fronts,
but it is still continuing on the western front due to strong
winds. The fire has destroyed at least 1,000 hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
The forest fire near the popular tourist town of Marmaris,
Mugla province, along the Mediterranean coast. It was caused by
negligence during the burning of dried weeds, and is still out of
control on the western front.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 people are now fighting against the flames in
the region.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkish Foreign Ministry appealed to Israel,
Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Britain and the united States for
help to extinguish the forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Israel has given a positive response to Turkey's appeal and
proposed to send four water tanks, each with a capacity of five
tons, to be installed on helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has proposed to Britain and the United States on using
the air forces in Incirlik base in Adana. However, both countries
have declined to offer help, saying that the forces were not
appropriate to be used in fire-fighting operations.

JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today rejected
several demands by African refugees who had protested against the
deportation policy outside the Pretoria office of the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, the Department of Home
Affairs said there was a distinction between the rights of
recognized refugees and those of asylum-seekers and rejected
asylum-seekers.
</P>
<P>
About 300 African refugees staged a demonstration on Monday
outside UNHCR office in central Pretoria, demanding that their
deportation from South Africa be forestalled until they could be
resettled in other countries.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, the protesters, who had spent the night
on the pavement in front of the UNHCR office, marched to the
union buildings to present a memorandum to a government official
after police threatened to arrest them.
</P>
<P>
The department said UNHCR would assist refugees or asylum-seekers
to resettle elsewhere only when the current country of asylum was
considered unsafe.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Strives for Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said today it has made
adequate provisions for the protection of the environment against
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has enacted anti-pollution decrees and
set up the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA) to
enforce them, Chief of General Staff Oladipo Diya said.
</P>
<P>
The FEPA's activities have had a great impact on Nigerians,
especially those living in urban areas where industries and
manufacturing firms generated wastes which could pollute the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Diya, the second most powerful man in the country, was in
Lagos, the largest industrialized city in Nigeria, to inaugurate
the country's largest sewage treatment plant, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
The completion of the plant will help strengthen the efforts
of the federal government to provide an enabling environment for
the establishment, growth and sustenance of industries in the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the FEPA's Director-General Evans Aina said that
the 5,000 indentified industries in the country generate about
178,000 tons of waste annually.
</P>
<P>
To save cost, the FEPA has advocated that industries with
similar production processes should consider the establishment of
a joint or central waste treatment facility, the official said.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women's volleyball
team swept Germany 15-12, 15-8 and 15-8 on Tuesday to move up to
the semifinals at the Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"We have attained our aim to become the top four squads here
and we are so delighted with the result," said Lang Ping, head
coach of the Chinese that only placed seventh in the Barcelona
Olympics after five world titles in a row from 1981-86.
</P>
<P>
With the win of the quarterfinals, China will play the winner
between Russia and the Netherlands on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese displayed their masterfull ball-handling and
defensive skills to blunder the German attacks before unleasing
scoring counter-punches, paced by hitters Li Yan and Sun Yue.
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Germany enjoyed their early lead of 6-3, 8-5
and 12-11 with steady serves and fierce back-court attacks, but
China rallied back to control the court through solid blocks over
the net since then.
</P>
<P>
"China's defense and attacking downed our team, and we had
trouble in blocking," said German coach Siegfried Kohler.
</P>
<P>
"We have really made a big step in the world arena," Lang said,
"Our goal has been realized through the efforts of my players and
the cooperation of assistant coach apart from my perfonal
contribution."
</P>
<P>
Ace spiker Sun Yue stole the spotlight for China with 18 kills
while Lai Yawang added 14 kills and four blocks.
</P>
<P>
For Germany, Nancy Celis led with 15 kills and Sylvia Roll
pounded 14.

<HEADLINE> Britain Seeks Curbs on EU Foreign Policy Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
reaffirmed its long-standing stance that the European Union's (EU)
common foreign and security policy can be made more efficient
without introducing majority voting.
</P>
<P>
In a six-page submission to the Inter-governmental Conference
on EU reform, the British Foreign Office insisted that the veto
power for each member state should not be abolished in a bid to
enhance the formulation of a common foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
While endorsing the idea of appointing an external
representative of the EU, the Foreign Office also proposed strict
terms of reference for such a representative.
</P>
<P>
The document made it clear that such an official would be kept
on a fairly tight rein by the 15 EU member states and he would
also be answerable to member states through the foreign minister
of the EU presidency state.
</P>
<P>
The official would be responsible for the "external
representation of agreed policies" and "conducting political
dialogue with third countries," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The representative would have the right to speak for the EU,
but not the right to vote or propose new policies at foreign
ministers meetings, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office paper also noted that five or six diplomats
should be seconded from the member states to the secretariat of
the European Council to help with planning and analysis.
</P>
<P>
The group would help prepare the agenda for foreign ministers'
meetings, set out policy options and recommendations, and give
early warning of impending crises.
</P>
<P>
However, the Foreign Office said in the document that member
states would have "no formal obligation" to pass on sensitive
information to the council secretariat.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Bemoans Public Debate on Holomisa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today bemoaned the public debate about the
dismissal of Bantu Holomisa as Deputy Minister of Environmental
Affairs and Tourism, but he again declined to give reasons for
the move.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that a person who holds a responsible
position can go public on a matter of this nature, without having
first finding out why we took this decision," said the president
at his official Pretoria residence.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also told reporters: "We give no reasons for replacing
the deputy minister, and I will give no reasons here."
</P>
<P>
Holomisa was dismissed as a deputy minister by Mandela last
week.
</P>
<P>
His dismissal reportedly came after criticism by the African
National Congress (ANC) of Holomisa's testimony early this year
before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that Public
Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau had accepted a bribe from
former Transkei president George Matanzima.
</P>
<P>
Holomisa faces an ANC disciplinary inquiry into his testimony.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Truth and Reconciliation Deputy Chairman Alex
Boraine reportedly demanded that the ANC urgently provide reasons
for Holomisa's dismissal.
</P>
<P>
If the deputy minister has been dismissed because of his
testimony before the commission, this will make the commission's
task difficult. It might discourage others to give evidence
before the commission, said Boraine.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Leader Accepts Two Ministers' Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 30 (Xinhua)--Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko today accepted the resignation offered by two major
government ministers, Leonid Sinitsyn and Georgy Badei, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The resignations were accepted during a joint meeting of the
government and the Security Council, which was held behind closed
doors was dedicated to the results of the country's economic
performance during the first half of 1996 and the economic
policy's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Sinitsyn, who was Deputy Prime Minister in charge of foreign
economic relations, led Lukashenko's campaign headquarters in the
presidential elections two years ago.
</P>
<P>
He was named presidential chief of staff immediately after
Lukashenko was elected head of state, but was removed to the post
of Deputy Prime Minister later because of differences with the
president, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Badei, who was Economics Minister and who had supra-ministerial
powers under a special presidential decree, was not part of
"Lukashenko's team". He had been Labor Minister in the former
government led by Vyacheslav Kebich until 1995.
</P>
<P>
He told Interfax that he had decided to resign because of the
presidential administration's insufficient attention to the
Economics Ministry's initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, the program concerning Belarus' economic
development for the period until the year 2000 was submitted for
consideration by the presidential administration as early as in
October 1995," Badei said, adding that the program had so far gone
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Lukashenko blamed the current
government for failing to turn the poor economic situation around
in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The economy has been in a free fall for the past six years,"
he said, noting that two years was enough to pass judgement on the
Cabinet's ability to run the economy. The president made it clear
that the Cabinet could no longer refer to the previous
government's economic mismanagement as an excuse for its own
failure.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer confidence
advanced to a six-year high in July, a leading research institute
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence Index, issued by the New York based
Conference Board, rose to 107.2, a gain of more than 7 points
over June. Consumer confidence is now at its highest level since
May 1990, it said.
</P>
<P>
Both of the widely-watched components of the Index scored
strong gains in July. Consumers' views of current business
conditions jumped to 124, a gain of more than 9 points over June.
Consumers' expectations for the next six months climbed to 96.1,
up almost 6 points over June.
</P>
<P>
The survey is based on a representative sample of 5,000 U.S.
households, according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
But the vice-president and Economic Counsellor at the
Conference Board, Edgar R. Fieldler, said, "Whether this latest
surge in confidence is a decisive signal that the economy is
picking up steam remains to be seen."
</P>
<P>
"But the latest survey results confirm that consumers are
clearly confident about current economic conditions and anticipate
further economic growth in the months ahead," he added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Three NATO member states and 16
NATO Partnership for Peace nations will send troops to participate
in a peacekeeping exercise in the United States, U.S. General John
Sheehan announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, coded-named Cooperative Osprey 96, will take
place in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, from the 12th through the
30th August, Sheehan told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Some 95O troops from the 16 Partnership for Peace nations
including Albania and Uzbekistan will practice and develop their
combined peacekeeping skills alongside soldiers and Marines from
Canada, the Netherlands and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"This is the second large Partnership for Peace exercise we
have here in the United States," said Sheehan, supreme allied
commander Atlantic and commander-in-chief of the U.S. Atlantic
Command.
</P>
<P>
"It's focused on humanitarian and peacekeeping operations, but
what's different from last year, we've added more of a military
dimension to this," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"We're adding the level of sophistication, we're adding the
level of complexity to what we did last year. And what we're doing
is taking many of the IFOR (International Peace Implementation
Force) lessons in Bosnia," Sheehan added.

<P>
MOGADISHU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A boy and two girls were eaten
recently by hyenas in the outskirts of the southern port town of
Kismayo when they went for elopement.
</P>
<P>
They are two couples of which one would marry secretly each
other while the other couple went with them to witness their
marriage and keep them company. the two couples who had only one
AK-47 with a full magazine were attacked by a large group of
hyenas. They hardly killed 10 of the beasts after they run out of
bullets. The boy who had the gun escaped after climbing a tree
while the other three were eaten.
</P>
<P>
To perform an elopement, the young couples should avoid the
presence and awareness of the father of the lady. They should
travel at least 90 km away and meetl an authorized sheikh who can
read them the marriage performance. Through that simple
procedure, the couple can then claim to be a legalized family
after interoducing their marriage certificate offered by the
sheikh and then the parents of the lady are forced to accept that
procedure according to the tradition.
</P>
<P>
Accordion to Sheikh Idle Abdullahi Farah, a moderate Sheikh,
more than 60 percent of the Somalis are born on the elopement
method since the life standard in the country is very low and the
young couples are often poor. The only reason for the young
couples to choose elopement is their attempt of avoiding to pay
dowry to the parents of the would-be bride. Traditionally, the
parents of the lady would be honored by the parents of the would
be bridegroom with some gifts such as a horse and gun when an
engagement is to be made for their daughter and her loved boy.

(about 4.1 million dollars) were destroyed during this period.
They included chicken, wine, chocolate, drinks and ice cream.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, Albania has been importing large amounts
of foodstuffs to make up domestic shortages. But a considerable
proportion of imported foodstuffs are either of poor quality or
past their sell-by dates.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today appealed to all nations to distribute their
wealth in a way that will ensure social justice for the people.
</P>
<P>
"We should try new approaches to achieve social justice to
ensure the people have a fair share of the wealth of their
nations," Mahathir said at the closing of an international
dialogue on "smart partnership" in Langkawi, Malaysia, the
Malaysian news agency Bernama reported.
</P>

It is worth trying "the smart partnership" approach where the
administration, workers and business forged partnerships to
achieve prosperity and stability for the people and countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also appealed to big corporations to reinvest to
strengthen the process of social justice that will bring more
meaningful purpose for their own existence.

<HEADLINE> Japan Adopts Measures to Control Food Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government today
adopted a package of measures to combat the spreading of food
poisoning caused by the O-157 strain of E. coli bacteria, Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said.
</P>
<P>
The package includes working out a manual by the weekend on
medical treatment of the epidemic, studying whether to make it a
legally designated infectious disease and stepping up sanitary and
medical treatment methods, Kajiyama said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cabinet also decided to distribute to every
household with newspapers 40 million flyers containing information
on how to avoid food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has spread throughout Japan this year, causing
seven deaths and sickening some 8,700 people, mostly
schoolchildren in the western city of Sakai.
</P>
<P>
The Kyodo News Service reported today that the Health and
Welfare Ministry planned to invoke a powerful law as early as next
week, aiming to prevent the spread of the O-157 epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo said that it would be the first time in 20 years for the
dangerous infectious classification to be applied to an epidemic
under the 1897 Communicable Diseases Prevention Law, which allowed
health authorities to take legal steps -- the isolation of
patients, traffic blockades and regulations on patients' work --
to fight an infectious disease.

<HEADLINE> BOC Sets New Record In Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- For the first time the Bank of
China (BOC) is raking in more deposits in RMB than it has loaned.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this past June, the bank's RMB yuan deposits
topped 442.4 billion yuan, eight billion more than the total
amount of loans delivered in the same period, according to an
official of BOC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the banks deposits in foreign currencies rose by 1.7
billion US dollars, standing at 27.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rising RMB yuan deposits took place and has boosted the
bank's capacity in dealing RMB business, against the backdrop of
the country's promise to make RMB convertible under current items
within this year, along with recent cuts of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
As a move to woo depositors, BOC branches at all levels have
worked without their traditional midday break since July.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, the bank, as the second largest credit
card issuer in China, issued 3.82 million credit cards to the
public, involving a total of 105.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Also the bank recalled a total of 43.6 billion-yuan in overdue
loans in the first five months of this year.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Hold Closed-Door Talks on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- African leaders held closed-door
talks on the Burundi crisis in the northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha before a summit opens later today.
</P>
<P>
According to a report available here, the presidents of Kenya,
Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, the prime ministers of Ethiopia and
Zaire, and the foreign minister of Cameroon were set to study an
option for military intervention in Burundi after a military
coup led by Tutsi-dominated army took place in the tiny central
African state last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Organisation of African Unity Secretary-General Salim A. Salim
and U.S. and European Union envoys also attended the talks.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Buyoya, the new Burundi military ruler who overthrew
former Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in the coup, was
barred from the talks, the report said. His delegation in Arusha
was regarded as a lobby group.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an unnamed Kenyan presidential official as
telling reporters that the leaders are expected to agree on
action on Burundi -- either a regional peacekeeping force or
economic sanctions against that tiny mountain state.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Military Technical Committee grouping
Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania, set up in June by African
heads of state, said: ``The committee has drawn up a plan
for military intervention if instructed by the heads of state.''
</P>
<P>
``It's up to them to decide what to do. But in case they seek
intervention, then we're ready. We have a plan which can be
applied in the Burundi situation,'' the report quoted another
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Burundi's new president, Buyoya, strongly opposes the
proposed foreign military intervention.
</P>
<P>
The report said the plan called for a force of 25,000 troops
to be deployed in Burundi, where 150,000 people had been killed
in a war between Tutsi-dominated troops and Hutu rebels in the
last three years. enditem

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Banking Know-How Exposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A new-generation bank cash machine
that can wipe the smile off the faces of cash-card cheats, made
its Asia debut in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The ATM machine is a real eye-catcher at the International
Exhibition on Financial Banking Technology and Equipment opened in
China's capital today.
</P>
<P>
Instead of relying on the usual PIN number, the new cash
machine identifies customers by their faces. It has been developed
by Germany's Siemens Nixdorf. Their advanced automatic teller
machine (ATM) has been developed to use clever technology to check
the physical appearance of customers. It is the first time the
machine has been publicly shown in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Organized by People's Bank of China, the showcase event, from
July 31 to August 4, has attracted more than 200 companies from 13
countries. It is the largest, most advanced event of its kind for
the country's financial circles.
</P>
<P>
US giants, IBM and Hewlett-Packard, Sweden's Ericsson, Japan's
NTT Data Corporation, and Germany's Siemens Nixdorf are among the
86 big-name foreign companies at the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Other items on display include domestic and overseas up-to-date
financial banking technology and equipment, banking computer
systems, banking card systems and equipment, including ATM and
POS, multi-media technology, banking facilities, banking business
handling systems and financial information service systems.
</P>
<P>
During the exhibition there will be 30 technology-exchange
meetings, providing an opportunity for domestic and overseas
financial organizations to exchange computerized financial
services.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts during the 1981-1995 period, China's
financial industry has made massive progress in electronic
technology applications, especially in state-owned financial
organizations.
</P>
<P>
China's financial institutions now use over 250 mainframes,
more than 240,000 personal computers, and 9,000 ATMs. A total of
110,000 banking outlets in the country are equiped with computers.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Receives Steady and Sufficient Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Almost three billion yuan was
injected into the Three Gorges Project, the world's largest
water-control scheme, in the first half of this year, according to
a Beijing-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
China Electric Power News reports that the financial input was
nine percent more compared with the same period last year, with
1.57 billion yuan from the Three Gorges Project Foundation, and
1.39 billion yuan in State Development Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The nation adjusted fund-raising policies early this year,
pledging stronger support from the nation's comparatively
developed provinces and the Three Gorges Project reservoir areas.
</P>
<P>
To expedite the money supply for the project, the State
Development Bank opened its Wuhan Branch in Central China's Hubei
province, the first branch in the country, early this year.
</P>
<P>
The loans from commercial banks guaranteed sufficient flowing
funds for construction companies involved in the giant project.
</P>
<P>
An efficient arrangement and fund transfer system is also
ensured by the Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, the
major undertaker of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Started in 1995, the Three Gorges Project is expected to take
17 years to complete, involving a total investment of 110 to 180
billion yuan. By the end of last February, the nation had poured
11.5 billion yuan into the water-control scheme.
</P>
<P>
China plans to earmark 8.2 billion yuan for the project this
year.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Iodized Salt Has More Benefits Than Potential Harms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The benefits of universal salt
iodization by far outstrip potential adverse effects like inducing
hyperthyroidism, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed in
a study today.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted in seven African countries to examine
an increase in hyperthyroidism cases reported in 1995 in Zaire and
Zimbabwe following use of iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
In the seven countries of Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania,
Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe, the recent use of iodized salt has
made iodine deficiency no longer a severe public health problem.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, for example, goiter prevalence in children was
brought down to 9.1 percent in 1995 from 38.3 percent in 1988,
said WHO in a press release issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
No clear evidence of hyperthyroidism was found in the countries
studied except Zaire and Zimbabwe, said WHO, noting that in some
areas of four of them, iodine consumption levels rose sharply from
almost null to up to four times the maximum levels it recommended.
</P>
<P>
The problem in Zaire and Zimbabwe might result from
unnecessarily high iodization level of salt due to lower losses
and higher salt consumption levels than earlier expected and to
some batches containing too much iodine, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that salt iodization levels could be safely
lowered in some countries without harming their effectiveness.
Experts urged better monitoring and quality control procedures
from production to consumption levels.
</P>
<P>
In some of the countries surveyed, salt-iodine content varied
much in production -- a situation needed to improve. The WHO said
that good manufacturing practices, including packaging and
storage, would also help ensure proper salt-iodine content,
especially in tropical areas, where heat and humidity badly affect
the conservation of iodine.
</P>
<P>
Today, the majority of the global population have access to
iodized salt. Universal iodization -- fortification of all salt
for human and animal consumption, has been endorsed as a
cost-effective public health alternative against iodine deficiency
disorders, which is a serious public health problem in 118
countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, it was estimated that about 1,500 million people
worldwide were at risk of iodine deficiency disorders.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said that globally, about 655 million people suffered
from goiter as a result of iodine deficiency, and more than 20
million others were believed to be mentally handicapped due to the
lack of iodine in food and water.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Egypt to Withdraw from Camp David Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran today urged Egypt to withdraw
from the Camp David Accord as a pre-condition for the
re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The official statement was issued by Iran's Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mohammad Mohammadi and was published by the official
news agency IRNA today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iran's stand towards relations with
Egypt has remained unchanged, stressing that Iran will restore its
relations with Egypt only after Egypt officially withdraws from
the Camp David Accord.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Israel signed in 1978 two Camp David agreements. The
first agreement provided for a five-year transitional period
during which the inhabitants of the Israeli-occupied West Bank of
Jordan and the Gaza Strip would obtain full autonomy and
self-government, and the second agreement provided for the signing
of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel by September 17, 1978.
The agreement made Egypt the first Arab country to make peace with
Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
But Syria, Algeria, Libya, the PLO condemned the Camp David
agreements and then pushed the Arab League Council to expel Egypt
from the league in 1979 for its peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran also severed its ties with Egypt after it made peace with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Egypt's withdrawal from Camp David
will "free that country from being used by the United Stated as an
instrument for the implementation of anti-Islamic policies."
</P>
<P>
He also accused the United States for triggering insecurity in
the region and motivating open sedition against Iran's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States' intervention in this region is the
main factor contributing to serious clashes between Kurdish
factions in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran strongly denounced any and all forms of
terrorism, accusing the United States of supporting Israel's state
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He called on the G-7 ministers gathered in Paris to
counter the American double-standard policy by paving the way
for effectively countering world terrorism.

<HEADLINE> China to Import More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China has thrown open its doors
to exporters from around the world to help meet its massive
development plans.
</P>
<P>
Figures released today in Beijing show that developing
countries are rapidly cashing on China's domestic growth, too.
</P>
<P>
Imports from India rocketed by over 83 per cent in the first
six months of this year compared to the first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Australia and Russia both increased their exports to China by
over 50 percent, while Latin American countries, Kazakstan and
Myanmar, as well as Switzerland shipped more goods to China.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhaoqing, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation outlined the global export winners to
emphasis the way China had multi-dimensional access to its import
markets.
</P>
<P>
He said China plans to expand its import of technology,
equipment and materials needed for domestic construction work, to
meet the needs of its economic development and its increasing
market capacity,.
</P>
<P>
Hu gave details of the measures in Beijing today, adding that
China will welcome more involvement from other countries and
regions around the world in the competition for Chinese markets.
</P>
<P>
Hu noted that China, as a huge market, is open not only to
developed nations, but also to developing nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's import volume in the first half of this
year totaled US$ 63.181 billion, rising by 11.6 per cent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Hu referred to countries whose exports to China grew by the
biggest margin in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
China's imports from India picked up 83.3 per cent more than
the previous figure, and from Oman by 74.2 per cent.

NEW DELHI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- India's Supreme Court today
exempted former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao from appearing
before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) on Friday in the L.
Pathak cheating case.
</P>
<P>
Rao moved a petition before the Supreme Court earlier today
challenging the Delhi High Court verdict upholding a CMM order
that summoned him to appear as a co-accused in the cheating case.
</P>
<P>
"The matter has been listed to come up before this court on
August 12. In the meantime, we grant exemption from personal
appearance to the petitioner (Rao) before the learned CMM, till
the disposal of the special leave petition challenging the High
Court verdict upholding the summons issued by the CMM," said a
brief order of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Britain-based non-resident Indian businessman L. Pathak earlier
testified before the CMM court that he had given 100,000 U.S.
dollars to controversial godman Chandraswami and his associate to
secure contracts for the supply of newsprint and paper pulp to
India on the assurance of Rao, who was the then external affairs
minister.
</P>

The exhibition, the second of its kind, will focus on the
progress made by the UAE pharmaceutical sector, as well as the
need to further health care in the Middle East. The exhibition
will be 30 percent bigger in scale than the first one held in
1994, WAM reported.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the exhibition will include a large number of
major manufacturers and suppliers of medicines and medical
instruments from the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Sweden,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Artist Carves Microscopic Miniatures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The art of carving miniatures has
a long history in China, and many such works illustrate flowers,
birds, landscapes, crafted into objects the size of small seeds.
</P>
<P>
But Artist Zhang Yuanxing's work is different: he carves
microscopic Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Zhang recently completed a 20-character poem in four lines
carved on a tiny slice of ivory, one-tenth the size of a sesame
seed. It is the smallest of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a retired primary school teacher in Shenyang, the
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, has carved many
remarkable works.
</P>
<P>
Zhang once carved 100 poems on eight pieces of jade, each just
three square cm, and each carved with 500 Chinese characters. He
also carved a book, consisting of more than 6,000 characters, on a
15 sq cm piece of jade.
</P>
<P>
All of these minute carvings only can be seen with the help of
a microscope.
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old artist said that he became interested in
carving Chinese characters on tiny items more than 40 years ago,
when he was in middle school.
</P>
<P>
Once, during a visit to a local museum, he found a small piece
of ivory -- as big as a grain of rice -- on which 117 Chinese
characters were carved. Zhang then decided to study miniature
carving and become a skilled craftsman.
</P>
<P>
To keep his skills sharp, Zhang has carved 500 characters
daily for more than 40 years. He says he now can carve Chinese
characters on any type of object.
</P>
<P>
He usually does his carving aided by a microscope. Sometimes,
when a piece is too small to be seen with a magnified lens, he
carves by intuition.
</P>
<P>
Zhang uses homemade gravers made from 1,000 different
materials.

<HEADLINE> First Motel Opens in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has opened its first
motel to cater for the growing army of car owners.
</P>
<P>
The motel, which cost 4.5 million yuan (about 542,169 US
dollars) boasts car wash and repair services, installing a
gasoline station, offering boarding and accommodation and snacks,
and even managing a Karaoke house.
</P>
<P>
Since trial operations started in January, business at the
motel, located on a key state highway, has been booming. The new
motel meets international standards.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the emergence of such a standard motel is
likely to lead to the birth of other motels in the city, or even
throughout the country, as private motorists take to China's roads.
</P>
<P>
At present there are many small and privately-owned restaurants
and hotels, which provide similar services, along the country's
main highways. But their functions and services are often
sub-standard and leave much to be desired.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar to Discuss Border Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Amnuay
Virawan will visit Myanmar on August 5-6 to attend a joint
commission meeting at which border issues between the two
countries will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Main problems to be ironed out will include the digging in the
Moei river on the Thai side and the deadlock over construction of
the Thai-Myanmar bridge, said Amnuay, who spoke to reporters when
making an inspection tour of the sites on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year Myanmar accused Thailand of illegal encroachment on
the border area, which led to alteration of the Moei river
borderline. Later, Myanmar suspended construction of the border
bridge in June, demanding removal from the reclaimed area of
construction materials, rock filling and all buildings on the
river bank as preconditions for talks.
</P>
<P>
The reclaimed area on the Thai side has since been altered but
Myanmar is yet to agree to resumption of construction on the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Thailand also asked Myanmar to stop planting
stakes along the river and to dismantle concrete barriers.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The new UN envoy to Afghanistan,
Norbert Holl, said today that he would broaden his spectrum of
contacts during the peace mission in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Reports coming from Kabul said Holl, who is visiting Kabul,
indicated that he wanted to hear more from those people who do not
belong to the political elite but are intelligent and
sound-minded.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen in the Afghan capital, Holl said that he
would not only talk with Afghan political and military leaders,
but also seek the views of other elements of society, such as
intellectuals, judges and women's groups.
</P>
<P>
Holl, a German diplomat who replaced Mehmud Mestiri as the UN
special envoy to Afghanistan last month, said that he would make
changes to Mestiri's tactics.
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to spell out the details of his peace plan.
</P>
<P>
"I will not be very specific at the beginning of this mission
but I definitely have a few plans and initiatives to get this
process moving again," he added.
</P>
<P>
Holl also stressed that the UN would coordinate its operations
to deal with Afghanistan more closely and that his UN Special
Mission to Afghanistan would remain based inside the war-ravaged
country.

<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen opened fire and
killed three people in Abu Quras, Minya province, in southern
Egypt Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) today quoted a
source from the Interior Ministry as saying that the body of Nagih
Abdel Qader Abdel Hamid, 25, was found on a piece of cultivated
land he owned.
</P>
<P>
Also in Abu Quras, Mohsen Badia Gerges, 30, and Ihab Amin
Ghebrial, 35, were shot dead by three gunmen who opened fire at
them and fled afterwards.
</P>
<P>
MENA said that security forces were trying to arrest the
perpetrators of the attacks. It did not give more details.
</P>
<P>
Moslem fundamentalist militants who launched a violent campaign
against the government in 1992 have carried out many terrorist
attacks in Minya.
</P>
<P>
But it was unclear whether Tuesday's attacks were the work of
the Moslem militants, who have attempted to overthrow Egypt's
current secular government and replace it with strict Islamic
rule.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Finance Minister Resigns on Moral Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat resigned today after an opposition lawmaker last
Thursday accused him of illegally holding a personal account in a
New York bank, which some MPs pointed out violated the country's
foreign exchange law.
</P>
<P>
Mahat today announced his resignation in the lower house where
the regular proceeding had been stalled for the last four days as
opposition MPs raised legal and moral questions against him and
refused to start discussion on the government's budget plan.
</P>
<P>
MPs of the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-UML)
asked Mahat to resign on moral grounds, saying they would carry
out regular business of the house session only after Mahat's
ouster.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's foreign exchange law prohibits any Nepali national
living in Nepal from possessing any foreign bank account unless
permitted by the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Mahat, who had worked as an economist in the United Nations
from 1988 to 1991, said he opened the account in the New York bank
in 1988 and failed to transfer it to Nepal in time as there were
unsettled claims between him and the UN agency he had worked with.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he was innocent and the money in his bank
account was the earnings from his UN service.
</P>
<P>
Mahat returned home from his UN service in 1991, and was
elected into the lower house representing the Nepali Congress (NC)
party in the 1991 election.
</P>
<P>
He became finance minister last September when the NC-led
three-party government under Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba was
formed to replace the minority communist UML government.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Impose Anti-Smoking Law From Early 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A new law on the restriction of
smoking, which extends non-smoking areas and limits advertisement
of cigarettes, has been passed by the Macao legislative Assembly
and will become effective from January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new law has extended the non-smoking area to all places
for health care, whether public or private, including clinics,
chemist's shops and ambulance, places for people of under 16 years
old, places producing or marketing inflammables, libraries,
museums, public meeting halls, reading rooms, exhibition halls and
within taxicabs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it rules that smoking is also banned in all
passenger transportation vehicles, like buses and ships, and
places for public reception.
</P>
<P>
Violators of the rules will be fined between 250 Patacas
(about 31.6 US dollars) and 10,000 Patacas (about 1,265.8 US
dollars). Fines will double if the violator is found to have
violated the rules for a second time within three months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the law also imposes more strict restrictions over
the advertisement of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The number of smokers in Macao has been rising over recent
years, and people have called for a more effective restriction on
smoking.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Cities to Discuss Cultural Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the world's
most famous historical cities will gather in the ancient Chinese
capital of Xi'an in September to discuss protection of cultural
relics.
</P>
<P>
About 100 historical cities in 62 countries will send delegates
to the Fifth World Conference on Historical Cities, which is to be
held in this 2,200-year-old city from September 9-12, announced
Wang Xizhao, a local government official in charge of foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Xi'an and China to host such an
event. Other cities that have welcomed global guests for the
conference are Kyoto, Florence and Barcelona, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Mayors and representatives from these and other cities will
discuss events related to the revival of ancient historical
cities, such as Rome, Athens, Cairo, London, Paris, Moscow,
Vienna, and Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Topics also will cover the relationship between the protection
of ancient culture and the development of modern civilization.
</P>
<P>
A declaration on protection of cultural relics and
modernization is to be published during the conference. The host
site of the next conference also will be named.
</P>
<P>
The first conference was initiated by Kyoto in 1987, in an aim
to promote exchanges and cooperative relationships among those
cities.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an served as the capital of several ancient Chinese
dynasties since 206 B.C., and is now widely-known for its rich
cultural relics and historical sites.
</P>
<P>
But Xi'an also wants to take advantage of its rich cultural
heritage to develop its tourist sector and build itself into a
modern city.
</P>
<P>
In addition to holding an ancient art festival during the
conference, the city plans to attract foreign funds through
investment and trade talks with its counterparts around the world,
the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stock Market Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market rose
sharply after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut official
interest rates today.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index surged 49.5 points, or 2.32 percent,
to 2180.3 points, the highest level since July 11.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose by 74.9 points to 3291.6 points,
while the all resources index closed 30.2 points higher at 1338.3
points.
</P>
<P>
The RBA reduced official interest rates from 7.5 percent to 7.0
percent today. Local economists predicted that further interest
rate cuts would come before the end of the year due to a slower
economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cut helped to lure more funds into the local
stock market, because investors usually move their money from bank
to equity market in pursuit of a higher return when interest rates
drop.
</P>
<P>
Among local shares, BHP jumped 43 cents to 17.03 Australian
dollars, CRA strengthened 41 cents to 18.25 Australian dollars,
National Australia Bank gained 16 cents to 11.74 Australian
dollars, News Corp rose 28 cents to 6.50 Australian dollars and
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie added five cents to 1.33 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover totaled 297.13 million shares, valued at
788.9 million Australian dollars (615.3 million US dollars).

On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the September share price index
contract bounced back by 68.0 points to 2199.0 points.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Weakens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar weakened
against all major currencies under the impact of official interest
rate cut today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 77.28 US cents from 78.79 US
cents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut official interest rates
from 7.5 percent to 7.0 percent today. It was the first change of
Australian official interest rates since December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The cut of interest rates and speculations about a possible
interest rate hike in the United States prompted investors to dump
Australian dollars and hedge their funds in other currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was traded at 83.00 yen against the
Japanese yen at today's close from 84.99 yen yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It was also sharply weaker against the German mark, ending at
1.1376 marks from 1.1663 marks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local traders expected the Australian dollar to be under
pressure for some time in the near future, but they said that the
currency was unlikely to fall much below 77 US cents because of
long-term trend of economic growth in Australia.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Restore Discipline in Private Health Care Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- An inspection will be conducted
throughout Vietnam in the private health care sector as from
August 1 according to a decision made by the health minister.
</P>
<P>
The inspection will be carried out first in Hanoi and Ho Chi
Minh city before being launched on a nation-wide scale in the
final quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 8,000 private health care
establishments, 2,295 traditional healing establishments, and
7,984 private pharmacies, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
These medical establishments have made contributions to caring
for the people's health. However, they have had shortcomings that
should be eliminated in the near future, officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The inspection will focus on evaluating the qualifications of
private medical practitioners, equipment, and the quality of
medicines in order to promote the sector's positive aspects and to
restrict negative effects.
</P>
<P>
Permits to provide private health care services will also be
checked during the inspection.
</P>
<P>
The move is to restore discipline in the private health care
sector as well as in the medicinal market.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire Vie for Regional Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The seaports of Lagos and Abidjan
are under the World Bank's spotlight to determine which will be
chosen as a ship and cargo processing center for the west and
central Africa sub-regions.
</P>
<P>
The two port cities, the former is the largest commercial city
of Nigeria and the latter the economic capital of Cote d'Ivoire,
are vying for designation as a load center, a new concept in ship
and cargo management designed to centralize ship traffic in a
given sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement which is already being operated in
developed regions and the Far East, according to press reports
today, a select city will serve as the primary port of call for
all ships with cargo destined for the relevant sub-region and
from where cargoes will be transhipped to other destinations.
</P>
<P>
A study team commissioned by the World Bank has begun
simultaneous analysis of the maritime environment in Lagos and
Abidjan toward designating either city as the load center for
west and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The bid is critical to Lagos because if it loses, Nigerian
port may be relegated to an appendage of the port of Abidjan and
will handle only small vessels shuttling between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The timing to make public the result of the current panel
study is yet to be disclosed.

<HEADLINE> HK To Remain Regional Telecom Center In Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will maintain its status
as a regional telecommunications and information center after
China regains sovereignty in 1997, according to an official with
the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister Yang Xianzu told a conference on Hong Kong's
economic prospects, in Guangzhou, recently that Hong Kong will
continue to be an international information hub, and its
co-operation with mainland areas will increase after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining its telecommunications advantage will guarantee the
area's status as an international financial, communications and
business center, which is what the Chinese government wants to
see, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of phone calls between Hong Kong and mainland areas
was 300 million last year, totalling more than 700 million
minutes, according to Guangdong Telecom News.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the mainland and Hong Kong have become each
other's largest trading partners in telecoms, with the number of
telephone lines up to 15,000.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now also serves as the transfer point for mainland to
Taiwan postal and telecom connections. Direct service is still not
available across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Hong Kong and mainland areas on telecom
projects and technical exchanges is also good, the vice-minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the telecom business will be independently
managed by the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region after July 1, 1997, and his ministry will play an important
role in normalizing technical standards of Hong Kong between the
mainland.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Blocks Nigeria Airway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The South African government is
accused of scuttling Nigeria Airways' bid to expand its routes to
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The result of an investigation by the Daily Times newspaper
which was made public today revealed that the application filed
by the Nigerian national carrier for two slots four months ago
was being tossed round by the South African authorities.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria Airways has planned to begin flights to Johannesburg
last month and appointed a station manager to oversee the
operations. But the application is yet to see the light of the
day.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian embassy in Pretoria and the consulate in
Johannesburg were said to have put in the necessary diplomatic
touch to secure the approval in the past four months with little
success.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the South African embassy in Lagos was
not forthcoming in the visa application filed long ago by Nigeria
Airways for its station manager.
</P>
<P>
The embassy, like its home government, was said to have
continued to give one reason or the other for the delay in
granting the visa to enable the manager to go to South Africa in
preparation for the operation.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the continued delay in the slot approval
was part of South Africa's diplomatic offensive against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's relation with South Africa, which was very close
after the collapse of apartheid, became sour following the
execution of nine Ogoni minority activists last November, when
President Nelson Mandela took the lead in calling for sanctions
against the Nigerian military government.
</P>
<P>
Later Nigeria boycotted the African cup soccer championship
held in South Africa. In May Nigeria refused to attend the
African insurance organization annual meeting in South Africa
because of alleged discrimination by South African embassy in
Lagos against the Nigerian members of the organization in
applying for visa.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and South Africa entered into a bilateral air services
agreement immediately after the abolition of apartheid in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Former Prime Minister Rao to Appeal to Supreme Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Former prime minister and
president of the Congress Party P.V. Narasimha Rao will made an
appeal to the supreme court later today challenging the Delhi high
court's rejection of his petition, Congress Party sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi high court rejected Rao's petition and upheld the
order of chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM), Prem Kumar,
summoning Rao as an accused in the cheating case involving
UK-based Indian businessman L. Pathak.
</P>
<P>
Rao's petition was to seek quashing of the July 9 CMM order
summoning him to appear at the court on July 24. The CMM later
fixed August 2 for Rao's personal appearance at the court as the
Delhi high court had directed deferment of Rao's presence in the
lower court on July 24 in view of the pendency of the decision on
the petition moved last week.
</P>
<P>
L. Pathak has testified before the CMM court that he gave
100,000 US dollars to controversial godman Chandraswami and his
associate to secure contracts for the supply of newsprint and
paper pulp to India on the assurance of Rao, who was the then
external affairs minister. Rao said that he had nothing to do with
the case and he is innocent.

<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China has geared up development of
its primary industries this year by expanding its fixed-asset
investment in these sectors.
</P>
<P>
The farming sector received an investment of 7.731 billion yuan
in the first half of this year, 25.3 percent more than in the same
1995 period, according to the State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Such growth has helped improve conditions for grain production,
which is a significant stabilizer in the Chinese economy, bureau
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investment in the energy industry chalked up an
increase of 20.3 percent to 89.592 billion yuan in the
January-June period, of which 56.093 billion yuan went to
construction of power generation facilities, up 40.1 percent.
</P>

The country injected 50.065 billion yuan into the raw materials
industry, 39.1 percent more than in the corresponding period last
year, with the chemical industry taking the biggest share of
25.701 billion yuan, up 51.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Environment Protection Complements Economic Growth in Tibet Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China is taking a series of measures
to protect the environment of the Qomolangma Nature Reserve, and
at the same time promote local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The reserve straddles the border between Tibet in southwest
China and Nepal, and covers more than 33,000 sq km, with five
mountain peaks above 8,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Qomolangma, the world's highest peak, is famed for its
glaciers, forests, grasslands and lakes.
</P>
<P>
However, due to natural and geographical reasons, nearly 80,000
residents in the area remain poor.
</P>
<P>
To better protect the reserve and improve the local people's
living standard, the Qomolangma Nature Reserve Working Committee
recently divided the reserve into three areas: a core zone, a
buffer zone and a development zone.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection should be backed up by a strong
economy, and vice versa, said Zholma Yangzon, a committee official.
</P>
<P>
And the appropriate exploitation of natural resources and
improved natural environment will ensure the steady growth of the
local economy, she added.
</P>
<P>
The core zone includes seven areas, with the peak of Qomolangma
at the center, that require the most extensive protection, such as
the mountain eco-system, large primitive forests and several
historical sites, she said. Some endangered wild animals and plant
species also live there.
</P>
<P>
Damage to the ecological environment may cause irretrievable
losses. "A single tree, flower or little bird is not allowed to be
hurt in the area," she said firmly.
</P>
<P>
Just outside the core zone is the buffer zone, which is
designed to lessen the impact of human activities on the core
region.
</P>
<P>
The buffer zone should be used as an experimental area where
methods can be developed to protect the natural environment and
explore natural resources simultaneously, allowing man to work in
harmony with nature, she said.
</P>
<P>
Most scientific work on the nature reserve is carried out in
the buffer zone, and some tourism is permitted there.
</P>
<P>
The outermost layer is the development zone, where most local
residents live. By protecting this zone's environment and
improving its resources, the Committee can improve the local
residents' living standards.
</P>
<P>
Development in this zone will be categorized into agricultural,
pastoral and township growth patterns.
</P>
<P>
The central government, concerned with environmental protection
in the reserve, has set aside funds and arranged for officials
with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation to
supervise the work.
</P>
<P>
Effective protection work in the reserve has attracted the
attention of the United Nations Development Program, which has
agreed to provide 880,000 US dollars for economic development
there.
</P>
<P>
With financial and technical assistance and the continuing
efforts of local residents, Zholma said she is confident that in a
few years, the Qomolangma region's economic development will be as
attractive as its scenery.

Reports said that the workers at the Partizansk mine in
Primorye of the Far East region got only 15 eggs and some cans of
meat and fish in July to avoid massive starvation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some hungry children of miners suffered food poisoning
after eating dog meat, the daily newspaper Moscow Tribune reported.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 13,000 miners have joined the strike since it
began 11 days ago and about 10,000 more were expected to take part
in it although the Russian government has sent 45 billion roubles
(8.7 U.S. dollars) to the region to pay part of their delayed
salaries now totaling 130 billion roubles (25 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In Primorye, which is one of Russia's major coal mining regions
with 27,000 pit workers, more than 300 workers from a
hydroelectric plant at Luchegorsk also went on a hunger strike on
Tuesday, demanding for the payment of five billion roubles
(900,000 dollars) in arrears.
</P>
<P>
Interfax warned that the strikes would paralyze the production
of energy resources in Primorye.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kremlin's senior economic aide Alexander Livshits
was optimistic, saying that the government's money would help ease
the problem and a solution would be found to settle the crisis in
Primorye within several days.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday urged Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin to solve the problem by launching a thorough
economic reform in the fuel and energy industry.
</P>
<P>
He also accused local authorities of delaying the payment of
the miners' wages.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Tribune said a large amount of inter-company debts
instead of a failure in timely budget transfers have led to the
wage delays.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the coal consumers are currently owing the
suppliers about two trillion roubles (400 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many Russian companies deliberately delayed the wage
payments so as to have more floating capital, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Reception Marking 69th PLA Founding Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Defense Minister Chi Haotian today
called for effectively raising the defensive combat capabilities
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) under the conditions
of modern technology, especially the modern high-tech.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also vice-chairman of the Chinese Central Military
Commission (CMC) and a State Councillor, made the remarks at the
reception marking the 69th anniversary of the founding of the PLA.
</P>
<P>
China should steadily build its army into a crack force of
well-trained, well-equipped and disciplined officers and men with
up-to-date military theory, appropriate size, scientific and
effective organizations and footing, and with efficient logistic
support, he said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, he called on the army to adhere to the general
requirements set by CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin, namely "be qualified
politically and competent militarily, have fine style of work,
maintain strict discipline and be assured of adequate logistic
support," so as to enhance the defense and military modernization
and provide a strong security guarantee to the nation in its
reform and opening-up process.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the army's work over the past year, Chi said, the PLA
has become more revolutionized, modernized and regularized in an
all-round-way and scored great achievements in all fields' work
with defense capabilities further enhanced, thus making new
contributions to maintaining the national security and
safeguarding the unity and social stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
As "an army dedicated to the cause of justice and peace," the
PLA has consistently been implementing the Chinese Government's
independent foreign policy of peace and persistently pursuing a
defensive policy concerning national defense, noted Chi.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that the PLA wishes to conduct still more extensive
exchanges and cooperation with the peoples and armed forces of
other countries and is determined to play an active role in
building a still more splendid world.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Chi reaffirmed that the PLA will
unswervingly implement the basic policies of the "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems," resolutely oppose
any schemes and plots of creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan", firmly oppose interferences by any external forces in
China's internal affairs and resolutely combat the conspiratorial
activities within Taiwan island, which are attempted to split the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We shall work hard to promote the peaceful reunification of
our motherland but, on no account shall we commit ourselves to
abandoning the use of force. We have the will, capabilities and
ways and means to defend the state sovereignty and territorial
integrity so as to accomplish the great cause of reunifying the
motherland," Chi said.
</P>
<P>
CMC members Yu Yongbo, director of the PLA General Political
Department, and Wang Ke, director of the PLA General Logistics
Department, and Zhou Ziyu, deputy director of the PLA General
Political Department, Ding Henggao, minister in charge of the
Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for Defense
Industry, as well as commanders and senior officers of the three
services of the army were among some 600 people present at the
reception.
</P>
<P>
Military attaches and deputy attaches of the embassies of
foreign countries in Beijing were also invited to attend.

<HEADLINE> Young Chinese Sturgeon Set Free In Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in southwest China's
Sichuan Province recently released 30 artificially-bred Chinese
sturgeons in the Yangtze River, in a move to prevent the
extinction of this rare migratory fish species.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese sturgeon, known as the "Living Fossil," is thought
to have lived in the Yangtze River for more than 140 million
years, said a researcher at the Institute of Rare Aquatic Animals
in Yibin city, Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The sturgeon is under top protection in China.
</P>
<P>
The rare fish used to spawn in the Jinshajiang River, a
tributary of the Yangtze. When they had grown to about 10 cm, they
swarmed to the sea 3,000 km away. As adults, they swam back
upstream to their birthplace.
</P>
<P>
However, their travel route has been blocked by the Gezhouba
Hydro-electric Power Station, which has been in operation for more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time researchers in Yichang have freed the
rare species into the Yangtze.

<HEADLINE> HK Futures Exchange Launches Long-dated Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Futures Exchange
(HKFE) launched long-dated Hang Seng Index (HSI) options contracts
today.
</P>
<P>
Ivers Riley, chief executive officer, said that long-dated HSI
options will provide investors with an additional investment and
hedging tool, complementing the existing HSI options contracts.
</P>
<P>
The contract specifications for long-dated and short-dated HSI
options are the same except in their contract months and strike
prices.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to short-dated HSI options which have a maximum
term of 12 months, long-dated HSI options have expirations of up
to 24 months. If the residual term of long-dated HSI options is 12
months or less, they are integrated into the cycle of short-dated
HSI options.
</P>
<P>
Riley said that since the launch of the current short-dated HSI
options contracts in March, 1993, trading volume has been growing
steadily, adding that this highly encouraging trend is another
factor for the introduction of long-dated options.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the average daily turnover for HSI options was 1,426
contracts. In 1994 and 1995, the volume increased to 2,446 and
2,614 contracts respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the volume further surged to
3,843 contracts per day.

<HEADLINE> More Precious Stones Exploited in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China's exploitation of precious
stones since the beginning of the 1990s has increased the number
of precious stone deposits to more than 200, and those of gem
varieties to 60.
</P>
<P>
China's progress in precious stone prospecting has eased
bottlenecks in the domestic market's gem supply, which experienced
an overnight boom when the jewelry trend hit the entire country in
late 1980s, and continued to grow, according an official with the
Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the ministry show that the country has
more than 7,000 precious stone shops, and the annual foreign trade
volume for precious stone and jade stands at 100 million US
dollars, ranking China 11th in the world.
</P>
<P>
But gem exploitation has a long way to go to meet people's
demand: most of the popular precious stones sold in the domestic
markets, such as jadeite, rubies, sapphires, emeralds and
diamonds, are from other countries.
</P>
<P>
China's search for gems has been fruitful in the past few
years, as dozens of new mines and varieties of precious stones
have been detected and exploited.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, China has discovered more than ten
sapphire deposits along the eastern coast, which is covered by a
basalt belt. The Changle Mine of Shandong Province, the largest of
its kind, has formed a production capacity of one million carats,
and is China's first sapphire exporter.
</P>
<P>
All the stones exploited by the mine have a grain size of more
than one centimeter, and the largest weighs about 1,000 carats.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest diamond mine has gone into operation in
Wafangdian of Liaoning Province, generating an output of more than
100,000 carats every year.
</P>
<P>
Ruby and emerald deposits were found in mountainous Yunnan
Province of southwest China, according to ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
The jade output has grown at a stable rate over the past five
years. The Xiuyan Jade Mine in Liaoning Province, the largest jade
supplier of China, has improved its yearly production capacity to
10 million tons.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's annual output of popular precious gems,
especially diamonds, sapphires and rubies, are still behind the
growth in domestic demand, said industrial analysts in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The prospection of precious stone deposits and exploitation in
scale should be the key tasks for China's geological industry in
the coming years, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Regulations For Foreign Exams in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
(SEC) has released a set of interim provisions to guide
Sino-foreign cooperation with regard to educational examinations.
</P>
<P>
According to the new provisions, foreign organizations must
work in cooperation with Chinese educational examination bodies
that are at least of the provincial level, and the exams must meet
China's requirements.
</P>
<P>
The foreign organizations should obtain legal authorization
before giving the exams, according to the provisions.
</P>
<P>
The two sides must provide the necessary facilities for the
examination, as well as names of the examinees and of the
organizing bodies, and prove that they are capable of conducting
the exam, the provisions state.
</P>
<P>
The examiners are also asked to provide a list of exam items
and rules.
</P>
<P>
Organizations that jointly give exams can grant non-diploma
certification to qualified examinees. However, the organizations
cannot grant foreign certification to students without SEC's
approval.
</P>
<P>
An SEC official said that foreign organizations began to
cooperate with Chinese educational departments to give exams in
China in the late 1970s, when the country initiated its reform and
opening-up.
</P>
<P>
The examinations have contributed to the improvement of China's
ability to conduct exams, and also to studies of examination
theories.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the new provisions, however, some foreign
organizations failed to follow SEC guidelines in entrusting
Chinese units or individuals to hold entrance examinations or
tests of language proficiency.
</P>
<P>
The official said that such practices, along with improper
publicity of the exams, disrupted the normal educational order.
</P>
<P>
The interim provisions apply with examinees from Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan.

<P>
WUHAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in central China's Hubei
Province are battling against the elements to make up losses
caused by the recent floods.
</P>
<P>
They are fully engaged in farming their fields, trying to make
up for the crop losses.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers are competing with time in taking in early rice, while
planting late rice, straining for a good harvest," said an
agricultural official from the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the flood situation is still serious in
the province, through which the mighty Yangtze River runs, adding
that anti-flood measures are still intact along the river and
major lakes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the rainfall which hit the province from July
13-18 was the most severe in its history, causing excessive flood
water to burst river banks and engulf over 2.67 million hectares
of farmland, washing away 360,000 ha of crops.

<HEADLINE> China Expecting To See Progress In Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government said here
today that it hopes the negotiations on its entry into the World
Trade Organization will show some progress in October when the WTO
Working Party on China convenes its second meeting in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, spokesman for the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Hu Zhaoqing said that there
can be positive results as long as those concerned join in the
effort.
</P>
<P>
"China has always had a positive attitude towards the
resumption of its founding status in the General Agreement on
Tariff and Trade and its accession to the WTO," Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
"As the largest developing country in the world, China plays an
important role in the world economy and in trade," Hu said.
"Without China's participation, the WTO will be incomplete," he
emphasized, adding that, "China's participation in the WTO at the
earliest date possible is not only beneficial to China, but also
to the whole world."
</P>
<P>
The WTO Working Party on China held its first meeting in Geneva
in March this year but failed to reach a resolution.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that leaders and trade officials from many countries
are interested in China's entry into WTO and have exerted some
influence for this end.
</P>
<P>
"It is our sincere hope that all the parties involved in the
negotiations can be flexible and pragmatic and properly resolve
this issue, on the basis of the Agreements of the Uruguay Round
and on the condition that China's status as a developing country
is recognized," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to develop economic and trade relations with
all countries and regions on the basis of equality and mutual
benefits, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
Rome was not built in one day, Hu said, and China believes that
it's liberalization of trade can only be realized one step at a
time.

The giraffe, "Linlin", swallowed a plastic bag that had been

animal's enclosure, on the night of July 12. The animal got to the
bag just moments before the zoo keeper could remove it.

The giraffe appeared to be sick two days later, and even after
veterinarians at the zoo along with doctors gave the animal
emetics, its condition did not get any better.
</P>
<P>
The mother and the baby giraffe it was carrying died on July 23
under anaesthesia as veterinarians prepared to operate on the
animal. They later concluded that it was killed by intestinal

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Return Will Not Disrupt Oil Market: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's return into the oil
scene in late August will not disrupt supplies if members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) abide to
their agreed output quota, said former OPEC secretary general
Subroto here today.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is expected to sell about 700,000 barrels per day (bpd)
and if OPEC members adhere by the quota of 25.033 million bpd
agreed in Vienna in June "we would see even stronger prices," he
told reporters after a panel discussion at the Asia Oil and Gas
Conference 1996 here.
</P>
<P>
Subroto, who is now chairman of the Indonesian Institute for
Energy Economics, said current world production of oil stood at 69
million bpd, of which 26 million bpd was supplied by OPEC and the
balance of 43 million bpd by non-OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, a co-founder of the 12-member OPEC, produced more than
3.0 million bpd before a trade sanction was imposed on the country
in 1991 after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the over-capacity in most oil producing
nations in Asia, the return of Iraq and the oil development in
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union will not paint a rosy
picture for the oil industry beyond 1998.
</P>
<P>
With the oversupply situation, he said "a bearishness in price
is envisaged in the short-term but let us not forget that a
shortage might occur further ahead of the year 2010."
</P>
<P>
The three-day first Asia Oil and Gas Conference, which began
here Tuesday, is aimed at addressing concerns over the limited and
declining supply of oil in the region and at assessing future
trends, strategic issues and challenges facing the petroleum
industry in the Asia-Pacific region as well as exploring new
opportunities in the East Asian market in both upstream and
downstream activities.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Flower Producing Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- China's flower industry will
blossom in the next two years, with help from a multi-million
dollar project in southwest China's Yunnan Province that will
produce 30 million high-quality flowers and plants every year.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of China's major steps China to speed up the
development of seedlings of flowers and plants," officials from
the State Planning Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a large number of fresh and quality flowers are
imported. The disorderly and unsystematic imports, low quality,
plant diseases and insect pests are major obstacles in the
country's development of its flower industry, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The new project, with an investment of 36 million yuan, will be
built by the Yunnan Jingyun Co. and the Yunnan Gardening High-Tech
Development Co.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on studying the key techniques, facilities and
standardization of flower seedling production, and on the
development of new breeds that will meet the demands of the
overseas and domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
Modernized facilities will also be built for virus detection,
anti-diseases, anti-insect-pests and storage of fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be completed in two years, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
China's flower and plant growing area is totaled 75,000
hectares, and its flower exports amount to 60 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the planning commission, the annual growth rate of
flower production and export is expected to reach 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The current world flower sale is about 100 billion US dollars
and is expected to reach 200 billion by the end of the century.

They managed to steal more than 500,000 yuan from the
passengers before being apprehended in January 1995, said the

foreign-funded enterprises in the first five months of this year,
with a combined contractual value of 40.6 billion US dollars, 67
percent more than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds used totalled 15.3 billion US dollars, a rise of
27 percent, the overseas edition of "People's Daily" quotes Wang
Liaoping, deputy head of the Foreign Investment Department of the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 270,000 foreign-funded firms have been built in
various parts of China since the country began its economic
reforms 18 years ago. There are now 121,000 foreign-funded firms
operating in China.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output value generated by these enterprises
accounted for 14.5 percent of the national total, while their
imports and exports in the first five months amounted to 47.8
billion US dollars, a 28-percent increase over last year's period.
</P>
<P>
Because of improvement in the investment environment in
central and western parts of China, the amount of overseas funds
coming to these areas saw a 24-percent rise, higher than the
national average growth rate, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the Chinese government has been working on
policies on the use of foreign funds in central and western parts
of the country for the next five years. The government will grant
preferential treatment to those who invest in capital cities,
development zones, and high-tech zones in those parts.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Commander Foresees Pullout from E. Slavonia by July 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- United Nations forces in Eastern
Slavonia could pull out by July 1997 after free elections there, a
top U.N. commander in the region said here today.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal from the last Serb-held territory in Croatia
would take place after an extension to the peacekeepers' present
mandate, according Belgian General Josef Schoups.
</P>
<P>
Schoups, who is leading the U.N. Transitional Authority in
Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES), told reporters that he foresees a
six-month extension of the 5,000-strong forces' mandate in January.
</P>
<P>
And elections in the currently U.N.-administered region, he
said, could be "organized as soon as possible, maybe by the end of
March," to facilitate the pullout before the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed between Croatia and Serbs, the
one-year U.N. mandate in the region, which comprises 4.4 percent
of Croatian territory, can be extended if either side asks for it.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Serb assembly in Eastern Slavonia wrote
to the U.N. Security Council, the U.N.'s decision-making body,
asking that the UNTAES mandate be extended for another year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the request, Schoups said the year-long extension
is "improbable."

<HEADLINE> Romania, U.S. Agree on Co-Production of Helicopter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government today
signed a memorandum of intent with a U.S. firm to jointly produce
helicopters with both military and civilian capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The document calls for the co-production of Cobra helicopter
designed by the U.S. Bell Helicopters Textron.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca and the U.S.
manufacturer's president, Lewis Campbell, signed on the memorandum
at a ceremony held at the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Tinca said that Romania, after two years of study, chose Cobra
as its production partner because its military needs attack
helicopters and that the project will help Romania's aircraft
industry survive.
</P>
<P>
Cobra attack helicopters are now widely used in the
U.S. military. But they also have civilian capabilities and
Romanian hoped that the U.S.-Romanian production of helicopters
for civilian purpose will help open up the eastern European market.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Romanian President Ion Iliescu earlier today,
Campbell told his host that he would like to see the co-production
project finalized by the end of September.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is

part of its measures to raise agriculture production.
</P>
<P>

cooperation of the fertilizer industry, an official said here
today.
</P>

farmers are helped to reap bigger and better harvests," the
official quoted the agriculture minister as saying.

<HEADLINE> Germany Pays 1.5 Million Marks to Nazi Victims in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Germany paid 1.48 million marks (one
million U.S. dollars) to compensate victims of Nazism last year,
or 50 years after the end of the Nazi rule over much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The payments, by Germany's federal and regional governments,
were slightly less than those in 1994 due to a decrease in the
number of people who were qualified to claim the compensation.
</P>
<P>
However, according to figures released today by the federal
government in response to parliamentary questioning, the amount
awarded to individuals saw an actual increase last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 1.13 million marks (750,000 dollars) were for personal
injuries, 102,000 marks (65,000 dollars) were paid to descendants
and 53,000 marks (35,300 dollars) for capital repayment.
</P>
<P>
Government estimations put the total amount needed to pay for
compensations between now and the year 2020 at 25.9 million marks
(17.2 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Nepali House Session Adjourned for Fourth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The regular proceeding of
Nepal's lower house session has been disrupted for the last few
days as opposition lawmakers demanded the resignation of Finance
Minister Ram Sharan Mahat before starting discussion on the
government's budget.
</P>
<P>
The house meeting was adjourned for the fourth consecutive day
Tuesday when MPs of the main opposition the Communist Party of
Nepal (CPN-UML) continued demanding the ouster of Mahat for his
holding a personal account in a US bank.
</P>
<P>
A CPN-UML MPs revealed last Thursday that the finance minister
has an account in a New York bank with nearly 47,000 US dollars
five years after he returned home from United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) service.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's foreign exchange law prohibits any Nepali national
living in Nepal from holding foreign bank account unless permitted
by the Central Bank of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
MPs of the opposition have been raising legal and moral
questions against Mahat in parliament and asked him to resign in
the last few days.
</P>
<P>
However, the finance minister defended that he was innocent
because his money in the account was not illegal.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he had registered in Nepal Rastra bank, the
central bank, for transfer of his foreign account to Nepal earlier
this month and the bank had approved his application.
</P>
<P>
But CPN-UML President Man Mohan Adhikari Tuesday accused Mahat
of abusing his authority by planting document in the central bank
to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
Adhikari said at the lower house that the issue could be
settled only after the finance minister's resignation.
</P>
<P>
He said that one minister's mistake could bring his coalition
government down.
</P>
<P>
Mahat is from Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba's Nepali
Congress (NC) party, which is leading the three-party government
formed last September to replace the then minority CPN-UML
government.

ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian mountain biker Paolo Pezzo
upset world champion Alison Sydor of Canada to seize the gold
medal in the women's mountain bike cross country race here today
at the 26th Oplympics.
</P>
<P>
Pezzo, 27, peddled home in one hour, 50 minutes and 51 seconds
in the 31.8 kilometer race to win the first women's mountain bike
cross country race in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
Sydor, who won women's cross country race at World
Championships in 1994 and 1995, finished second in 1:51:58 to take
the silver. Susan MeMattei of the United States, silver medalist
at the 1994 World Championships, finished third in 1:52:36 for the
bronze.
</P>

on an upward slope, bridged up to the leading group and then broke
away from it half way into the second lap, leaving DeMattei and
Sydor chasing closely behind.

"When Paola went by, there was nobody who could really stay
with her," said Sydor. "I thought she was one of the few (who
could win) coming in."
</P>
<P>
With one lap left in the race, Pezzo seemed to have a lock on
the gold medal after building up a 1:31 advantage over Sydor and
DeMattei.
</P>
<P>
"I did't ride as hard at the start as I did at the end," said
Sydor, who shaved seconds off Pezzo's lead when she motored away
from MeMattei.

DeMattei, who maintained her pace well into the end, said: "I'm
happy wth the bronze." She said that during the race, she was

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper was to leave today for France and Spain in a bid
to strengthen Colombia's economic and diplomatic relations with
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
His first call was to be Paris for a three-day visit to France
at the invitation of his French counterpart, Jacques Chirac,
Colombian Vice Foreign Minister Juan Fernando Cristo said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Samper, who is concurrently president of the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), was due to attend talks between the

Countries.
</P>
<P>
The tour would also tighten Colombia's bilateral links with
France, Cristo added.
</P>
<P>
Samper's activities in France were to begin with a meeting
with local businessmen, to whom he will explain investment
opportunities in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
A military cooperation agreement will be signed prior to his
talks with Chirac, and Samper is expected to tell Chirac

partners in Latin America. He will present initiatives to attract
French investment in Colombia, especially in the energy sector.

ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- world top women's table tennis
player Deng Yaping downed fellow Chinese Liu Wei, setting up a
final clash with Chinese Taipei's Chen Jing, who routed Chinese
world number two Qiao Hong in the other semi-final on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deng rallied to beat Liu 21-23, 21-17, 21-19, 21-9, while Chen
beat Qiao 21-9, 23-21, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
Chen, the 1987 world champion, took the advantage of her
rival's complacence to clinch her first victory against Qiao in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"She had never beaten me in recent several years," Qiao said.
"Therefore I was too relaxed coming onto the court."
</P>
<P>
"I was under-prepared," she added.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles quarter-finals, two Chinese rallied to
beat their rivals to reach the top four.
</P>
<P>
World number two Wang Tao came back from two sets down to
overcome Vladimir Samsonov of Belarus 16-21, 16-21, 21-10, 21-15,
21-15.
</P>
<P>
Power failure happened twice in the table tennis court and it
might have helped Wang.
</P>
<P>
The first power cut delayed the second set for 25 minutes and
the second postponed the deciding set for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"Samsonov's coach asked me whether I would like to play the
rest of the match tomorrow, "Wang said. "I regarded it as sign of
nerves and I said no."
</P>
<P>
China's world number six Liu Guoliang snatched a 9-21, 21-19,
21-16, 21-16 victory over Canadian Johnny Huang, who eliminated
defending Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I won the first set because I was faster than Liu," Huang
said. "But Chinese head coach Cai Zhenhua demanded Liu to change
the strategy and it worked."
</P>
<P>
"Liu played rallies with me in the following sets and that got
on my nerves," Huang said. "When I played the ball a bit high or
long, Liu got the kill."
</P>
<P>
In the other men's quarter-finals, 31st-ranked Czech Petr
Korbel upset world number three Jean-Michael Saive of Belgium
21-10, 21-13, 21-19, while German Jorg Rosskopf edged out South
Korean Kim Taek-Soo 12-21, 26-24, 21-12, 16-21, 26-24.

<HEADLINE> UK Hopes Bulgaria Acts as Intermediary Between Russia, NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary Michael
Portillo today expressed the hope that Bulgaria can act as an
intermediary between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Bulgarian President Zheliu Zhelev,
Portillo said NATO has become a bloc ready to cooperate with
rather than confront Russia as it did before.
</P>
<P>
Portillo said that only those countries which are afraid of
Russia strongly demanded NATO membership. But NATO is prepared to
cooperate with Russia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Portillo and Zhelev agreed that it is impossible to halt the
process of NATO's eastward expansion to include Russia's former
satellite states in eastern and central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Zhelev repeated Bulgaria's determination to join the Western
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria should not be isolated by Europe's security body
because its two neighbors -- Greece and Turkey -- have been NATO
members and the other two neighbors -- Romania and Macedonia --
are applying for NATO membership, Zhelev said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve central and eastern European nations stretching from the
Baltic to Mediterranean seas, including Bulgaria, have demanded
NATO membership since 1990.
</P>
<P>
But NATO has kept them waiting because of Russia's strong
opposition. Russia insists that the enlargement process will
threaten its national security.

<HEADLINE> Canada Lifts Oil Barge from Gulf Bottom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The biggest marine salvage
operation in Canadian history took place today as the Coast Guard
refloated an oil barge that has lain at the bottom of the Gulf of
St. Lawrence for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
Powerful cranes on the lift vessels hoisted the barge Irving
Whale off the 67-meter-deep seabed in some 70 minutes, local media
reported today in what's been described as one of the biggest such
operations ever undertaken in the world.
</P>
<P>
The barge, the size of a football pitch, sank in the gulf on
Canada's south east coast in a storm in 1970, with 3,100 tonnes of
oil and seven tonnes of oil containing poisonous PCB chemicals.
</P>
<P>

<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China meet Russia and Cuba take on
Brazil in the Olympic women's volleyball semi-finals after they
beat their respective opponents in the quarter-finals Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, which placed seventh in the Barcelona
Olympics, beat Germany 15-12, 15-8 and 15-8 to move into the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy to reach the semi-finals," said Chinese
coach Lang Ping.
</P>
<P>
Germany led early in the first set at 6-3, 8-5 and 12-11, but
China made up the margin and dominated the match thereafter.
</P>
<P>
"China's defence and offence beat our team, and we had some
trouble in blocking," said German coach Siegfried Kohler.
</P>
<P>
Russia, silver medalists of the last Olympics, rallied to beat
European champions the Netherlands 10-15, 15-7, 15-9, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch team launched fast attacks and forced their Russian
opponents into frequent errors. The Dutch team win the first set
15-10.

But the Russian team took over the domination in the second set
with fierce attacks and tight blocking.
</P>
<P>

Bert Goedkoop, coach of the Dutch team, "Our players were nervous
in the game."
</P>
<P>
Asked the chances for the Russian team to win the semi-final
match, Kappol said: "We are capable of beating the Chinese team."
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Cuba, which only placed third with a slow
start in the Pool B preliminaries, denied the Americans' hope for
a semi-final berth as they trounced the hosts 15-1, 15-10, 15-12.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians, cheered by their fans in yellow T-shirt at Omni
Coliseum, scored a straight set win of 15-4, 15-2 and 15-10 over

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Mindanao Residents Protest Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 20,000 people staged
rallies and marches in three Mindanao cities on Tuesday in a
protest against the government's peace deal with the MORO National
Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators marched through the city centers of Iligan,
Dipolog and Dapitan to protest the government's plan to set up the
Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD).
</P>
<P>
Protesters in Dipolog and Dapitan also waved inverted national
flags and burnt effigies of President Ramos to greet the president
who is visiting the region to drum up support for the proposed
council.
</P>
<P>
Ramos ordered the arrest of instigators of such acts, saying
the government would no longer tolerate the "desecration of a
constitutional symbol of the republic."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he sent to the opponents a message, calling them to
"break not the peace," in his speech during the multisectoral
assembly in Dapitan city.
</P>
<P>
The protest occurred as the government reached consensus with
the MNLF to absorb 7,500 MNLF members into law enforcement
agencies, but the issue of integrating 5,000 MNLF fighters into
the armed forces still remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
In another development the same day, President Ramos announced
that the government and the MNLF have agreed on two revisions in
the interim peace accord to accommodate the concerns of critics of
the proposed SPCPD, but he did not disclose the details.
</P>
<P>
Some senators also said they are willing to meet with MNLF
Chair Nur Misuari in connection with their inquiry on the Mindanao
peace formula.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos tried hard to win the support of 29 Mindanao
officials, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines and
181 representatives in the congress, but he failed to sway the
senate and the Mindanao residents, especially Christians, who are
the majority of Mindanao society and fear they will be put under
Muslim's control after decades of ethnic conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Thailand to Designate Border Checkpoints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- High ranking officials of Myanmar
and Thailand are due to hold a meeting here today on designating
checkpoints on the Myanma-Thai border, according to diplomatic
sources.
</P>
<P>
An eight-member Thai delegation, led by director of Asian
Affairs of the Foreign Ministry of Thailand Suvidhya Simaskul,
arrived here Tuesday to attend the meeting on border checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the 13th meeting of the Myanmar-Thailand Joint
Boundary Commission was held in Thailand. Two Myanmar regional
commanders, Southeastern Commander Major-General Ket Sein and
Eastern Commander Major-general Tin Hlut, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa's official visit
to Myanmar in March this year, Myanmar reopened three border
checkpoints on the Myanma-Thai border at Tachilek-Maesai,
Kawthaung-Ranong and Myawaddy-Maesot, and the two sides signed an
agreement to work out ways and means to synchronize the procedures
and practices on border crossing at respective border checkpoints.

<HEADLINE> Cuban scientists Invent Biological Substances to Kill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Three Cuban scientists are
carrying out new experiments with a substance they invented called
Griseleaf, which can kill mosquito larvae in 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
Griseleaf has already been successfully tested in the fight
against malaria-carrying mosquitoes, Cuban Public Health Ministry
representative Grisel Montero said.
</P>
<P>
Tests are also being carried out on another product as
effective as Griseleaf to combat the anopheles mosquito that
transmits the organism which causes some 23 diseases including
dengue, a tropical disease causing joint pains, fever and rash.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said the World Health Organization (WHO) is
working with these kinds of products as part of the biological
fight against illnesses caused by the "Aedes aegypti" and the
"Albopictus" mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
"Griseleaf is effective for the elimination of the anopheles
and culex mosquitoes and other vectors of the encephalitis
bacterium. It does not affect people, wildlife and plants, and
does not pollute the environment," an Cuban expert said.
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes in Central America have become resistant to many
chemicals because of the indiscriminate use of insecticides which
also damage the regional ecosystem.

<HEADLINE> New Formation in World Weightlifting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- With the emerging of Chinese
lifters in the world and 15 new world records set at the Olympic
Games, the sport of weightlifting has entered a new era.
</P>
<P>
After ten-day competition, China collected two golds to share
the lead with Turkey, Greece and Russia in the team standings. It
is the first time in 12 years that China displayed its power on
the Olympic weightlifting arena.
</P>
<P>
"China tells the world through the Olympics its power in
weightlifting," said International Weightlifting Federation
spokesman Jeno Boskovics. "I should say that China is a challenge
to other weightlifting powers in the world."
</P>
<P>
After Tang Lingsheng opened the gold account for China in the
59-kg category, Zhan Xugang added one title in the 70-kg division
with three world records.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Xugang is among of the lifters who collected five gold
medals for China at the last World Championships in November of
1993.
</P>
<P>
Apart from China, Turkey, Greece and Russia each also had two
golds in the ten-category competitions.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Naim Suleymanglu, who was once called as "Pocket
Hercules", became the first lifter to win the gold medal in
consecutive three Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
After shining in Seoul and Barcelona, Suleymanglu continued to
dominate the 64-kg category in Atlanta, winning the title with one
world record in the total.
</P>
<P>
Akakide Kakhiashvilis of Greece, who competed for Georgia in
Barcelona four years ago, deserved a special mention.
Kakhiashvilis not only won the 99-kg category, one of the golds
for his new country, but also broke the old world record in the
jerk by seven kilograms.
</P>
<P>
"It is a huge margin, it is the first time in weightlifting's
100 year history," said Boskovics. "It is a record of the world
record."
</P>
<P>
At the year 1993, the International Weightlifting Federation
changed ten categories, in aim to clean its name as drug-abused
sport. The change has resulted in a record-broken wave at the
Centennial Olympics Games. According to statistics, a total of 15
world records have been rewritten in the past ten days.
</P>
<P>
"We have never experienced so many exciting moments in
weightlifting competition before," Boskovics said. "The results
are fantastic, the crowds are supportive and the competition is a
success."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Seven more people reportedly died
in floods caused by powerful Typhoon "Huaning," bringing to 62 the
death toll from the typhoon and its predecessor "Gloring,"
according to a report on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A weather forecast said "Huaning," sustaining center winds of
165 kilometers per hour (kph) and gusts of up to 215 kph, had
veered away from the country and was spotted at 5 p.m. over the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Although storm warnings for Luzon island have been lowered, the
typhoon was expected to bring continued rains and isolated
thunderstorms to many areas in the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Many areas of Luzon, including Metro Manila, were flooded and
more than 10,000 families have been forced to evacuate from the
areas.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon and floods have seriously damaged the
infrastructure on Luzon island, thus creating one of Metro
Manila's worst traffic jams.  The damage to infrastructure was
estimated at 200 million pesos (7.7 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since Monday, some vehicles have bumped together while
thousands of commuters were stranded for lack of public
transportation and forced to walk home for up to four hours.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Metro Manila and other areas of Luzon might
become even worse in the near future. According to weather
forecast, at least eight typhoons are expected to visit the
country: three in August, three in September and two in October.

<HEADLINE> UK Hopes Bulgaria Acts as Intermediary Between Russia, NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary Michael
Portillo today expressed the hope that Bulgaria can act as an
intermediary between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Bulgarian Prime Minister Zheliu Zhelev,
Portillo said NATO has become a bloc ready to cooperate with
rather than confront Russia as it did before.
</P>
<P>
Portillo said that only those countries which are afraid of
Russia strongly demanded NATO membership. But NATO is prepared to
cooperate with Russia, he added.
</P>
<P>
Portillo and Zhelev agreed that it is impossible to halt the
process of NATO's eastward expansion to include Russia's former
satellite states in eastern and central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Zhelev repeated Bulgaria's determination to join the Western
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria should not be isolated by Europe's security body
because its two neighbors -- Greece and Turkey -- have been NATO
members and the other two neighbors -- Romania and Macedonia --
are applying for NATO membership, Zhelev said.
</P>
<P>
Twelve central and eastern European nations stretching from the
Baltic to Mediterranean seas, including Bulgaria, have demanded
NATO membership since 1990.
</P>
<P>
But NATO has kept them waiting because of Russia's strong
opposition. Russia insists that the enlargement process will
threaten its national security.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Seeks Confidence Vote on Small Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
today called on the parliament to pass a vote of confidence in his
government in a bid to force through a reduced budget for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Prodi told deputies that he hoped the budget proposal would be
passed without any amendments or additional articles.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget provides for savings of 16,000 billion lire
(about 10 billion U.S. dollars) this year to reduce the public
deficit to around 114,000 billion lire (71 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
A vote of confidence, which the government is likely to win
with ease, will enable Prodi to ignore a series of amendments
proposed by the Northern League which was obstructing the finance
bill.

<HEADLINE> Serb Delegation Presses for Indictment of Izetbegovic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A Bosnian Serb delegation today
met with Yugoslav war crimes tribunal prosecutors to press for the
indictment of Bosnia's Muslim President Alija Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
But neither delegation leader Igor Pantelic or tribunal deputy
prosecutor Graham Blewitt gave details of the talks this morning,
according to reports reaching here from the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The Serb delegation and the United Nations court are expected
to issue a joint statement when the talks end either Wednesday or
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pantelic, together with Bosnian Serb justice minister Marko
Arsovic, arrived in the Hague on Monday for a visit that seems to
indicate some improvement in relations between the Bosnian Serbs
and the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Arsovic said he would press for the indictment of
Izetbegovic, claiming Bosnian Serbs had sent the tribunal
documents supporting their call. But he did not give details of
the documents or the nature of the charges.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also plans to visit Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic,
who is on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity carried
out during the nearly four-year war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Tadic is a Bosnian Serb citizen so we are going to visit
him this evening," delegation leader Igor Pantelic said.
</P>
<P>
A 40-year-old former cafe owner from northwestern Bosnia, Tadic
has pleaded innocent to all 31 charges against him, including
those accusing him of visiting three Serb-run camps in
northwestern Bosnia in 1992 to kill and torture Muslim inmates.

<HEADLINE> MPT Set Shanghai-style Service as Example </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) issued a circular urging all departments
to learn from their Shanghai counterparts in providing better
service, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Service quality in the country's monopoly industries has shown
little improvement in recent years, while it has grown at an
annual average rate of more than 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Consumers Association, the sector has
been among the top targets of public complaints in most Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
Based on a nationwide survey, MPT has found that Shanghai
postal and telecommunications workers, who respond to customer
complaints quickly and setup a public supervision system as well
as a strict staff management pattern, are offering the best
service in China.
</P>
<P>
About 96.9 percent of Shanghai residents surveyed said they
were satisfied with local telecom service, while 94.3 percent were
satisfied with postal service.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that in June, Shanghai Telecommunications
Administration (STA) opened a toll-free telephone hotline to
handle customers' complaints.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 2,000 people have been invited by the
STA as public supervisors to help spot bad service in the city.
</P>
<P>
Central Television of China (CCTV), People's Daily and other
national newspapers have reported on the excellent quality of
Shanghai-style Service.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Create More Job Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is making
fresh efforts to find jobs for surplus urban workers and keep the
unemployment rate in cities at about three percent this year,
"China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the country kept urban
unemployment at 2.9 percent, a rise of 0.1 percentage points over
last year, according to the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, labor departments at all levels helped 1.64
million unemployed people find jobs.
</P>
<P>
This experimental program focuses more on low income and
redundant employees, and has helped alleviate the growing
unemployment pressure.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, local governments adopted preferential
policies to encourage service industries, particularly
labor-intensive firms, to hire more redundant workers.
</P>
<P>
Some service industries were exempt from some taxes and allowed
easy access to bank loans and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The surplus workers were also encouraged to find new jobs in
private firms and joint ventures after receiving vocational
training.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1.4 million workers who lost their jobs for more
than six months were re-hired through the help of labor
departments, according to Labor Minister Li Boyong.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, China will help eight million jobless
and surplus workers to find jobs, Li said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, labor departments are phasing in a blanket
social insurance network, which was based on the Labor Law.
</P>
<P>
Of the 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions on
the Chinese inland areas, 29 have formulated programs for old-age
insurance.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hit By Major Rainstorm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital was hit
Tuesday by a heavy rainstorm that deposited over 200 mm of
precipitation.
</P>
<P>
The rain lasted from Tuesday afternoon until early the next
morning, hitting the counties of Shunyi and Pinggu to the
northeast, and soaking downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
There was flooding on some streets, causing traffic jams
Wednesday morning. So far there have been no reports of
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Residents in heavily-hit areas were urged to make an effort to
help deal with the bad weather and in the case of disasters.
</P>
<P>
The local weather forecast said that there will be more showers
over the next two days, and the current hot damp days may last for
about 20 days until the end of the major rainy period.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the storm system is from a subtropical
high-pressure front, an air mass characterized by high
temperatures, high humidity, and high barometric pressure,
conditions that are usually found 30 degrees latitude farther
south. The northward shift has brought it to the edge of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Although many local people have complained about the oppressive
weather recently, with the humidity hitting a record 98-99
percent, the city is said to be enjoying the pleasantly cool
summer weather of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
So far this summer, the highest temperature here reached only
36 degrees centigrade, two degrees lower than the hottest day in
1992, and six degrees lower than the record hottest day in 1942.

<HEADLINE> China Combats Bribery in Medicine Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese pharmaceutical producers
are being called upon by the state to further improve medicine
quality and standardize sales practices to prevent bribery,
reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenzhou, deputy director of the State Pharmaceutical
Administration, made the call yesterday in Beijing at the launch
of a nationwide quality inspection of new Shanghai-made medicines.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the drive would help promote the central
government's attempt to regulate sales practices in the medicine
field and to create well-known Chinese-made medical products.
</P>
<P>
Bribery has boomed in the pharmaceutical business in recent
years. Hospital drug purchasers can receive kickbacks of up to 25
percent, which leads to the inflow of substandard or even fake
medicine to some hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued a circular in April calling for a
crackdown on sales commissions and illegal sale promotion
activities.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide inspection of Shanghai's new medicines is one of
the responses to the state request and is expected to result in a
new and healthy medicine promotion process, said Chen Tonghui,
deputy director of the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Administration.
</P>
<P>
About 26 pharmaceutical enterprises from Shanghai will
participate in the action that is initiated by the Shanghai
Pharmaceutical Industry Sale Co and supported by the State
Pharmaceutical Administration.
</P>
<P>
Aside from quality inspection, activities will also be carried
out to collect suggestions from patients for improvement in 36
major Chinese cities, recommend some new medicines for medical
institutes and exchange service experiences.
</P>
<P>
An important research, production and exportation base,
Shanghai currently has more than 1,500 varieties of medical
products marketed to foreign countries and regions. More than 200
million US dollars-worth of medicines and medical products were
exported.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the municipal government and enterprises
invested 3.4 billion yuan (409 million US dollars) in the past
five years to renovate facilities and techniques and about
one-third of the 28 pharmaceutical enterprises have moved to the
Pudong new industrial development area in Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) - Aleksandr Parygin of Kazakhstan
took the gold medal of the Olympic modern pentathlon on his debut
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Parygin totalled 5,551 points, ahead of Russia's Eduard Zenovka
who scored 5,530, and Janos Martinek of Hungary with 5,501 points.
</P>
<P>
Favorite Dmitri Svatkovski from Russia, world champion for the
last two years, came up from ninth after four events but was just
edged out of the bronze medal and collapsed on the finish line of
the cross country run with dehydration.
</P>
<P>
Parygin, a 23-year-old sports coach from Almaty, won the
decisive 4,000m cross country at the end of 13 hours of
competition in a photo finish from Zenovka.
</P>
<P>
Zenovka led into the final straight but in a breathtaking
climax tripped just inches from the finish line when running
shoulder to shoulder with Parygin.
</P>
<P>
For the first time at the Olympics, the five disciplines in
modern pentathlon, normally spread over five days, were held on
one day.

ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Umpires played the most role in
the softball final here Tuesday evening when the United States
stole the gold medal from the women's softball tournament at the
Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
After two scoreless innings, a woman umpire with helmet stole
the limelight by ruling fair a clear outside hit by American Dot
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong protests from the Chinese coaches, the woman
remained stubborn in her decision to the cheers of the crowded
home fans at Colombus, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The host scored two points from the controversial home run.
</P>
<P>
China, runners-up at the World Championship, had to settle
for a silver medal on the controversial 1-3 scoreboard, with
Australia bagging home the bronze medal after its 3-0 victory
over Japan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes prior to the final, China breezed across
Australia 4-2, winning its outing to the final.
</P>
<P>
With no time even to relax from the early two-hour competition,
the Chinese women were forced to challenge the United States in
front of the partisan crowd in the remote venue, with the latters
having rested a whole day Tuesday.

PANAMA CITY, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Fifty people died and dozens

</P>
<P>
Cesar, which became tropical storm Douglas on Monday, left nine

<HEADLINE>   World Champion Lifts Olympic Title wiith World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- World champion Andrey Chemerkin of
Russia, who jerked a world record weight of 260 kilograms in his
last lift, became the strongest man in the world, winning the over
108-kg category at the Centennial Olympic Games here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, gold medal winner at the world championships in
Guangzhou, China, last November, snatched 197.5 kilograms and
jerked the world mark weight for a total of 457.5 kilograms, which
equals the world record weight set by Aleksandr Kurlovich of
Belarus in Istanbul two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Ronny Weller, runner-up to Chemerkin at the Worlds in
China, won the silver medal at 455 kilograms, with 200 from the
snatch and 255 from the jerk.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Stefan Botev, who snatched 200 and jerked 250 for a
combined total of 450, finished third on the closing day of the
weightlifting tournament.
</P>
<P>
After the snatch, it seemed that Botev, who enjoyed lighter
bodyweight against other medal contenders, would win an Olympic
weightlifting gold for his new country. The lifter, who moved
from Bulgaria to Australia, beat Weller and Chemerkin to the
second and third in the snatch.
</P>
<P>
In the clean and jerk, both Weller and Chemerkin hoisted the
world record to a new high in their third attempts.
</P>
<P>
After Weller jerked 255 kilograms to beat the previous world
mark by 1.5 kilograms, Chemerkin went ahead to hoist 260
kilograms, five kilograms more than Weller's lift.
</P>
<P>
Two-times Olympic champion Kurlovich, who had 195 in the snatch
and 230 in the jerk, only finished fifth. The Belarussian, who
was tested positive during a German competition, missed the last
world championships in China.
</P>
<P>
When Chemerkin noticed in the backstage that Weller jerked
255kg, he just added five kilograms. "I know I have to lift that
weight," he said. "But if there is somebody who can lift 260, I
might try more."
</P>
<P>
"The only thing for me here is to win," he added. "And I will
continue my training in weightlifting, for another gold in
Sydney."
</P>
<P>
After ten days of competition, China, Turkey, Greece and Russia
each took two gold medals in the final team standings. Cuba and
Ukraine each had one.

<HEADLINE> Earth Quake Hits Island of Luzon, Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- An earth quake rocked the main
island of Luzon, northern Philippines, early Wednesday morning,
and slight damages are expected in areas around its epicenter, the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the institute told Xinhua that the epicenter of
the quake measuring 5.8 on Richter scale is Floida Blanca near the
provinces of Pampanga, Bataan and Zambales, about 60 km north of
Manila.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen aftershocks have been registered since the major one,
which hit at 01:38 a.m. the cities of Olongapo, Angeles, Baguio,
Tagaytay and Manila, he said.
</P>
<P>
Emergency monitoring teams were sent to the affected areas to
check reports of quake-induced cracks in buildings and other
structures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leonardo Roman, governor of Bataan province, said that the
earth quake caused a 150-meter crack in a dike in the village of
Tukop in the town of Dinalupihan.
</P>
<P>
He said that he already ordered evacuation of people who will
be immediately affected by the expected collapse of the Tukop
dike.
</P>
<P>
Roman said that the inevitable collapse of the Tukop dike would
induce main rivers to overflow and cause major floods in
Dinalupihan and nearby areas.

<HEADLINE> Slovenian Medved Qualified for Men's Individual Top Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Slovenia's Samo Medved scored one
of his career's most impressive victory as he beat world number
two Jari Lipponen of Finland in an unbelievable way at the Olympic
men's individual archery event here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Medved won the extraordinary second round shoot-out over the
Finnish with his fourth extra arrow. The two earlier tied on 161
points.
</P>
<P>
They each twice scored a nine with their initial shots from 70
metres, which brought the contest into a third extra arrow decided on
a closest-to-the bull basis.
</P>
<P>
And both Medved and Lipponen scored perfect 10s which measured
an identical three centimeters from the centre of the bullseye.
</P>
<P>
And the issue was decided only when the archers reached into
their quivers a fourth time and Medved scored a nine to his
opponent's eight.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old from Ljubljana was ranked joint 99th in the
world.
</P>
<P>
His opponent was left to reflect on the fickle nature of
Olympic sport, having registed the highest score of the opening
round with 168 from his allotted 18 arrows.
</P>
<P>
There was no repeat Games joy for 1992 champion Sebastien Flute
of France, who was beaten 161-158 by world number one Martinus
Grov of Norway in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The pair were level halfway through the match, but Grov pulled
away and later beat China's Tang Hua to advance to the last 16 on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among other qualifiers were Jose Anchondo of Mexico, who beat
Raul Kivilo of Estonia 158-157. He went on to win over then beat
18-arrow world record holder Vadim Chikarev of Kazakhstan by two
points in the second round.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian and German weightlifters
Andrey Chemerkin and Ronny Weller came to the limelight when they
put up record-breaking performances in the over-180kg
weightlifting competition of the 26th Olympic Games here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The German strongman jerked 255kg to smash the old world mark
of 235.5kg set by Chemerkin in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, the Russian came forward and lifted 260kg
to rewrite the record and make it his own again.
</P>
<P>
The gold medal in this event was won by the Russian on a
two-lift total of 457.5 kilograms, which equalled the existing
world mark held by Aleksandr Kurlovich.
</P>
<P>
So far, half of the 30 weightlifting world records have been
improved upon in the current Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Of the seven gold medals awarded today, mountain bike racing
which made its debut in the current Olympics drew big crowds into
the Georgia International Horse Park. Holland's Bart Jan Brentjens
won the men's 47.7km event while Italy's Paola Pezzo rode over a
31.8km course of rough terrain in one hour 50 minutes and 51
seconds to claim the gold.
</P>
<P>
Kazakistan's Aleksandr Parygin collected a total of 5,551
points to emerge first in the men's modern pentathlon which
includes 10m pistol shooting, one-touch epee fencing, 300m
freestyle swimming, horse riding and jumping and 4,000m running.
</P>
<P>
A Brazilian pair emerged on top in the Tornado yachting event
while a Chinese duo defeated their compatriots to take the table
tennis men's doubles title.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's last gold medal was won by the United States when its
softball team defeated China 3-0 in the gold-medal final match.
</P>
<P>
Of the 271 golds on offer in the current Games, 170 have been
awarded with the United States and Russia taking 25 and 19

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- China's world runner-up Liu
Guoliang nipped Canadian Johnny Huang in four sets to reach the
men's singles semi-finals at the Olympic table tennis tournament
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old, who combined with world number one Kong
Linghui to take the men's doubles gold medal three hours ago, beat
the Canadian 9-21, 21-19, 21-16, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
Liu, sixth-ranked penholder, didn't get used to Huang's fast
attacks from both sides and lost the first set in less than 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
But Huang's momentum ended here as Liu put up more aggressive
game to win three sets in a row.
</P>
<P>
"Huang is really difficult to cope with," Liu said. "If I had
lost nerves in the second set, the game would have been over for
me."
</P>
<P>
Huang produced the biggest upset in the tournament as he beat
defending champion Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Liu is to take on the winner of the match between German Jorg
Rosskopf and South Korean Kim Taek-Soo.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Dominates Mubarak-Clinton Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian president stressed
on Tuesday that the "first and foremost" thing to maintain
momentum for the Middle East peace process is to abide by the
land-for-peace formula, and any activities against it should be
terminated.
</P>
<P>
Hosni Mubarak made the unequivocal statement at a joint news
conference with U.S President Bill Clinton following their White
House consultations, in which the Middle East peace was a
dominating issue, on his third day of visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"A just and fair peace must be based on formula, which was
proposed by the co-sponsors of the Madrid peace conference of
October 1991 and accepted by all parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Activities which are inconsistent with the requirements and
spirit of peace, such as settlement activities and the
confiscation of lands, should be terminated," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak warned Israel's Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who
replaced moderate Labour leader Shimon Peres after a narrow
victory in the May election, that risks could be involved if the
peace process is terminated or set back.
</P>
<P>
"We are all quite aware of the risks involved if the peace
process is terminated or set back. No party would benefit from
this prospect," said the Egyptian president, who met Netanyahu in
Cairo before leaving for Washington.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is in Washington to press the United States to continue
what he called "its essential role" in the Middle East peace
process, which the Arab world is uneasy to be reversed with
inertia on the side of the Clinton administration towards
Netanyahu's controversial policies.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, whose talks earlier this month with Netanyahu in
Washington resulted in nothing positive with regard to the peace
process, adviced people to be "a little patient" before he had a
"chance to put Israel back on track".
</P>
<P>
He told the joint press conference that "a slowdown period was
inevitable because of the (Israeli) election".
</P>
<P>
"I know it's frustrating, but we just have to let a little of
that time elapse," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the Clinton administration would
rather keep the situations as it is in the Middle East than to
prod Israel to make any compromises, fearing that it might provoke
Jewish-Americans, who support whatever government elected in
Israel, to turn their back to the U.S. incumbent president in the
upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
In answering the question of world-wide anti-terrorist
activities, proposed by President Clinton, Mubarak made it clear
that only peace can solve the the problem, not vice versa as
Netanyahu emphasized during his visit to Washington when he said
only security could yield peace.
</P>
<P>
"If we could maintain peace, if we could reach a comprehensive
settlement in this critical part of the world... I think we could
put an end to at least 95 percent of the terroristic actions in
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is also disagreement between Clinton and Mubarak in
sanctions against countries which the United States deems as
"terrorist" nations or at least the bases for terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to form a committee... to find out how could we
punish not the whole people of a country but to punish the group
who's responsible about terrorism in any country in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Because if we are going to punish the whole country in any
place because of terrorism, the people will get upset, get
furious... Just punishing the whole people create terrible
problems," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Makoto Imaoka's two-run homer
Tuesday clinched a 12-1 victory over Italy and sent Japan into the
medal round of the Olympic baseball tournament.
</P>
<P>
Japan, with a record of four wins and three defeats, will play
the United States (6-1) in its first medal-round game Thursday.
The United States won their round-robin meeting 15-5.
</P>
<P>
Cuba (7-0) will play Nicaragua (4-3) in the other first-round
game. The winners will play for the gold Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Italy (2-5) would have clinched the berth by beating Japan, but
couldn't get much offense. The Italians managed just six hit in
eight innings off three Japanese pitchers.
</P>
<P>
Imaoka's RBI double put Japan ahead 3-0 in the second, and
Yoshitomo Tani tripled home a run in the fourth. Japan took
control with three more runs in the fifth, which included Hideaki
Okubo's solo homer and another run-scoring double by Imaoka.
</P>
<P>
Imaoka's two-run homer with one out in the bottom of the eighth
inning invoked the 10-run rule.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A late goal from Chang Eun-Jung
paced South Korea to sail across Germany on Tuesday for a hopeful
gold medal match of the women's Olympic hockey tournament.
</P>
<P>
Chang scored the winner from a penalty corner four minutes
before the end of the first half, her eight of the tournament
which levelled an Olympic record.
</P>
<P>
With its 1-0 victory, South Korea virtually secured its outing
to the final against Australia.
</P>
<P>
In the preliminaries, South Korea finished in a slate of 4-2-1
for 10 points, good enough for the second place behind leader
Australia that obtained the final berth on Sunday with five wins
and one draw for 11 points.
</P>
<P>
The only challenge that could blunder South Korea's outing will
come from the Netherlands that currently ranked third with one
game remained in late this evening.
</P>
<P>
However, the Netherlands that scored only eight points, can
only overtake South Korea on goal differential should they defeat
Australia by six goals.
</P>
<P>
Anything less will not be good enough to stop South Korea from
vying for the gold medal, and the Netherlands has to settle for a
bronze medal battle against Britain.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Receive Unequal Treatment Ahead of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Serbs in the Republika Srpska and
Serb Refugees are not treated equally with Muslims and Croats
ahead of Bosnia's September elections, Slobodan Kovac, member of
Bosnia's Temporary Electoral Commission, complained today.
</P>
<P>
"Serbs sheltering in third countries have to register with
embassies of the Muslim-Croat federation, while thousands of
Croatian Serbs expelled from the Republic of Serb Krajina who wish
to remain in the Republika Srpska are denied the right to vote,"
Tanjug news agency quoted Kovac, a judge of the Serb
constitutional court, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
which is in charge of Bosnia's elections, has rejected the Serbs'
request that all Serb refugees in third countries be enabled to
register elsewhere and not only in embassies of the Muslim-Croat
federation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kovac also stressed the issue arising from a request by Bosnian
Croats sheltering in Croatia who hold dual citizenship to be
allowed to vote in municipalities situated near the border with
the Republika Srpska.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian mountain biker Paolo Pezzo
upset world champion Alison Sydor of Canada to seize the gold
medal in the women's mountain bike cross country race at the 26th
Olympic Games here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Pezzo, 27, peddled home in one hour, 50 minutes and 51 seconds
in the 31.8 kilometers race. The women's mountain bike cross
country race is making its Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
Sydor, who won women's cross country race at World
Championships in 1994 and 1995, finished second in 1:51:58 to take
the silver. Susan MeMattei of the United States, silver medalist
at the 1994 world championships, was third in 1:52:36 for the
bronze.
</P>

Sydor led a group of six bikers to pull away from the field in the
first lap, but DeMattei took over the lead at the beginning of the
second in the three-lap race.
</P>
<P>
Pezzo, who crashed shortly after the start and walked her bike
on an upward slope, caught up with the leading group and broke
away from it half way into the second lap, leaving DeMattei and
Sydor chasing closely behind.
</P>
<P>
Pezzo expanded her lead to more than one minute at the
beginning of the third lap and led the rest of the way, cruising
to victory.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street rallied
near the close as signs of slowing economy were revealed in
several government reports today that held out hope for modest
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 47.34 to 5,481.93, after
slipping into negative territory several times in the session.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-8 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with volume reaching 337.30 million
shares, up from 281.35 million in the previous light session.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.26 to 1,068.73, and other
major stock indexes also rose.
</P>
<P>
It is reported in the afternoon that retail sales fell from
June's levels in the first three weeks of July.
</P>
<P>
The news sent long-term interest rates lower. The yield on the
30-year Treasury bond fell to nearly 7.03 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government reported that employment costs -- a key element
of inflation -- increased 0.8 percent in the second quarter,
slightly less than expected.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department, meanwhile, reported that sales of new
homes slipped more than expected in June.
</P>
<P>
And even though the employment cost index fell within range of
expectations, many analysts still expect Federal Reserve policy
makers to boost short-term interest rates at their Aug. 20 meeting
to insure slower economic growth and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
A private research group reported that consumer confidence
jumped in July to the highest level in six years. The report is
closely watched for the first signs of changed spending patterns by
consumers, who account for the bulk of economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Railway Links Sarajevo to Adriatic Coast Re-opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 30 (Xinhua) - A vital railway linking the
Bosnian inland with the Adriatic sea was in service again on
Tuesday after more than three years of disruption caused by the
country's ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
To mark the occasion, a train left Sarajevo railway station
this morning for Ploce, an Adriatic port on the Croatian coast,
with 250 passengers aboard including President Alija Izetbegovic,
other senior Bosnian officials and international representatives.
</P>
<P>
"Today Bosnia goes out to the sea and into the wide world,"
Izetbegovic said in an emotional speech before the departure.
</P>
<P>
The 190-kilometer railway from Sarajevo to Ploce via the
southern Bosnian city of Mostar was restored with aid from the
European countries, Saudi Arabia as well as neighboring Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The European Union contributed more than 6.7 million Ecus (8.7
million US dollars) in cash and equipment for repairs to the line,
while Germany helped reconstruct two bridges outside Mostar which
was blown up during fightings between Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
Although Bosnia has a short section of coast at the town of
Neum, it is not viable for maritime transportation for which
Bosnia had to rely on Ploce even before the war.

<HEADLINE> Prime Suspect Rumored as Security Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A security personnel was reported
as the prime suspect for the bomb explosion at the Centennial
Olymic Park on Saturday that claimed two fatalities and injuried
112 people.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard of that in the conversation with you and others,"
said A.D. Frazier, chief operating officer of the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"But maybe it is another rumor," Frazier was quick to add.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this person in question is contracted by us," he
said, adding that among the security personnel at the Park were
those provided by the tenants.
</P>
<P>
For the Olympic Games, the ACOG has accreditated some 6,000
security personnel "through background information checks".
</P>
<P>
"However, the Park is a public place not a competition venue"
which provides open access to the public, said Frazier.
</P>
<P>
In the wee hours of Saturday, a home-made crude pipe bomb with
nails and screws attached, exploded before the arrival of a bomb
disposable squad from the Atlanta Police Office, claiming two
lives including a Turkish TV cameraman who was died of heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
Among the injuried, 97 were Americans and two Britons.
</P>
<P>
Those 16 remained in hospitals but in stable condition "are
expected to be released soon", said Frazier.
</P>
<P>
After the tragedy, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
dispatched its agents to the spot and concerned authorities sealed
off the Park for three days till Tuesday morning when it was
re-opened to the public with random bag check taken as additional
security measure.
</P>
<P>
Beverly Harvard, Chief of Police in Atlanta, said early that a
911 caller, among a dozen of bomb calls, said "a bomb will explode
in the park in 30 minutes" without specific information on its
location.
</P>
<P>
Woody Johnson, the chief FBI agent, said the caller was "a
white male with indistinguishable accent" who made the call in the
Days Inn hotel, two blocks away from the Park.
</P>
<P>
And they have flown the bomb fragments, the phone to the FBI
headquarters in Washington D.C. for revaluation, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
So far, neither the law-enforcement forces here nor the FBI was
ready to confirm the report concerning the prime suspect.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Park Reopens 3-Day After Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park
reopened today, three days after a bomb blast in the park that led
to two people dead and more than 100 injured.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of thousands, many in sombre mood, waited outside
before the opening and then filed quietly in through tightly
controlled checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
The park was closed after the bomb blast on Saturday for
investigation. Police, FBI agents and forensic experts handed the
park back to Olympic organizers after they had completed a search
for clues.
</P>
<P>
Security measures have been redoubled in the park. Police,
soldiers, plain clothes officers and explosives-sniffing dogs
patrolled the area.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell and his family were among the first
visitors. He told CNN in the park he had come back for the opening
as "a tangible symbol of my commitment to these Games continuing."
</P>
<P>
"People understand that if you do otherwise in responding to
terrorism, you allow those who have committed these heinous acts
to be victorious and we will never do that," said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
Former Atlanta mayor Andrew Young, who co-chairs the Games
organizing committee, was due to lead a memorial service at the
park later today.
</P>
<P>
Investigation is continuing, but investigators believe a white
American male was the prime suspect. He made a warning call about
the bomb from a nearby public phone shotly before the bomb
blasted.

<HEADLINE> Canada Fines U.S. Drug Maker for Excessive Pricing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A federal regulator of Canada has
slapped 2.4 million Canadian dollars in penalties on a U.S. drug
maker for overcharging a patented medicine used to treat children
with respiratory infections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling from the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board
against California-based ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. marks the first
time in its nine-year history that the board has used its full
powers against a pharmaceutical company, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The board ordered ICN to pay immediately 1.2 million Canadian
dollars (one Canadian dollar equal to 0.73 US dollars), an amount
equal to estimated unwarranted profits ICN earned by selling the
drug for excessive price since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling, ICN must also drop the price of the drug,
called Virazole, to 200 dollars a vial from the current price of
1,540 dollars in the next three years, which will cost it an
additional 1.2 million dollars in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
After 1999, ICN must comply with the board's regulated price
for Virazole, which is around 400 dollars a vial.
</P>
<P>
ICN is appealing the ruling, which was made yesterday. It
argued that the board has no jurisdiction over Virazole and that
the patent on the drug has expired, making it exempt from the
patent law.
</P>
<P>
The board contended that while an initial patent has expired,
other patents still prevent rival versions of the drug from coming
on the market.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, drugs that are no longer under patent aren't
regulated by the board because they are subject to competition
from other drug makers.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1987, the board reviews the price of drugs twice
a year in order to ensure that companies don't increase prices
beyond the consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
ICN increased the price of Virazole by 83 percent to 750
dollars a vial in 1994. It raised the price up to 1,540 a vial a
year later, saying the price increases were intended to bring the
Canadian price of Virazole in line with the U.S. price.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Jurors Report Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Federal jurors said Tuesday
they were deadlocked in the Whitewater trial of two Arkansas
bankers accused of illegally using their bank funds to promote
Bill Clinton's political career, but the judge sent them back for
more deliberations.
</P>
<P>
"We as a jury have come to the conclusion we are locked, and we
are seeking advice of your honor," the jury in the trial of Herby
Branscum Jr. and Robert M. Hill said in a note to U.S. District
Judge Susan Webber Wright, according to media reports from
Little Rock, Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
The judge then summoned the jury into the courtroom and reread
them an instruction asking them to do everything possible to reach
a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Before the jury was summoned, defense attorney Dan Guthrie told
the judge: "If they say they are hopelessly deadlocked, we should
declare a mistrial."
</P>
<P>
Deliberations began Thursday afternoon in the six-week trial
and continued all day Friday and a full day on Monday. Today was
their fourth.
</P>
<P>
Branscum and Hill are charged with misapplication of bank funds
and conspiring to use money from their Perry County Bank to pay
for political contributions to Clinton and others.
</P>
<P>
They also are accused of concealing 52,500 dollars in cash
withdrawals by Clinton's 1990 gubernatorial campaign from the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
The government contends the two were motivated to break the law
by a desire for political power. The bankers say they were already
politically connected and had no need to ingratiate themselves
with Clinton or other candidates.
</P>
<P>
They claim money they received from the Perry County Bank
around the time of their political donations reimbursed them for
legitimate business expenses.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Takes on Croatia in Olympic Basketball Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Olympic basketball silver medal
favorites Yugoslavia and Lituania will meet in the semifinals
Thursday after the two teams won their qurterfinals games with
ease here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania trounced Greece 99-66 after roaring to a 45-19
half-time lead. The Lithuanians opened the game with a 16-2 lead
with all five starters contributing.
</P>
<P>
Sarunas Marciulionis led the Lithuanians with 16 points while
Rimas Kurtinaitis and Arturas Karnisovas each added 15 points.
</P>
<P>
The Greeks were headed by Giorgos Sigalas with 18 points, and
no other players finished in double figures.
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of problems today," said Greek forward Efthimis
Rentzias, who was drafted by the NBA Denver Nuggets earlier in
June.
</P>
<P>
"Our defense was not strong and we weren't very aggressive in
our offense. So I can't say that Lithuania is a better team than
us; we just didn't play well today," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's second quarterfinaL, Group A winner Yugoslavia
overwhelmed Gruop A fourth placer China 128-61. The 67 winning
margin is the biggest since the basketball tournament started on
July 20.
</P>
<P>
"It's a record for us to enter the first eight in the Olympic
Games," Chinese head coach Gong Luming said. "Everyone was
complacent because of this and they didn't play well."
</P>
<P>
China will face Greece Thursday in the play-off with the winner
entering the 5th to 6th places.
</P>
<P>
Yugolavia will face its toughest rival Lithurania in the
Olympic Games in the semifinals Thursday but team captain Zarko
Paspalj thought it will be a difficult game because Yugoslavia
headed into the semifinals without so much competitive games.
</P>
<P>
"We were nervous in our first Olympic game against Greece and
the competition format does not give us the opportunity to prepare
for a good team although in the group you won by 30,40 or 50
points," said Paspalj.
</P>
<P>
"You don't know what you really do against an equal opponent.
It is good that we know Lithuania is the same as we are. And it'll
be a very hard game," he added.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Conscription Bill Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Greek defense ministry today
unveiled a draft law on conscription aimed at solving the shortage
of military personnel caused by the country's demographic problem.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Gerassimos Arsenis said that the bill would
be tabled in parliament for voting by the Summer session in
September.
</P>
<P>
The bill lowers the age for compulsory military service from
the current 20 years to 19 years, while enabling the national
defense minister to revise the age limit according to requirements.
</P>
<P>
It also provides incentives in the form of reduced service for
young men who do not exercise their right to postpone their
enlistment
</P>
<P>
The ministry's target is to eventually establish a 12-month term
of service plus two or three Summers.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, Arsenis said, postponements will be granted for
studies, including post-graduate studies, up until the age of 28,
after which no further postponement will be given.
</P>
<P>
According to ministry figures, 40 percent of young Greek men
begin their military service immediately upon reaching the required
age, while 30-35 percent postpone it, in order to study, until
they reach 25 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, conscientious objectors will be able to complete
their military service in unarmed roles, although no provision
has been made for alternative service for this category. The issue
of alternative service for conscientious objectors is expected to
be examined within the framework of discussions on the revision
of the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Smith Urges Reconciliation in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Commander of the NATO-led
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia, U.S. Admiral Leighton
Smith, today urged the leaders of the three ethnic groups to work
hard for reconciliation among the local people in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing IFOR commander, before flying out of Sarajevo to
end his seven-month mission in Bosnia, said that political leaders
in Bosnia who fail to urge their peoples to reconciliate run the
risk of being responsible for renewed fighting in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that politicians on all three sides in Bosnia --
Serbs, Muslims and Croats -- may use upcoming elections in Bosnia,
scheduled for September 14, for deepening existing divisions,
according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Smith told reporters that there was no peace in Bosnia but an
absence of war.
</P>
<P>
Smith, who was flying for NATO's Southern Command base in
Naples, will be replaced by U.S. Admiral Joseph Lopez.
</P>
<P>
Under Smith's command, IFOR has achieved remarkable progress in
keeping peace in Bosnia and almost fully implemented the military
aspect of the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Smith also called for the extradition to the Hague criminal
tribunal of Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief
Ratko Mladic, both have been indicted for war criminals. The
Bosnian Serbs would suffer as long as Karadzic and Mladic were
free, he added.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic resigned as Serb republic president and chairman of
the Serb ruling Serbian Democratic Party on July 19 under strong
international pressure. But Mladic still remains the commander of
the Serb army.
</P>
<P>
"The entire Serb population is basically getting a bad rap
because they are being painted with that black tar brush saying
they are guilty. But they are not," he said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Backs Estonia's 1996-97 Economic Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) today approved a 13-month stand-by credit of equivalent 20
million U.S. dollars in support of the Estonian Government's
1996-97 economic program.
</P>
<P>
The economic and financial program for 1996-97, which is
financed by the new stand-by credit, seeks to enhance the economic
recovery while preserving macroeconomic stabilization in the
country. The program is targeted at real GDP growth of 3.1 percent
in 1996 and 4.4 percent in 1997, reducing inflation to 27.1
percent in 1996 and 21 percent in 1997. The program also aims at
containing the external current account at 6.9 percent of GDP this
year and 5.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Estonia joined the IMF in May 1992. Its quota is about 68
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF financing currently
totals about 86 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic Rules out Integration with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 30 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb acting President
Biljana Plavsic today excluded the possibility of an integration
association of the Serb entity in Bosnia-Herzegovina with the
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
"An integration would create a latent danger of a new genocide
of the Serb people," Plavsic said during a meeting with
politicians and businessmen from Prijedor, a Serb town in
northwest Bosnia, according to Tanjug news agency report from
Prijedor.
</P>
<P>
The bloody Bosnian civil war started in April 1992 because the
Serbs, who accounted for one-third of the population in Bosnia,
opposed the independent bid of the Muslims and Croat in the
country, fearing possible discrimination as minority after Bosnia
broke away from the former Yugoslavia. The Serbs' final goal is to
separate from Bosnia to merge with neighboring Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace agreement signed in December of last
year, Bosnia is preserved to be a single state with two equal
entities -- Republika Srpska and Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said that integration aspirations were fomented by
foreign influence in an attempt to weaken the national feelings of
the Serb people in Serb entity Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Any Serb party which treasures national interests cannot uphold
such aspirations, said Plavsic, who assumed full presidential
duties this month when Serb President Radovan Karadzic formerly
resigned two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the first post-war elections scheduled in
September in Bosnia, Plavsic said that it was necessary to
strengthen the national front of the Serb people whose victory at
the September elections would mean a final recognition of the
Republika Srpska's statehood.
