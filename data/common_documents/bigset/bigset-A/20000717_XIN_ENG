<HEADLINE> Zambia Strives to Restore Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's key objectives for this
year will be to restore economic growth, further reduce inflation
and poverty, reform economy through strengthening expenditure
controls, improve the delivery of social services, and continue
privatizing the remaining state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance Minister Katele Kalumba told the 12th
Consultative Group (CG) meeting beginning on Sunday that his
country's economy is projected to grow by 4 percent this year
premised on a strong recovery of the mining industry and continued
improvement in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting ever first held in the country that
expected improvements in economic conditions, coupled with
tightened monetary policies, are expected to limit the inflation
to 19 percent by the end of this year compared with 20.6 percent
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia government has continued to encourage the
participation of the private sector in agriculture and will
continue encouraging the development of small and medium scale
mining industries, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to tourism, he said it is expected to increase the
earnings of foreign exchange and thus significantly contribute to
mobilizing resources for other development programs of the country.
</P>
<P>
Since the last Consultative Group meeting held in May in 1999,
Zambia continued to experience economic constraints due to the
problems including delay of the privatization of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
At the end of this March, the inflation reached 24 percent and
debt service payment, combined with lack of donor support, reduced
the free reserves, Kalumba said.
</P>
<P>
The ZCCM privatization that was finally completed on March 31
this year contributed significantly to improved market sentiment
and is expected to provide an opportunity for increased focus on
program implementation which will in turn lead to a revival in
economic activity and allow the government to effectively tackle
development and social objectives, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the CG meeting provides Zambia a platform to discuss
critical issues facing it and an opportunity for it to solicit for
development assistance from donors.
</P>
<P>
Attending the three-day meeting are representatives of the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union,
the U.N. agencies and a number of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Zambian government ministers and representatives of civil
societies are also attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Conduct Population Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will conduct the fourth
comprehensive census of its population and housing next month to
update the primary database for statistical information in order
to ensure equity in political representation and distribution of
resources and to monitor development in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has already requested the European Union
and a number of countries including the United Sates, Germany,
Japan, Britain, Canada, Sweden and Norway to support the various
activities of the census, according to a paper presented to the
12th Consultative Group meeting starting here on Sunday..
</P>
<P>
About 1 million U.S. dollars have been provided by the United
Nations Population Fund, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The census program is estimated to cost 64 billion Kwacha (
about 21 million U.S.dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of this amount, 2.7 million dollars has been secured from the
government and 2.6 million dollars from cooperation partners,
leaving a shortfall of 15.3 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall has led to the delay in some of the preparations
for the census, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Rescued Peacekeepers Arrived at U. N. Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- About 220 U. N. peacekeepers who
were rescued on Saturday have arrived at a U.N. base in Daru, an
eastern city of Sierra Leone, said a report reaching here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Major-General Vijay Jetley, commander of the
U.N. force, as saying in Daru that the peacekeepers were rescued
with all the weapons they had in their possession after being
confined in their camp in Kailahun, the stronghold of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
Backed by gunships, the U.N. mission in Sierra Leone, known as
Unamsil, Saturday launched a successful military operation to
release the confined U.N. peacekeepers, most of them being Indians,
in Kailahun.
</P>
<P>
Eleven military observers were airlifted to the capital
Freetown on Saturday after their release.
</P>
<P>
According to Jetley, the rescued peacekeepers met resistance by
the rebels when they traveled by road through the rebel-held
jungle to Daru, about 80 kilometers from Kailahun.
</P>
<P>
Five U.N. personnel were injured during the exchange of fire,
while heavy casualties were inflicted to the RUF rebels, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Allot 9 Billion Dollars for Redeveloping South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon intends to spend more than 9
billion U.S. dollars on an extensive rehabilitation program for the
southern areas that have just been liberated from Israeli
occupation, local reports said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The program covers sewage, water and power supply networks as
well as the construction of new schools, hospitals, roads and
sophisticated means of communication, Minister of Economy Nasser
Saidi announced Sunday at the opening of the National Conference on
Human Development in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which opened in the city of Tyre, near the
former Israeli occupied zone, was also attended by delegates who
are involved in the development of human resources, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
But the minister did not reveal how the government would try to
raise the money.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at encouraging southerners, who had left
their towns and villages, to return and invest, as private sector
investments are called for.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, human, social and economic resources in the
south are to be enhanced through providing medium- and short-term
loans in agricultural and social projects to the tune of 103
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The program also provides for paying adequate compensation for
the death and injury of resistance fighters and for repairs to any
damage caused to houses or properties during the Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Existing private businesses will be offered the opportunity to
delay the payment of their taxes for up to six years to enable them
to stay in business and compete.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, up to 8.2 million dollars is to be spent on clearing
the land mines, which were left behind by Israel in the south after
its troop withdrawal on May 24.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Leaders Urged to Help Reduce Poverty in Developing World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James D.
Wolfensohn on Monday appealed to leaders from the Group of Eight
member countries to ensure that the power of globalization is
harnessed to reduce poverty and disease worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In a letter dispatched to all eight leaders, Wolfensohn wrote
that the primary challenge confronting the international community
is to use the forces of the global economy to tackle poverty in
the poorest countries in the world, many of them in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"A world in which the rich get richer while the poorest
countries are left out can never be secure and stable," Wolfensohn
warned in letters sent to the leaders of Britain, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eight is to hold its annual summit July 21-23 in
Okinawa, Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Despite a relatively benign short-term economic outlook,
without further action the international development goals we have
set for ourselves will not be met," Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that debt relief for the world's poorest nations will be
on the agenda in Okinawa, he called for "speed and flexibility" in
efforts to ease debt burdens in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, nine nations, Benin, Bolivia,
Burkina Faso, Honduras, Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania
and Uganda, will have been approved for debt relief by the time of
the Okinawa summit. These countries will receive relief totalling
15 billion U.S. dollars under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
</P>
<P>
Of this total, the World Bank will contribute 4.5 billion
dollars, according to Wolfensohn, with the rest provided by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), regional development banks and
bilateral creditors.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that difficult decisions lie ahead for donor
nations in expanding the list of eligible countries, many of which
are poorly governed. To receive debt relief through HIPC a country
must adhere to IMF economic reforms and commit itself to a poverty
reduction strategy.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in his letter, Wolfensohn called for global
initiatives to combat communicable disease, particularly AIDS,
malaria and tuberculosis, and to make information technology
available to poor countries.

<HEADLINE> Witness Places Libyan Accused at Luqa Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A travel agent on
Monday testified at the Lockerbie trial that one of the Libyans
accused of bombing the Pan Am flight in December 1988 was at the
Maltese airport.
</P>
<P>
Travel agent Dennis Burke told the Scottish court on Dutch soil
that Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima was at the Luqa Airport in Malta in
1988.
</P>
<P>
"He is here," the travel agent told the court while pointing to
Fahima in the dock.
</P>
<P>
Burke said that Fahima worked for the Libyan Arab Airlines at
the airport in 1988 and that because the Libyan Arab Airlines
flights were often overbooked in the 1980s, the allocation of
spare seats depended on Fahima.
</P>
<P>
Fellow travel agent Nicholas Ciarlo also identified Fahima."He'
s the gentleman with the mustache and the gold-rimmed glasses," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Alan Turnbull showed the court a statement that
Ciarlo had made to police alleging that he had seen Fahima filling
out baggage tags at Luqa but Ciarlo told the court on Monday that
he could not recall seeing or telling the police what the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The defense team, hoping to cast doubt on the suggestion that
Fahima and co-accused Abdel Basset al-Megrahi had planted a
suitcase bomb on an Air Malta plane, said that security at the
Luqa airport was tight.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans are accused of having placed a bomb in a
suitcase that was then sent onto the Air Malta plane unaccompanied.
The suitcase was then tranferred onto the Pan Am Flight 103 in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The bomb caused a mid-air explosion over the Scottish town of
Lockerbie and the blast killed 259 people on board the New York-
bound airliner and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Fahima and al-Megrahi are charged with murder conspiracy,murder
and breach of international aircraft safety laws. Both denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial went underway on May 3 after almost 12
years of investigation and preparation.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Fully Backs U.N. Decision to Rescue Surrounded Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday adopted a presidential statement, voicing its "full support
" to stage a rescue operation to bring more than 200 U.N.
peacekeepers back to freedom after they were surrounded by the
rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) more than two months ago.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its full support for the
decision taken by the Secretary-General to mount a military
operation by UNAMSIL (the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone) to relieve
its surrounded peacekeepers and military observers at Kailahaun"
in eastern Sierra Leone, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council believes that the hostile stance taken
by the RUF towards UNAMSIL personnel at Kailahun had become
intolerable," the statement said. "It fully concurs with the
Secretary-General's assessment in this regard."
</P>
<P>
"It is firmly of the view that, after over two months' denial
of freedom of movement by the RUF, the exhaustion of intensive
diplomatic and political efforts, and the recent decision by the
RUF to impede the resupply to Kailahun, the Force Commander, under
these circumstances, had no choice but to take resolute action to
restore the security and freedom of movement of UNAMSIL personnel,
" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council believes that there is now a firm foundation on
which UNAMSIL can build as it continues to implement its mandate
and work towards a lasting peaceful settlement to the conflict in
Sierra Leone," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"While noting these positive developments, the Council
recognizes that there is still much to be done, and expresses its
full support to UNAMSIL in its efforts to implement its mandate,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that he hopes
that efforts can now be directed to resume the much-stalled peace
process in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here by the spokesman of Annan, said, "The
Secretary-General is gratified that the military operation to
bring to safety the UNAMSIL peacekeepers, who had been surrounded
for 2 and a half months by the RUF, has been completed
successfully."
</P>
<P>
Some 222 Indian peacekeepers were sprung from their camp in the
eastern rebel stronghold of Kailahun in a dawn operation on
Saturday, provoking rebels to attack the rescue convoy as it made
its way a U.N. base at Daru, 80 kilometers away. They killed one
peacekeeper and wounded six others.
</P>
<P>
The Indian unit had been surrounded since early May, as RUF
rebels flouted a 1999 peace accord in a dispute over disarmament,
taking more than 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage and threatening the
whole U.N. peace operation.
</P>
<P>
The force is now close to its authorized strength of 13,000,
making it the world's biggest U.N. peacekeeping force, and no
longer has any personnel immediately threatened by rebels.

<HEADLINE> Conference Vows to Crack Down on Conflict Diamonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTWERP, Belgium, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The diamond industry on
Monday vowed to crack down on the trade of conflict diamonds that
have aided the civil wars in African countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our industry stands absolutely resolved," said Itzak Forem,
president of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses, at the World
Diamond Conference that went underway here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 diamond traders and cutters from around the world
have gathered in this northern Belgian town and promised to pass a
tough resolution on curbing the United Nations-embargo busting
dealers.
</P>
<P>
The move followed the United Nations' embargoes on Angola and
Sierre Leone. Earlier this month, the United Nations imposed an
embargo on the export of Sierra Leone diamonds until the African
country could implement a certificate system to prevent the trade
in illegal diamonds to benefit the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed a similar sanction against Angola
last year in an effort to cut funding to UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
Recent investigations by pressure groups and the United Nations
reports have revealed how rebel groups fighting government troops
and one another in Angola and Sierra Leone have managed to
purchase arms with funds netted from sales of smuggled diamonds.
</P>
<P>
Lax controls at international markets have been blamed for
allowing conflict diamonds to continue to reach the markets,
though major diamond centers like Antwerp, Bombay of India and Tel
Aviv of Israel have worked out tougher rules on certifying the
origins of diamonds. These three centers have also threatened to
ban U.N. sanctions-busting dealers.
</P>
<P>
The South African diamond conglomerate, De Beers, said that it
was instructing its 125 major diamond buyers not to purchase gems
from African conflict zones. The conglomerate controls 60 percent
of the uncut diamond market of the world.
</P>
<P>
The global diamond business produces each year 6.8 billion U.S.
dollars from trades in diamonds which in turn generate a retail
diamond jewelry sales of around 56 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Antwerp is the world's largest diamond trading center, handling
some 80 percent of the world trade in raw diamonds and around 50
percent of the trade in polished gems.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela to Continue Open to Private Capital: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
said Monday his government will continue the energy sector's
opening process to private capital.
</P>
<P>
Chavez recently announced his going over of oil contracts the
former state company signed with private firms, above all of
foreign capital. He described how the new Bolivarist constitution,
approved last December, forces him to act this way in relation to
Venezuelan interest.
</P>
<P>
Chavez rejected giving the process the name of "petroleum
opening," which is how  the arrival of private capital in the oil
sector during the former government of Rafael Caldera (1994-1999)
was termed, and preferred to talk about the sector's exploitation
and development.
</P>
<P>
Chavez said that state oil company Venezuela Petroleums (PDVSA)
counts with a "very well established" plan for the coming 10 years
for national and international investments, "which we want to
privilege."
</P>
<P>
This plan will fundamentally be centered on the areas of gas
and petrochemicals. They  will deal hard in the coming two years,
he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Mayors Meet Counterparts from Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Mayors from European Union cities
Monday met their counterparts from Serbia to discuss possible
partnership to cope with the post-NATO air campaign economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting was designed to start up a city partnership
between EU and Serbian cities that the West considers to be
alienating from the Yugoslav government of President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, who led the NATO air strikes last year, told the
mayors that promoting civil society in Serbia means reinforcing
the principal engine for a democratic change.
</P>
<P>
"Developing a vibrant civil society is the key to the economic
and political development of the region," said Solana, who now
heads the European Union's common foreign and defense policy
office.
</P>
<P>
The assistance to municipalities of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia is one of the most important instruments for
strengthening the civil society, he added. "It is also crucial in
helping the western Balkan countries to come closer to the
European Union."
</P>
<P>
The former NATO chief described the meeting between EU and
Serbian mayors as an important day marking the fact that the
support for the civil society is at the top of the European Union
agenda for the western Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is organizing a summit with the western
Balkans in coming November.
</P>
<P>
France, that is now holding the rotating presidency of the 15-
nation bloc, proposed the summit held between the 15-nation bloc
and Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, the Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro and the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yet Britain, Austria and the Netherlands asked the French
presidency and other EU member states to consider extending
invitation to Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
They argued that these countries all have historic, geographic
and ethnic ties with the western Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
The summit was planned to be held at the Croatian tourist
resort of Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
Attending the one-day meeting were mayors from the EU cities of
Athens, Dortmund, Konstanz, Ancona, Boulogne-Billancourt, Suresnes,
Lille and Barcelona and mayors from the Serbian cities of Nis,
Novi Sad, Pancevo, Podgoriza, Gnjilane, Suva Reka and Leposavic.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Southeast Europe Stability
Pack Coordinator Bodo Hombach and United Nations special
representative in Kosovo Bernard Kouchner.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Says Turkish Planes Violate Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Defense Ministry spokesman
Andreas Charides said Turkish planes violated Cyprus' airspace on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus News Agency reported that an F16 warplane of the Turkish
Air Force, which entered from northern Cyprus, flew over the
Turkish Cypriot area of Nicosia and the eastern coast town of
Famagusta Monday morning before flying back about an hour later.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Turkish transport plane landed at Ercan airport in
the Turkish Cypriot village of Tympou near Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government frequently protests to the United Nations
of Turkish warplanes' violation of Cyprus' airspace, particularly
the Nicosia Flight Information Region, which includes the airspace
of the capital city and surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since July 1974 when
Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of the Mediterranean
island following a failed Athens-backed coup by supporters seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Since then Turkey has maintained some 35,000 troops in the north
of the island with the claimed aim of protecting the Turkish
Cypriot minority. In 1983 Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a
breakaway republic which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots has started their celebration activities for
the 26th anniversary of the 1974 Turkish invasion.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has returned from Geneva,
where he attended the first phase of the third round of U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus, to be present at the
celebration activities.
</P>
<P>
The third round of Cyprus peace talks, starting on July 5 in
Geneva, adjourned on July 12 and will resume on July 24.

<P>
ABU DHABI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Minutes endorsing a cooperation
agreement between United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Palestinian
Ministries of Information and Culture was signed here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
UAE's Foreign Minister Undersecretary Bin Saed and Palestinian
Ambassador Khalid Tawfiq Malak inked the minutes on the behalf of
their own government.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed between UAE's Minister of Information and
Culture Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan with his Palestinian

strengthening bilateral relations in information and cultural
fields. It was effective Monday.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Saed reaffirmed his country's
support for the Palestinians and urged Israel to implement the
signed agreements, according to the official WAM news agency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian envoy praised the UAE government and
people for their support for the Palestinian people in their
struggle to regain their legal rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates hopes
that the ongoing U.S.-hosted Camp David summit would result in
serving the Palestinian cause and the Middle East peace process,
said Saif Saeed bin Saed, undersecretary of the UAE Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Bin Saed made the remark in a statement released on Monday
through the Emirates News Agency (WAM), stressing that the UAE is
closely following the negotiations at Camp David, a U.S.
presidential resort near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and United States President Bill Clinton are holding a three-
way summit there aimed at resolving the final-status issues between
Israel and the Palestinians and reaching a final peace deal before
the target date of September.
</P>
<P>
The thorny final-status issues include the status of Jerusalem,
the fate of Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements, borders of
a future Palestinian state, water and security.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that Jerusalem, which is the holy city to the
Muslims, Christians and Judaists, is the core issue in the
negotiations. Israel claims the city as its "undivided and eternal
capital" while the Palestinians wants East Jerusalem as the capital
of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Bin Saed also reaffirmed the UAE's total support for the
Palestinians to regain all their legal rights and establish their
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
He then urged Israel to abide by its commitments and implement
the agreements it had signed with the Palestinians in accordance
with international resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Israel's non-commitment would threaten the
security and stability of the whole Middle East region.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hopes Efforts Can Be Directed to Resume Peace Process in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday said that he hopes that efforts can now be directed
to resume the much-stalled peace process in Sierra Leone after
more than 200 U.N. peacekeepers were rescued from more than two
months of siege by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (FUR) in
the West African country.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here by the spokesman of Annan, said, "The
Secretary-General is gratified that the military operation to
bring to safety the UNAMSIL (the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone)
peacekeepers, who had been surrounded for two and a half months by
the RUF, has been completed successfully."
</P>
<P>
"Now that this episode is behind us, the Secretary-General
hopes that all efforts can now be directed toward establishing
conditions conducive to a resumption of the peace process in
Sierra Leone and an early end to the prolonged suffering that the
people of Sierra Leone have had to endure," the statement said.
</P>

Some 222 Indian peacekeepers were sprung from their camp in the
eastern rebel stronghold of Kailahun in a dawn operation on
Saturday, provoking rebels to attack the rescue convoy as it made
its way to a U.N. base at Daru, 80 kilometers away. They killed

in the area at Pendembu on their route and inflicting heavy

<HEADLINE> U.S. Eases Export Control of Encryption Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has eased its
rules on exporting encryption products to the European Union and
other key trading partners in an effort to try to improve security
in cyberspace and promote e-commerce, the White House announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, U.S. companies no longer need a license
to export encryption products to any end user in the 15 nations of
the European Union as well as Australia, Norway, Czech Republic,
Hungary, Poland, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The new policy removes previous distinctions between government
and non-government end users, the White House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It allows U.S. exporters to ship their products without waiting
for a technical review or a 30-day delay to ship their products as
they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
U.S. high-technology companies, along with Internet and privacy
advocacy groups, have been pushing for changes to restrictive U.S.
rules for years, arguing that encryption was needed to protect the
security of communications and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
"The steps announced today continue our policy to serve the
full range of national interests: promote electronic commerce,
support law enforcement and national security, protect privacy,
and maintain U.S. industry leadership in security technologies."

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq
Aziz will visit Russia later July to cement bilateral ties, a local
TV report said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aziz will start the visit on July 25 and is expected to hold
talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Nikolai Khorotzeiv, special envoy of the Russian president,
visited Iraq in May and held talks with President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He also delivered to Saddam a letter from Putin, which touched
upon ways to develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Putin expressed Russia's stance to continue to
call for the lifting of the United Nations embargo imposed on Iraq
since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Defense Minister Sultan Hashem Ahmed visited Moscow in
April for talks on military relations with Russia, its main arms
supplier before the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told
his Iraqi counterpart that Russia is willing to restore military
cooperation "completely" with Iraq after the U.N. embargo is
lifted.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly called for lifting the sanctions on Iraq
and condemned the U.S. and British bombings of Iraqi territory
during their patrols of the two no-fly zones in north and south of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States-led Western allies imposed the no-fly zones
with the claimed aim to protect the Kurds in the north and the
Shiite Muslims in the south from the oppression of the Iraqi
government forces.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories Rise in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. businesses increased their
inventories by 0.8 percent in May from April's level to a
seasonally adjusted 1.18 trillion U.S. dollars, the fastest pace
since November, the Commerce Department reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
May's increase was twice as fast as the 0.4 percent gain many
analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business sales rose 1 percent to 895 billion dollars,
the biggest gain since March.
</P>
<P>
May's sales increase left the inventory-to-sales ratio at 1.32,
meaning it would take 1.32 months to exhaust inventories at the
May sales pace. The ratio also stood at 1.32 in April.
</P>
<P>
Also in April, inventories grew by 0.5 percent, slightly faster
than the government previously estimated, while sales fell by 0.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the last year to slow the economy and keep inflation under control.
Recent economic reports have suggested the Fed's rate increases
are working. Given that, some analysts believe odds are good that
the central bank won't raise rates at its August 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
In May, the biggest inventory gains were posted by retailers.
They boosted inventories by 1.4 percent to 382.3 billion dollars,
the biggest increase since January 1995. That followed a 0.3
percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
Wholesalers increased their inventories by 0.8 percent in May
to 319.8 billion dollars, down from a 0.9 percent rise the month
before. At factories, inventories rose by 0.2 percent to 478.7
billion dollars, down from a 0.4 percent gain in April.
</P>
<P>
On the sales front, factories led the way, boosting sales by 1.
9 percent to 380 billion dollars in May, following a 1.2 percent

dollars after a 0.3 percent increase in April. And, retailers'
sales grew by 0.3 percent to 267.9 billion dollars following a 0.5
percent decline.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Opens Debate on AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Monday held an open debate after its closed-door discussion on a
draft resolution on HIV/AIDS in another bid to raise the popular
awareness of the gravity of AIDS, the killing epidemic in today's
world.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council meeting began after the 13th
International AIDS Conference, with the theme of "breaking silence,
" ended in Durban, South Africa, Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, representatives of China and Russia, two permanent
members of the Security Council, did not inscribe to speak at the
debate, which is the second such debate after the Council meeting
on AIDS in January, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has claimed 18.8 million lives since the first
AIDS patient was diagnosed in 1981. Now almost 35 million people
are suffering from the disease, with the majority in developing
countries, the Sub-Saharan African in particular.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution intends to stress the need for
coordinated efforts of all relevant United Nations organizations
to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic in line with their respective
mandates and to assist, wherever possible, in global efforts
against the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The draft stresses that the HIV/AIDS pandemic, if unchecked,
may pose a risk to stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The current problem is that it is estimated that more than 90
percent of those who need HIV drugs have no access to them,
fueling the spread of the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, thousands of people living with the disease in
developed countries led relatively full and healthy lives because
they had access to medicine which suppressed the HIV and treated
opportunist infections.
</P>
<P>
But to buy anti-retroviral drugs at current prices for all
those who need them would cost 60 billion U.S. dollars a year,
making the anti-AIDS task too formidable for developing nations.

Marianne Engelhart and her colleagues at Erasmus Medical Center
in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, collected data between 1990 and
1993 on the dietary habits of 5,392 men and women aged 55 and over
who were free of dementia.
</P>
<P>
Study participants were reexamined in 1993-1994 and 1997-1999.
In addition, the cohort was continuously monitored for incident
dementia or mortality.
</P>
<P>
People who took part in the study completed questionnaires
about their dietary habits and were interviewed by dietitians.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that on average, people who remained free
from either form of dementia had consumed higher amounts of beta-
carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E and vegetables than those in the
study who developed Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
Engelhart and her colleagues also noted that family history of
the presence of a genetic marker called the ApoE4 allele did not
alter their findings. Presence of the ApoE4 allele is considered a
risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
World Alzheimer Congress started in Washington, D.C. on July 9
and will end on July 18.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The London and Frankfurt stock
exchanges have expressed hope of expanding their merger to include
America's Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
If the deal succeeds, it would create the first global
stockmarket, providing a unified trading platform for shares in
world giant firms.
</P>
<P>
"The parties ... intend to take substantial cross-shareholdings
in each other and will work together thereafter to explore a full
merger of interests to create a global exchange," the London and
Deutsche Bourse said Monday in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
When London and Frankfurt announced their merger plans two
months ago, they mooted an alliance with the Nasdaq to create a
global market for high-technology shares.
</P>
<P>
For now, the proposed new exchange, to be called iX,will be
headquartered in London, with blue chip stocks being traded there
and high growth and technology shares being traded from Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, their proposed merger will create
savings of around 50 million pounds a year for their members from
2002.
</P>
<P>
It is announced that meetings will be held on September 14 in
London and Frankfurt for shareholders to vote on the merger
proposal.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Sheep to Be Destroyed in U.S. for Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Some sheep imported by the United
States from Belgium will have to be destroyed because of possible
infection of a sheep equivalent of madcow disease.
</P>
<P>
The owners of three flocks of Belgian-imported sheep to produce
milk will have their animals destroyed after tests on four
slaughtered sheep showed presence of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy or BSE, according to local reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sheep in question came from an area of Belgium where the
madcow disease has been found.
</P>
<P>
The sheep, a breed called East Friesians, have been quarantined
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
The United States Department of Agriculture has ordered the
owners of the imported sheep to destroy the animals, 376 head in
total.
</P>
<P>
Though there has so far been no proven case of sheep infection
of the BSE in the world, sheep are susceptible to scrapie, a
disease similar to the madcow disease.
</P>
<P>
The BSE disease affected some 180,000 head of cattle in Britain
and has been linked to a similar disease in human beings known as
the Creutzfeldt-Jakobs disease.
</P>
<P>
About 50 people have died of the Creutzfeldt-Jakobs disease in
Britain after having eaten contaminated beef.
</P>
<P>
Belgium reported the confirmation of its first proven case of
BSE on October 31, 1997, and there are now 13 diseased cattle
reported from different regions of the country.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounds: 50 Years of development Cooperation By U.N. System  By Xie Meihua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 17 (Xinhua -- In celebration of the
anniversary of 50 years of U.N. development cooperation, the
Economic and Social Council(ECOSOC) on Monday is scheduled to
discuss the current look, the urgent actions required to promote
the U.N.'s efforts and the resources needed to sustain them.
</P>
<P>
The development cooperation activities of the United Nations
system originated fifty years ago, with resolutions by the General
Assembly and ECOSOC establishing an Expanded Programme of
Technical Assistance(EPTA).
</P>
<P>
Meeting at U.N. Headquarters in Lake Success, New York, in
June 1950, governments of 54 countries pledged some 20 million U.S.
dollars of voluntary contributions to finance the first eighteen
months of the programme. A Technical Assistance Board was set up,
as well as an ECOSOC Technical Assistance Committee.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, 55 governments had submitted some 265
requests for assistance. The U.N. Secretariat, International Labor
Organization, Food and Agriculture organization, U.N. Educational,
Scientifical and Cultural Organization, International Civil
Aviation Organization and World Health Organization launched
programs that provided advisory services, expert assistance,
fellowships and equipment. The International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund
also initiated projects.
</P>
<P>
Establishing EPTA was an early step toward achieving a basic
aim of the U.N. charter to promote social progress and better
standard of life. EPTA's initial focus on advisory services and
related training was augmented in 1959 by creation of the U.N.
Special Fund, which supported large-scale pre-investment projects.
The two programs were merged, leading to the establishment of the
U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) in 1965.
</P>
<P>
The 1960s and 1970s saw large-scale U.N. support for training
institutions in forestry, disease control, administrative
management, statistics, geology, water resources, and employment
and industrial skills.
</P>
<P>
By the 1980s, a wide range of programs were in place, and UNDP
and other U.N. agencies were helping governments to mobilize and
manage additional resources. During the latter part of the decade,
however, need also arose to help countries to contend with the
effects of economic adjustment policies.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990, social issues figured more prominently in the
wake of global conferences on education, children, human rights,
population, social development, and women. Further critical issues
were brought to the fore by conferences on environment, food,
trade and development, least-developed countries, small island
developing countries, natural disaster reduction and human
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Re-thinking of the U.N. system's role accelerated in the 1990s,
in the context of dwindling resources available and demands for
urgent action in countries experiencing violent conflicts or
natural disasters. U.N. agencies increasingly emphasized national
execution of projects, the "upstream" elements of programming and
coordination and expanded relations with civil society and the
business community.
</P>
<P>
At ECOSOC's year 2000 session, the overview of U.N.
development cooperation continues in the operational activities
segment. Promotion of international exchanges of technical
knowledge and skills and capacity-building now are seen as part of
the refocusing of the U.N.'s comparative advantage.
</P>
<P>
With increasing urgency, attention is being directed toward
the tremendous growth of information technology, its important
applications for development and the dangers posed by a widening
digital divide.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.'s policies have evolved apace with changing
requirements, but its underlying principles have remained the same:
neutrality, respect for sovereignty, long-term commitment and
responsiveness to national priorities.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, the United Nations is ever more aware that the success
of its development cooperation efforts stem, most importantly,
from the trust it has earned in partner countries and an ability
to strengthen national capabilities.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformist Journalist Sentenced to Prison Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A Tehran public court on Monday
sentenced Emadeddin Baqi, a prominent reformist journalist, to five
and a half years in prison, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was issued by Branch 1410 of the public court,
Baqi's attorney Masood Haeri told the agency.
</P>
<P>
Baqi, editor-in-chief of the now-banned reformist daily "Fath"
(Conquer), has been held under detention since May 29 on charges of
publishing articles questioning the validity of the Islamic law,
spreading falsehoods to divert public opinion, as well as libel and
insult.
</P>
<P>
The charges were lodged by different agencies controlled by the
conservative camp, including the Intelligence Ministry, the elite
Islamic Revolution Guards Corps and the Islamic Republic of Iran
Broadcasting (IRIB) responsible for radio and television.
</P>
<P>
Haeri said his client is going to be informed of the verdict on
Wednesday and details of the ruling would be made known to the
press later.
</P>
<P>
He said he would appeal to Tehran's appeal court before a
deadline in 20 days and call for re-examination of the case.
</P>
<P>
The powerful conservative camp has in recent months taken tough
measures to crack down on the reformists, closing down 18
publications and putting several journalists into prison.
</P>
<P>
Having lost control of the parliament in the February elections
to the reformists, the conservatives still dominate the important
state organs, such as the judiciary, the broadcasting network and
the military.

<HEADLINE> No Peace Agreement at Camp David by Wednesday: Israeli Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Speaker Avraham Burg said here on Monday that Israel and the
Palestinians can not reach a framework agreement on final-status
issues at Camp David by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More time is needed for the two sides to narrow their
differences on the major issues concerning the peace talks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Burg made the remarks on Israel Radio after holding a telephone
conversation with Prime Minister Ehud Barak who is leading the
Israeli delegation to the summit.
</P>
<P>
"From what I have heard from Barak, the two sides are very close
on some issues, but positions on Jerusalem and refugees are still
wide apart," Burg said, adding that it is impossible for the sides
to reach a framework agreement by Wednesday as had been reported by
some foreign press.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that United States President Bill
Clinton is pushing to wrap up the Camp David summit or to be able
to issue a declaration on its progress by the time he leaves for a
Group of Eight (G-8) economic summit in Japan on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that Clinton re-introduced bridging
proposals on all the major issues on Sunday and is waiting for
feedbacks from the Israeli and Palestinian sides on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the proposals, Clinton reportedly outlined the suggestions
for settling the major issues including Jerusalem, Palestinian
refugees, borders and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
"The next two days will show whether an agreement can be reached
within days or within a few weeks. President Clinton is keen to do
it within days," a Palestinian official in direct contact with the
negotiators said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-hosted three-way summit between Clinton, Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, which started last Tuesday, is
aimed at resolving the major final-status issues between Israel and
the Palestinians and reaching a framework agreement for a final
peace accord by September 13.

<HEADLINE> Syrian New President Vows to Seek Full Return of Occupied Land EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Bashar al-Assad was sworn in as
Syrian president in the Syrian parliament on Monday, vowing not to
abandon demand for a full return of the occupied land.
</P>
<P>
Bashar, elected Syrian president on July 11 following his
father's death, "we reaffirm here that we are in a hurry to make
peace but we are not willing to squander our land or our territory
and jeopardize our sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad died of a heart attack on June 10
after ruling the country for the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his late father's policy toward Syria's long-time
enemy Israel and calling for U.S. pressure on Israel to compromise,
Bashar said,"we call upon the United States to play its full role
as an honest broker and as a co-sponsor of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Israel wants to retain enough of the Golan Heights to have full
control of the entire Sea of Galilee, Israel's major water resource
-- a position firmly rejected by Syrian late president Hafez al-
Assad.
</P>
<P>
"We are longing for the return of the Golan," Bashar said. "
However long it takes this land is ours and it will return to us in
full. We are not ready to pay the price of the inability of Israeli
governments to take a decision for peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bashar's father made return of the Golan seized by Israel in the
1967 Mideast War the heart of his negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The liberation of our territory is at the top of our national
priorities and is as important to us as the achievement of the just
and comprehensive peace that we have adopted as our strategic
choice," Bashar said.
</P>
<P>
"I promise to perform my duty properly under these very
sensitive circumstances experienced by our homeland, Arab nation
and the world as a whole. I will do my utmost to lead the nation to
a bright future," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bashar also called upon all Syrian citizens to take part in the
process of development and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of accountability and interrogation
establishments in the coming stage, Bashar said any one who tries
to make a mistake should be brought to book.
</P>
<P>
He further bitingly blasted the absence of palpable and
articulate economic strategy in the past, which was the cause
behind Syria's current deteriorating economic situation.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Bashar, recalling Syria's efforts to promote
ties with other countries specially the Arab neighbors, reiterated
the need to revitalize the existing inter-Arab economic agreements
and pursue a "pan-Arab market" with the hope of developing healthy
inter-Arab relationships.
</P>
<P>
He said he was seeking a more vital role by the Arab League in
terms of correcting the inter-Arab relationships, stressing that
Syria supports any move to promote harmony and consensus among the
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Syria-Lebanon relationship as a" model for inter-Arab
ties," he said it still needed much efforts to grow to the level
expected by both countries. Syria is the major power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the Golan issue is a top national priority, Bashar
said "for us, liberating the Golan is equal in importance to the
just and durable peace that we adopted as a strategic option yet
not at the expense of our territorial integrity or national
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Territorial integrity and sovereignty were an issue of national
dignity that can not be bargained and is unnegotiable, he added.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and Syrian that resumed in December
1999 after a nearly 45-month break have been stalled since January.
</P>
<P>
The new Syrian president also called on U.S to shoulder a full-
fledgedly unbiased and fair role in the peace process to get the U.
N. resolutions on legitimate rights of Lebanese and Palestinian
peoples implemented.
</P>
<P>
He also called for an objective and non-influenced role in the
global issues by the United Nations while asking the developed
North to live up to its responsibilities towards the developing
South.
</P>
<P>
"We seek closer ties with all countries and organizations on
bases of mutual respect, cooperation and cherishing of people's
rights," he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani police Monday arrested
an Afghan figure and his four supporters in the northwestern city
of Peshawar for his anti-Taliban activities, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The arrest came after the ruling Taliban of Afghanistan
complained to the Pakistani authorities that Abdul Qahir is
engaged in activities against the Islamic militia, the News
Network International quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Qahir with an alias Shariati has recently launched a group "
Shura-e-Sulha Wa-Nijat" (Council for Reconciliation and
Deliverance). He said Monday his group will shortly control the
whole Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
However, Taliban's Acting Governor of eastern Nangarhar
province has dismissed Shariati's claim as baseless.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Decides to Abolish Bonded Labor System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government decided to
abolish with immediate effect the bonded labor system existing in
some part of the country as a quintessence of social inequality.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Land Reforms and Management Siddharaj Ojha
announced at the parliament that the cabinet meeting took a
decision Monday prohibiting anyone from employing any person as a
bonded laborer in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the constitutional and other legal provisions which
prohibit the practice of slavery as well as exploitation of
laborers in any form against one's will, bonded labor system has
been existing in some parts of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On line with the cabinet decision, all such bonded laborers
have been automatically freed from today," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ojha said that anyone going against the decision will be
punished and bonds signed for this purpose will be regarded null
and void.
</P>
<P>
"Since the bonded laborers are freed from today, they needn't
pay any due debts they owe to their masters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many farmers in Nepal's remote villages were forced into
bondage after borrowing money from landlords and were thus trapped
into a life of unrelieved poverty and exploitation. Unofficial
estimates put the number of bonded laborers at 40,000.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches Tourism Recovery Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Monday launched the tourism recovery plan aimed at restoring
international confidence in the country as a safe destination.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony in Harare, Chairman of the Recovery
Plan Task Force Steve Mangadze said 1.5 million U.S. dollars is
now available for implementing the plan.
</P>
<P>
He said strategies had been put in place to stop the slide, but
some recovery measures would require action that was beyond the
scope and capacity of the tourism industry alone.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry is the country's third biggest foreign
currency earner after agriculture and mining. Last year about 1.2
million tourists visited the country.
</P>
<P>
The recovery program is based on the large scale mobilization
of resources from within and outside the tourism industry, backed
by an international information campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said one of their strategies would be to positively
influence foreign missions in Harare as well as relevant
authorities in source market countries.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign tourists canceled their trip as a result of
violence ahead of the parliamentary elections last month.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn of Alzheimer's Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Alzheimer's disease is
increasing so fast that more than 22 million people worldwide will
be affected by 2025, experts warned at the ongoing World Alzheimer
Congress held in Chicago, Illinois.
</P>
<P>
With global population aging, humans have an imminent worldwide
epidemic and if no cure could be found, more than 22 million
people will have this disease in 25 years, warned Edward Truschke,
president of the Alzheimer's Association.
</P>
<P>
Worse, by 2050, 45 million people worldwide may have Alzheimer'
s, a toll rivaling cancer, said Robert Katzman of the University
of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's disease today afflicts about four million Americans
and eight million others. Scientists do not know what causes the
sticky brain deposits that inevitably kill neural cells until
memory disintegrates and ultimately the patient dies.
</P>
<P>
Lots of risks are under study. Certain genes make some families
vulnerable. Head injuries may increase risk; high blood pressure
is a new suspect.
</P>
<P>
But the biggest risk for Alzheimer's is simply age: Alzheimer's
cases double with every five years of age from 65 to 85. Currently,
one in 10 American people over the age of 65 and as many as half
those over 85 have Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
The White House Sunday said that U.S. federal researchers will
get an additional 50 million U.S. dollars over the next five years
for research into prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease,
including the potential for a vaccine.

against the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The draft stresses that the HIV/AIDS pandemic, if unchecked,
may pose a risk to stability and security.
</P>
<P>
The current problem is that it is estimated that more than 90
percent of those who need HIV drugs have no access to them,
fueling the spread of the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, thousands of people living with the disease in
developed countries led relatively full and healthy lives because
they had access to medicine which suppressed the HIV and treated
opportunist infections.
</P>
<P>
But to buy anti-retroviral drugs at current prices for all
those who need them would cost 60 billion U.S. dollars a year,
making the anti-AIDS task too formidable for developing nations.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Toll Rises to 11 in Alberta, Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A 30-year-old woman became the
latest victim of Friday's tornado in Alberta, Canada, to bring the
death toll to 11, the country's CBC Newsworld reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The woman died in Calgary's Foothills Hospital after being
transported from the stricken Green Acres vacation spot in Pine
Lake in central Alberta.
</P>
<P>
Officials have indicated that the list of victims could rise
even higher with several people in critical condition still
receiving intensive care.
</P>
<P>
So far, rescuers have not yet found any bodies from one side of
the lake to the other. About two dozen civilian and military
divers are expected to continue their search until Monday night
with the help of high-tech sonar equipment.
</P>
<P>
The devastating twister descended on the Alberta campground at
about 09:30 p.m. local time Friday at 300 kilometers an hour,
spinning one kilometer at its widest point to sweep along 27
kilometers across the lake.
</P>
<P>
Nobody exactly knew how many people there were in the large
campsite at the time, although the number is approximately put at
1,000.
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth deadliest tornado to hit the country since
1912, when a storm of swirling winds hit Regina, Suskatchewan,
killing 28 people and injuring hundreds of others.

<HEADLINE> Ten Warning Signs of Alzheimer's Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are 10 warning
signs of Alzheimer's disease listed by The United States Alzheimer
's Association:
</P>
<P>
-- Recent memory loss that affects job skills. It is normal to
occasionally forget an assignment, deadline, or a colleague's name,
but frequent forgetfulness or inexplicable confusion at home or in
the workplace may signal that something is wrong.
</P>
<P>
-- Difficulty performing familiar tasks. Busy people can get
distracted from time to time. For example, a person might leave
something on the stove too long or not remember to serve part of a
meal. People with Alzheimer's might prepare a meal and not only
forget to serve it but also forget they made it.
</P>
<P>
-- Problems with language. Everyone has trouble finding the
right word sometimes, but people with Alzheimer's may forget
simple words or substitute inappropriate words, making their
sentences incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
-- Disorientation as to time and place. It is normal to forget
the day of the week or what you need from the store. But people
with Alzheimer's can become lost on their own street, no knowing
where they are.
</P>
<P>
-- Poor or decreased judgment. Choosing not to bring a sweater
or coat along on a chilly night is a common mistake. A person with
Alzheimer's, however, may dress inappropriately in more noticeable
ways, wearing a bathrobe to the store or several blouses on a hot
day.
</P>
<P>
-- Problems with abstract thinking. Balancing a checkbook can
be challenging for many people, but for someone with Alzheimer's,
recognizing numbers or performing basic calculations may be
impossible.
</P>
<P>
-- Misplacing things. Everyone temporarily misplaces a wallet
or keys from time to time. A person with Alzheimer's disease may
put these and other items in inappropriate places, such as an iron
in a freezer or a wristwatch in the sugar bowl, then not recall
how they got there.
</P>
<P>
-- Changes in mood or behavior. Everyone experiences a broad
range of emotions; it is part of being human. People with
Alzheimer's tend to exhibit more rapid mood swings for no apparent
reason.
</P>
<P>
-- Changes in personality. People's personalities may change
somewhat as they age. But a person with Alzheimer's can change
dramatically, either suddenly or over a period of time. Someone
who is generally easygoing may become angry, suspicious, or
fearful.
</P>
<P>
-- Loss of initiative. It is normal to tire of housework,
business activities, or social obligations, but most people retain
or eventually regain their interest. People with Alzheimer's
disease may remain uninterested and uninvolved.

MOSCOW, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Alexander Popov
refused to visit Moscow before the Sydney Olympics after Russian
President Vladimir Putin called on all russian Olympians to

<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
arrived here tonight by special plane, kicking off his state visit
to China as guest of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
This is Putin's first visit to China since he assumed the
Russian presidency. Putin led a delegation to China in 1994, when
he was the first deputy mayor of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Wenchang, Chinese
Ambassador to Russia Wu Tao, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs
Igor Ivanov and Russian Ambassador to China Igor A. Rogachev

</P>
<P>
Aboard the same plane were Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya
Klebanov, Defense Minister Igor Dmitriyevich Sergeyev, Atomic
Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov and Power Minister Alexander Gavrin.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that Jiang will
hold talks with Putin tomorrow, during which the two heads of
state are expected to exchange views on furthering the Sino-
Russian strategic partnership of cooperation, and other major
global and regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Jiang conferred with Putin when they attended
the "Shanghai Five" summit meeting in Tajikistan's capital of
Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his visit, Putin told Chinese journalists in
Moscow that the aim of his China tour is to promote the
relationship between Russia and China in all fields. The two
countries already share a strategic partnership, and China is on
the top of the agenda of Russian foreign policies, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A block at Hong Kong's Pillar
Point Vietnamese Refugees Center, the world's last Vietnamese
refugee center, was razed to the ground on Monday, signifying the
formal end of the Vietnamese boat people saga here.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the center "not only marks the end of one of the
20th Century's greatest migration challenges, but also the
beginning of a new era for the Vietnamese in Hong Kong to build a
new life," said Secretary for Security Regina Ip at the closure
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
She thanked the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
governments of all donor and resettlement countries, various
international agencies and non-governmental organizations for
helping settle the Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
Immense efforts and resources have been given to the Vietnamese
boat people stranded in Hong Kong. More than 8.71 billion HK
dollars (1.11 billion U.S. dollars) have been spent to house and
feed them since 1979, said Ip.
</P>
<P>
Since the Hong Kong SAR government's announcement of a Widened
Local Resettlement Scheme (WLRS) in February, some 1,400 remaining
Vietnamese have been moving out of the camps and integrating into
the Hong Kong society, and the world's last Vietnamese refugee
center, the PPVRC, was formally closed last month.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Minister on Internet's Negative Consequences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has reminded the media
and communication scholars here of the negative consequences of
Internet which is rapidly linking the world and sucking enormous
energy from the society.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 22nd General Assembly and Scientific Conference
of the International Association for Media and Communication
Research (IAMCR) here Monday, Singapore Minister for Information
and the Arts, Lee Yock Suan, said that technological breakthroughs
are transforming the world and offering enormous potential for
growth. But, he stressed, they may also threaten society and the
individuals and pose troubling issues of ethics and morality.
</P>
<P>
"Individuals and societies have to decide what to do with the
information explosion, to navigate and seek out what they need and
protect themselves, if possible, from the misleading and the
harmful," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that businesses are busily reinventing
themselves to take advantage of the Internet or to protect
themselves from its negative consequences; and researchers and
designers are racing to find new application of digital technology.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the developments in the media industry, the
minister said that newspapers are holding their ground in the face
of competition from on-line rivals.
</P>
<P>
"Most readers are still more comfortable with the printed page
than staring at computer screens even though news on-line offers
the advantage of more frequent updates," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that television sets are dominating the homes
with larger sets and better picture and sound quality.
</P>
<P>
"With convergence of technology, digitization and the
increasing number of channels available, a critical element will
be the quality of content," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On ways to eliminate the negative consequences in moral and
ethnic aspect brought by new technologies, Lee said his government
has taken a pragmatic approach.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is ranked the 10th on the world list of internet
usage with about 60 percent of homes having computers and 40
percent having internet accounts.

<HEADLINE> Kiswahili Version of "Facts for Life" Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kiswahili version of the
handbook "Facts for Life" was launched here Monday with an aim to
disseminate the basic child health information among more families
in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The book, compiled by the United Nations Children's Fund (
UNICEF), World Health Organization and other two U.N. agencies,
was first published in 1989. Now the book has about 200 language
versions.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Minister of Information, Transport and Communication
Musalia Mudavadi officially launched "Kweli Za Malisha", the
version in Kenya's national language Kiswahili.
</P>
<P>
"The handbook bring together the child health messages that
every family in Kenya needs to know," said Mudavadi.
</P>
<P>
The translation from English to Kiswahili should be taken as a
first step and we should continue to translate the book to tribal
languages with local photographs that can foster a sense of
national ownership, Mudavadi noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister also urged journalists, religious leaders,
nongovernmental organizations, community-based organizations,
teachers, health workers and broadcasters to play a part in
spreading the messages contained in the book.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Education said that the
ministry will use the school networks to spread the knowledge in
the book "Kweli Za Maisha", which includes chapters such as Timing
births, Safe motherhood, Breast feeding, Child growth,
Immunization, Diarrhea, Coughs and colds, Hygiene, Malaria, AIDS
and Child development.
</P>
<P>
About 64 in every 1,000 children died before the age of one in
1990 in Kenya and now the figure reached 75. The proportion of
children who died before the age of five rose dramatically from 9.
8 percent in 1990 to 17 percent currently.
</P>
<P>
"Things are moving backward in terms of child heath in Kenya,"
said Jane Muita, UNICEF Technical Officer on HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF representative in Kenya Nickolas Alipui also noted at
the launching ceremony that a partnership related to the "
liberation war" on the diseases which affect Kenya was essential
to protect the children's health.
</P>
<P>
Only one agency or one government office can not accomplish the
task to protect the children from diseases and the partnership
should be extended to local community, he said.

<HEADLINE> World Diamond Conference Demands End to Trade in Conflict Gems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTWERP, Belgium, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The biannual World
Diamond Conference opened here on Monday with various sides
calling for halting the trade in conflict diamonds that funds
rebel wars in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The International Diamond Manufacturers Association (IDMA)
called for global registration of exports to stop the trade in
conflict diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The IDMA, which represents the 10 leading diamond manufacturing
centers of the world, outlined a nine-step program to certify
legal diamonds on an international basis.
</P>
<P>
The association said that the implementation of its proposal
would cut off the flow of illegal diamond exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pressure groups were hoping that stricter rules
would be introduced at the World Diamond Conference to stop
trading conflict diamonds.
</P>
<P>
These groups were running a side show at the biannual world
conference that went underway here on Monday by calling stricter
new controls on the conflict diamonds that have been trafficked by
rebel groups in Angola, Sierra Leone and other war-torn African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Global Witness, a London-based pressure group, wanted the
Antwerp conference to agree on an international certification
system to ensure that all diamonds can be traced to their origins
where they are mined.
</P>
<P>
Recent investigations by pressure groups and the United Nations
reports have revealed how rebel groups fighting government troops
in Angola and Sierra Leone have managed to purchase arms with
funds netted from sales of smuggled diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, therefore, has imposed embargoes on
diamonds from Angola and Sierra Leone unless the diamonds are
certified by government agencies.
</P>
<P>
But lax controls at international markets have been blamed for
allowing conflict diamonds to continue to reach the markets,
though major diamond centers like Antwerp, Bombay of India and Tel
Aviv of Israel have worked out tougher rules on certifying the
origins of diamonds. The three centers have also threatened to ban
U.N. sanctions-busting dealers.
</P>
<P>
The South African diamond conglomerate, De Beers, said that it
was instructing its major diamond buyers not to purchase gems from
African conflict zones. The conglomerate controls 60 percent of
the uncut diamond market of the world.
</P>
<P>
Leading figures were present at the Antwerp conference, which
drew more than 300 diamond traders and cutters from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
The global diamond business produces each year 6.8 billion U.S.
dollars from trading in diamonds, which in turn generate a retail
diamond jewelry sales of around 56 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes New Rules on Food Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission announced
Monday new proposals on food safety, saying food operators right
through the food chain should bear primary responsibility for food
safety.
</P>
<P>
"The new regulations will merge, harmonize and simplify very
detailed and complex hygiene requirements previously scattered in
17 existing directives," said the EU's executive body in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the new rules are aimed at making a single,
transparent hygiene policy applicable to all food and food
operators,
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for health and consumer protection David Byrne
said this package is of strategic importance in achieving the food
safety objectives.
</P>
<P>
"Food operators large and small will find this simplified and
transparent set of rules easier to apply. They give them a clear
responsibility for making sure food is safe, while leaving them
more freedom and flexibility in deciding how to achieve that in
their own premises," the Commissioner said.

<HEADLINE> Michael Johnson Paces for Double Titles in Olympic Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Michael Johnson, the Olympic
double champion, ran within 44 seconds to win the 400 meters at
the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in Sacramento, California
Sunday afternoon, staging his surge for a repeat of double titles
in the coming Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Johnson circled the track in 43.68, nearly a second ahead of
his closest rivals of Alvin Harrison (44.63) and Antonio Pettigrew
(44.66), marking the 22nd time in his career that he's broken 44
seconds in the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't trying to run any spectacular time," said Johnson,
the world record holder of 43.18. "I just wanted to win the race.
I'm not concerned with records. There was no reason to take
chances at the Olympic Trials."
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Johnson has five days to rest and refocus on his
impending duel with Maurice Greene in the 200 meters which begin
the first-round heats on Saturday, with the semifinals and final
Sunday, the last day of the trials.
</P>
<P>
Being a typical race, Johnson, in Lane 6, made up the stagger
on runners in the outside lanes by the 200-meter mark, established
his commanding lead after the second turn.
</P>
<P>
"My preparations from this point on is getting ready for the
200 meters," Johnson said. "I'm in good shape. I have to take it
easy and not get too excited about the race."
</P>
<P>
Noting that Greene had called the Olympic Trials a "prelim" to
the Sydney Olympics, Johnson said: "It's not a prelim. It's the
Olympic Trials and I take it very seriously."

<HEADLINE> Beijing Sets New Record in Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing-based enterprises realized
5.163 billion U.S. dollars-worth of imports and exports in the
first half of this year, with 2.016 billion U.S. dollars-worth of
exports. The monthly growth rate exceeded 40 percent, the fastest-
ever increase, according to related statistics released today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou He, deputy director of the Beijing Foreign Economic and
Trade Commission, said exports from foreign-funded enterprises
accounted for 60 percent of the city's total. Also, among all the
industries, the rises in processing and machinery and electronics
were respectively 84.3 percent and 93.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
More enterprises are dealing in imports and exports, with 102
more in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said new and high-technology industries will be the focus
for the next six months in export increases. The city will also
raise the proportion of agricultural products in the export
structure.
</P>
<P>
Related government departments and financial institutions are
also encouraged to provide a better environment for the export
companies.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Medicine Producers Seeking Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Wang Zili, manager of the Tibet
Gadol Development Co., was a busy figure at the International
Symposium on Tibetan Medicine, which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The first international symposium held in the hometown of
Tibetan medicine provided him with a golden opportunity to seek
partners for the development of new medicines.
</P>
<P>
Like him, business people involved in Tibetan medicine
production and development from Tibet and other areas of China,
such as Qinghai, Yunnan and Gansu provinces, brought to the
symposium some 100 of their products to look for partners.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that he signed letters of intent at the meeting with
a number of potential partners. A sales agency based in Beijing
said that it was interested in representing his company in
promoting Gadol products in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that by attending the symposium he has broadened his
insight into the industry. The development of traditional Tibetan
medicine must go along with ecological protection, as Tibetan
medicine is mainly produced from natural herbs.
</P>
<P>
For example, gadol or rhodiola root is a popular Tibetan herbal
medicine. Tibet has a gadol reserve of some two million tons.
</P>
<P>
"But we can not excessively exploit wild herbs. The company has
planned to build a gadol plantation of some 66 ha to sustain the
use of the medicine," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Baima Gyaco, manager of a Tibetan medicine company from Nagqu
Prefecture in Tibet, got inspired by the knowledge from the
symposium that an American company had opened a website featuring
Tibetan medicine and intends to use E-commerce to explore the
American market for Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
"My company mainly depends on intermediary agencies to explore
overseas markets, which has proved ineffective. We now plan to
learn to use E-commerce to promote 13 categories of our medicinal
products overseas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the symposium foresee a broad international
market for Tibetan medicine. However, they pointed out that there
is still a long way to go to direct the mass-produced medicine to
the international market.
</P>
<P>
One of the problems is that most Tibetan medicine producers
have not properly prepared themselves for international
competition. The terms of "capital restructuring and share-holding
" are still new to the locals.
</P>
<P>
Experts also suggest that more high technology be introduced
into Tibetan medicine production in order to better adapt the
traditional industry to the international market.

<HEADLINE> HK Marks Closure of World's Last Vietnamese Refugee Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A block at Hong Kong's Pillar
Point Vietnamese Refugees Center, the world's last Vietnamese
refugee center, was razed to the ground Monday, signifying the
formal end of the Vietnamese boat people saga here.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the center "not only marks the end of one of the
20th Century's greatest migration challenges, but also the
beginning of a new era for the Vietnamese in Hong Kong to build a
new life," said Secretary for Security Regina Ip of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government at the closure
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
She thanked the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
governments of all donor and resettlement countries, various
international agencies and non-governmental organizations for
helping settle the Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
Immense efforts and resources have been given to the Vietnamese
boat people stranded in Hong Kong. More than 8.71 billion HK
dollars (about 1.11 billion U.S. dollars) have been spent to house
and feed them since 1979, said Ip.
</P>
<P>
Since the Hong Kong SAR government's announcement of a Widened
Local Resettlement Scheme (WLRS) in February, some 1,400 remaining
Vietnamese have been moving out of the camps and integrating into
the Hong Kong society, and the world's last Vietnamese refugee
center, the PPVRC, was formally closed last month.

<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The four-day Fifth ICPO-Interpol
Heroin Conference will open in Beijing tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The conference is being held at a time when the global
population of heroin users has reached 8.6 million, in addition to
140 million marijuana users and 13 million cocaine users.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Public Security disclosed that
by the end of 1999, China had a drug population of 681,000, of
which 71.5 percent are heroin users.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the Chinese government has been
consistently advocating international cooperation in the fight
against the narcotics trade, and has participated in a number of
international conferences sponsored by the United Nations, ICPO-
Interpol, and the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
ICPO-Interpol, which deems eradicating drug-related crimes to
be one of its major responsibilities, had held four heroin
conferences previously.

<HEADLINE> Red Tide Spotted in China's Bohai Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A red tide covering 350 sq m, was
monitored in the western area of Liaodong Bay in China's Bohai Sea,
after large red tides had been spotted in the South and East China
seas since May.
</P>
<P>
The red tide, which occurred on July 12, was centered at 40.23
degrees north latitude and 121.56 degrees east longitude,
according to the State Marine Environment Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that China has entered the season of the
outbreak of red tides, and it is urgent to take measures to
prevent and control them. Sea pollution must be checked, they said.
</P>
<P>
China's State Oceanic Administration has called on the coastal
areas to strengthen their round-the-clock monitoring against red
tides, which kill fish and other organisms in sea waters.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that about 20 to 30 red tides occur this year
in China's coastal sea waters, and aqua-cultural and sewage
discharge areas as well as ports are listed as the most vulnerable
regions.
</P>
<P>
A red tide is a dense population of aquatic microscopic
organisms that breed in the abundance of salt in surface water.
The micro-organisms appear in most of the world's waters, and most
are harmless. However, some single-cell organisms produce a poison
that paralyzes and kills fish. These organisms may also suffocate
fish by consuming nearly all the oxygen in the water.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, red tides are mainly caused by pollution
from the land and large-scale fish farming in coastal waters,
which produce too much nitrogen and phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
China has experienced an increasing number of red tides off the
coast since the 1990s, due to increasing pollution caused by
industrial waste water, according to a recent report issued by the
State Oceanic Administration.
</P>
<P>
China has registered more than 200 red tides in the past decade.
A total of 45 large-scale red tides occurred between 1997 and 1999,
causing direct economic losses of 240 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China's Steel Plates for Boilers, Pressure Vessels Up to Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A recent random examination showed
that 100 percent of China-made steel sheets for the production of
boilers and pressure vessels are up to the national standard.
</P>
<P>
The examination, conducted by the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision, involved 34 varieties of steel plates
produced by 13 enterprises in 13 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Steel sheets, used specially for producing boilers and pressure
vessels, are required to meet the national standard.
</P>
<P>
At present, every year China produces about 150,000 tons of
steel plates for boilers, valued at 500 million yuan (about 60
million U.S. dollars), and 250,000 tons of steel plates for
pressure vessels, worth 800 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has issued an urgent circular to stress
safety in production and the prevention of accidents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision has taken measures to improve the quality of boilers
and pressure vessels and ensure proper usage of the products.

<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The quality of China-made lighting
instruments has been improved, according to a recent sample survey
by the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision.
</P>
<P>
The qualification rate was 65.3 percent, higher than the
previous examination by the bureau. However, the quality of lamps
is still at a low level, said an official from the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The spot-check on 49 production and sales enterprises of
lighting instruments across China showed that 78.3 percent of the
examined producers were qualified, but only 53.9 percent of the
dealers met the standard.
</P>
<P>
The lack of proper management in the Chinese market for
lighting instruments was cited as the major reason affecting the
quality of lamps.
</P>
<P>
Local quality and technical supervision departments have been
urged to strengthen reexamination of the unqualified enterprises
and improve the quality of the products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Forecast Another Ionospheric Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have once again
succeeded in forecasting a powerful ionospheric storm, according
to the China Electric Wave Transmission Institute.
</P>
<P>
The ionospheric storm was caused by a solar storm that occurred
last Friday and began affecting the Earth. The ionospheric storm
lasted for over 20 hours, making it the longest of its kind felt
by the Earth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Beginning at zero hour on July 16, the ionospheric storm
attacked many parts of the country, resulting in a marked decline
of the critical frequency of the ionosphere, down over 50 percent
in Manzhouli, in north China, and Urumqi, the capital of the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and over 40 percent in Guangzhou,
provincial capital of Guangdong, and Haikou, provincial capital of
Hainan, in the south.
</P>
<P>
Short-wave telecommunications were affected by the ionospheric
storm, while some of the transmitters on telecommunications
satellites were severely disturbed, according to the scientists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy geomagnetic changes were also detected.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India Kick Off Border Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 17 (Xinhua -- Bangladesh and India Monday kicked
off border talks in Chittagong, the largest port city in the
country, in the wake of a series of bloody border clashes which
left five people dead in both sides during the last week.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources told Xinhua that the two sides had two rounds
of talks on the first day of a three-day high-level border
conference between the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) and the Indian
Border Security Force (BSF).
</P>
<P>
Officials of the BDR, the border guard of Bangladesh, said the
talks were going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"Recent frontier fights between the two border security forces
and intrusion by Indians into Bangladesh territories are among the
issues discussed at the talks," an BDR official said.
</P>
<P>
Besides intrusion by the BSF, Indian nationals and law
enforcers, the long-drawn agenda for the border coordination
conference also include matters relating to disputed lands of
Nayagram and Muhurirchar, and firing and casualties in border
areas.
</P>
<P>
Repair and maintenance of border pillars, demarcation of
disputed lands, woman and child trafficking and smuggling will
also come for discussion, the BDR sources said.
</P>
<P>
During last week, the border guards of Bangladesh and India
fought a series of battles in two frontiers, Northeastern Sylet
and Northwestern Kurigram, where three Bangladeshi civilians were
killed. India claimed its two BSF members were killed in the
border clashes.
</P>
<P>
One hundred Bangladeshi, including six BDR personnel, were shot
dead and 106 injured in incidents of firing by the BSF in border
areas in the last four and a half years, making the 4,156-
kilometer border between the two countries "one of the most
volatile international borders", according to the BDR sources.
</P>
<P>
The border killings have increased since early this year. In
the first six months, 22 Bangladeshis were killed in the
indiscriminate firing by the BSF in different frontiers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Happy Over Release of German Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
expressed elation Monday over the release of a German woman
hostage by the Abu Sayyaf, while reiterating the government's
foremost concern that all captives be set free soon.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy about this development," Estrada said in a
press statement, after Renate Wallert, a German national, was
released to government chief negotiator Robert Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
Wallert is the third, and first European, to be released by the
Abu Sayyaf. Two Malaysian nationals were earlier set free by the
separatist group.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the release of the three hostages is a vindication
of the government's policy not to give in to the demands for
ransom of the hostage takers while ensuring the safety of the
captives.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that our patience and very careful approach to this
hostage crisis is clearly paying off," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada pointed out, however, that this is not the time for the
government to lay down its guard, saying it still has to make
careful efforts to work for the release of the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
"But we still have some ways to go. This is a very complex,
delicate and difficult situation. Still, we are confident that
with this development, we will be able to see all the hostages
released safe and sound, and soon," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Wallert is expected to arrive in Manila Monday night from the
remote southern city Zamboanga aboard a private plane. From the
airport, she will be taken to a hospital for a medical checkup.
Then, she will take a flight for Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf snatched 21 persons, mostly foreigners, from a
dive resort in Malaysia on April 23.

LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Hoodlums Sunday engaged the police
in a gunbattle in Lagos, Nigeria' s commercial capital, killing

Two policemen were reportedly killed and eight others seriously

This is one of the findings released on Monday by the Economics

<P>
The findings showed that in 1999, the total taxes, excise and

retail price, despite Finance Minister Trevor Manuel's claim that
the target of 50 percent had been reached in 1997 and subsequent

<HEADLINE> Croatian President Hails Proposal for EU-Balkans Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Stipe Mesic
said here Monday that it would be good to invite the neighboring
countries in the Balkans to attend the proposed summit with the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"Now we are discussing which countries that were members of the
ex-Yugoslavia will participate in the summit and we think it will
be very good to invite the countries from our neighborhood which
are interested in the stability of the region," Mesic told
reporters after paying a visit to the NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that France and the EU have the say on whom to be
invited. "The organizers of the summit are the European Union and
France, which now holds the presidency of the union," he added.
</P>
<P>
France has proposed a summit between the 15-nation bloc and
west Balkan countries and regions in November this year. Yet
Britain, Austria and the Netherlands asked France and other EU
member states to consider extending invitation to Bulgaria,
Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
They argued that these countries all have historic, geographic
and ethnic ties with the west Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
France proposed to hold the summit between the EU and Albania,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Yugoslavia's Montenegro
republic and Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
The summit was planned to be held at Croatia's western coastal
city of Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, one of the six former Yugoslav republics, has been
hailed by the Western countries as an example of democratization
for countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Croatia was admitted into the Partnership for Peace program of
NATO, the western military alliance that launched a 78-day air
campaign against Yugoslavia last year to force the withdrawal of
its troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Croatia has become a member of the PfP and thus entered the
family of the Euro-Atlantic partnership," said NATO Secretary-
General George Robertson after meeting Mesic. "We enthusiastically
encourage Croatia to play its role as an example for the region."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether NATO will be at the Dubrovnik summit, the
NATO chief said it was up to the EU to decide.

OTTAWA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Up to 5,000 evacuees were told to
return to their homes in a Montreal suburb early Monday after an
overnight fire at a chemical plant west of the city.
</P>
<P>
An explosion-induced fire erupted Sunday night at Regent
Chemical Products in an acid-transformation plant about 25
kilometers west of Montreal, city police said.
</P>
<P>
A blanket of toxic smoke could be witnessed billowing into the
sky from several kilometers away. There were as many as 50,000
liters of toxic materials in the plant, including sulfuric, nitric
and hydrochloric acid.
</P>
<P>
About 100 firefighters from neighboring municipalities fought
the toxic blaze for hours before they finally brought the fire
under control.
</P>
<P>
"Only a few hundred people in one particular neighborhood are
being told to stay way," according to Wilfrid Houle, a police
spokesman for the municipality of Vaudreuil-Dorion, where the
chemical plant is located.

<HEADLINE> HK Grants More Funds to Drug Prevention Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government has
granted around 500,000 HK dollars (64,100 U.S. dollars) to finance
19 district anti-drug preventive education and publicity projects
under the Community Against Drugs Scheme (CADS) in the 2000-2001
period, according to a government press release Monday.
</P>
<P>
Funded by the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) of Hong
Kong, the objective of the CADS is to encourage non-profit-making
organizations, such as voluntary bodies and schools, to launch
preventive education and publicity projects to further the anti-
drug cause.
</P>
<P>
Since its inception in 1972, the scheme has been an integral
part of ACAN's drug prevention program. This year, the upper limit
of grant has been increased to 40,000 HK dollars (5,100 U.S.
dollars) for each project in order to encourage more worthwhile
and innovative proposals.
</P>
<P>
Justein Wong, chairman of the ACAN Preventive Education and
Publicity Sub-committee, said the assessment panel gives priority
to those projects which target at areas with high drug abuse rate,
youths at risk, and those providing training or support for
volunteers in disseminating anti-drug messages.
</P>
<P>
"Factors like the objective of the project, degree of
innovation, number of beneficiaries, cost-effectiveness, scale of
publicity, and the past performance of the applicants in using
ACAN funds are also considered when assessing the projects," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Bashar al-Assad Sworn in as Syrian President EDS: Updates with Bashar's remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Bashar al-Assad took oath as
Syrian president in the Syrian parliament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bashar was elected on July 11 as president of Syria with an
overwhelming majority of votes in a nationwide referendum.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the office-taking ceremony, Bashar said
Syria wants to quickly reach peace with Israel but will never
abandon its demand for a full return of the occupied land.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirm here that we are in a hurry to make peace but we
are not willing to squander our land or our territory and
jeopardize our sovereignty," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bashar's father Hafez al-Assad died of a heart attack on June 10
after ruling the country for the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his late father's policy toward Syria's long-time
enemy Israel and calling for U.S. pressure on Israel to compromise,
Bashar said,"We call upon the United States to play its full role
as an honest broker and as a co-sponsor of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Israel wants to retain enough of the Golan Heights to have full
control over the entire Sea of Galilee, Israel's major water
resource -- a position firmly rejected by Bashar's father.
</P>
<P>
"We are longing for the return of the Golan," Bashar said,
adding,"However long it takes this land is ours and it will return
to us in full. We are not ready to pay the price of the inability
of Israeli governments to take a decision for peace."
</P>
<P>
Bashar's father made return of the Golan the heart of his
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The liberation of our territory is at the top of our national
priorities and is as important to us as the achievement of the just
and comprehensive peace that we have adopted as our strategic
choice," Bashar said.
</P>
<P>
"I promise to perform my duty properly under these very
sensitive circumstances experienced by our homeland, Arab nation
and the world as a whole. I will do my utmost to lead the nation to
a bright future," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bashar also called upon all Syrian citizens to take part in the
process of development and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of accountability and interrogation
establishments in the coming stage, Bashar said any one who tries
to make a mistake should be brought to book.
</P>
<P>
He further bitingly blasted the absence of palpable and
articulate economic strategy in the past, which was the cause
behind Syria's current deteriorating economic situation.

<HEADLINE> 22 Filipinos Massacred by Moro Rebels: Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Muslim secessionists massacred 22
civilians Monday, including a pregnant woman, whom they kidnapped
Sunday in the southern Philippines, Philippine News Agency (PNA)
said.
</P>
<P>
Local military official Capt. Arnulfo Bajarin was quoted as
saying that the bodies of the slain victims were found with their
hands tied behind their backs in Bumbaran town, South Lanao
province at 9:00 Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The victims were cowering in fear inside their homes when some
500 rebels of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) attacked a
Civilian Armed Force Geographical Unit detachment in Bumbaran at 9:
00 a.m. Sunday Bajarin said.
</P>
<P>
The militia unit fought back and repulsed the MILF during a
five-minute gun battle.
</P>
<P>
Seething with anger, the MILF burned down six houses and held
hostage 19 farmers while withdrawing and took more three captives
along the way, bringing their hostages to 22.
</P>
<P>
They were herded inside a mosque where pursuing army soldiers
found the 22 bodies of the victims. They sustained multiple
gunshot wounds all over their bodies.
</P>
<P>
The massacre came a week after the MILF suffered a series of
debacles in the battlefield that resulted in the capture of all 57
MILF camps by the military in Mindanao, including the MILF's main
stronghold Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Because of their defeat, MILF chairman Hashim Salamat
reportedly declared a "jihad", or holy war, against the government.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets Conditions for More Role in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has reiterated that her
further involvement in the restoration of peace in Sierra Leone
under the United Nations banner depended on the change of mandate
and the command of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Monday quoted Nigerian Minister of Defense Gen.
Theophilus Danjuma as telling visiting U.S. Under Secretary of
State Thomas Pickering that as long as the UN mandate remains
peace-keeping in the face of rebel RUF (Revolutionary United
Front) activities, normalcy will never be restored in the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
"The mandate of peace-keeping instead of peace enforcement is
the major cause of the problem, "added Nigeria' s Chief of Army
Staff and Commander of the West Africa Peace Keeping Force (ECOMOG)
, Gen. Victor Malu, at the meeting on Sunday in the Nigerian
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian side made the stand clear when Pickering urged Nigeria
to make larger inputs into Sierra Leone peace process.
</P>
<P>
There are many troops pulled from many countries and command is
under someone who doesn't know the terrain and that is affecting
the effectiveness of the troops there, said Malu.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the commanding position of the UN force
should be given to an officer from Nigeria, which has led the
ECOMOG force to fight the rebels for many years before the UN's
intervention.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies must be ready to supply Nigeria with
the equipment necessary for its operation in Sierra Leone, said
Nigerian officials during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for Nigeria' s Defense Ministry said at a press
conference after the meeting that if the conditions are met,
Nigeria has the capacity to quickly restore peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pickering promised to do all that is necessary to help, but
said "it is only the United Nations, not the U.S. that can change
the mandate or command of the troops in Sierra Leone".

<HEADLINE> Old Chart Shows Excellent Skills of Tibetan Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A chart, which was drawn several
hundred years ago by Tibetan doctors and depicts the course of
fetation, aroused great interest among experts attending an
international symposium on Tibetan medicine in this capital of the
Tibet Autonomous Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Zhamdui, president of the Tibetan Hospital here, said that the
chart is one of the 80 colored hanging charts drawn by ancient
Tibetan doctors to explain the Four Medical Classics, known as an
encyclopedia of ancient Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Bhagwan Dash from India said, "It is a rare thing in the
world's history of medicine that charts to explain the secrets of
Tibetan medicine were drawn as early as in the 12th century."
</P>
<P>
Ancient Tibetan doctors began to use congealed butter to cure
traumas and obtained rich knowledge through clinical experience on
preventing and treating diseases more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Based on these, Yuto Yondan Gonbo, an eighth-century Tibetan
doctor, wrote the Four Medical Classics.
</P>
<P>
The four-part classic systematically discusses the basic theory
of Tibetan medicine, the structure of the human body,
physiological functions, causes of diseases and pathology,
diagnosis and treatment and medicines, the effects of daily life
on people's health, and medical ethics.
</P>
<P>
From the 12th century to the 17th century, Tibetan doctors drew
a total of 80 colored charts which explain the Four Medical
Classics. With the help of these charts, Tibetan medicine was
widely spread in the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Qinghai, Sichuan,
Yunnan and Gansu provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to 36 of the 80 charts and a batch of surgical tools
collected in the regional museum of history, Tibetan doctors could
treat knife wounds, burns and fractures hundreds of years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan doctors used golden needles to perform eye operations,
before modern surgical techniques became available.
</P>
<P>
Zhamdui said that some of the Tibetan medical skills were used
until the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium closed today.

<P>
Modern science and technology can also help improve the
effectiveness of Tibetan medicine and the medical skills of
Tibetan doctors in treating diseases, according to experts who are
attending the three-day symposium on Tibetan medicine in this
capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Rinwang, vice-president of the Beijing College of Tibetan
Medicine and an expert in cardiovascular diseases, said that
though the over-2,000-year-old Tibetan medicine has many unique
ways for treating diseases, modern medical equipment can help
Tibetan doctors diagnose more accurately and thus improve the
effectiveness of Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
Using modern scientific and technological methods, experts have
explained some of the ways used by Tibetan doctors in treating
diseases, including bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
Documents on Tibetan medicine have general expositions about
the tools, diagnoses and operations involving bloodletting, but
the explanations can not give the accurate location of the 77
pulses for bloodletting. Tibetan doctors can not even conduct
operation due to the too-simple depiction, and the skill has
almost been lost.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, a team of experts on Tibetan medicine, acupuncture and
dissection started a two-year research program on the skill. They
identified the locations of all the original 77 bloodletting
pulses and added 24 more new ones.

<HEADLINE> Female Tibetan Doctors Play Equal Role with Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Women doctors of Tibetan medicine
are playing an equal role with their male partners in the Tibet
Autonomous Region in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Digi Zhoigar, one of first Tibetan medicine doctors trained in
New China, exchanged her experiences on the treatment of
angiocardiopathy with experts from India, Germany and the United
States in English and Tibetan at the 2000 International Symposium
on Tibetan Medicine, which closed today in this capital of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
She was born into a slave family and was admitted to the
Tibetan Medicine School in Lhasa in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Since her graduation in 1966, Digi Zhoigar has been treating
patients in both urban and rural areas of Tibet. Her husband is
also a Tibetan medicine doctor, but their daughter is practicing
Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
"Though Tibetan and Western medicines are different systems of
medical science, we have something in common," she said.
</P>
<P>
Women constitute half of the 500 physicians at the Tibetan
Hospital in Lhasa. Of the new students enrolled by the Tibetan
Medical Institute each year, half are women students.
</P>
<P>
There are many outstanding female Tibetan doctors like Digi
Zhoigar. Qamba Zhoigar, a woman doctor at the Tibetan Hospital,
has developed a unique therapy which combines Tibetan medicine
with Western medicine in treating cerebral hemorrhage. The cure
ratio of the disease at the Tibetan Hospital is 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yonggar, 30, was the youngest female participant in the
symposium. "Although my skill is far from that of the experienced
Tibetan physicians, I love Tibetan medicine very much and am
determined to learn from and surpass the older generation in the
future," she said.

Modern science and technology have also helped people both at
home and abroad to have a better understanding of the scientific
nature of ethnic medicines, thus promoting the rapid development
of Tibetan medicine, Chu said.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 20 types of Tibetan medicines in the
country's pharmacopoeia, and 336 kinds of Tibetan medicines are
produced in accordance with ministerial-level standards. The
country now has 57 hospitals of Tibetan medicine, and 35 types of
Tibetan medicines are used by more than 300 hospitals in China.
</P>
<P>
Qamba Chilai, honorary president of the College of Tibetan
Medicine here, said, "Tibetan medicine is playing an important
role on the national and even the world stage of medicine."
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is a traditional medicine system developed by
the Tibetan people based on their experience in life and
production. It widely absorbed the advantages of traditional
Chinese medicine, ancient Indian medicine and ancient Arabian
medicine.

However, for thousands of years, Tibetan medicine information
was kept inside temples and lamaseries in Tibet. Tibetan doctors
never categorized the specialties of Tibetan medicine and never
established files for patients.
</P>
<P>
China started building a modern Tibetan medicine system
involving medical treatment, teaching, scientific research and the
manufacturing of Tibetan medicines 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Institutions engaged in teaching and research on Tibetan
medicine and a group of modern Tibetan medicine factories have
been established in Tibet, and the provinces of Qinghai and Gansu.
</P>
<P>
Experts have conducted a series of qualitative and quantitative
analyses on more than 1,000 types of Tibetan medicines regarding
their names, species, ingredients, functions and doses, and
standardized the production of Tibetan medicines.
</P>
<P>
Development of new Tibetan medicines is going smoothly with the
help of modern science and technology. Two types of the new
medicines, including a kind of plaster which helps ease aches,
have been exported to the United States, the Republic of Korea and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Chu Guoben said bio-engineering, gene projects and other modern
technologies pose a challenge for Tibetan medicine, but they can
also help promote its development.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine will make full use of modern science and
technology for further development to meet the requirements of
modern society, Chu said.

ZHENGZHOU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has suffered an economic loss of over 7.82 billion yuan from
repeated floods since June.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-June, heavy rain has hit the province on the middle

</P>
<P>
Statistics released today by the provincial bureau of civil
affairs show that by July 16, 22.75 million people in 15 cities
had been affected by the floods, and 7,678 people were at one time
or another stranded by floods.

<HEADLINE> No Dried-up Areas on Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- No drying-up has appeared on the
Yellow River, the second largest in China, since last November,
according to the Yellow River Water Resources Committee (YRWRC)
today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time there have been no dried-up areas on the
river since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute this to a conservation program carried out
by the YRWRC, which orders the provinces along the river to use
less water.
</P>
<P>
Some sections of the Yellow River started to dry up in the
1970s. In the 1990s, the dried-up periods were longer and came
earlier year by year.
</P>
<P>
This year, the river basin underwent a severe drought and
rainfall on the river from March to July was 80 to 90 percent
lower than the normal level, hitting the lowest point since the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
With cooperation and communication with other departments, the
YRWRC employed a lot of water-saving methods such as making full
use of large reservoirs on the river and carrying out the
conservation program.
</P>
<P>
With the above efforts, no drying-up was found on the Yellow
River in the late dry season from November 1 last year to June 31
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, even though rainy season has started,
the drought will not disappear immediately, and related
departments still have to keep alert for any emergency situation.

<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official for
Taiwan affairs met and exchanged views on the current cross-
Straits relations with a delegation from Taiwan's Kuomintang here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li Yafei, secretary-general of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), and the
delegation reached common understanding on adherence to the one-
China consensus and the promotion of direct economic and other
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held that the major reason behind the stalemate
in the current cross-Straits relations lies in the denial of
Taiwan's new leader of the one-China consensus reached between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the association and Taiwan's Straits Exchanges
Foundation (SEF) reached a consensus by agreeing to adhere to the
one-China principle, which led to a summit between the association
's president Wang Daohan and his Taiwanese counterpart Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the SEF.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between the two organizations will be reopened
and the cross-Straits relations improved and developed when the
consensus is upheld, the two sides noted.
</P>
<P>
It is in the best interests of people on both sides of the
Straits to enhance economic cooperation and realize the exchanges
of mail service, trade, and air and shipping services, known as
the "three direct links", they said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also pledged enhanced cooperation in fighting
against "Taiwan independence" and striving for the improvement and
development of cross-Straits relations.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Begins to Verify Border Encroachments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A team of U.N. personnel and
Lebanese army officers are scheduled to verify whether Israel has
ended its violations of the line of withdrawal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There are nine existing violations, according to the U.N., most
of them in the areas where sections of the old border fence and
patrol roads stray into Lebanese territory and small observation
posts located north of the so-called Blue Line, drawn by the U.N.
to verify Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel promised last week to end the violations. Security
sources believe that most were amended by the onset of the weekend,
Daily Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
A western diplomat in Beirut on Sunday described July 17 as a
critical date for ending the violations.
</P>
<P>
Fulfilling the remaining components of the U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425 cannot occur until the violations are concluded, the
Lebanese government has said, adding that it will not approve the
permanent deployment of U.N. peacekeepers into the area vacated by
Israeli troops until Israeli forces remain behind the Blue Line.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that the international community was ready
to offer loans and grants to Lebanon to help rebuild not only the
south but the rest of the country. However, this will only happen
once peace and stability are restored to the south.
</P>
<P>
The results of the border inspection will be reported by General
Amin Hoteit, the head of the Lebanese team, to the government,
while the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) will
contact U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on their findings.
</P>
<P>
Annan has been concerned about following developments in south
Lebanon since he announced on June 24 that Israel had fully
departed Lebanon. The subsequent Israeli violations were seen as
serving to undermine his personal credibility.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultra-Orthodox religious
Shas party has decided not to participate in Monday night's
parliamentary no-confidence vote, party officials announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shas, who holds pivotal 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset
(Parliament), said in a statement that the party is against raising
no-confidence debates while Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is
abroad for national business.
</P>
<P>
Barak is attending a three-way summit with U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at Camp David,
Maryland, trying to reach a final peace agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Shas party officials said that although the party has resigned
from Barak's ruling coalition earlier July and joined in the
opposition factions since then, it has no plan to break the
unwritten parliamentary ethic code to support a no-confidence
motion while the prime minister is abroad and busy with state
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Shas's absence from Monday's vote announced the de facto death
of two no-confidence motions due to be discussed Monday night in
the Knesset, which were submitted by National Union - Yisrael
Beiteinu, and Herut - National Movement respectively.
</P>
<P>
The National Union - Yisrael Beiteinu is against the "security
risks" to the country posed by the Camp David summit, while Herut-
National Movement is against Barak's offer to "give billions of
shekels to the Arab sector" in return to obtain their votes.

On Sunday, the major opposition Likud bloc, who holds 19
parliamentary seats, also decided to abstain from the no-confidence
vote, which already reduced the chances of these motions to garner
law-required 61 votes to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
Likud parliament faction whip Reuven Rivlin said that in spite
of his party's lack of faith in the government, the oppositions
should postpone the no-confidence vote "out of respect for the
prime minister, who is abroad on state matters."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects Foreign Intervention in Sudan's Affairs: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
stressed on Monday his country rejects any foreign intervention in
Sudan's internal affairs, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's opposition to any foreign interference in the Sudanese
affairs is to avert threats to Sudan's territorial integrity,
Moussa quoted Mubarak as saying after the president met with
visiting Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Othman Ismail.
</P>
<P>
The United States and some Eastern African countries reportedly
have been supporting the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the
major rebel group in southern Sudan, which has been fighting since
1983 to seek greater autonomy from the Muslim government in
Khartoum for the mostly Christian and animist south.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian position is also aimed at securing the
implementation of a dialog-based peace initiative, proposed jointly
by Egypt and Libya last year, under which "we are all working to
stop the bloodletting" in Sudan, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Libyan initiative calls for permanent ceasefire in
Sudan and a peace conference to be attended by the government and
the opposition, including the SPLA and the northern Muslim
political parties which want to share power with the government.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's keenness on helping safeguard Sudan's territorial
integrity results from its fear that a possible disintegration of
the largest African country will jeopardize its major water source,
the Nile.
</P>
<P>
Ismail, who arrived in Cairo earlier for a brief visit, said he
delivered a message to Mubarak from his Sudanese counterpart Omar
Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir on the current situation in Sudan and the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak asserted the importance of promoting the bilateral ties
and preparing for the joint committee meeting slated for September
2, he added.
</P>
<P>
Later, Moussa and Ismail went into a meeting to discuss
arrangements for a preparatory meeting for the peace conference to
group all parties related to the Sudanese issue, and efforts
exerted to end the civil war and realize peace and national
reconciliation in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Ismail has said that both the government and the opposition have
agreed to take part in the proposed dialog. He expressed hope that
the process will succeed in achieving the aspired-for goal.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's National Alliance Supports Wahid-Megawati Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Amid rising struggle among
political rivals in Indonesia, a just established 11-party
National Alliance expressed its support to the government led by
President Abdurrahman Wahid and Vice-President Megawati
Soekarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, which was established on Sunday by 11
nationalistic-based political parties, said it supported the
president and vice-president to stay in power and deal with
problems now faced by Indonesian people, the Suara pembaruan daily
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the alliance RO Tambunan was quoted by the
newspaper as saying that, "The support was provided for the sake
of the national unity," adding that the current political and
economic situation in the country is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
The 11 political parties had contested in the general election
in June last year, but they got a few seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Since May this year, political rivals of the President Wahid
administration have criticized the government for failing to deal
with the country's political and economical unstability. Some of
the supporters of the former president Soeharto have played
significant roles in the current political struggle in the country.
</P>
<P>
The country's law making body of the People's Consultatives
Assembly (MPR) is due to hold its annual session on August 7,
during which the president is due to appear before the session to
account for his nine-month in office. Some of the president's
rivals have warned to conduct an impeachment during the session.
</P>
<P>
But all factions of the MPR have declared a unified stance and
vowed to reduce mounting political tension ahead of the Assembly's
annual session.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives (DPR) Akbar Tandjung
also said that the session will not be designed to unseat Wahid.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Medicine to Become Wealth of Mankind (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign medical experts
attending the "2000 International Symposium on Tibetan Medicine",
which closed in this capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region today,
agreed that the 2000-year-old Tibetan medicine will be turned into
the wealth of all the countries on earth.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guoben, president of the Nationalities Medicine and
Pharmacy Association of China, said, "Among the four famous
medical systems in the world, the ancient Greek medicine has been
lost and the ancient Indian medicine is going downhill. Only
traditional Chinese medicine and Tibetan medicine are widely used
in various parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is a traditional medical system gradually
built up by the Tibetan people in their long struggle against
diseases and illnesses. It has miraculous curative effects on
cerebrovascular disease, rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis and
chronic hepatitis. It is also notably effective against tumors,
diabetes, blood diseases, hepatocirrhosis and other difficult
diseases which Western medicine is unable to deal with.
</P>
<P>
Ren Wang, vice president of the Beijing Tibetan Hospital, said
three-fourths of the patients at his hospital are people of the
Han nationality, and one fifth of the patients come from abroad.
They turn to Tibetan medicine after unfruitful medical treatment
in other hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bhagwan Dash, an Indian physician who has engaged in
clinical Tibetan medicine for more than 20 years, said, "A lupus
sebaceus patient of mine received Western medicine treatment for
two years, but to no avail. Since he turned to Tibetan medicine
not long ago, he has felt much better."
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is a complete theoretical system with rich
clinical practice. The "Four Medical Classics", a medical
encyclopaedia compiled at the end of the eighth century, gives
accurate descriptions of anatomy, physiology and other medical
elementals. Later people drew 80 colorful wall maps for this
monumental medical work, providing a straightforward explanation
of the diagnosis and treatment of Tibetan medicine. It helps
Tibetan medicine get widespread in China's Tibet Autonomous Region,
and Qinghai, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces as well as in India and
Nepal.

Dash has written 14 books on Tibetan medicine since he won a
doctoral degree at New Delhi University in 1978. The majority of
them have been published in New Delhi. He shuttles between India
and Italy to attend his five Tibetan and Indian medicine clinics
in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetan medicine is a kind of natural therapy which combines
human beings closely with nature. It pays attention not only to
treatment of disease but also to psychological recuperation," he
said, adding, "I hope my endeavors will make Tibetan medicine
accepted by more people."
</P>
<P>
To date, research institutes on Tibetan medicine have been set
up in more than 20 countries and regions with a large contingent
of established specialists. Tibetan medicine doctors from China
have been invited to give lectures in a dozen countries, including
the United States, Britain, Japan, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a report on Tibetan medicine given at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983, an American doctor,
named Eliot Tokar, opened his own Tibetan medicine clinic in New
York in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Many Tibetan medical books such as the "Four Medical Classics",
"Pearl Herbology" and "Selected Works of Tibetan Medicine" have
been translated into English, German, French, Russian and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Dui, president of the Tibetan Hospital in Tibet, said most
of the crude drugs in Tibetan medicine are mineral products or
natural plants and animals living on snow-covered mountains with
an elevation of 5,000 meters. Hence, it has better curative effect
than other medicine.
</P>
<P>
The Chee-Zheng Pain-Eliminating plaster made by the Qizheng
Tibetan Medicine Group, won the grand prize at the 26th
International Exhibition of Inventions held in Geneva in 1998.
Tibetan Rhodiolao, a new type of tonic which is good for the brain
and able to inhibit the spread of cancer, now has ready markets in
the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Education in Tibetan Medicine Expands in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Tibetan Medicine College in this
capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, built with state
investment a decade ago, has now become the biggest and most
authoritative center for education in Tibetan medicine in China.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the college, the tutors and the
students enrolled by the college are all from the ethnic Tibetan
group. Undergraduates spend five years at the college studying
more than 20 subjects. The textbooks are all written in the
Tibetan language.
</P>
<P>
So far, the college has trained 650 students who are now
workers in Tibetan medicine in Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan
provinces, as well as Tibet, or as doctors of Tibetan medicine in
major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan Medicine College was designated as a place to train
postgraduate students in Tibetan medicine in 1998, and has so far
recruited two terms of postgraduate students. There are now 10
students who have been studying for master's degrees in Tibetan
medicine at the college, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Yangga, 34, who is acting as an English interpreter at the
international Tibetan medicine symposium that closed today, was
one of Tibet's first four postgraduates in Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
Born into a herdsman's family in northern Tibet, Yangga was
introduced to Tibetan medicine by his uncle. He used to study and
give lectures at the Tibetan Medicine Department of Tibet
University and the Tibetan Medicine College, and is now studying
for a master's degree under well-known scholars including Qamba
Chilai, a state-level expert in Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
Education in Tibetan medicine has gained more and more
financial support from the international community over the past
few years. With this aid, four secondary Tibetan medicine schools
have been set up in Tibet since 1990, offering four to six years'
schooling. More than 300 students have graduated from the schools.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the state-financed Tibetan medicine schools and
medical organizations, Tibetan medicine has also been carried
forward by way of father teaching son or master coaching
apprentice.
</P>
<P>
Specialists in Tibetan medicine are also invited to write down
or dictate their experiences in monumental written works to
facilitate the younger generations' study and research in Tibetan
medicine.
</P>
<P>
"Detailed Interpretation of the Four Medical Classics",
compiled by a group of specialists including Tsorum Tsenang, head
of the Tibetan Medicine College, will soon be published. "Wall
Maps of Four Medical Classics, Interpreting the Difficulties in
Light of Lapislazuli", dictated by Qamba Chilai, another state-
level specialist in Tibetan medicine, is now in the process of
compilation.

<HEADLINE> HK's Unemployment Rate at 5.0 Percent in April-June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate stood at 5.0 percent in the April-June period of
this year, slightly lower than the 5.1 percent in March-May,
according to the latest provisional labor force statistics
released Monday by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the underemployment rate was 3.1 percent, which was
also lower than the 3.3 percent in the March-May period.
</P>
<P>
A comparison between the April-June period and the March-May
period shows that decreases in the unemployment rate were seen
mainly in the foundation and superstructure construction,
manufacturing and import/export trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
As to the underemployment rate, decreases occurred mainly in
retail trade, manufacturing and construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
The size of the total labor force in the April-June period was
estimated at 3,564,000, slightly larger than that in the March-
May period, at 3,562,500.
</P>
<P>
The number of employed persons also increased marginally, from
3,385,200 to 3,386,000. Over the same period, the number of
unemployed persons, which was not seasonally adjusted, edged up
from 177,400 to 178,000, while the number of underemployed persons
declined from 116,300 to 113,000.
</P>
<P>
A government secretariat spokesman said that while both the
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate and the underemployment rate
edged down, the total number unemployed had a small rise.
</P>
<P>
This was mainly due to fresh graduates and school leavers
beginning to enter the job market at this time of the year, he
explained, but the strengthened labor demand upon the on-going
economic recovery should help absorb the additional labor supply.

CANBERRA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Australia and the United States
Monday signed an agreement for enhanced cooperation on defense

<HEADLINE> 2nd lead: German Hostage Released With Go-between's Help EDS: With more details  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Monday release of Renate
Wallert, a German woman hostage held by the Abu Sayyaf for 12
weeks in the southern Philippine province of Sulu, was mainly
contributed to the help of a government-approved emissary, local
press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Business World said Monday that government chief negotiator
Robert Aventajado sent a special emissary on Sunday to persuade
the Abu Sayyaf to release their remaining hostages after they
freed a second Malaysian hostage three days ago.
</P>
<P>
The emissary, serving as the "go-between" of Aventajado and Abu
Sayyaf's leader Galib Andang (or Commander Robot), is a relative
of Andang, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
Wallert, 58, was the first of the 10 western hostages released
by the Abu Sayyaf although the extremist group has released two
Malaysian hostages last month and last Friday, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, including 10 westerners and 11 Asian hostages,
were abducted by the extremist group on April 23 from an eastern
Malaysian resort of Sibadan and moved to Sulu on the following day.
</P>
<P>
Wallert, who was reported to be suffering high blood pressure,
has since been the priority of the government's effort involving
the negotiation over the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
However, the Abu Sayyaf seized 13 Christian evangelists who
traveled to their camp in Patikul, Sulu, on July 1.
</P>
<P>
One German journalist and three French journalists who went
there to interview the original hostages were also reportedly
abducted by the group recently.

</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have discovered well-preserved fossils

years in a mountain cave in Pubei County of south China's Guangxi

</P>
<P>
The archeologists believe that the fossils were those of Asian
elephants that lived in the late period the Pleistocene.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the archaeological team said that the fossils of

were found in a mountain cave near Mocun Village, Pubei County.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

capital of northwest Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The 900,000-square meters site, located in Huxian County, 20 km
from the city's downtown, is well preserved, said an archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
An abundance of historical relics related to ancient coin-
making were unearthed from the site, including coins of various
kinds as well as bronze molds, kilns, pottery stoves and iron
tools used in coin minting.
</P>
<P>
-- Prehistoric Town Discovered
</P>
<P>
China has discovered a prehistoric town which has an inner and
an outside wall in the city of Lianyungang in eastern Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the town belonged to the Longshan Culture, a
late Neolithic civilization 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weichao, an expert at the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage (SACH), said the town is one of the best-preserved large
prehistoric sites and will be valuable for research. The town lies

-- Ancient Coins Unearthed in North China
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists recently unearthed precious ancient
coins in north China's Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
Among the discovery, 42 coins were made in the Northern Song
Dynasty (960-1127) and some words were engraved on them, which are
believed to be written by the emperors at that time.
</P>
<P>
To engrave lucky words on coins was common in ancient China,
but such kinds of coins with emperors' handwritings are rare in
the region, said experts.
</P>
<P>
-- 2,700-Year-Old Tombs Found in Central China
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have found dozens of ancient tombs
dating back to the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-256 B.C.) in Xinzheng

</P>
<P>
An archaeologist said that some burial vehicles and remains of
horses were also found in the tomb area.
</P>
<P>
"Four ancient vehicles and ten horses buried alive with the
dead bodies were unearthed from the pits and tombs," the expert
said, adding that a number of bronze and jade cultural relics have
also been dug up, including a set of bronze ceremonial objects.

<P>
Enthusiastic local residents of Lanzhou, capital of northwest
China's Gansu Province, swarmed on July 15 to a special exhibition

as a 100-year-old branch of learning.
</P>
<P>
The two-month exhibition, which opened today, is the only
activity that is being held in Lanzhou.
</P>
<P>
-- Archeological Survey Tells True Figures of Murals Plundered
by Foreign Explorers
</P>
<P>
A recent archeological survey in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region showed that the amount of murals plundered
by foreign explorers at Kizil Thousand Buddha Cave some 90 years
ago was much more than the figure they had announced before.
</P>
<P>
The One Thousand Buddha Cave, located in Baicheng County of
Aksu Prefecture, is the largest group of grottoes cut in the
ancient Guizi State of Western Regions with 236 caves. It is one
of the four famous grottoes in China together with grottoes at

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Myanmar SPDC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao,
who is paying an official visit to Myanmar, met with Chairman of
the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) Senior-
General Than Shwe at the Pyithuluttaw (People's Parliament) Hall
here Monday and they chatted in a friendly atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Hu first conveyed the cordial greetings and good wishes of
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji to chairman Than Shwe
and the Myanmar people.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The aim of my Myanmar visit on the occasion of the
50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations
between China and Myanmar is to enhance the 'paukphaw' (fraternal)
friendship and to deepen the two countries' cooperation so as to
ceaselessly develop the Sino-Myanmar friendly cause initiated by
leaders of elder generations of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
China and Myanmar are friendly neighbors linked by mountains
and rivers and Myanmar is one of the earliest countries that
recognized the People's Republic of China after New China was
founded, Hu noted, recalling that Myanmar had firmly supported
China in resuming its legal seat in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In the past half century, no matter how the international
situation changed, Sino-Myanmar ties have been consistently
maintained and steadily developed, he pointed out, attributing
this to the joint efforts made by successive leaders of the two
countries and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He expressed willingness to strive with the Myanmar side and
actively implement the contents contained in the China-Myanmar
Joint Statement, and deepen the mutually beneficial cooperation of
the two nations in each sector so that the bilateral ties would
sustainably and steadily develop in the new century.
</P>
<P>
He appraised and thanked Myanmar government for its consistent
abidance by the "One China" policy which says Myanmar would never
establish official ties with Taiwan in any form.
</P>
<P>
He also said in recent years, under the leadership of the
Myanmar SPDC headed by chairman Than Shwe, Myanmar government and
people have gained important achievements in bringing about
political stability, national reconciliation, economic development
and in foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
"For these, we, as a friendly neighbor, are heartily delighted,
" he said, expressing the belief that with Myanmar possessing rich
natural resources and its people's diligence, Myanmar government
and people are bound to overcome various difficulties and will
score greater achievements on its road forward and build its own
country even better.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Three Former AUM Cult Members Sentenced to Death, Life Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo District Court on Monday
sentenced two former members of the AUM Shinrikyo to death and
handed a life imprisonment sentence to another former member for
their involvement in the 1995 sarin nerve-gas attack on the Tokyo
subway system which killed 12 people and injured thousands.
</P>
<P>
Toru Toyoda and Kenichi Hirose were sentenced to death after
they were found guilty on murder and attempted murder charges
while Shigeo Sugimoto received a life imprisonment sentence.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the ruling, Presiding Judge Manabu Yamazaki said
Toyoda and Hirose bear a huge amount of responsibility for the
attack which he called cruel and indiscriminate.
</P>
<P>
The judge said the cult started to espouse religious dogma
which justified murder after its founder, Shoko Asahara, suffered
a crushing defeat in the House of Representatives election in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the cult began to arm itself and Asahara ordered a
number of its senior members to produce sarin, the deadly nerve
gas used in the subway attack.
</P>
<P>
Yamazaki said the three defendants conspired with Asahara in
the subway gassing and other crimes instigated by the cult.
</P>
<P>
Toyoda and Hirose are the last of the five-member AUM squad
that carried out the subway attack. One of the other members
received life imprisonment and two have been sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
The attackers targeted five trains on the Tokyo subway system
March 20, 1995. During the morning rush hour, Toyoda and Hirose
released liquid sarin on two trains, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
Sugimoto served as a driver for Yasuo Hayashi, another member
of the squad.
</P>
<P>
The three defendants were also on trial in connection with
various other charges including an attempt to assassinate then
Tokyo Governor Yukio Aoshima by mailing a parcel bomb to the Tokyo
metropolitan government office in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
The package exploded when Aoshima's secretary opened it,
causing the secretary to lose all the fingers of his left hand,
the ruling said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi President Delivers Address on Revolution Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
delivered his annual nationwide address to commemorate the 32nd
anniversary of the revolution on July 17, 1968, which brought the
Arab Baath Socialist Party to power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The president touched upon the glory of the revolution, which
overthrew the then military government.
</P>
<P>
Before the July revolution, Iraq can be described as a "
wasteland," said Saddam, adding that the revolution led Iraq to the
light and enabled Iraqis to give free rein to their potentials.
</P>
<P>
Saddam was the power behind the revolution and Ahmed Hassan Al-
Baker became president. Eleven years later, Saddam came to power
and has ruled Iraq since then.
</P>
<P>
In his highly philosophical address, Saddam made little
reference to Iraq's current situation, or gave any hint that Iraq
would allow the United Nations arms inspectors back.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts point out that Saddam has told the Iraqis,
rather ambiguously, that they will have to continue to live under
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions ever since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, and arms inspections on Iraq have been suspended after
the U.S. and Britain launched the Desert Fox Operation air strikes
against the country in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
One day before the annual event, Iraqi Vice President Taha
Yassin Ramadan condemned the U.S. domination in the U.N. Security
Council and vowed that Iraq will never yield to the U.S..

Othman Ismail arrived in Cairo Monday on a brief visit for talks on
ways of pushing forward the reconciliation process in Sudan under
an Egyptian-Libyan initiative.
</P>
<P>
Ismail will discuss with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa
arrangements for a dialog between the Sudanese government and the
opposition, which is aimed at realizing peace in Sudan, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed last year a five-point peace plan,
which calls for permanent ceasefire between the Sudanese government
and the southern Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), and a peace
conference grouping all the concerned parties to seek national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arab
radio earlier Monday, Ismail said in Khartoum that he will apprise
Egypt of the Sudanese government's decision to take part in a
preparatory meeting for the peace conference.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Sudanese National Democratic Alliance (NDA),
which groups northern Muslim opposition parties and the SPLA, has
also agreed to attend the meeting, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese official voiced hope that the meeting including the
conflicting parties would be made a success to pave the way for
reaching a comprehensive political solution to the Sudanese crisis
and restore peace and stability in the largest African country.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese opposition political parties want to share power
with the government while the SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for
greater autonomy for the mostly Christian and animist south. The
civil war and war-related disasters have left millions of people
dead and displaced.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been keen on helping Sudan realize peace and
territorial integrity, for in fear that a possible disintegration
of Sudan will endanger its major water source, the Nile.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Afghan King's Team Arrives for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of former Afghan
king Zahir Shah arrived here on Monday for talks with Pakistani
officials on the convening of the traditional Afghan "Loya Jirga"
(grand assembly) to find out a peaceful solution of Afghan
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Hedayat Amin Arsala, former Afghan Foreign Minister, is leading
the four-member delegation, which will begin talks with Pakistani
officials and Islamabad-based diplomats on Tuesday, sources from
Afghan embassy here told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Pakistani Foreign Office said that Zahir Shah'
s team is scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar too
during their stay in Islamabad. The Loya Jirga team will convey a
message from Zahir Shah to the Pakistani leaders, seeking support
for his peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Zahir Shah, who has been living in exile in Rome for years,
constituted a number of teams for talks with various countries to
seek support for the proposed Loya Jirga to involve Afghans in
determining the future set-up in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The Arsala team will proceed to Afghanistan to hold talks with
the ruling Taliban militia and the opposition alliance United
Front.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sattar last month said that Pakistan
would support the Loya Jirga if Afghans backed the idea.
</P>
<P>
However, Talibans are strongly opposing the former king's plan
while the opposition has hinted support. Taliban's envoy in New
York Abdul Hakim Mujahid in a recent interview rejected the
proposal of the Loya Jirga and ruled out any role for Zahir Shah
in the future Afghan set-up.

<HEADLINE> Manila Continues Negotiations for Hostages' Release: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government negotiators
said Monday that they are continuing to work for the safe release
of hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf in the southern Philippine
island province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Chief negotiator Robert Aventajado said in a radio interview
that they will use only a mutually agreed upon set of go-betweens
in the negotiation to avoid confusion in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, also chairman of the presidential flagship projects
committee, said go-betweens are now being tapped for the
negotiations over the release of the mostly foreign hostages held
by the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo island in Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said the go-betweens will be used to relay details
of the negotiations with Abu Sayyaf leader Ghalib Andang (or
Commander Robot), who cannot use a satellite phone he has borrowed,
for long periods.
</P>
<P>
He said Commander Robot is using a satellite phone owned by a
French journalist whom the Abu Sayyaf took hostage.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf abducted 21 Filipino and foreign hostages in a
diving resort in Malaysia on April 23 and took them to Sulu
province.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have released two Malaysian hostages in what
officials described as a "goodwill gesture."
</P>
<P>
However, the Abu Sayyaf was said to have seized 13 Christian
evangelists who traveled to their camp in Patikul, Sulu, on July 1.
</P>
<P>
One German journalist and three French journalists who went
there to interview the original hostages were also reportedly
abducted by the group recently.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to speak through a satellite phone. It is better
that I just talk to him and he would be responsible for relaying
to his fellow leaders what we have talked about," Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
He said the French journalist's satellite phone line has not
been cut off so far. A go-between was sent recently to give a
battery pack to Commander Robot.
</P>
<P>
On evangelist Wilde Almeda, Aventajado said the preacher was
not being held hostage but has chosen to stay there.
</P>
<P>
Citing Commander Robot's claims, Aventajado said Almeda and his
"prayer warriors" have decided to fast for 40 days during their
stay at the camp. Ten of them are taking on water, while three are
subsisting only on fruits.
</P>
<P>
He said Commander Robot told him the evangelists are free to go
if they wish to.
</P>
<P>
"I asked Robot if he would let them go if they wanted to go. He
said yes," Aventajado said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing 737-200 aircraft
which crashed in north India early Monday morning was 20 years old,
Indian Civil Aviation Secretary A H Jung said here.
</P>
<P>
"The aircraft is of 1980 vintage," Jung told the press in
response to questions.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which belonged to Alliance Air, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Indian Airlines, was on its way from Calcutta to
Patna, capital of Bihar state, when it crashed into a row of
houses near Patna, killing 51 people on board and three others on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance Air owns 12 737-200s including the crashed one,
and the average age of these 12 aircraft is about 18 years, the
Press Trust of India quoted aviation industry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The mandatory life span of the Boeing 737-200 planes is about
15 years and the Seattle-based Boeing Company has stopped building
this kind of aircraft about 15 years ago, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The crashed aircraft, which joined the Indian Airlines fleet in
June 1980, had flown 44,087 hours before crash, and it had
undergone a major check at the Boeing aircraft base in Delhi on
June 21 last year, sources with the Indian Airlines revealed.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korean National Assembly (
parliament) Speaker Lee Man-sup on Monday proposed an inter-Korean
parliamentary meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the ceremony to mark the 52nd anniversary of the
Constitution Day at the parliament, Lee urged the parliament
members of South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) to join forces in taking the lead to open an era of
inter-Korean reconciliation and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"We now have a task which cannot be further delayed. That is
for the representatives of the National Assembly (of South Korea)
and the Supreme People's Assembly (of the DPRK), which represent
the peoples of South and North Koreas respectively, get together
to discuss the paths for the nation to pursue and soothe the
bitter sentiments and wounds created in the past half century," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lee also said that South Korea will come up with measures in
which lawmakers of South Korea and the DPRK could freely discuss
the future of the nationality.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling and opposition parties in South Korea will form
a special committee on inter-Korean relations, a preparatory
committee for inter-Korean parliamentary meeting and a working-
level task force to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
The speaker urged both the ruling and opposition parties to
refrain from damaging the grand project for national unification.

"The ruling and opposition parties and the government should
not respond to small and trivial matters with nervousness," added
the top legislator.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Raze 12,500 Hectares of Land in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires have devoured a total
of 12,500 hectares of land in Turkey so far this year, 12 times
that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-three forest fires, which burned in three days last week,
destroyed 3,000 hectares of land alone, said Forestry Minister Nami
Cagan in Adana, southern Turkey, over the weekend, the country's
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the intense fires to high temperatures, low
humidity and strong winds in the forest regions.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is undergoing an immense heat wave that has lasted for
two weeks. While the heat was breaking century-old records, forest
fires were raging at a rate of one per half-hour on Thursday. Many
fires surged at midday when the temperatures sprang above 40
degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that almost all the southern European regions
had been on fires these days and forest fires are still raging
unabated in some countries.
</P>
<P>
In Turkey, however, forest fires, albeit ferocious, had been put
under control thanks to the great efforts by the authorities at
various levels, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Cagan warned against loosening forest fire
vigilance, saying that his ministry was taking additional
precautions against forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Forest watchmen working in eastern and southern regions would be
appointed as forest protection wardens, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, rich in forest resources, comparatively-speaking, in the
Middle East, has a total of 26 percent of lands covered with
forests, according to official figures.

<HEADLINE> Prison Violence under Investigation in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish authorities are
investigating whether or not security forces have abused inmates,
Turkish Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The investigation was launched following allegations that one
female prisoner was raped and another male prisoner lost his arm
when security forces quelled a prison uprising recently, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that security forces stormed into a prison in
the city of Burdur in southwestern Turkey on July 5 after inmates
barricaded themselves inside their wards to prevent the forces from
taking 11 leftist prisoners to testify in court.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the inmates said that security forces used
bulldozers to break into the wards, injuring several of the inmates
and causing one prisoner to lose his arm.
</P>
<P>
A female inmate was also raped by prison officials after the
standoff, according to reports of the Radikal daily.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry confirmed a probe into the prison violence
has been launched but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Human Rights Commission had previously warned
officials of a possible riot in Burdur Prison in a report prepared
by the commission on last year's Ulucanlar Prison riot in Ankara,
Radikal reported.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a cautionary note that serious events may
take place if necessary precautions are not taken in Burdur Prison.
</P>
<P>
Ankara's Ulucanlar Prison was the scene of a bloody uprising
last year which claimed the lives of 10 inmates.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, an investigation was launched over prisoner
riots which have been often seen in recent years in the country,
and some of the inmates in Ulucanlar Prison were transferred to
Burdur Prison.
</P>
<P>
The uprising at Burdur, along with several others in prisons
across Turkey over the past few years, was sparked by government
efforts to transfer prisoners from large and crowded cells to
smaller, two-or three-person rooms.
</P>
<P>
Inmates said the transfers left prisoners more vulnerable to
beatings and other abuses.
</P>
<P>
But the government said the new system is needed to better
control inmates and break up the groups of Kurdish, leftist and
Islamist dissidents which presently command the wards.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the Inmate Families' Solidarity
Association have started a hunger strike in southern Izmir in a bid
to protest the new system in the prisons that the government was
trying to implement.
</P>
<P>
Families of inmates were also urging the government to identify
those who were really responsible for the Burdur riot and punish
them.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 150,000 Israeli demonstrators converged on Tel
Aviv's Rabin Square Sunday night to protest against Prime Minister
Ehud Barak making broad concessions to the Palestinians at the Camp
David summit. Some reports said it was one of the largest
demonstrations ever held in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a strident speech, Likud leader Ariel Sharon stepped up his
attacks on Barak's policies toward the Palestinians. He accused the
premier of leading the nation into a dangerous and irreversible
process of compromise.
</P>
<P>
Speaker after speaker reiterated this sentiment, which could be
summed up by the stickers that many in the crowd were wearing:
"Peace yes. Suckers no."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak rejected an American "
bridging proposal" to set the border between Israel and a
Palestinian state, which would be based on an exchange of
territories across both sides of the 1967 Green Line, Israeli
sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
As regards the refugee question, Barak is ready to consider
Israeli recognition of United Nations Resolution 194, which alludes
to the refugees' right of return and is so far vehemently rejected
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton is pushing to wrap up the Camp
David summit or to be able to issue a declaration about its
progress by the time he leaves for a G-8 economic summit in Japan
on Wednesday, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Although Barak has made it clear to Clinton he feels more time
is needed, Clinton is keen to make some sort of statement by the
time of his scheduled departure on July 19, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to one source, Clinton re-introduced bridging
proposals on all the main issues Sunday, and is waiting for
feedback from the sides Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Likud Knesset (Parliament) faction will not support
Monday's no-confidence motions in the government sponsored by
National Union-Yisrael Beiteinu and Herut-National Movement.
</P>
<P>
Likud faction whip Reuven Rivlin said Sunday he will advise his
fellow legislators to abstain when the motions are voted on in the
plenum.
</P>
<P>
Rivlin said that in spite of his party's lack of faith in the
government, the party believes those motions should be postponed
out of respect for the prime minister who is abroad on state
matters.

<HEADLINE> Phreatic Explosions May Occur Anytime At Mt. Mayon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine volcanologists have said
that phreatic or steam-driven explosions may still occur anytime
due to contract of rainwater with still-hot lava and pyroclastic
deposits at the summit of Mayon Volcano.
</P>
<P>
This warning was issued by the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) after it has observed that
Mayon Volcano at the southeastern tip of Luzon island exhibited a
phreatic explosion Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The event was visible only from the east of the volcano. A
small volume of grayish ash was produced and steam clouds rose
about 1,000 meters above the summit crater before drifting to the
north-northeast.
</P>
<P>
Helma Canon, of Phivolcs observatory based at Legazpi city,
Albay province, said the seismographs recorded relatively short-
duration explosion type seismic signal that lasted for one minute
and 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Canon said that in view of the observations, the Phivolcs
warned the public to avoid entering the six-kilometer radius
permanent danger zone due to instability of the upper slopes and
crater area.
</P>
<P>
Further, she stressed that although Mayon Volcano is under zero
alert level, phreatic explosion may still occur anytime. Likewise,
trek to the upper slopes or near the crater should be prohibited
at this time until further notice, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs official said that residents of low-lying areas
and near major river channels are also advised to be aware on
lahar flows which may transport life-threatening volcano debris to
their areas.

JOHANNESBURG -- South African Foreign Affairs Minister
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Sunday that the envisaged "United
States of Africa" would replace the current Organization of
African Unity (OAU), and would focus on the economic regeneration
of the continent as well as on political matters.
</P>
<P>
The new body would not take on the form of a federation of
African countries, but would instead be a loose union with member
states retaining their own sovereignty, cabinets and ministers,
Zuma told the South African Broadcasting Corporation's Newsmaker
Program. She said the envisaged body could not be likened to the
United States of America, but rather to the European Union. (

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Still Supports Ousted Fijian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is continuing to
back ousted Fijian Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and will take
his advice before taking action against Fiji, according to the
Evening Post.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper Monday reported that New Zealand
Prime Minister Helen Clark spoke to Chaudhry by phone Sunday night
to offer her continuing support and ask for his views on what New
Zealand should do in response to the overthrow of his government.
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly speaking to him with the respect he is due as
a democratically elected Prime Minister," Clark was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
She said Chaudhry told her the situation in Fiji is "extremely
dangerous. There is no effective law and order."
</P>
<P>
Clark said her cabinet will not make a final decision on
imposing sanctions against Fiji until interim president Josefa
Iloilo, appointed to his post by the Great Council of Chiefs last
week, names his new government.
</P>
<P>
But the New Zealand government has already announced it would
cut aid and military ties, extend the ban on sports visas, and
reduce political and diplomatic relations if there are "no signs
of a return to democracy" in the troubled country.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, Clark also formally offered
Chaudhry refuge in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Chaudhry was grateful for the offer and was considering his
options, including whether he could play any role in rebuilding
Fiji," it said.

"I didn't know if it really came out of her mouth or if it had
just blown up in the media ... it wasn't like her to say such a
thing.
</P>

"The fact she emailed and wanted to continue our friendship was
great. Susie is an awesome athlete. I have no enemies. If I am on

the nice person that I am."

O'Neill made the "pretty suss" comment on June 9 after De
Bruijn had broken five world records and equaled another over 50

previous weeks.

"I'd like to think she's clean," O'Neill said at the time. "But

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Parliamentary Elections to be Held in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has said that the 11th parliamentary elections will be
held in the first week of November after the adopotion of the new
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parliament members on Sunday, Kumaratunga said
the present parliament would be dissolved on August 24 and
elections would be held according to democratic constitutional
process.
</P>
<P>
She called on them to help the government to hold fair and free
elections for the welfare of the people.
</P>
<P>
But she also asked them to be fair during the elections and not
to obstruct the government's opponents nor to place stumbling
blocks on the government's progressive measures.
</P>
<P>
Noting that her government was determined to isolate the rebel
Tamil Tigers, who have been fighting for 17 years for an
independent Tamil state, she however promised legal and political
rights for the minorities.
</P>
<P>
The present government's term in office ends this year with
elections scheduled for November. President Kumaratunga herself
could have continued in office till the end of this year
originally, though last year's presidential elections she called
won her a further term of six years.
</P>
<P>
Her government has been saddled with the separatist war in the
North and East of the country. To resolve the issues it once came
up with a political package but could not go through with it as it
did not have the required two-third majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition United National Party has since had talks
with the government and reached consensus for a new constitution
to devolve power to the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga sees this as a political solution to the country's
ethnic crisis and expects to win the support of the minorities by
isolating the rebel Tigers.
</P>
<P>
While this is considered a major political victory for her by
political observers, the rising cost of living with the recent
price hike of gas, diesel, electricity and telephone calls is
considered a stumbling block for her chances at the polls.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese companies have
respectively reached contracts with the Myanmar government to
build a textile mill and a pulp factory in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Monday's official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar, the contract for building the Pwintbyu textile mill in
Myanmar's central Magway division was signed here on Sunday
between the Tianjin Machinery Import and Export Corporation (Group)
of China and the Myanma Textile Industries of the Ministry of
Industry-1.
</P>
<P>
The other contract for building the Thabaung pulp factory in
the country's southwestern Ayeyawaddy division was signed on the

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Suspends Rice Imports As Election Approaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government said
Monday that it has suspended all imports of rice to the island
country with immediate effect as the general elections is around
the corner.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a statement said President Chandrika
Kumaratunga had taken the decision during the weekend following a
meeting with members of Parliament in the paddy growing areas. The
meeting focused on the plight of the farmers who were left with
unsold stocks of paddy from a record harvest during the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
The president felt that halting the rice imports for a few
months would enable the farmers to clear their stocks at a better
price, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The president's move is viewed as a vote-gathering strategy to
woo farmer voters as President Kumaratunga has announced that the
parliament will be dissolved on August 24 and the general
elections would be held during the first week of November.
</P>
<P>
Despite improved local paddy production of 2,868,000 tons, Sri
Lanka imported 214,200 tons of rice in 1999, an increase of 28
percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Violence Claims More Lives in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A trail of violence in Ambon,
capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, left at least nine persons
dead and scores injured on Sunday as security forces seemed
helpless to stop rioters despite the enactment of the civil
emergency status.
</P>
<P>
Two of those killed on Sunday were a woman and a four-year-old
girl who had sought refuge in a house in Batu Gantung Dalam, which
was blasted with mortars. Another seven persons were killed in
separate incidents across the city, according to Jakarta Post
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most victims died from gunshot wounds, mortars, grenades or
bomb shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
"Dozens of others were probably killed or injured as the sniper
attacks are rampant. Gunfire and explosions are still heard
everywhere and have not stopped in four days," a local journalist
reported.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's violence brought the death toll in a week of fracas to
28. Nearly 100 have died since the implementation of the civil
emergency status on June 27. Hundreds more are wounded and
thousands have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
The spice islands of Maluku have been wrecked by communal
clashes since early 1999. Thousands of people were either killed
or wounded and hundreds of public buildings destroyed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some residents in Ambon have expressed
concern that security forces have not been able to stop the
violence which is openly taking place in public place.
</P>
<P>
Some have also accused security forces of abetting the violence
by supplying weapons.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono recently admitted there were
some elements of the Army stationed in Maluku who have "
facilitated" or exacerbated the violence.
</P>
<P>
The latest spate of violence erupted not long after the arrival
of more than 2,000 hard-line Muslim fighters from outside the
islands, intent on waging a jihad (holy war) against Christians.
</P>
<P>
The Navy Sunday announced it had deployed eight more warships
to the Maluku islands in a bid to patrol the waters to intercept
rioters smuggling weapons to the islands.
</P>
<P>
Last month the Navy had caught 19 boats trying to smuggle
weapons into Maluku.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab Sunday reiterated that
the government would not tolerate any kind of foreign intervention
in strife-torn areas across the country.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that foreign countries could provide humanitarian
aid through the government or other domestic organizations without
having to send foreign staff into the areas.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Hard Hit by Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- It is raining season in Nicaragua,
but severe drought has swept over this central American country,
affecting seed sowing in its northern and western provinces.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Nicaragua's national agriculture and stock-
raising association said drought has hit provinces of Esteli,
Madriz, Chinandega, Leon, Boaco and Matagalpa to various degrees,
where grain production is put in a very difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
Esteli province was the hardest hit, with 18,700 hectares of
kidney bean, corn or sorghum, nearly 80 percent of its farmland,
being unable to sow due to the lack of rainfall, an official of
the association said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that more than 2,000 hectares of farmland in
Chinandega have not been sown, and so has half of the land in Leon,
due to the adverse weather.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that drought-afflicted provinces will
face shortage of food this year.

74 million.
</P>
<P>
Business travel reported the most rapid increase rate of 40
percent, according to a local tourism official.

<P>
Meanwhile, the city has exerted great efforts to promote the
tourism market and enhance interprovincial cooperation in the
tourism sector.

<P>
Last year, the city's tourism revenues hit 8.3 billion yuan (
one billion US dollars), accounting for 14 percent of its GDP of

<HEADLINE> Building Industry to be Upgraded in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The building materials industry in
China is expected to be upgraded in the next five years, with new
materials and foreign cash being injected into the sector.
</P>
<P>
Traditional materials like cement and glass will grow at a slow
pace while new building materials and non-metallic materials will
grow fast in the 10th Five-Year Plan period (2001-2005), today's
China Daily quoted Zeng Xuemin, an official with the State
Administration of Building Materials Industry as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's GDP will maintain a high growth rate in the next five
years and the fixed asset investment is expected to increase at
double-digit figures, said Zeng.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to build 1.8 billion square meters of housing
annually in the five years. "All this will create a stronger
domestic demand for building materials," he said.
</P>
<P>
China will support the development of cement industry which
uses the new dry method and raise this kind of cement production
by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country will also give key support to the development of
new wall materials and use them to replace the clay bricks in 160
large and medium-sized cities in three years, Zeng added.
</P>
<P>
Overseas fund will be mainly used to produce new building
materials and equipment to make those materials, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Legislators Call For Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- All 11 factions of Indonesian
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest
decision-making body, Sunday declared a unified stance and vowed
to reduce mounting political tension ahead of the Assembly's
annual session next month.
</P>
<P>
In a four-point statement, faction leaders said that the
escalating political tension had created "uncertainties" that are
detrimental to the country's effort to recover from
multidimensional crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We, therefore, believe that there should be a deliberate
effort to reduce political tension among the political elites and
the public," Soetjipto, chairman of the Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle faction, said, reading the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that there have been differences of opinion should
not affect (our) commitment to maintain the country's unity," he
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The factions also called on the political elites "to prioritize
the interests of the nation and state, and not to put their egos
and respective interests over the interests of the public. To
develop a healthy democracy, all parties should always avoid the
use of anarchy, mass tyranny and political violence," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as tension sharpened between the government
and the legislature. The political divisiveness was also regarded
as a major factor in pressing the rupiah into a 21-month low and
weakening share prices at the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid is due to appear before the
Assembly in August to account for his nine months in office.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees Some Progress at Camp David </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Sunday that there had been "some progress" at Camp David
peace talks but he was still uncertain whether the summit could
succeed with a framework agreement for a final settlement of the
52-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
"There's been some progress, but I can't say I know we'll
succeed," he said in an interview with the New York Daily News.
</P>
<P>
According to a transcript of the interview released by the
White House, Clinton said "I'm more optimistic than I was when
they got here."
</P>
<P>
The president, who has shuttled to mediate between Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
since Tuesday, said the issues dividing the Israelis and
Palestinians were the most difficult he had ever tried to help
resolve.
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard. My heart goes out to them ... It's the hardest
thing that I have ever seen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, some Palestinian sources at Camp David also
signaled some progress in the talks but Israeli officials
immediately dismissed it as "baseless" and "rumors".
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israelis have met at the Camp David
presidential retreat since Tuesday to try to resolve the most
vexing issues in the 52-year dispute: the borders of a Palestinian
state, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian
refugees and Jewish settlers in the West Bank.

PARIS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian Marco Pantani posted his

WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States conceded a
last-minute goal for a 1-1 tie in its opener of the World Cup
qualifying tournament in the North and Central American and the
Caribbean region in Guatemala Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In its road game at Mazatenango, the United States was beaten
in the 88th minute by Carlos Ruiz after a first half goal scored
by Ante Razov in injury time.
</P>
<P>
The Americans dominated the first half by outshooting Guatemala
7-2 before the hosts outshot the visitors 14-3 in the second half
in front of a heated crowded audience.
</P>
<P>
"We earned an important point on the road," U.S. coach Bruce
Arena said. "It wasn't something we weren't expecting. Winning
at home and taking points on the road is what World Cup qualifying
is all about."
</P>
<P>
The game originally was scheduled for Guatemala City but was
moved by the home team to this inland town.
</P>
<P>
The top two nations in each of the three semi-final groups
advance to the six-nation finals of the CONCACAF region wherein
three berths are alloted for the 2002 World Cup to be co-hosted by
South Korea and Japan.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Marion Jones kept her hopes
alive for five titles in this year's Olympic Games by winning the
women's long jump in the U.S. national Olympic trials in
Sacramento Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jones, a sure bet for the 100m and 200m events, jumped to her
year's best of 7.02 meters in her last attempt, beating Dawn
Burrell to second at 6.96 meters.
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting for that jump all year," Jones said. "That
it came at the Olympic trials is great. I'll be ready for Sydney.
"
</P>
<P>
Yet, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, 38, failed to materialize her dream
of competing for the record-tying fifth consecutive Olympics as
the 1988 Olympic gold medalist and winner of six Olympic medals
finished sixth overall in the trials.
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, who made the final in fourth place at 6.67
meters, didn't come close to duplicating that distance with the
best distance recorded on her first attempt at 6.38 meters.
</P>
<P>
"The reason I'm not disappointed is I've been to four Olympics,
" said Joyner-Kersee who came out of a two-year retirement. "I
was hoping to go to five, but it didn't pan out."
</P>
<P>
Jones took her first step toward the unprecedented five-gold
medal haul by winning Saturday's 100 meters. She will try and
complete a trials triple by winning the 200m event next weekend.
</P>
<P>
At the Olympic Games, her five-event performance also would
include the 400m and 1,600m relay.

MEXICO CITY, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A pair of goals from striker
Carlos Pavon lead Honduras to a humiliating 5-2 home defeat on
bitter rivals El Salvador in a World Cup qualifier on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Defender Samuel Caballero, Dany Turcios and David Suazo scored
the other goals as Honduras came from behind in the opening match
of CONCACAF semifinal group D.
</P>
<P>
There seemed no hint of the impending rout when Elias Montes
hooked home from close range in the seventh minute to put El
Salvador in front.
</P>
<P>
But Honduras took control after Caballero headed their
equaliser five minutes later. And two goals in five minutes gave
the visitors a 3-1 lead by halftime after they had dominated the
first half.
</P>
<P>
Pavon scored a brilliant fourth in the 62nd minute from a pass
by Julio Cesar Leon before substitute Suazo burst through the
defence to make it 5-1 in the 88th minute. Mauricio Cienfuegos
pulled a goal back for El Salvador one minute later.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Approves More Overseas-funded Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing approved the
establishment of 534 new overseas-funded enterprises during the
first half of this year, with 40 joint ventures involving more
than 10 million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Beijing vice mayor Zhang Mao at a recent
seminar attended by more than 200 representatives of Beijing-based
foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen existing projects had also added investment surpassing
10 million U.S. dollars each during the six-month period, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
The overseas-funded businesses in Beijing realized a total
industrial output of 38 billion yuan (nearly 4.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first five months this year, up 35.9 percent on
yearly basis, with exports soaring 85 percent to reach 910 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
These businesses have witnessed a growth of 40 percent in sales,
which hit 58.4 billion yuan during the five-month period. They
turned in 3.77 billion yuan in taxation, up 34.1 percent compared
with the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> More Support for Township Enterprises: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Township and village enterprises
should be given more support by the government to sustain their
competitive strength in the global market, an Agriculture official
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises, which contributed 37.8 percent of all
Chinese exports in 1999, are in weaker conditions compared with
State firms, today's China Daily reported in a front-page story.
</P>
<P>
"Township firms contributed 30.3 percent to the country's GDP
in 1999, however, the amount of loans granted to them accounted
for less than 5 percent of the country's total," said Chen
Jianguang, an official with the ministry's Township Management
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, over 1,000 township companies have met the
requirement to get listed, but only 40 of them have been approved
to do so, accounting for a small 4 percent of the country's total
listed companies.
</P>
<P>
"If the country enters the World Trade Organization (WTO) as
expected, rural firms will play an even bigger role with more
government support in the financial and foreign trade sector,"
said Chen.
</P>
<P>
More than 130,000 township enterprises were engaged in foreign
trade businesses last year, with export goods valued at 774.4
billion yuan (93.3 billion U.S. dollars), the paper said.
</P>
<P>
These companies have so far conducted business with more than 6,
600 firms abroad, with an accumulative investment of 8.8 billion
yuan (1.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Most of these industries are labor-intensive and are able to
adapt to market changes since they have weathered intense
competition domestically," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen said a fair and sound environment is needed for township
enterprises to further prosper in foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Raises Taxi Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Taxi passengers in Beijing will
pay more as of today when the taxi administration has raised taxi
fares to compensate for a rise in oil prices, today's China Daily
reports.
</P>
<P>
For a taxi charging 1.2 yuan (0.14 U.S. dollar) per kilometer,
the basic fare of 10 yuan will be charged at 4 kilometers instead
of the previous 5 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The distance is cut from 4 to 3 kilometers for 1.6-yuan and 2-
yuan per kilometer taxis.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing taxi administration official said the change was
aimed to reduce the financial burden upon taxi drivers caused by
the oil price rise.
</P>
<P>
Beginning July 14, the factory price for gasoline was raised by
200 yuan per ton, and that of diesel by 180 yuan per ton.

<HEADLINE> Part of WB-Backed River Harnessing Scheme Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 17 (Xinhua) --A special ceremony was held
recently in this capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, to mark the completion of the first phase of a
World Bank-financed scheme to harness a local river.
</P>
<P>
Huang Fenglian, a woman who has been living on Chaoyang Creek,
the river, for more than half a century, was invited to cut the
ribbon in celebration of the completion.
</P>
<P>
Chaoyang Creek, with a length of 14 km, runs through downtown
areas of the regional capital. But the stinking water and
propagation of mosquitoes and flies from ever-growing trash heaps
and non-stop inflow of sewage into the river had turned the river
into an affliction for the 300,000 nearby residents.
</P>
<P>
The scheme to harness the river and surrounding environment
started in December 1997. The scheme requires construction of
more than 20 projects involving flood control, sewage treatment
and afforestation along the river banks, and will cost 800 million
yuan (about 96.39 million U.S. dollars), of which, 48 million U.S.
dollars will be covered by World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Already completed are projects on the western section of the
river. They include the dredging of three-km-long river course,
relocation of 3,590 residents, erection of a 7,284 m sewage
diversion pipeline, construction of three new scenic plazas and
the planting of 32,000 sq m of trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
The entire scheme will be finished in 2003.

<HEADLINE> More Than Half of State Enterprises Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Most of China's key state-owned
enterprises have made profits so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, director of the State Economy and Trade
Commission, said that 52.5 percent of the country's 6,599 big and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises and enterprises whose shares
are under state control have extricated themselves from their loss-
making predicament.
</P>
<P>
State enterprises in 22 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have made money, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 14 key industries, except for the coal and military
sectors, all have made profits, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Between January and May, state enterprises generated a record
62.9 billion yuan (about 7.8 billion U.S. dollars) of profits, 4.1
times that of the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government made a plan in 1998 that the reform of
state enterprises should achieve good results, and the enterprises
should extricate themselves from loss-making in three years.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said that the government's good policies have pushed
forward the reform and improved management, and the application of
high-technology have all benefited the money-losing companies.
</P>
<P>
China's state enterprises are a legacy of the planned economy
copied from the Soviet model in the 1950s.

<HEADLINE> One in Every Ten Guangxi Farmhouses Uses Biogas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- One in every ten farmhouses in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region uses biogas,
according to the latest figures from the regional energy office.
</P>
<P>
Renewable energy is replacing the traditional burning of
firewood to become the major fuel resource for household use in
this region, which lacks energy resources and the economy of which
depends mainly on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
More than 700,000 biogas generators have been installed in
ordinary farmhouses in Guangxi. They process human and livestock
waste into methane gas for cooking. This year, another 200,000
generators will be built, according to the regional government's
development plan.
</P>
<P>
"Cooking becomes easy with biogas, just pressing a button which
produces blue flame on the kitchen range," Liang Tianshu, a farmer
in Gaoren village said.
</P>
<P>
The popularization of the new energy source, which spread at a
annual rate of 35 percent last year, has been attributed to the
improved living standard in rural areas. In Gongcheng County,
where 70 percent of the local residents have used biogas, farmers
use the by-products of the biogas instead of chemicals to
fertilize their orchards. Fruit-growing brings in 1,600 yuan (
about 192 US dollars) of per-capita income a year.

<HEADLINE> Germany Takes FISA World Cup for Fourth Successive Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany has won the rowing World
Cup in Lucerne, Switzerland, for a fourth successive year with the
final overall points of 143 in the three-regatta event, according
to the International Rowing Federation (FISA).
</P>
<P>
Part of Germany's tally included maximum points from wins in
two individual boat classes. In the final held on Sunday, world
champions Jana Thieme and Katrin Boron won the women's double
sculls while world champion women's quadruple sculls were also
victorious in their boat class. Katrin Rutschow-Stomporowski
finished first equal in the points table in the women's single
with Ekaterina Karsten of Belarus, although the title went to
Karsten thanks to her victory in the Lucerne final.
</P>
<P>
Australia, fourth at last year's World Cup, cemented the second
place it achieved at the Vienna regatta, with a total of 100
points, while Britain stayed in third with 93. Romania was fourth,
Italy fifth and France sixth.
</P>
<P>
Vaclav Chalupa of the Czech Republic took the men's single
sculls title with consistent perfomances over the season - gold in
Munich and bronze in Vienna and Lucerne. The same was the case
for the Norwegian men's double who took the title over Munich and
Lucerne winners, Iztok Cop and Luka Spik of Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian women's eight snatched the title from Belarus
after an improvement in their performance saw them win Sunday's
final. And Britain had a firm grasp on the men's title after
their win on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The British men's coxless four won its third World Cup title,
despite not placing in the final. Wins in Munich and Vienna meant
they were certain of the title before the Lucerne final.
</P>
<P>
But the Danish lightweight coxless four were not so lucky.
Their three-year World Cup winning streak came to an end after the
injury of crew member Thomas Poulsen disrupted their season.
</P>
<P>
44 countries and regions have entered crews for the third and
final regatta of the Zurich Rowing World Cup which took place in
Lucerne from July 14-16.
</P>
<P>
A total of 825 rowers in 329 boats have raced on the scenic
Rotsee of Lucerne in a last chance to earn World Cup points and
the title of World Cup champion to be awarded on Sunday. The
impressive entry includes 25 world champions and 23 Olympic gold
medalists.
</P>
<P>
"This regatta represents the last international encounter for
the rowers before the all-important Olympic regatta in Sydney so
we are expecting some excellent racing," said Matt Smith, FISA's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
The FISA Rowing World Cup, created in 1997, is an annual team
competition comprising three regattas staged at three week
intervals and featuring the fourteen Olympic boat classes racing
over a classic 2000 meters distance.
</P>
<P>
Points are awarded to the highest placing boats at each regatta
in the fourteen Olympic boat classes. A winning federation is
declared after each regatta and an overall Rowing World Cup
winning federation is declared at the end of the three regattas.
Eight points are awarded to the winners of each World Cup event,
six for second, five for third, four for fourth, three for fifth,
two for sixth and one for winning the B final (the seventh).
</P>
<P>
This year's regattas of the series were in Munich (June 1-3),
Vienna (June 23-25) and the final in Lucerne (July 14-16).

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Rainstorms in Central China's
Henan Province over the past few days have decreased crude oil
production in the Central China Oilfield by over 500 tons.
</P>
<P>
A total of 261 roads in the oilfield have been swamped, and
water flooded 28 oil wells and 225 drilling sites, halting work at
229 wells.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the heavy rain in the province has brought floods to
80 percent of its area, affecting 19.892 million people.
Altogether, 122,300 houses have so far collapsed in the flood-hit
areas, with direct economic losses estimated at 7.82 billion yuan
(about 938 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The province is now making every effort to reduce economic
losses and help local residents get through this extremely serious
natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
Henan is China's most populous province, and also one of the
country's key grain crop bases.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Warns Liberia not to Support S. Leone Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior United States official
Monday warned Liberian President Charles Taylor of serious
consequences if Liberia continues to support rebels in neighboring
Sierra Leone, according to reports from the British Broadcasting
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas
Pickering said in Liberian capital Monrovia that Liberia's
relations with the U.S. would be seriously affected if the west
African country did not change its stance on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Pickering made the remarks after his meeting with Taylor in
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that there were strong indications that Liberia
was the primary patron and benefactor of rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone, especially in the field of
illegal gun-running and diamond-smuggling.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the Liberian government, with Taylor
personally involved, is the biggest buyer of Sierra Leone's
diamond produced by the RUF, who traded the diamond with armament
in the nine-year-old civil war in this war-torn country.

Chavez told journalists when being consulted regarding supposed

"There is an Armed Force in function of the country's
development, of people's peace and tranquillity", Chavez said

certain individualities inside NAF that used by desperate persons
that do not want to enter into positive changes ."

In recent weeks, active and retired military men identified
with the opposition have insisted there exists a supposed "saber

in army affairs.

Three weeks ago, National Guard (militarized police) captain
Luis Eduardo Garcia Morales asked Chavez to renounce Venezuela's

Trade and stabilization will be promoted as the concrete
preparation for the summit that pools the 15 EU nations with
Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, the Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro and the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Consideration is being made of inviting Bulgaria, Hungary,
Romania and the Czech Republic to the summit to be held at the
Croatian tourist resort of Dubrovnik.
</P>
<P>
Prodi described his discussion with Mesic as frank and the
relations between the EU and Croatia as in the beginning of a good
political and economic season.

With this accord they hope to open "right away" a free trade

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Putin to Discuss Missile Program with DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Monday
that it hoped Russian President Vladimir Putin would discuss with
the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) its
missile program, over which Washington shows grave concern despite
its own plan of deploying the theater missile defense system in
the region.
</P>
<P>
President Putin will make a state visit to the DPRK Wednesday
and hold talks with DPRK leader Kim Jong-Il before his departure
for Okinawa to attend a G8 summit.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton's deputy national security adviser, Jim
Steinberg, said Putin's visit to Pyongyang would make a positive
contribution to regional security.
</P>
<P>
"We very much hope and expect that when President Putin meets
with Kim Jong-Il, he will reiterate the message the rest of the
international community is giving, which is one to welcome steps
towards reconciliation between North and South (Koreas) and to
encourage North Korea to take steps to deal particularly with its
missile program," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Putin implied, but did not directly spell out, that
he would raise the DPRK's missile program when holding talks with
Kim Jong-Il. But he also made it very clear that Russia opposes
the U.S. anti-missile plan in the region.

</P>
<P>
Foreign Office Minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, will co-host the

He said his office have worked very hard to build productive
relationships with local administrations in Britain to ensure

WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
condemned the murder of a Spanish city councilman, saying it was
cowardly terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Jose Maria Martin Carpena, a member of Spain's ruling Popular

"The perpetrators of this recent horrible crime, during which
Carpena was shot six times in the head at close range in front of
his wife and daughter, must be brought to justice," Boucher said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Claims It's No.1 Online Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft said Monday that it
had 201 million users of its Internet services worldwide in June,
surpassing America Online and Yahoo as the most popular network of
destinations on the Web.
</P>
<P>
Internet audience data have usually been provided by
independent rating services whose counts do not cover all
countries with Internet users. In the U.S. market, Microsoft
Network (MSN) is generally listed third in independent rankings,
behind AOL and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said that the figure of 201 million is based on its
own records of activity on multiple Web sites associated with the
MSN brand.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Yahoo said that its own count of worldwide users
made it "the leading global, branded Web network." According to a
most recent report from Internet audience measurement firm Media
Metrix, AOL's properties saw 72.2 million unique visitors in March,
followed by Microsoft's sites and Yahoo's.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft entered the online market in 1995 and has been trying
to expand its services abroad since. In May, MSN said it will
spend 90 million U.S. dollars in Asia to offer new services and
expand its marketing. But most analysts believe Yahoo has so far
the largest international presence and strongest brand outside the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Bush to Visit Democratic-leaning States before Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush said Monday that he will travel around
Arkansas and four other Democratic-leaning states before the party
's convention later this month.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to win this state," Bush declared at a news
conference in Arkansas, home state of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Arkansas, the Texas governor plans to travel by
plane and bus to Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia en
route to the July 31-Aug. 3 convention in Philadelphia. Clinton
won each of those five states in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Polls in those five states show Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore is behind Bush or in a dead heat. Bush hoped
that by traveling around these states, he can build the political
support on his way to the White House.
</P>
<P>
"The schedule tells you that few states that are traditionally
Democratic strongholds are up for grabs," said Republican
consultant Scott Reed.
</P>
<P>
But Gore's campaign shrugged off news of the Texas governor's
travel plans.
</P>
<P>
"He can go in any direction he wants to in terms of his travel,
but he better explain to the American people why he wants the
country to change course and take the country on a right-wing U-
turn, which is what his policies represent," Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane said.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's ambassador in
Mexico Marcus Kaiser said Monday that in July both countries began
trade talks, expecting they'll end in coming November in view of
signing a Free Trade Accord (FTA).
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said negotiations between Mexico and Switzerland
have been hastened since the trade accord with the European Union
represents competition for the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that on July 6 and 7, both nations began talks, which
they'll continue in September and October and by November the FTA
signing could take place.
</P>
<P>
He recalled his country's interest in a covenant with Mexico
was expressed by Switzerland's minister of economy two years ago,
when he paid a visit to Mexico, but official negotiations started
barely 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
He added that Swiss entrepreneurs fully trust in investing in
Mexico. Their investment is an average of 1 billion U.S. dollars,
which places their country in 14th place of foreign capital in the
Republic of Mexico.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Uruguay
placed the totality of its gold reserves in ingots in London to
obtain greater profitability, Rosario Medero of the bank said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The last consignment of 96,858 gold ounces in bars was
deposited last week on the London market, said Medero in
statements to the evening newspaper "Latest News."
</P>
<P>
In May and June Uruguay sent to that market 164,741 ounces in
ingots and bars. With the latest consignments, Uruguay has already
placed in London 261,528 gold ounces, equivalent to 72.4 million U.
S. dollars, which will bring in an interest of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Uruguay has already placed abroad a
total of 1,821,131 gold ounces and keeps in security vaults of
Central Bank 2,774 ounces in coins, which bear a historical value
above the gold content.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay has always kept high immobilized gold reserves. In
recent years, Uruguay lost about 500 million dollars due to the
fall of the metal's international prices.

<HEADLINE> Burundi's Major Rebel Group Leader Arrives in Arusha for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye,
leader of the rebel Hutu group of Forces for the Defense of
Democracy (FDD), a breakaway wing of the National Council for the
Defense of Democracy (CNDD), arrived in Tanzania's northern town
of arusha Tuesday afternoon to attend a new round of Burundi peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first time for the FDD rebel group leader to
attend the negotiations since they resumed in 1998. All the
Burundian warring party leaders attended the new round of the
negotiations which started on Monday with a view to ending the
seven-year-old civil conflicts in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
But, according to spokesman for the peace facilitation team
Hashim Mbita, the team has not received any reports from the other
rebel group, the National Liberation Force (FNL), a splinter of
the Hutu People's Liberation Party (PALIPEHUTU), on whether it
will attend the negotiations or not.
</P>
<P>
He also said the facilitation team on Monday distributed the
revised version of the draft peace agreement to all the attending
parties for comments.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the facilitation team said negotiators will be able
to submit comments on the draft accord this week, but that only
those considered useful will be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa arrived in Arusha
on Tuesday afternoon to attend a one-day regional summit to be
held on Wednesday on the process of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be addressed by mediator of the talks and
former South African President Nelson Mandela on the achievements
so far and several outstanding issues barring the warring 19
parties from reaching a final power-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
So far, the spokesman said, seven African heads of state,
including Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, Burundian
President Pierre Buyoya, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba and
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, have confirmed to attend
the summit.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Mandela is expected to hold talks with
leaders of various Burundian parties attending the Arusha
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced earlier this month that a peace deal would be
signed on July 20. However, his foundation announced last Sunday
that the date had been postponed to August 28 because of the late
and partial participation of belligerent groups that had not
previously been involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the tiny central African country has claimed at
least 200,000 lives, mostly civilians, since it began in October
1993 when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
Mandela took over as mediator last December from the late
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and has been trying to speed up
the talks, which have dragged on since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mandela invited all the Hutu rebel groups that had been
previously excluded to take part in the peace process.
Negotiations over the past 24 months in Arusha have worked out the
outlines of a peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Maps out Medium-Term Economic Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Finance Minister Katele
Kalumba on Tuesday unveiled his country's medium-term economic
program, aimed at achieving high and sustained economic growth and
reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
Kalumba told the three-day 12th Consultative Group (CG)
meeting beginning here Sunday that Zambia's macroeconomic
objectives for 2000-2002 are to achieve sustained economic growth
of 4-7 percent annually and further reduce inflation to 11.5
percent in 2002 from the current about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the growth prospects in the coming years
are premised on the increase in private sector investment in
mining, tourism, manufacturing and energy sectors and also in
exports of agricultural commodities.
</P>
<P>
In the mining sector, Kalumba noted that the completion of the
privatization of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) and a
projected increase in the world price of copper will contribute to
growth of output by 6.5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
In addition, spillover effects of growth in the mining sector
and a continuation of parastatal and privatization reform program
will spur growth in other sectors, mainly trade with 4.5 percent
and manufacturing with 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, the minister said the government will assist
small-scale farmers to increase agricultural production and
productivity through adoption of proven technological innovations
and provision of a strong linkage between farmers and farm support
organizations responsible for marketing, credit and farm input
supplies.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the energy sector the government's strategy is
to offer incentives and concessions to private sector to develop
hydropower generating plants and transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
In the tourism sector the government will construct accessible
and all weather road network in all priority development areas
that have high potential for tourism growth and development, said
Kalumba.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by 25 bilateral and multilateral
agencies, discussing the country's economic reform and poverty
reduction programs.
</P>
<P>
Zambian government ministers, parliament members and
representatives of civil societies also attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Women Allegedly Ill-treated in Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has accused Eritrea
of ill-treating Ethiopian women in the country, urging the
international community to help Ethiopians in Eritrea return home.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea deported 100 Ethiopian women from its port of Assab
last weekend, leaving them on the North Coast of Djibouti, the
semi-official Walta Information Center of Ethiopia quoted an
official of Djibouti as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian women, mostly domestic workers, had been detained
in "inhuman conditions for 17 days before being expelled," Obock
District Commissioner of Djibouti Kayad Rayaleh said, adding they
arrived wearing almost no clothes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Djiboutian official, the boat had crossed into
Djibouti territory without permission, forcing the Ethiopians to
disembark in low tide at night.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Embassy in Djibouti has called on the
international community, the International Committee of Red Cross
and human rights organizations to pay attention to the plight of
Ethiopians, and help them return home.
</P>
<P>
The deportees said that several women were forced by Eritrean
officials to abandon their children, whose fathers are languishing
inside Eritrean prisons.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a ceasefire agreement last month
after a two-year border war. The two countries have been accusing
each other of maltreating residents of opposite country in the
past few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Continue to Dominate Client Operating Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft will maintain its
dynasty in the client operating environment (COE) market for the
foreseeable future despite the enthusiasm for Linux, according to
a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
In fact, said the report from U.S. market research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC), in 1999 Microsoft Windows NT
Workstation revenue growth was larger than the overall market's
increase. According to IDC, NT Workstation revenue grew by 1.6
billion U.S. dollars while the overall market grew by only 1.53
billion dollars due to product declines that offset Microsoft's
growth.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, there is a lot of excitement surrounding Linux,
but so far this technology has failed to ignite a broad revolution
against Microsoft-dominated desktop world," said the report. "
Revenues from sales of Linux remain a single droplet compared with
the sea of cash that the Windows COE products generate."
</P>
<P>
Windows products generated about 87 percent of revenues in the
COE market in 1999, according to IDC. By 2004, NT Workstation and
Windows 2000 Professional will account for just shy of 85 percent
of all COE revenues.
</P>
<P>
IDC said that Linux will continue to make inroads into the
market, but not enough to alter the market segmentation
significantly. COE revenues generated from Linux and other open
source environments will increase from 36.9 million dollars in
1999 to 93.3 million dollars in 2004.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox announced Monday the names of his transition team that
will coordinate power transfer tasks before his taking of office.
</P>
<P>
The people designated will work from right now until November
30 and their objectives include making up of the budget for year
2001, said Fox, of the opposition Alliance for Change, to the
press.
</P>
<P>
Fox, winner of the July 2 elections, will take office on
December 1 as the first leader coming from the opposition in
Mexico that put an end to the 71 years of presidential monopoly by
the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
The former Coca-Cola executive has promised sweeping changes in
the way Mexico is governed, replacing past corrupt practices with
business-management efficiency.
</P>
<P>
For the past three decades, the changeover every six years has
been accompanied by political and economic turbulence. President
Ernesto Zedillo has made it his personal mission to end this
tradition.
</P>
<P>
Fox said he would name his cabinet at the end of next month or
in September but the unpaid transition team, heading various
commissions, would remain in place until Nov. 30.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the team may be included in his cabinet, he
added. Fox also included several former PRI members in his
transition team.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Claims It's No. One Destination on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. announced
Monday that it had become the top destination on the Internet with
201 million people around the globe visiting its MSN portal and
partner sites in June.
</P>
<P>
The software giant said its internal measurements showed that
its consumer sites linked to its MSN network had topped Yahoo and
America Online (AOL), its two largest competitors for Web traffic.
</P>
<P>
The statement was the first time Microsoft had publicly
released its Web traffic data and claimed the top spot, said
spokeswoman Kathy Gill.
</P>
<P>
Gill said the 201 million figure included the Hotmail e-mail
site, its Expedia travel service and other partner sites, but did
not include those visiting Microsoft.com for software updates.
</P>
<P>
Web traffic information has often been closely guarded by the
companies.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft decided to release its data after Yahoo last week
claimed it was "the world's leading global, branded Web network
with more than 156 million unique users worldwide during June,"
Gill said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Media Metrixthe, an independent research firm,
ranked AOL as the top Web destination in the United States, with
59.2 million visitors to its proprietary and websites in May,
followed by Microsoft with 49.3 million and Yahoo with 48.9
million. But it said Yahoo was by far the top advertising
destination on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Kill Sheep Linked to Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- About 376 sheep imported from
Europe will be killed and incinerated as a forewarning against the
possible spread of a disease connected to mad cow disease, U.S.
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sheep were in three flocks in Vermont, and tests showed
four of them were carrying a transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy (TSE), a type of ailment that causes scrapie in
sheep and mad cow disease in cattle, said officials with the
Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
The department decided to acquire and then kill the sheep, the
owners of which will be compensated and kill them. The carcasses
will be incinerated.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are to conduct tests to see what kind of TSE
infected the sheep.
</P>
<P>
The Vermont sheep flocks to be destroyed were built with sheep
imported from Belgium and the Netherlands in 1996. The Agriculture
Department learned in 1998 the sheep could have been exposed to
feed contaminated with mad cow disease.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Aims to Boost Computer Literacy in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Labor Ministry Monday
unveiled another project aimed at fighting joblessness and
boosting computer literacy in the south, saying that it intends to
provide computers and courses for up to 600,000 unemployed youths
over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Labor Vice-Minster Raffaele Morese made the announcement at a
conference here in Rome, saying that the scheme would teach the
young people to master computer skills, thereby increasing their
prospects of finding a job.
</P>
<P>
Those involved in the scheme would be given between five and 10
hours of basic training, he said, and would then be given a
computer to enable them to continue studying online at home.
</P>
<P>
The project would also provide online tutoring in English as
part of a general "youth literacy drive," said Morese, adding that,
according to a recent study, 37 percent of Italians have no
knowledge of a foreign language.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the course, those involved will receive a
certificate from the Labor Ministry, he said.
</P>
<P>
The initiative kicks off this autumn with 20,000 trainees, all
between 16 and 30 and unemployed for at least a year, Morese said,
adding that if the program is a success, the government's target
is to train 600,000 by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Labor Ministry was also examining the
possibility of allowing those involved in the initiative to buy
their computers at "knocked-down prices" once they have completed
the course.
</P>
<P>
Later, Morese touched upon the problem of the hidden economy in
the south, saying that the "fight against the underground economy
is sacrosanct."
</P>
<P>
The Mezzogiorno, as southern Italy is known, has traditionally
relied heavily upon illegal or "black" labor, and Morese admitted
that "a part of the south's economy survives only thanks to the
underground element."
</P>
<P>
However, he blasted the theory that so-called zero tolerance
towards the black economy would lead to a total disappearance of
business in the south, dismissing it as an "urban legend."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Occupation of Ecuadorian Military Base Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A former Ecuadoran military man
condemned Monday Ecuador's government decision that aided the
United States to occupy Manta Air Base.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Lucio Gutierrez, leader of the military uprising on
January 21, said Ecuador doesn't obtain any benefit from the
accord signed with the United States and, on the contrary, could
have unpredictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorians don't obtain any benefits from this covenant but
the tens of thousands displaced from Colombia who'll pass the
border, said the retired colonel.
</P>
<P>
On 12 November 1999, Ecuador's government signed with the United
States an accord to concede the use of Manta Air Base, situated on
this country's northwest coast.
</P>
<P>
As Ecuador's Foreign Ministry reported, the accord to last 10
years will have clear objectives like carrying air operations for
detention, monitoring, tracking and controlling of illegal air
drug-traffic.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Oil Company To Pay 28 Mln Dlrs for Oil Spillage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Brazil Petroleums (Petrobras) was
fined Monday by the Parana state government for 28 million U.S.
dollars due to a 4 million liter crude escape.
</P>
<P>
The spillage took place Sunday afternoon at a rupture of the
joint pipeline at the Getulio Vargas refinery, situated in the
metropolitan region of Curitiba, capital of the state.
</P>
<P>
Petrobras' President Henri Phillipe Reichstul said the company
won't limit expenses to contain the crude and clean the river
Iguazu, also affected by the spillage. Technicians reported the
escape was halted also Sunday after several hours.
</P>
<P>
Energy Company of the state fears the oil could cause damage to
hydroelectric plant Foz do Arcia, situated 240 kilometers from the
refinery.
</P>
<P>
The state's government stipulated a fine, for ecological damage,
of 28 million dollars, the same amount Petrobras paid for oil
pollution of the Guanabara bay, in Rio de Janeiro, in January.

Ottawa, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien Monday announced that he will attend this year's Group of
Eight (G-8) Economic Summit in Okinawa, Japan, on July 21-23.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will also attend a pre-summit meeting in
Tokyo on July 20 organized by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
with leaders from the developing world and heads of international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
One focus of this year's summit will be the challenges facing
developing countries, including poverty reduction, debt relief,
combating infectious diseases, the benefits and impact of
information and communications technologies, and regional or civil
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's record of achievement in these areas is very positive.
We have been among the leading proponents of debt relief, we are
pursuing an international strategy to fight HIV/AIDS, and our
technological expertise has made us one of the world's most
connected populations," said the prime minister in a release.
</P>
<P>
"In Okinawa, we will examine ways to enhance these initiatives
and make them available to more developing countries," added
Chretien.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed With Dow Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended mixed
Monday with the blue chips falling ahead of the release of the
Consumer Price Index for June and the tech shares rising.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 8.48 at 10,804.27,
ending the six sessions of rally in a raw.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 28.49 at 4,274.67 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 0.51 at 1,510.49.
</P>
<P>
The Dow fell as investors cautiously took some profits from a
rally in the previous six sessions even though Wall Street
analysts believed the June CPI to be released Tuesday will show a
benign inflation. Merrill Lynch's the Global Securities Research &AMP;
Economics Group expects the core CPI to rise only 0.2 percent for
June and the overall CPI to rise 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tech stocks continued the rally starting last week in hope
that a string of strong second-quarter earnings reports last week
will extend into this week. Intel, Apple Computer, IBM, Lucent
Technology and Microsoft were expected to release their earnings
reports later this week.
</P>
<P>
VerticalNet and Rambus rose. But Ariba and Amazon.com fell
Monday after a big surging last week.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 0.60 at 683.20. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 1.28 at 943.66 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 2.55 at 545.18.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,522 down, 1,343 up and 518
unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 900.37 million shares from 947.15

<HEADLINE> Counting on Genocide Victims Kicks off in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A 12-day census began Monday in
Rwanda to write down the number and names of victims in the
country's national genocide during 1990-1994, Rwanda News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Many people especially those who wish to water down the
genocide that was committed in Rwanda quote lower numbers of
victims because of their interests, the prime reason for
organizing this census is to give the names and the real numbers
of the people that perished in the tragedy," said Musoni Protais,
secretary general in the Ministry of Local Administration and
Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The census, to be conducted throughout the country, will
extend to 9,104 cells, the lowest administrative unit in the
country.
</P>
<P>
At each cell, there is a person who has specifically been sent
to carry out the census exercise, but will be assisted by the
local administration committee.
</P>
<P>
The subjects of the census are supposed to be those killed
between October 1, 1990 and December 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
During the process, a questionnaire will be presented to
informants, who will have to explain why a person was killed,
whether it was because the victim was a Tutsi, or had any other
sort of relationship with Tutsis and whether the person was killed
because he/she did not support the regime in power at the time.
</P>
<P>
Protais said: "The census has nothing to do with finding out
who killed who, neither has it any thing to do with the "Gacaca"
Courts (participatory traditional courts) that are soon to be
established."
</P>
<P>
It has further been clarified that the information obtained
will be treated confidentially and the informants were encouraged
to give proper and true information.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Royalists Prepare Official Funeral for Late Emperor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The preparation for an
official funeral for the late emperor Haile Selassie has been
underway, an Ethiopian royalist group announced early this week.
</P>
<P>
The funeral ceremony is scheduled to be held on November 2 this
year, 25 years after the emperor death and on the 70th anniversary
of his coronation, the Emperor Haile Selassie Foundation said.
</P>
<P>
Around 1 million U.S. dollars is needed to organize the
reburial ceremony, the foundation said, stressing it will not
accept any money from foreign governments and organizations as the
emperor's funeral must be an all Ethiopian affair.
</P>
<P>
Emperor Haile Selassie was allegedly murdered in 1975 after
being deposed by the former regime led by Mengistu Haile-Mariam in
1974.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that his remains were exhumed in 1992 and
placed inside Menelik Mausoleum until being quietly moved to a
specially-built tomb inside the Orthodox Trinity Cathedral in
Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
However, controversy still abounds over whether the remains are
really his.
</P>
<P>
In an unofficial poll held at the beginning of this year, the
late emperor was elected as a personality of millennium in
Ethiopia. He was survived by a daughter and many grandchildren,
most of whom live in the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A government committee on the
resumption of Nigeria Airways flights to New York has recommended
partnership with either Ghana Airways or South Africa Airways.
</P>
<P>
The 10-member committee, which presented the report Tuesday to
the Nigerian Aviation Minister Kema Chikwe, said it based its
recommendations on civil aviation status, fleet and route network
of the two airlines.
</P>
<P>
Committee chairman Zakari Haruna said the panel had considered
three options -- independent operation, wet lease and partnership -
- and later decided on partnership as the most viable.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria Airways plans to resume the flights in August after a
six-year suspension.
</P>
<P>
Washington in 1993 barred all Nigerian registered flights to
and from the U.S. following the return of the military in politics
in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
Abuja reciprocated the suspension, which was only lifted last
year after Nigeria's return to democracy.
