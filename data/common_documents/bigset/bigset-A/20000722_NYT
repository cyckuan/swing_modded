   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ... the water.
</P>
<P>
   The grid also protects swimmers by keeping all metal at the same
voltage potential. This way, if stray volts enter the grid, the
voltage passing through all the metal is the same. If someone
touched the metal, there would be no shock.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same reason a squirrel can sit on a power line
without getting hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a difference in voltage _ as when the squirrel
touches another power line or a pole _ the result could be a shock
or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you have to remember is that the grid is not 100
percent effective,'' said Rick Park, a service coordinator for SKC
Electric. ``It is not a sure thing. It is there for safety, and it
is the best humans can come up with. But you have to remember there
are a lot of variables that can defeat these systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzig's inspection of the Tomahawk Ridge pool found that
several structures were added to the complex without being properly
connected to the grid. Also, several other items were initially
connected but were altered sometime after installation.
</P>
<P>
   A third group of items were never properly bonded during the
original installation, Herzig said. Overland Park officials denied
that.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items were ladders, lifeguard stands, canopies and
diving board rails.
</P>
<P>
   City officials found similar problems at the city's other five
pools.
</P>
<P>
   After area cities heard about Overland Park's pool closings,
some decided to make sure their pools were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Olathe, Kan., for example, was advised that because the city had
not added features or modified its pools, the original design and
construction would ensure people's safety.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a precaution, the city had an electrician inspect its
pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pools were fine,'' said Marlene Natoli, assistant director
of community services. ``We did some minor modifications following
the test, but there were no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cities conducted tests before the pools opened for the
season. Overland Park, which did not test the grid system before
the season began, will now require such tests every year, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cities with older pools, such as Kansas City, do not have the
protective grids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the grid systems, because our pools were built
back in the 1940s and 1950s,'' said Chuck Moore, communications
officer for the Kansas City Parks and Recreation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The city checks the pools at the beginning of the season to make
sure everything is safe, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Banks, president and owner of Banks Pool &AMP; Spa Designs
Inc. in Kansas City, said it was important for homeowners and
apartment complexes with pools to periodically check them to make
sure that their safety measures are working properly, including
checking the grid system.
</P>
<P>
   Pools are designed to withstand incidents such as the one in
Overland Park, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been a lot worse,'' Banks said. ``Fortunately,
Overland Park found out about its problems with the pools without
anybody getting injured.''

METS AMD LEITER CAN'T SHAKE TURNER FIELD CURSE, LOSING 6-3 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Melvin Mora stood in the Mets dugout at Turner Field
before Friday night's game and said he was not concerned with
rumors that he might soon be replaced as the Mets' starting
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I know,'' he said, ``is they need me out there
at shortstop, and I'm going to try to do my best, and I will do my
best.''
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the ninth inning Friday night, Mora gave the
Mets his best, surprising the Atlanta Braves with a bunt and
reaching safely on a single. But Mora's best has not been good
enough, and Mora could not have known then that the Mets already
had worked out a deal in principle with the Cincinnati Reds that
would bring Barry Larkin, a potential Hall of Fame shortstop, to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mora has filled in capably for the injured Rey Ordonez, but if
Larkin approves the deal, he will lift a team that needs the help.
The short-handed Mets fell to the Braves, 6-3, as Al Leiter
faltered again in a ballpark that bedevils him and the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Field has been a house of horrors for the Mets, whose
playoff hopes died here in 1998 and whose World Series dreams were
dashed here last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine conceded before Friday
night's game, ``is a ballpark that hasn't been a friendly place to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   In their last 16 games at Turner Field, the Mets are 1-15. That
record includes the Mets' three losses here in the National League
Championship Series last year.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year-old park has been most inhospitable to Leiter.
Counting his start in the decisive sixth game of last year's NLCS,
when he allowed five earned runs and did not retire a batter,
Leiter has given up 16 earned runs in 161/3 innings at Turner
Field, for an 8.82 earned run average. He was even the losing
pitcher in the All-Star Game here 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter worked six innings Friday night, allowing five runs (four
earned) and six hits. He dropped his third decision in a row since
beating the Braves at Shea Stadium on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter allowed singles to the first two hitters he faced, Rafael
Furcal and Andruw Jones, and they executed a double steal as
Chipper Jones struck out. Brian Jordan followed with a single to
center, scoring two runs, including one by Jones, who overslid the
lunging catcher Mike Piazza, then scrambled back to touch the plate
with his foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets used four singles and a walk by Braves starter Terry
Mulholland to take a 3-2 lead in the third. Joe McEwing, Piazza and
Jay Payton all had run-scoring singles, and when Mulholland, a
control pitcher, walked Benny Agbayani to load the bases with two
out, Braves manager Bobby Cox called for John Burkett.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, who defeated the Mets at Shea Stadium in the opener of
the clubs' four-game series on June 29, was bumped from the
rotation when the Braves acquired Andy Ashby in a trade over the
All-Star Game break. But he was stingy Friday night, retiring Mora
on a flyout to center to end the third and then cruising.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves gave Burkett a lead in the bottom of the third, when
a decision by third baseman Lenny Harris proved costly.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on second and third, Harris fielded Jordan's
grounder and threw to Piazza at the plate. The throw pulled Piazza
into the path of the base runner, Andruw Jones, who scored as the
ball got away. Harris was charged with a throwing error, which
allowed the runners to advance a base.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 3-3 and Andres Galarraga grounded to shortstop,
bringing in Chipper Jones to give Atlanta the lead. The Braves
added another run on a homer by Javy Lopez in the sixth, and
Chipper Jones added a run-scoring single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were playing without second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo,
who received an anti-inflammatory injection in his sore right hip
before the game, which should make him available for the final game
of this series on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give guys motivation to keep playing,'' Alfonzo
said. ``The last thing we need right now is me going on the
disabled list. We win with all 25 guys. It's kind of a little hard,
but it's something you're going to have to deal with.''

`DARK QUESTIONS' RESOLVED, WACO INQUIRY CONCLUDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA and KIT WAGAR  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Answering the ``dark questions'' that have lingered
for seven years, John Danforth said Friday that blame for the
bloodshed in Waco rests entirely with Branch Davidians, not
government agents.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-month probe led by the former Missouri senator also found
no evidence of a government coverup or improper military
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's 149-page interim report exonerates Attorney General
Janet Reno and, he hopes, puts to rest conspiracy theories about
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any open-minded person, any fair-minded person, who
reads this will say, `This is the way it was,' '' Danforth told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   David Koresh and about 80 Davidians died in an inferno following
raids of their compound near Waco, Texas, on April 19, 1993. The
raids, and allegations of a coverup, caused some lawmakers to
demand Reno's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Reno appointed Danforth special counsel to
investigate Waco after revelations that the FBI used tear-gas
rockets that could have sparked a fire, a contradiction of earlier
government claims.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's report concluded that government agents did not set
the fire at Waco or shoot at the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   But the government did not get off entirely. In an interview
with The Kansas City Star, Danforth said the lack of candor about
the pyrotechnic devices contributed to public suspicion about Waco.
</P>
<P>
   He said that deception allowed the media, politicians and
extremists to fuel conspiracy theories and erode public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is that people who want to believe the worst in
government say, `Aha! This is something that is really bad so
everything is suspicious.' The lesson is that government has to be
open,'' Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Danforth's report indicated that skepticism remains
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Klayman, chairman and general counsel of the conservative
legal group Judicial Watch, said he wasn't surprised. He said his
group, which is suing the Justice Department to get access to
documents involving the Waco standoff, will continue its
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet Reno knew what she was getting when she appointed
Danforth,'' Klayman said. ``Danforth is establishment and we expect
him to scratch the back of the establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Klayman said Danforth's sweeping exoneration of the agents on
the scene would breed further mistrust of government. To exonerate
the government for actions that left about 80 dead insults the
American people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth would not comment on whether the government exercised
bad judgment at Waco because his research only addressed ``bad
acts.'' He said he did not want to emulate special counsels whose
investigations ``morphed'' into wide ranging topics.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth expects to present a final report by the fall. He said
his investigation of the 51-day siege is about 95 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   The report addresses four major questions: Did federal law
officers shoot into the compound? Did agents start the fire? How
involved was the military? Was there a government coverup?
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found no evidence that FBI agents returned fire
from the Davidians. The report stated flashes that occurred around
government vehicles were reflections or ``glint'' from scattered
debris.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews, autopsies, ballistics tests and other evidence
indicates that Davidians who died from gunshot wounds committed
suicide or were killed by other Davidians, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also placed blame for the deadly fire on the
Davidians. The report describes conversations among Davidians
picked up by government listening devices within the compound.
Several discussions involved ways to pour fuel and start a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators did find evidence that an FBI agent fired three
pyrotechnic tear-gas rounds. But the report states that the rounds
were fired at an outbuilding that was under construction 75 feet
from the Davidian complex.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have ignited the fire because the bounced off the
building and they were launched about four hours before the fire
erupted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's report was the second time in a week that the
government was cleared of wrong-doing at the Davidians' Mt. Carmel
complex.
</P>
<P>
   A five-member jury in Waco decided July 14 that federal agents
were not responsible for the Davidians' deaths. The jury's ruling
was only advisory, but both sides expect a U.S. District judge to
hold the government blameless when he issues a final ruling.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh was heartened by the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple truth, as the FBI has maintained since April 19,
1993, has been unmistakingly confirmed again today _ the FBI fired
no shots on that day and the Davidians started the fire that
ultimately engulfed the compound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the military's involvement, the report found that armed
forces ``conducted themselves properly and commendably,'' by
providing reconnaissance, training and medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found no evidence that Reno intentionally
covered up the use of the three pyrotechnic rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any misstatement that (Reno) made was inadvertent and occurred
after diligent efforts on her part to learn the truth,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Danforth harshly criticized several Justice Department
lawyers and FBI agents for concealing the use of pyrotechnic
devices, even though the rounds caused no harm.
</P>
<P>
   He said repeated denials by the FBI and the Justice Department
from 1993 until last year seriously undermined the government's
credibility. The report noted that the last page of a key FBI lab
report was omitted from the information turned over to
congressional investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The missing page showed that the FBI had used pyrotechnic tear
gas canisters, which can spark a fire under certain conditions.
Reno, in granting the order to storm the Davidians' compound, had
ordered the FBI not to use such propellants because of the risk of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Justice Department report was at best misleading
when it said tear gas delivery systems were ``completely
nonincendiary,'' the report said. Testimony to Congress was
similarly suspect, it said.
</P>
<P>
   And during preparation for a criminal trial against surviving
Davidians, prosecutors falsely told defense attorneys that they had
no evidence that government agents used pyrotechnic rounds. They
made the statement despite agents' reports that such rockets were
used, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth wrote that those actions were reprehensible because
they undermined public confidence. Lawyers in private practice
might skirt the truth, but that is not acceptable for the
government, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government lawyers have responsibilities beyond winning the
cases at hand...,'' he wrote. ``Government lawyers carry on their
shoulders responsibility for not only the prosecution of specific
cases, but also for public confidence in our system of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, who has the power of prosecution, said he does not
expect to charge the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, a Houston attorney who represents most of the
families of people who died, said several of Danforth's conclusions
echoed his own. But he said he was bothered that Danforth decided
not to pursue criminal charges against those who lied.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cannot help but add to the impression that a double
standard exists for government misconduct,'' Caddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth, an ordained Episcopal priest, said he saw his Waco
investigation as part of a higher crusade to restore public
confidence in government. He called it ``the most important work
I've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said his conclusions are unanimously shared by the
team's 16 attorneys and 38 investigators. Danforth's team, based in
St. Louis, sifted through more than 2 million pages of documents
and interviewed almost 900 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt, whatsoever, in my mind as to these
conclusions. This is not a close call,'' Danforth said. ``These
`dark questions' have been answered with total certainty.'' (MORE)

STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS MAY OK PESTICIDES AFTER MAYOR'S
COMMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arguing that humans are more important than a few
fish, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sharply criticized state and federal
environmental officials Friday for blocking the city from spraying
pesticides in wetlands and other marsh areas in its battle against
the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor attacked the government policies _ which prohibit
spraying many pesticides over water, to protect fish and other
aquatic life _ as he announced that spraying to eradicate
mosquitoes that carry the virus would be extended to nearly all of
Staten Island and northern Queens on Monday night because three
more infected birds had been found in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that danger to human life is more important
than birds, fish and insects,'' said Giuliani. He condemned
policies of the National Parks Service, which had prevented
spraying pesticides inside the Gateway National Recreation Area,
and the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, which has
strictly enforced a federal prohibition on the use of pesticides in
ponds and wetlands elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's protests, at a news conference on Staten Island,
provoked immediate offers of compromise by state and federal
officials. The Parks Service said it would allow the city to spray
in the Staten Island section of Gateway at the same time it sprays
elsewhere in the city on Monday. A senior official of the
Environmental Protection Agency in Washington said the agency would
consider granting the city an emergency waiver to allow spraying
over water, perhaps at the same time on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal and our desire is to make sure we are providing
complete health protection,'' said Stephen Johnson, the deputy
assistant administrator for the EPA's office of prevention,
pesticides and toxic substances. He said the waiver would allow the
city to spray its pesticide, Anvil, over water despite federal
rules that prohibit its use in areas ``where surface water is
present.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, Jennifer Post, said last night that her department
would request the waiver ``if that is the route the city wants to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparent concurrence of state and federal officials,
the city's plan to spray Anvil over water was greeted with
skepticism by environmentalists, who fought fiercely last year
against the city's use of malathion, a more toxic pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's constant drumbeat about the safety of this product
or any of these products could make people cavalier about
exposure,'' said Jay Feldman, executive director of the National
Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, a Washington-based
environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who acknowledged that spraying Anvil over water would
kill fish, dismissed environmental protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We catch fish to eat them, so if we lose a few fish to save
human lives, I don't understand'' the confusion going on, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement of expanded spraying came after health
officials concluded that the West Nile virus had killed a blue jay
in Douglaston, Queens, and a crow and a sparrow in the Great Kills
and Bay Terrace sections of Staten Island during the first week of
July. The dead birds are among five identified in the city this
year that were infected by the virus, which was responsible for 62
confirmed cases in people last fall, including seven deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is most problematic for children under 5, the elderly
and people with weakened immune systems. Otherwise, it causes
flulike symptoms in healthy adults.
</P>
<P>
   The city's health commissioner, Dr. Neal Cohen, while clearly
concerned about the fresh evidence of disease-carrying mosquitoes,
said the threat to the city was complicated by the wide swath in
which infected birds had been identified _ from the city to the
suburbs. He said that posed a threat that the mosquitoes were
migrating to unpredictable locations.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials said Friday that 29 birds had been killed
by the virus this year, including five crows in Rockland County and
a blue jay in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   But since there have been no cases of West Nile infection in
humans in the city this year, Cohen said ``there is no reason to
reach the conclusion that the virus is more prevalent or has more
traction'' than last year. He added that medical analysis of those
who became ill or died last year indicated that the first case had
been in early August, suggesting that an outbreak in humans this
year, if it occurred, could not emerge much earlier than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying has also begun in Rockland, Westchester and Suffolk
counties, and Giuliani said Friday that the findings in Douglaston
prompted health officials to ask Nassau County to begin an
eradication campaign along its western borders.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Katherine Gaffney, the Nassau County health commissioner,
said Friday that she had no intention of ordering pesticide
spraying unless infected birds or mosquitoes were found in the
county.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to begin adding chemicals to the ecosystem if
simple, preventative measures can be used instead,'' she said,
adding that the county had tested 189 dead birds and more than
25,000 mosquitoes this year, without finding any West Nile
infections.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Friday that the city might also ask Union County
in New Jersey to spray pesticides because of its proximity to the
section of Staten Island where infected birds were identified this
week. Tom Plant, a Union County spokesman, said the county had
already engaged in extensive testing of chickens and other birds
this year and had found no evidence of infection.
</P>
<P>
   The city's spraying could be completed on Monday night, health
officials said, when trucks are deployed in the area around
Douglaston and across Staten Island. Delays caused by weather or
other problems could require additional spraying on Tuesday night,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday when the city could complete spraying in
the Staten Island part of Gateway National Recreation Area, and
city health officials said some details of the operation _
including who would pay to spray the park _ remained to be
negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the agreement of the Park Service to allow any
spraying inside Gateway was welcome, particularly because one of
the infected birds identified on Staten Island this week had been
found close to the park's boundary, and could have been infected
from there.

BILLBOARDS URGE MOTORISTS ON I-70 TO OFFER IDEAS TO IMPROVE
HIGHWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATIE HOLLAR and KYLE S. THOMAS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Big and bright, the billboards beckon to
drivers on Interstate 70: ``70 needs help! Got ideas?''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, do they. At least 6,000 motorists, at last count, have
contacted the Missouri Department of Transportation through its Web
site. Officials say they can't count the number of people who have
called or written.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to I-70, it seems, everyone has a horror story.
From Kansas City to St. Louis and stops in between, drivers gripe
and grumble about the highway's potholes, traffic jams and constant
construction.
</P>
<P>
   If the billboards work, I-70 cynics may be the highway's
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Springs, Break Time.
</P>
<P>
   A taxicab-yellow pickup pulls into the parking lot of the Break
Time gas station. Out step Travis Young, of Higginsville, and
Bradley Maberry, of Sweet Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The two of them drive I-70 every day. They see the potholes,
they feel the bumps through the seat of the old truck, and they see
the construction crews trying to fix those problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do work every month, and it doesn't help it,'' says
Young, 20. ``There are good spots, there are bad spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Maberry, 17, says the crumbling condition of I-70 has lured some
truckers to take U.S. 40, thus ``another highway gets messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The two don't have high hopes for I-70.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may get it fixed,'' Young says, ``about when I turn 80.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be in the year 2060.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri highway officials, now studying alternatives for fixing
the road, insist it won't take that long.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching from Baltimore to Cove Fort, Utah, I-70 is the oldest
interstate highway route in the United States. And the 251-mile
portion of the road that stretches across Missouri has taken a
beating since construction was completed in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The highway was designed to last about 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the road begins to show its age, motorists and state
officials are wondering what should be done about it.
</P>
<P>
   Significant changes certainly are called for, said Linda Ell
Clark, a planner for the Missouri Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Clark cited the ``present serviceability rating,'' which is
compiled by a team of surveyors who examine the nation's roadways.
The rating crew found that 24 percent of Missouri's I-70 was in
poor condition. Forty percent is ``very poor.''
</P>
<P>
   In its early years, the interstate would average 15,000 to
20,000 cars daily, traffic officials say. Today, the highway sees
about two times as many _ 35,000 vehicles a day in rural areas and
45,000 near St. Louis, Columbia and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I-70 was designed, it wasn't designed to hold as much
traffic as it does today,'' said Jim Coleman, of the Missouri
Department of Transportation. ``Especially not truck traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen construction projects are set up between Kansas City
and St. Louis this summer, as the department tries to fix some of
the road's worst spots.
</P>
<P>
   Caution signs, orange and white barrels occupy the shoulder.
Workers use heavy machinery to resurface lanes. Others insert guard
rails, restore bridges and patch the road's median.
</P>
<P>
   Danville, Phillips 66.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Key pulls his champagne-colored Cadillac into the shade.
He's driving home from St. Louis to Jefferson City. But the
formidable summer heat and the dozens of orange barrels on the road
make for a long drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting some rest,'' he says, turning the Cadillac's
air-conditioner on high.
</P>
<P>
   Key hates driving in the construction zones, but he understands
the need for the I-70 projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're trying to fix it for good,'' he says. ``It's
just a big job. They're doing what they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Solution or not, motorists complain that construction is a major
hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Construction at night would make it easier for drivers during
rush hour, says Michelle Ifill, of Junction City, Kan., sitting in
the back seat of the family station wagon while her husband refills
a cooler with ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much traffic because of road work,'' she says.
``And the people drive crazy in Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   Six road crews worked between Kansas City and St. Louis on a
recent weekday. The orange cones, yellow dump trucks and steaming
asphalt have become a common sight along the highway.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling are the 14 crosses along the road, marking the
locations of fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   There could be more crosses to come. If projected traffic
increases hold true, the Transportation Department expects
accidents to double in the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason for the construction, said department
spokesman Mark Kross.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, about 6,000 trips are made between Kansas City and
St. Louis. That number could double by 2030, according to
transportation statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make it a safer road for drivers that travel between the
state's largest two cities, we have to stick by our current
construction schedule,'' Kross said. ``During this time, we have to
come up with a strategic plan to reduce congestion and collisions
on this statewide road.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2030, estimated volumes are expected to reach 80,000 to
90,000 vehicles a day in urban areas. The rural spaces could see
50,000 to 60,000 daily.
</P>
<P>
   Seven I-70 help billboards already dot the roadside. Seven more
will be put up soon.
</P>
<P>
   The responses to the phone line and the Web site will be
considered in MoDOT's I-70 improvement study.
</P>
<P>
   The agency hopes the plan will revamp I-70 in Missouri.
Conducted by a team of engineers, the study aims to solve the
ongoing problem of roughness, congestion and accidents.
</P>
<P>
   MoDOT hopes to have the first part of its plan completed by the
spring of 2001. The plan focuses on the 200 miles that stretch from
Kansas City's Interstate 470 to Lake St. Louis just outside St.
Louis. Besides the road, the study will examine five miles on
either side of the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Within that area, there are 53 interchanges and 130 bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Already, public meetings and engineers' suggestions are sparking
ideas to revamp the road, said Jerry Mugg of HNTB Corp., the
consultant that is heading the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study already has sparked some ideas:
</P>
<P>
   - A four-lane road could be constructed five miles to the north
or south of I-70. Building a new four-lane expressway or toll road
is estimated to cost about $2.5 billion _ the same as
reconstructing and widening the existing one.
</P>
<P>
   - Special lanes could be designated for buses and carpools.
</P>
<P>
   - Around the cities, park-and-ride programs could be
implemented, cutting down on commuter traffic.
</P>
<P>
   - A high-speed rail could be installed, running down the median
or alongside the road.
</P>
<P>
   On the Kansas side, highway officials also are looking at the
future of I-70 from Kansas City, Kan., to Topeka, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Adding lanes and energy-efficient transportation methods could
be some strategies they consider, said Kim Stich, a spokeswoman for
the Kansas Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Past Topeka, there is not a need for improvement,'' she said.
``If we have to concentrate on improving the road statewide in the
future, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Just outside Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   At a rest stop at mile 125, Frank Walsh sits in the grass,
trying to repair his Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh and his two buddies in bandannas are riding to St. Louis.
From there, they'll head north to Sturgis, S.D., for the annual
Harley convention _ if they can get this motorcycle to start.
</P>
<P>
   I-70 is especially vicious to bikers, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a bump off a bridge that almost made me come off my
bike,'' Walsh says. ``I've almost scratched out I don't know how
many times. The road's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hossfeld relaxes near his UPS truck. Hossfeld's been
driving I-70 for 26 years. He travels five days a week on the road,
and he's seen his share of bad accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``From St. Louis to Kansas City should be six lanes, to reduce
accidents,'' Hossfeld says. ``Also, a bypass around Columbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's Exit 128 is the worst part of the road, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sharp curve needs to be taken out, fill the median with
concrete and put up barriers to reduce head-on crashes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hossfeld has seen the big billboards that ask drivers for
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent my two cents in,'' he says.

 &HT;    SALMON HAS PLANS FOR AFTER OFFICE(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By CHRIS MOESER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon will be gone from Congress in January, but he's
making sure he won't be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa Republican says he plans to play a major role in state
politics once he leaves office by forming a non-profit foundation
to advocate and lobby for education and children's issue. What he
won't say is whether his new focus is a prelude to a bid for the
governor's office in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is aside from whether or not I'm running for governor.
This is not the `Matt Salmon for governor' exploratory committee,''
Salmon said in a telephone interview this week from Washington,
D.C. ``This is a foundation to try to address Arizona's problems,
which I will do whether I run for governor or whether I don't. I
don't know that I'm going to run for governor or that I won't.
There's a lot of thought that has to go into that. But along the
way if you have a chance to do some good, you ought to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some political analysts say Salmon's creation of the
Foundation for Arizona's Future has everything to do with
(beginitalic)his (enditalic)political future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about running for governor,'' said Bruce Merrill,
an ASU journalism professor and pollster. ``This is about keeping
access to the media once he leaves office. It's very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon launched the foundation as chairman of a 19-member board
that includes Republicans and Democrats, including former Assistant
Attorney General Steve Twist, former Mesa City Councilman John
Giles, Tucson trial lawyer Gary Bryant and Phoenix lobbyist Kevin
DeMenna.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon and the other board members will not be paid, although he
hopes to raise $150,000 over the next year to hire staff. The goal
is to research issues like a think tank, but also to lobby at the
state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a think tank. This is an action tank,'' Salmon
said. ``We intend to look at issues and come up with solutions, and
we intend to advocate for those solutions. This is not some kind of
passive board. We are going to try to make change.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon cited examples of what he'd like to work on: education,
child abuse, child support enforcement and divorce laws. And he
said the focus in education should be on improving science and math
performance by attracting better teachers - with more money, if
necessary - and by creating a science and math charter school.
</P>
<P>
   He's been harshly critical of Gov. Jane Hull's plan for a
six-tenths-of-a-cent sales tax increase to raise teacher salaries
and reduce class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a propensity in government to always believe that the
answer is just to throw money at a problem without any kind of a
well thought out plan,'' he said. ``There is no game plan right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he will defer to his board to decide exactly
what to pursue, pointing out that he has picked a diverse group
that won't rubber-stamp his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those board members agreed. Bryant, who calls himself
a liberal Democrat, has known Salmon for 20 years. He said he
expects to frequently disagree with Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's someone who believes in things. I like that,'' Bryant
said. ``If he asked me to help, there's clearly no agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon has long been something of a political enigma. He was
first elected to Congress in 1994 when Republicans swept to power.
But he was quickly at odds with GOP leaders, including then-House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. Salmon criticized Gingrich for abandoning
core principles of the ``Contract with America,'' such as tax and
spending cuts. He supported the coup against Gingrich that
eventually led to the speaker's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   And although Salmon is staunchly conservative, he has earned a
maverick reputation. He is one of the few members of the 1994
freshman class who stuck to a pledge to leave office after three
terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be an effort to soften his rightist image,'' Phoenix
pollster Earl de Berge said.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's announcement of the foundation even drew guarded praise
from a potential rival.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Goddard, a former Phoenix mayor and two-time Democratic
gubernatorial candidate who is weighing a third race for the post,
noted that Bryant's inclusion on the board as evidence that
Salmon's intentions may be altruistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, any time you have to look suspiciously at something
that has a potential candidate as a chairman,'' Goddard said. ``But
I wish him well. Any responsible voice for kids and families in
this state is desperately needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon could face a crowded field in the Republican primary for
governor. Former Attorney General Grant Woods, Secretary of State
Betsey Bayless and Senate President Brenda Burns are all potential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said he has not decided whether he will run, saying
instead that he will take a job in the private sector when he
leaves office to capitalize on his expertise on China. He is fluent
in Mandarin Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect that there will be cynics galore,'' he said.
``But you weigh on one hand the potential of criticisms from cynics
or the potential of continuing to do good. I'm 42 years old. I'm
not going to wither up and go away. I will be a force to be dealt
with in Arizona, whether it's on the sidelines helping other people
or in elective office myself. I will be involved in Arizona's
future one way or another.''

SPORTS COLUMN: METS, BRAVES REINTRODUCE THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This should have happened a few months ago. The Braves
and the Mets should have been getting it on in April or May,
reviving their rivalry early and often.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, baseball has been operating with a mentality of
painting itself into isolated corners, like Dagwood Bumstead in the
Sunday comics.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night the Mets were visiting the Braves for the first
time this season, with the same dismal result, a 6-3 loss. They
have won only 12 of 41 regular-season games in Atlanta since 1992
and were 0-3 in last year's playoffs, which constitutes a weird
kind of rivalry, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had not been here since Kenny Rogers, with a tepid air
of inevitability, walked home the winning run in the 11th inning of
the sixth game of the National League Championship Series late on
the night of Oct. 19
</P>
<P>
   Through the marvel of Major League Baseball planning, the two
teams did not meet again until June 29, the night 600 New York City
police officers were needed to usher John Rocker into Shea Stadium.
Now that Rocker has settled into being just another knucklehead,
the teams can go about their business of competing for the division
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is awfully late to be here for the first time,''
Bobby Valentine said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   This gaping void between engagements allowed Braves fans to
smirk that the Braves have dominated the Mets for the past decade.
Mets fans could reply with some veracity that they would have stood
up to the Yankees better than the weary Braves did in the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what miracles Melvin Mora might have wrought? Now the
Mets are trying to get Barry Larkin to supplant Mora as shortstop
pro tem; things happen fast.
</P>
<P>
   There is a history to these two teams, but baseball has done its
best to suppress rivalries in recent years, playing a so-called
balanced schedule with a gooey dollop of empty-calorie interleague
games. Through this gimmick, the Mets have been playing before
empty club boxes in Toronto while the Braves have been trying to
bring major league baseball to the grim dome in Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run baseball are nothing if not astute. Just the
other day they announced plans for an unbalanced schedule in 2001,
meaning teams will play up to 19 games against division rivals.
</P>
<P>
   There is some fear that baseball will realign what is left of
the two-league rivalry in the near future, perhaps separating the
Mets and Braves. ``I don't want 'em to go away; I want to beat
'em,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, at least, there will probably be three trips by the
Mets to Atlanta and three by the Braves to New York. This means
teams can take more responsibility for their own fate, can give
themselves a boost in the damp of springtime, turn on the burners
in the heat of summer and protect their turf in the chill of
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing like two teams starting to develop warm and
fuzzy feelings toward each other: Those lucky dogs! Those impudent
pretenders! Those cowardly weasels!
</P>
<P>
   This is what pennant races used to be like. The classic subway
rivalry between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants was
exacerbated by its frequency _ 22 games a year. If Sal Maglie, the
Barber, shaved the swarthy jowls of Carl Furillo, the man known as
Skoonj would not have to wait interminably for his chance to bunt
down the first-base line and see if he could leave cleat marks up
and down Maglie's flannels.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there was no designated-hitter rule to encourage a
Roger Clemens to become the classic American League bully, throwing
inside against great hitters like Mike Piazza, knowing he would
never have to stand in the general vicinity of home plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets now have a healthy little rivalry against Clemens, but
they will have to wait a very long time to see him again. Late
October would work.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball needs its rivalries, but interleague schedules and
expansion have diluted the product, creating a schedule of
one-night stands and creating makeshift return excursions to make
up inconvenient rainouts.
</P>
<P>
   At least the Mets and Braves play home-and-home series in
September, when division rivals should meet. ``If you play enough
games, they usually even out,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't evened out for the Mets here, but they keep
hustling. Friday night, with Larkin rumors infiltrating the dugout
at game time, the Mets fell behind by 2-0, ``but I didn't see us
give up,'' Valentine said, hopefully. The team's collective
memories of Atlanta are not good, but at least they are memories,
and baseball should do more to stimulate them. &QL;

50 SOUTH NEW JERSEY DEMOCRATS ENDORSE TORRICELLI'S BID FOR
GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON _ More than 50 South Jersey Democrats announced their
support for Sen. Robert Torricelli Friday in his bid to supplant
James McGreevey as the party's presumptive nominee for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's backers claimed that the show of support, which
included top officials in three counties and two county Democratic
Party chairmen, would be the first in a series of endorsements as
unstoppable as toppling dominoes.
</P>
<P>
   But McGreevey's loyalists dismissed the endorsements as a weak
showing, and said that they would announce their own South Jersey
supporters on Saturday, arguing that the region's Democrats
remained divided, at best, in the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   While such endorsements are unlikely to influence many voters,
they are considered critical at this stage in the
McGreevey-Torricelli showdown. The senator is seeking to prove he
would be the choice of an overwhelming majority of Democrats, and
needs to show he has the support of the most influential party
leaders. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, is striving to prove
he can withstand Torricelli's challenge, and must prevent
defections from his ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Those endorsing Torricelli Friday included the Democratic
chairmen in Camden and Burlington counties; the freeholder
directors _ the top elected officials _ in Camden, Cumberland and
Gloucester counties; the mayors of Atlantic City and Cherry Hill;
former Rep. William Hughes; seven assemblymen; and two state
senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an endorsement by the Who's Who of Democratic
leadership in southern New Jersey,'' said George E. Norcross III,
the Camden County power broker.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the officials listed as favoring Torricelli withdrew
his endorsement Friday night, saying he had been bamboozled. Tom
Pankok, the Salem County Democratic chairman, said he had agreed to
add his name to the list only because he had been told that
counterparts in Cumberland and Gloucester counties had already done
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to remain neutral,'' Pankok said. ``I'm so sick and
tired of hearing so much misinformation. I don't want to talk about
endorsements or anything till after the November election.''
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey refused to discuss the list of Torricelli supporters,
except to say he remained confident he would survive the senator's
challenge.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ... the water.
</P>
<P>
   The grid also protects swimmers by keeping all metal at the same
voltage potential. This way, if stray volts enter the grid, the
voltage passing through all the metal is the same. If someone
touched the metal, there would be no shock.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same reason a squirrel can sit on a power line
without getting hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is a difference in voltage _ as when the squirrel
touches another power line or a pole _ the result could be a shock
or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you have to remember is that the grid is not 100
percent effective,'' said Rick Park, a service coordinator for SKC
Electric. ``It is not a sure thing. It is there for safety, and it
is the best humans can come up with. But you have to remember there
are a lot of variables that can defeat these systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzig's inspection of the Tomahawk Ridge pool found that
several structures were added to the complex without being properly
connected to the grid. Also, several other items were initially
connected but were altered sometime after installation.
</P>
<P>
   A third group of items were never properly bonded during the
original installation, Herzig said. Overland Park officials denied
that.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the items were ladders, lifeguard stands, canopies and
diving board rails.
</P>
<P>
   City officials found similar problems at the city's other five
pools.
</P>
<P>
   After area cities heard about Overland Park's pool closings,
some decided to make sure their pools were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Olathe, Kan., for example, was advised that because the city had
not added features or modified its pools, the original design and
construction would ensure people's safety.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a precaution, the city had an electrician inspect its
pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pools were fine,'' said Marlene Natoli, assistant director
of community services. ``We did some minor modifications following
the test, but there were no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cities conducted tests before the pools opened for the
season. Overland Park, which did not test the grid system before
the season began, will now require such tests every year, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cities with older pools, such as Kansas City, do not have the
protective grids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the grid systems, because our pools were built
back in the 1940s and 1950s,'' said Chuck Moore, communications
officer for the Kansas City Parks and Recreation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The city checks the pools at the beginning of the season to make
sure everything is safe, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Banks, president and owner of Banks Pool &AMP; Spa Designs
Inc. in Kansas City, said it was important for homeowners and
apartment complexes with pools to periodically check them to make
sure that their safety measures are working properly, including
checking the grid system.
</P>
<P>
   Pools are designed to withstand incidents such as the one in
Overland Park, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been a lot worse,'' Banks said. ``Fortunately,
Overland Park found out about its problems with the pools without
anybody getting injured.''

VAUGHN HAS NO TIME TO TALK _ JUST PLAY

<P>
   OAKLAND _ Mo Vaughn is the only Anaheim Angel to play in all 97
games this season and he's started all 97. But if ever there was a
time he might have been given a day off, it was Friday against the
A's.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was hit in the helmet by a pitch thrown by Texas' Darren
Oliver Thursday in the first inning. He stayed in the game and
batted four more times, drawing four walks. He showed up at the
Oakland Coliseum Friday afternoon with some swelling on the right
side of his face but said he was able to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel beautiful,'' Vaughn said as he dumped a couple of
aspirin tablets from a bottle into his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the normally talkative Vaughn didn't feel much like
talking about the beaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he wants to make a big deal out of it,'' manager
Mike Scioscia said. ``He doesn't want people to focus on what he's
doing. He truly encompasses a team ideology. It's like, 'I got hit,
let's play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was checked out by doctors Thursday, who cleared him to
play.
</P>
<P>
   !Superstitious: Darin Erstad said he doesn't have any pregame
superstitions, nothing like Wade Boggs' insistence on eating
chicken before every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing that I say I have to do,'' he said. ``Everybody has
some kind of routine that makes them feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, however, does wear the same grungy T-shirt with cutoff
sleeves every game. The shirt _ which carries the phrase, ``Eat
right, drink lots of fluids, get plenty of rest'' on the front _ is
starting to get a little yellow. On the back is the phrase, ``Go
like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the shirt disappeared, I wouldn't commit suicide,'' Erstad
said. ``It's just a shirt.''

MINETA SWORN IN AT COMMERCE IN QUICK CEREMONY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ Norm Mineta, who spent three years imprisoned at a
Japanese American internment camp and 20 years representing the
South Bay in Congress, was sworn in Friday as the 33rd secretary of
commerce.
<P>
   Mineta is the first American of Asian descent to serve in a
president's Cabinet. He was sworn in at a hastily arranged private
ceremony after a speedy and controversy-free confirmation by the
Senate late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old former San Jose mayor will serve for six months
until President Clinton's term comes to an end. Mineta replaces
William Daley, who resigned from the Commerce Department last month
to manage Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months is a virtual eternity in the new economy,'' Mineta
said at a confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee
on Wednesday. Mineta said his top priorities will include promoting
free trade, expanding e-commerce and pursuing a policy of ``digital
inclusion to bridge the digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months of opportunity and responsibility will demand a
greater focus to make a greater difference in that time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; China Trade a Top Priority
</P>
<P>
   Among his first likely tasks will be to secure Senate passage of
permanent trade relations with China, a top goal of the Clinton
administration and the business community.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta will oversee a department of 40,000 employees with a $5
billion annual budget; his responsibilities range from promoting
American business and issuing patents and trademarks to conducting
the census and running the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment was hailed by Asian American groups as a
significant step toward ending discrimination and opening avenues
that have long been viewed as off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our history in this country, with a lot of
discrimination, epitomized by the internment camps during WWII, and
then to the year 2000, with Mineta becoming an appointee in the
president's Cabinet _ it's been a long distance we have traveled,''
said John Tateishi, executive director of the Japanese American
Citizens League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a signal to the rest of the country that Asian Americans
have arrived, and that we are now part of the fabric that makes up
the leadership of America,'' Tateishi said.
</P>
<P>
   As a 10-year-old boy in 1942, Mineta and his family were forced
from their San Jose home and sent to an internment camp in Wyoming
along with other Japanese Americans who were deemed a risk to the
national security.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta recalled his father bringing the family together, and
saying, ``He did not know what the war would bring to my mother and
to him, since they were resident aliens. ... However, he was
confident that his beloved country would guarantee and protect the
right of his children _ American citizens, all. But his confidence,
as it turned out, was misplaced.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineta led the fight in Congress to secure reparation payments
for the tens of thousands of Japanese Americans forced into the
camps. He rose to the rank of chairman of the Transportation and
Public Works Committee before leaving the House in the middle of
his 11th term to accept a senior executive position at Lockheed
Martin Corp., the world's largest defense contractor, which at one
time was the largest private employer in his district. At Lockheed,
Mineta worked on public transportation issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tried unsuccessfully in 1992 to tap Mineta to be
secretary of transportation, and he is regarded as a likely
candidate for a Cabinet post if Gore wins the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mineta) brings an in-depth understanding of American business
and a strong sense of the needs of our high-tech economy,'' Clinton
said in a statement released by the Commerce Department. ``But he
also has a deep concern for people, for the people in places who
are not yet fully participating in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineta's strong relations with Republicans as well as Democrats
was evident at his hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee
this week where Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the committee chair,
praised him as a ``great American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm Mineta's life story is, in a real sense, a celebration of
America,'' said Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   McCain expressed concerns about the ``alleged political nature''
of the Commerce Department's trade missions, but no objections were
raised to Mineta's confirmation. Members of the audience, including
Capitol Hill staffers, friends and members of Washington's Asian
American Committee burst into applause when the 90-minute hearing
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta was unanimously approved by a voice vote late Thursday
night. Mineta, who said at his hearing that ``accountability and
accessibility are among the greatest responsibilities that every
public servant owes,'' declined requests for interviews Friday. A
public swearing-in ceremony is expected in the next couple of
weeks.

BROCKOVICH CLAIMS MEDIA INACCURACIES
</HEADLINE>
 - LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA BARTHOLOMEW 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ Movie heroine Erin Brockovich issued
a challenge Friday to the TV news reporter who claimed her landmark
legal victory was based on a false assumption: Drink the water.
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich, the Agoura Hills, Calif., legal aide whose fight
against a utility company for poisoning well water won a $333
million settlement and a movie in her name, dared the anchor to put
his mouth where his mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   Her target: John Stossel, whose ``Give me a break'' segment on
ABC-TV's ``20/20'' last week called into question the harmful
effects of chromium 6 on the residents of the desert town of
Hinkley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the piece appalling,'' said Brockovich, 40, visibly
upset during a news conference in Westlake Village on Friday.
``Chromium 6 is toxic; chromium 6 is poison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Mr. Stossel, and his family, to come out here. I want
you to start drinking chromium 6-laced water, day in and day out,
just like the people in Hinkley did everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from ABC News on Friday defended the Stossel
broadcast by saying it never claimed drinking chromium 6 is safe,
but that ``drinking, breathing, or touching large amounts of
chromium 6 can cause lots of diseases - including lung and sinus
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Brockovich and her boss, Thousand Oaks attorney Ed Masry,
called for Stossel and his producer to apologize to them and to the
650 plaintiffs of Hinkley for what they say was a dangerous and
misleading broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   They also called for the media members' jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Masry, 67, whose Westlake Village practice forced PG&AMP;E into
paying millions after dumping chromium-laced water near its pumping
plant north of Barstow, called Stossel ``a plain-out fool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To permit a brainless news report to be aired without
verification of certain facts is absolutely ludicrous,'' he said.
``I would check the facts before encouraging children to drink
toxic poison - you might as well tell them to play with a loaded
gun.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript of his July 14 broadcast, Stossel
questioned whether chromium made Hinkley residents and PG&AMP;E
employees sick.
</P>
<P>
   There's no proof, he said, that chromium-laced drinking water
causes cancer. He cited the Environmental Protection Agency, which
sets drinking water standards, and the state Cancer Registry, which
he said found no excess cancer around Hinkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a known carcinogen if inhaled at high levels,'' said
Stossel, ``but there is no proof that the exposure in Hinkley made
people sick, or even that above-average numbers of people were
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``20/20'' broadcast cited a PG&AMP;E study of 50,000 suspect
power plant workers who turned out healthier than average, a study
Masry said was impossibly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   A summary of the corrosive effects of chromium 6 by the National
Safety Council division says it can damage tissue through exposure
via air, water, soil and food.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Dahlgren, the toxicology expert whose examination of
50 Hinkley residents influenced the 1993 settlement, said they
showed classic symptoms of chromium poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't subtle stuff,'' he said. ``They had very, very
severe upper respiratory problems, nosebleeds, cancers - things
known from people who have a history of chromium exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to calling for his job, Masry challenged Stossel to
debate Brockovich on the facts about chromium 6.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on television whether he'd let his family drink the water
in Hinkley, Stossel stalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, none of us like pollution,'' he said. ``I wouldn't like
them to drink the water, but let's not terrify people unless we
know it's true.''

EXCERPTS FROM PREFACE TO SPECIAL COUNSEL'S REPORT
</HEADLINE>
   (With WACO-REPORT) 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS, July 21 _ Following are excerpts from the preface to
the interim report of John Danforth, the special counsel, which
cleared the government of any wrongdoing in the deaths of 80 people
at the Branch Davidian compound outside Waco, Texas, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The bad acts alleged in this case are among the most serious
charges that can be leveled against a government _ that its agents
deliberately set fire to a building full of people, that they
pinned children in the burning building with gunfire, that they
illegally employed the armed forces in these actions and that they
then lied about their conduct. I took such charges very seriously
and began this investigation with my own mind totally open as to
the issues before me. ... This interim report summarizes the
exhaustive efforts undertaken to date to investigate every lead and
to test every theory. There is no doubt in my mind about the
conclusions of this report. Government agents did not start or
spread the tragic fire of April 19, 1993, did not direct gunfire at
the Branch Davidians, and did not unlawfully employ the armed
forces of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what is remarkable is the overwhelming evidence
exonerating the government from the charges made against it, and
the lack of any real evidence to support the charges of bad acts.
This lack of evidence is particularly remarkable in light of the
widespread and persistent public belief that the government engaged
in bad acts at Waco. On Aug. 26, 1999, for example, a Time magazine
poll indicated that 61 percent of the public believed that federal
law enforcement officials started the fire at the Branch Davidian
complex.
</P>
<P>
   This is a matter of grave concern. Our country was founded on
the belief that government derives its ``just powers from the
consent of the governed.'' When 61 percent of the people believe
that the government not only fails to ensure ``life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness'' but also intentionally murders people by
fire, the existence of public consent, the very basis of
government, is imperiled. ...
</P>
<P>
   We all carry the horror of the Waco tragedy with us. We have
reviewed the events of Feb. 28 and April 19, 1993, so many times,
and they will not leave us alone: the sight of ATF agents carrying
their dead and wounded from the Branch Davidian complex, the image
of that same complex burning against the sky and the sound of the
wind whipping the flames. In the face of such calamity, we have a
need to affix blame. Things like this can't just happen; they must
be the government's fault. We are somehow able to ignore the
contrary evidence _ never mind that the FBI waited for 51 days
without firing a shot, never mind the evidence that Davidians
started the fire, never mind that FBI agents risked their own lives
in their efforts to rescue the Davidians _ and we buy into the
notion that the government would deliberately kill 80 people in a
burning building. ... The only antidote to this public distrust is
government openness and candor. Instead, and tragically, just the
opposite occurred after Waco. Although the government did nothing
evil on April 19, 1993, its failure to fully and openly disclose to
the American public all that it did has fueled speculation that it
actually committed bad acts on that day. Even in their dealings
with this investigation, some government officials have struggled
to keep a close hold on information. More important, the government
did not disclose to the public its use of pyrotechnic devices at
Waco until August 1999 _ six years after the fact. This
nondisclosure is especially puzzling because the use of these
pyrotechnics had nothing to do with the fire. They were used four
hours before the fire began, 75 feet from the Branch Davidian
residence, and in a manner that could cause no harm. Yet the
failure to disclose this information, more than anything else, is
responsible for the loss of the public faith in the government's
actions, and it led directly to this investigation.

 EVEN DEMOCRATS ARE DEFENDING BUSH AIDE ON CONFLICT CHARGE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timing is everything in politics.
</P>
<P>
   And with a week to go before the Republican National Convention,
the state Democratic Party tried to rev up accusations that Texas
Gov. George W. Bush's state campaign chair, Gerald Parsky, was
guilty of conflict of interest when he served as a University of
California regent and head of a UC investment committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like another Quackenbush problem for the Republicans _
using inside government pressure to direct funds,'' said Bob
Mulholland, campaign adviser to the state Democratic Party in a fax
sent to national political reporters this week.
</P>
<P>
   The problem: leading state Democratic pols, some of them Vice
President Al Gore's biggest supporters, have repeatedly said they
have no reason to believe there are any problems with Parsky _ or
his fellow UC regents _ in the award of a $350,000 contract to
Wilshire Associates, a well-known investment firm. The company is
headed by Dennis Tito, who has donated to Republican causes.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Gray Davis' office, contacted more than a month
ago about questions on Parsky, said he had ``no reason for
concern'' on the regent's actions. His views haven't changed, his
spokeswoman confirmed this week.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, another UC
regent, said likewise last month. This week, he told us he still
has no reason to believe Parsky had done anything wrong _ though he
would have preferred that a contract for the second portion of a
plan had been bidded out.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hopkinson, a Democratic insider and Davis appointee who
now heads the UC investment committee, defended Wilshire as ``a
firm of international repute'' and came to the defense of Parsky as
well.
</P>
<P>
   And State Controller Kathleen Connell _ a major Democratic Gore
supporter _ said of Parsky's accusers: ``I don't see any conflict.
... I don't understand how they came to that conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell sits on the board of CalPERS, the state's $180 billion
pension fund, which she said also chose Wilshire as its investment
adviser because ``they're eminently qualified. ... They're not a
second-tier firm. They're the premiere firm _ I can vouch for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tito, Wilshire's executive, may be a Republican, but he's also
``one of the smartest (investment managers) in the country,''
Connell said. ``He developed the Wilshire (stock) Index, which
everyone in the country is using.''
</P>
<P>
   The only proven problem Bustamante had with Parsky? ``He's
backing the wrong candidate for president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Pete Wilson was not chosen as a delegate to the
Republican National Convention. But sources tell The Chronicle that
he will attend the confab in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Parsky, Bush's state chair, confirmed this week that Wilson
would not be a delegate. ``He has not been part of the Bush
campaign,'' Parsky said, adding that Wilson has devoted his time to
the ``Shape the Debate'' campaign instead.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared to forcefully distance himself from Wilson last
April when he said Republicans will reject ``the politics of
pitting one group against another.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's presence at the GOP convention could create waves _ and
pose some problems for Bush. Wilson is most closely associated with
his support of Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration
measure Bush has sought to put at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson was also a champion of GOP pro-choice delegates the
last time around, waging a battle for them to be heard _ even
though he was eventually drowned out.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush said he would welcome Wilson's support, the ex-gov
has been MIA in the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And don't look for any photo ops of Wilson and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That would make Democratic campaign consultant Mulholland too
happy _ and faster than you can say ``Al Gore,'' he'd put it to use
at those Democratic Latino Unity rallies.

NOTED PSYCHIATRIST SAMUEL GUZE, 76, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samuel Barry Guze, an influential psychiatrist who worked to wed
his discipline to medical science and its diagnostic techniques,
died on Wednesday at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. He was 76
and lived in Clayton, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was bone marrow disease, said a spokesman for the
Washington University School of Medicine, where he was the Olin
Professor of Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Guze (pronounced goo-ZAY), was among the first psychiatrists to
use the study of twins as a way to investigate the role of heredity
in mental illness. He and his researchers contributed significantly
to the knowledge of genetic vulnerability to alcoholism and
schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Guze trained as an internist before turning to psychiatry. In
the 1950s, he propagated the view that psychiatric trouble should
be diagnosed through the use of a scientific model and a biological
approach.
</P>
<P>
   As Guze, who also was an associate professor of medicine, once
put it: ``I couldn't ignore my training in internal medicine. I
suggested we approach psychiatric patients the way general
physicians approach all patients.''
</P>
<P>
   His views found general acceptance in 1980, when he helped to
compile the American Psychiatric Association's standard DSM-III,
the ``Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.'' He
and Donald Goodwin also published a textbook for adherents of the
medical approach, ``Psychiatric Diagnosis'' (1974), whose fifth
edition of 1996 remains in print at Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   Also in print are ``Why Psychiatry Is a Branch of Medicine''
(Oxford, 1992), and two books of which Guze was editor or
co-editor, ``Adult Psychiatry'' (Mosby, 1996) and ``Childhood
Psychopathology and Development'' (Books on Demand).
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Guze, a native New Yorker, attended City College before
receiving his medical degree from Washington University in St.
Louis in 1945. He trained in internal medicine at Barnes Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Washington faculty in 1951, served as vice
chancellor and president of the medical center from 1971 to 1989,
and headed the department of psychiatry from 1975 to 1989 and again
from 1993 to 1997. He also was psychiatrist in chief of the
university-affiliated Barnes-Jewish and St. Louis Children's
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Guze is survived by his wife of 54 years, Joy Campbell Guze; a
son, Jonathan D., of Durham, N.C.; a daughter, Jeremy Ann Guze
Opitz of Danbury, N.H., and five grandchildren.

 SUMMERTIME BLUES FOR UNITED AT SFO  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At the height of the summer travel season,
United Airlines is scrambling to cope with major flight delays and
cancellations, leaving angry passengers waiting for hours in
airports across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Union troubles, crowded runways and bad weather share the blame,
according to United, the Bay Area's dominant airline.
</P>
<P>
   In May, United led all other airlines in flight delays with only
57 percent of its planes arriving on time, according to the latest
available figures from the Department of Transportation. It also
led in flight cancellations, with 9 percent of flights never taking
off.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is especially acute at the San Francisco Airport,
the nation's worst in terms of delays, caused in most cases by fog.
United accounts for more than half of the airport's flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing everything we can, everything in our power,''
said Chris Brathwaite, a spokesman for United. ``It's been pretty
well documented that we've had some operations difficulties. But
the delays and cancellations are not because of one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   United's troubles began April 12, when its pilots contract
expired without an agreement. Many pilots reacted by refusing to
work overtime, leaving the airline scrambling because its schedule
is created taking overtime into account.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, many of United's maintenance crews have refused
to work overtime until their contract, which expired July 12, is
renewed. That has created a backlog of minor maintenance problems
that has doubled the number of grounded planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not paid near what all the other major airlines pay,''
said Herb Hunter, a spokesman for the United Airlines pilots union.
``I feel really bad for our customers. I hope they will be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect of these union disputes on flight schedules have been
compounded by the busy summer travel season, air traffic control
problems and unseasonable weather. For example, 13 United flights
in San Francisco were eliminated Friday because of fog.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of crew troubles, United has canceled at least
4,800 flights between May and September, or about 2 percent of the
airline's entire schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Lost business amounts to at least $50 million from April to
June, according to United's parent company, UAL, based in Chicago.
How much more the labor disputes, which have gone on four months so
far, cost the airline depends on how long they last.
</P>
<P>
   Many passengers are encountering an array of difficulties after
they arrive at the airport. For instance, a Chronicle reporter, who
was flying from Newark to Oakland Friday, was asked at the ticket
counter to take another flight in exchange for a $100 coupon
because his original flight was overbooked.
</P>
<P>
   The first leg of his flight was canceled because there was no
replacement for a defective part in the plane's navigation system.
He arrived in Denver late on a different plane, only to be told
that the final leg of the flight was delayed because the pilots
were in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Wilson, a spokesman for San Francisco Airport, said that up
to four or five United flights have been canceled per day this
month because of crew shortages. But he said that many of those
were short distance shuttles that depart frequently so passengers
could simply take a later flight, and in some cases, be put on
another airline.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some United passengers with canceled flights had
to sleep in the airport overnight, Wilson said. Because of these
inconveniences, the airport is receiving more passenger complaints
about United than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers can take several steps to reduce the chances of a
long wait because of a delayed flight. Brathwaite, the United
spokesman, suggested that passengers call or check the airline's
Web site for flight delays before going to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Airport officials have been bothered by United's
tardy flights even prior to this summer, and they have asked the
airline to improve timeliness by at least 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   United has agreed but has not said specifically how it will be
accomplished. Possibilities include adding a few minutes to flight
itineraries and reducing the number of flights.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kuhlmann, vice president of Roberts, Roach &AMP; Associates, an
aviation and transportation consulting firm in San Francisco, said
United is caught in a tough situation. ``United has had the
especially unfortunate situation of having labor trouble when they
are compounded by all sorts of other stuff,'' Kuhlmann said.
``They're stuck.''

NEUMA GONCALVES DA SILVA, 78, SAMBA LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neuma Goncalves da Silva, a central figure in the slums that
served as the testing ground for the composers, seamstresses and
fiercely talented layabouts who catapulted samba into an art form,
died on Monday in Rio de Janeiro. She was 78.
</P>
<P>
   A poor woman all her life, Goncalves da Silva, affectionately
known as Dona Neuma, rose to national prominence because of her
role in the samba school of Mangueira, a sprawling favela in Rio de
Janeiro. Her home became a meeting place for the creators of samba,
the frenetic, drum-heavy music that accompanies the hip-gyrating
dance of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   She founded the women's wing of the Mangueira samba school and
was its president for several terms. She often sought out the
carpenters and sculptors who built the floats and the seamstresses
and designers who created the costumes for the annual Carnival
celebration. The school's official colors, pink and green, often
show up among the victors in samba competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Goncalves da Silva was a force behind the scenes in electing the
male-dominated leadership of the school. Candidacies like that of
the acting Mangueira president, Elmo Jose dos Santos, were often
said to have been hatched from her modest home on Visconde de
Niteroi street.
</P>
<P>
   Goncalves da Silva also entertained celebrities like the
composer Heitor Villa-Lobos and the musician Noel Rosa, as well as
many politicians.
</P>
<P>
   One governor recognized Goncalves da Silva's social role by
giving her a telephone, the first in the favela.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest daughter in her poor family, Goncalves da Silva was
born in 1922 in Madureira, another Rio neighborhood and moved to
Mangueira as a child. At the time, samba was emerging as a type of
lingua franca among the variants of African-inspired music and
dance practiced in Rio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, her father, Saturnino Goncalves, was a founder of the
Mangueira Samba School and Recreational Society, together with Jose
Gomes da Costa, also known as Ze Espinguela, a master of
organization who arranged the first competitions among Rio's samba
schools. Other founders were the legendary composers Angenor da
Silva, or Cartola, and Carlos Moreira de Castro, better known as
Carlos Cachaca.
</P>
<P>
   Immersed as she was in music as a child, Goncalves da Silva made
samba central to her life, which was always one of economic
hardship. To make ends meet, according to one account, she took to
washing clothes by hand after being denied a factory job because
she was black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samba never leaves us sad,'' Goncalves da Silva told one
interviewer. ``It never leaves us with that disease which is
nostalgia.''
</P>
<P>
   When Maria Tereza Goulart, the wife of Brazil's former
president, Joao Goulart, visited Goncalves da Silva to see the
Mangueira school for herself, she was reported to have danced until
the wee hours. A headline in a local newspaper read, ``The first
lady of the country is received by the first lady of samba.''
</P>
<P>
   Goncalves da Silva is survived by four children, four
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   As samba evolved over the years into a commercialized,
multimillion-dollar industry, Goncalves da Silva wondered whether
the musical form could still capture with frivolity the ferocity of
existence, as it did when the Mangueira samba school was starting
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days samba is manufactured instead of delivered from
within us,'' she said. ``But I think samba is on a slow voyage to
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   After Goncalves da Silva's burial on Tuesday, her friends and
family members gathered to dance until 3 in the morning to some of
the legendary sambas with which she was associated. &QL;

THE SPORTING MUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's news-and-views edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   News item: Davey Johnson returns from the hospital to manage the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Views: It wasn't the least bit surprising that the 2000 Dodgers
made their manager sick. Since he arrived, he's been tearing
himself up internally about all of the personnel shortcomings that
G.M. Kevin Malone handed him.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone is clearly winning the internal battle for control.
All of the key people in the front office are Malone hires, and he
has the support of CEO Bob Daly. Johnson didn't even have final say
on all of his coaches. That might make my heart beat faster, too.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Olbermann of Fox Sports Net reported this week that Dodger
officials were preparing to fire him just before he checked into a
hospital. But at this point, what's the use of letting him go? A
firing now would make the organization look sour and mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Johnson is fire, baseball sources say Malone will make
another run at Montreal's Felipe Alou, too, before settling for
someone like Kevin Kennedy. Alou chose to stay in Montreal two
years ago after the Expos stepped up with a new contract, but the
franchise remains an endangered species. Maybe this time Alou
doesn't get sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   After completing the current homestand, the Dodgers play 23 of
their next 36 games on the road, a run that will take them to
September. If that's bad news, here's the good: Only six games of
the next 36 are against division leaders or serious wild card
contenders, three each against the Braves and the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Friday, the N.L. West-leading Diamondbacks have 39 of
their 66 remaining games on the road, too, where they're under
.500.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the Dodgers play 19 of 28 games at home.
Twenty-two of those 28 games will be against N.L. West foes,
including six with Arizona, three with the Giants and six with the
let's-ruin-the-Dodgers-season Padres.
</P>
<P>
   News: Angel pennant hopes are closing in on August.
</P>
<P>
   Views: September is what we remember, but races are often lost
in August.
</P>
<P>
   After the Angels short road trip is concluded, they will play 13
of their next 16 at home. But 10 of those home games are against
the White Sox, Red Sox and Yankees, and thereafter, the Angels 29
of their last 44 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage the Angels do have is more games under their belt.
Thanks to early season rainouts, the Yankees (six) and red Sox
(four) have quite a few more games to play than the Angels.
Doubleheaders and a lack of off days equals losses.
</P>
<P>
   News: Wild card races are hotter than Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   Views: As much as one might disdain the wild card, the 2000 race
has pennant-race atmosphere. The only A.L. division that's
essentially cinched is the Central (White Sox), leaving six teams
playing for three playoff spots, and through Thursday, all six were
separated by less than two games.
</P>
<P>
   In the N.L., the Braves and Cardinals look safe. The Braves have
a schedule edge on the Mets and the Reds do not seem capable of
making a run, especially after trading Denny Neagle. But just five
games separate six contenders for two playoff spots (N.L. West,
wild card), if one believes Colorado, Cincinnati and Florida, all
just a game over .500, are contenders.
</P>
<P>
   News: Kevin Brown goes on a rant over a newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   Views: I like to believe that athletes are bright enough to know
when they're being worked, but Brown obviously didn't. He did
exactly what the author wanted him to do, make a big fuss over
nothing and draw attention to a brief episode that was of no news
value or use to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   News: Shawn Green starts to shake his slump.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Green didn't make any excuses for his slump. But the
truth is that his homecoming has kept him extremely busy. He's very
generous with his time and money, and his first year playing at
home has definitely added a dynamic he didn't need.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he became the official spokesman for the Jewish Big
Brothers program. He filmed several public service announcements
that urge men to volunteer for the organization's mentoring
program, which has suffered a steep decline the last few years. He
will also participate in select Big Brother functions.
</P>
<P>
   Green has thrived as a person and ballplayer through his
relationship with his father, Ira, but Ira's father died young.
This is Green's way of giving back to his community while also
extending a bridge to his dad's past.
</P>
<P>
   News: Baseball's blue ribbon panel on its economics says 27 of
30 teams lost money, and it alludes to folding weaker franchises as
a way to stem the game's financial divide.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Sorry, I don't buy the idea of 27 losers in baseball,
especially when four of them are owned by media conglomerates _ the
Dodgers, Cubs, Braves and Angels. You know management at those
companies can shift money around to show a profit or loss on
whatever it wants.
</P>
<P>
   But I heartily agree with the idea of folding at least two
franchises. (I'd vote for Montreal and Tampa Bay.) The best way to
get the attention of the player's union is to threaten eliminating
100 major league jobs (40 man rosters plus coaches), another
250-plus minor league jobs, plus another 300-plus white collar jobs
(front office, scouting).
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is a great city, but the most memorable moments there
hardly involved the Expos _ Rick Monday's 1981 playoff home run and
Tony Gwynn's 3,000th hit _ and there was already proof that Florida
is a soft market before Tampa Bay was given a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   News: Isiah Thomas named Indiana Pacers coach.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Scratch one contender from the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   News: The 2000 NFL season nears with L.A. still without a
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Views: Here's a viable quote from a U.S. Senator on the NFL:
``Fans want to watch footbvall, but a majority of owners would
rather play Monopoly ... So many cities are hungry for pro football
that they have launched a bidding war to lure away established
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   That comes from Tennessee Senator Al Gore, Jr. No, not the
current Democratic party candidate, Al Gore, but his dad, circa
1986, when the NFL was lobbying for congressional perks.
</P>
<P>
   More proof that things don't change.

STEPHEN GENDIN, 34, ADVOCATE AND WRITER FOR AIDS CAUSES; THOMAS
SARDINO, 72, SYRACUSE POLICE CHIEF; VIRGINIA SAURWEIN, 71, U.N.
OFFICIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: No byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stephen Gendin, an activist and writer who founded a nationally
known mail-order prescription service for people infected with HIV,
died Wednesday in New York. He was 34.
</P>
<P>
   Gendin died of cardiac arrest while undergoing chemotherapy for
AIDS-related lymphoma, said Sean Strubb, founder of Poz, a national
magazine about life with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Gendin spent the last 15 years working to help people who had
AIDS or who were infected with HIV, the virus that causes it. He
was a founder and the chief executive of the Community Prescription
Service, a mail-order pharmacy service that also distributes
information to people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Gendin also became known through a regular column he wrote for
Poz. In the column, he discussed in graphic detail the toll AIDS
took on his body, his fantasies of political assassination and, in
an article that incited outrage among many gay men, the guilt and
the pleasure he felt from having unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman at Brown University, Gendin learned he was
infected with HIV. He founded the Rhode Island Chapter of Act Up,
the AIDS protest group, and was active in fund-raising for the
organization's New York chapter. He regularly took part in
protests, rallies and mass acts of civil disobedience, for which he
had a long arrest record. He was a director of AID for AIDS, which
distributes medications to patients in Latin America. He was also a
founder of Sex Panic, a group that contends it is preserving New
York's untrammeled ``sexual culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Gendin is survived by his partner, Kyle MacDowell; his father,
Sidney Gendin of Ypsilanti, Mich.; and his sister, Margo Hart of
Ionia, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   THOMAS SARDINO, 72, SYRACUSE POLICE CHIEF &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Sardino, who as Syracuse's police chief strove to
defuse demonstrations, disorders and racial tension in the early
1970s, died July 14 in Syracuse. He was 72 and lived in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, The Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
   Sardino headed his city's police from 1970 to 1985. In
mid-August 1971, when Syracuse youth gangs were involved in a
series of racial clashes, window breakings and fire-bombings, he
sent police community relations teams and human relations experts
to try to bring peace between the gangs, and the violence subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Early that month, after three nights of fire-bombing, Sardino
declared that ``citizens who feel their life and property are
threatened by arsonists may use deadly force.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when Vietnam War opponents, after protesting at
Syracuse University, wanted to march through the city's streets,
Sardino gave his approval. But he stipulated that the march had to
be well behaved _ and be led by him.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1990 interview, David Ifshin, who had been a Syracuse
student leader in 1970, recalled Sardino's ``patience and wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Sardino wrote books about police work, including ``Crime Control
Team'' (1971) and ``Police Crisis Intervention'' (1977).
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Syracuse, received degrees from Syracuse
University and joined the Syracuse police force in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Nina, 5 children and 11
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA SAURWEIN, 71, U.N. OFFICIAL
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Saurwein, who was the United Nations' top liaison
official with nongovernmental organizations from 1975 until 1989,
died July 9 in Erie, Pa. She was 71 and lived in South Salem, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered a heart attack and a stroke in February, according
to a former colleague.
</P>
<P>
   During Saurwein's tenure, nongovernmental organizations, known
as became increasingly influential at the United Nations in fields
like the environment, international law, arms control and human
rights. Such groups often play a significant role in bringing
social issues to the attention of member states.
</P>
<P>
   At the International Women's Year conference in Mexico City in
1975, Saurwein helped draft the first U.N. resolution on women's
access to credit. Later she was a co-founder and board member of
Women's World Banking, a global loan-guarantee organization. After
the Mexico City conference, she became chief of the nongovernmental
organization liaison unit in the U.N. Department of Economic and
Social affairs, a post she held until her retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Early in her career Saurwein worked as a program director at the
U.N. Association of the USA and at the Center for War/Peace
Studies. In 1970, the U.N. Development Program asked her to help
create its nongovernmental organization liaison office, which she
managed for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Saurwein is survived by a brother, George Saurwein, of Erie.

`NIGHT STALKER' IN NEW YORK BOARDING HOUSE JAILED AFTER ATTACKING
NEIGHBOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS _ Anyone who relishes scary stories knows that
there is one sure way to slay a vampire: drive a sharp wooden stake
through his heart while he sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   A 45-year-old Rockland County man, David Bolton, tried to do
just that to a neighbor early Wednesday, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our share of violent attacks,'' said Sgt. Steve
Morgan of the Clarkstown police, ``but nothing with this, shall we
say, modus operandi.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, at about 2 a.m. Bolton broke into
his victim's room at the Laurel Hotel, a boarding house where both
men live in Nanuet, a hamlet in Clarkstown. He was carrying a
hammer and a handmade wooden cross that had been whittled to a
spike at one end, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton struck the other man, Jeffrey Todd, 22, with the hammer,
and brandished the sharpened cross as if he were about to impale
him, the police said. Todd awoke in time to wrestle the cross from
Bolton, but Bolton repeatedly hit him with the hammer on the head,
neck, shoulder and back, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   When others in the boarding house heard the commotion and came
to help, Bolton ran back to his room, where he was later arrested,
the police said. Todd, a construction worker, was treated at Nyack
Hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said the two men had no previous dispute. Bolton told
police officers that he had ``received instructions from a higher
authority,'' the Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton was being held without bail Friday at the Rockland County
Correctional Facility, charged with attempted murder, assault,
burglary and criminal possession of a weapon, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Laurel Hotel, Todd's older brother Brian said the
attack had left him and other residents too frightened to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It freaks you out,'' he said. ``I can't sleep at night. No one
can. You see it happening in the movies, but you never expect it in
real life.''

WHITE BE BACK TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Devon White figures he'll be activated as soon as
today after missing the last 69 games with a left-shoulder injury.
And when White returns, Todd Hollandsworth said he expects to drop
back into the role of White's backup in center field for the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   White went 1 for 2 with a double and walk in five innings Friday
in his second rehab game for Class A San Bernardino, and general
manager Kevin Malone said White would control when he's ready to
return _ providing the team's medical staff gives him clearance.
It's a two-game rehab stint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is still what it was,'' Hollandsworth said.
``It's been kind of weird. But circumstances are what they are.
They always have been. Nothing has changed along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   White will be eased back, but Hollandsworth acknowledges White
will eventually be the starter again. Before the injury, White
started 19 of 26 games in center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what the circumstances were, Devo's going to be
here for the long haul,'' Hollandsworth said. ``He's under a
multiyear contract and as long as he's healthy he's going to play.
That's the way it's been.''
</P>
<P>
   White is in the second year of a three-year, $12.4 million
contract. Hollandsworth is a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers like Hollandsworth's versatility, but a team
official said it's ``extremely unlikely'' Hollandsworth would
re-sign with the club in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   __ Dusty's decision: The last time the Dodgers had a managerial
search, Dusty Baker was mentioned time and again as a leading
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   With Baker's current contract status unresolved, coupled with
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson's uncertain future, Baker's
availability and his level of interest in Los Angeles holds
relevance.
</P>
<P>
   Baker has been offered a contract extension by the Giants, but
he hasn't acted on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided to wait,'' Baker said. ``Right now, I'm going
to put all my efforts into winning. That's what I preach to my
players, `Don't worry about the contract, don't worry about the
money.' Do your job, win and the money will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's situation is up in the air. You live life up in
the air. Davey's a fine manager. I don't know what's happened here
with Davey or what hasn't happened here. I'm just hoping that
Davey's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hope it never becomes an issue.

EDITORIAL: REPUBLICAN TAX CUTS

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 22:
</P>
<P>
   The Republican effort to pass tax cuts that are tilted in favor
of wealthy families has until now been largely an election-year
sideshow. This week's vote to cut taxes on married couples,
including upper-income couples whom the code now subsidizes, and
previous votes to eliminate the tax on wealthy estates were not
large enough to get past President Clinton's promised vetoes. These
tax plans will die.
</P>
<P>
   But another GOP tax bill may not. The House will vote next week
whether to repeal a tax hike on high-income Social Security
recipients passed in 1993 as part of Clinton's deficit-reduction
plan. The Senate has already voted 58-41 for repeal. The Clinton
plan raised the portion of benefits subject to taxes to as much as
85 percent from 50 percent _ in effect raising the tax rate from
about 15 percent to about 25 percent. The White House argued that
it brought taxes on Social Security benefits closer in line with
taxes on private pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even after the 1993 rate hike, the tax code continues to
treat Social Security benefits more favorably than private pension
benefits. Repeal would make the discrepancy worse, and hand an
unwarranted $100 billion tax cut to the 15 percent or so wealthiest
retirees over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfairness is not the only problem. The Social Security system
is expected to run deficits over the next 75 years. This situation,
if addressed immediately, could be eliminated with modest fixes.
One would be to tax Social Security benefits fully as much as
private pensions. Repeal of the 1993 tax hike would move in the
opposite direction, eventually forcing Congress to tackle the
deficits with stiff benefit cuts and tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the Senate for repeal was short of the two-thirds
majority needed to override a veto. But some of the Democrats who
voted against repeal have warned their leadership that they are
likely to change their votes if it comes back to the Senate after
overwhelming approval in the House. That danger can be avoided if a
large number of House members reject the repeal.

EDITORIAL: THE SENATE'S DIMINISHING APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 22:
</P>
<P>
   It is too soon to know whether questions surrounding
fund-raising activities in Sen. Robert Torricelli's 1996 campaign
will derail his ambitions to become the next governor of New
Jersey. What intrigues us at the moment is Torricelli's eagerness
to leave the Senate after only four years, and the light this sheds
on the relative appeal of the Senate and the statehouses. The
Senate has been described as ``the greatest deliberative body on
earth.'' Even so, Torricelli wants out, believing that as a
governor he has a better chance of getting things done and,
further, a better chance to achieve higher office should he ever
seek it.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone in that view. Among politicians who seek
enhanced power and greater influence over social policy, the Senate
has declined in value while the governorships have risen. Leverage
is one factor. Torricelli is but one of 100 senators. An individual
senator can shape legislation and, on very rare occasions, claim
authorship. But unless a senator heads a committee, his or her
power is incremental.
</P>
<P>
   A governor, by contrast, is a chief executive, an agenda-setter
and architect. Governors make things happen. Congress rewrote the
welfare laws. But it is governors like John Engler of Michigan and
Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin _ flush with cash from Washington _ who
are actually remaking welfare in America. It is the governors who
can turn bad schools into good ones. It was a single governor,
George Ryan of Illinois, who energized the national debate on
capital punishment by imposing a moratorium on executions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has other liabilities. It requires a personality
capable of enduring endless delays while engaging in tedious
negotiations that may produce nothing at all. Nor can senators any
longer count on foreign policy issues to help them build a national
reputation. The end of the Cold War and the increasing complexity
of global issues have effectively shrunk the stage that yielded
such big players as William Fulbright and Henry Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate's main deficiency is that for someone who aspires
to broad influence and the mantle of leadership, it is simply not
the place to amass a portfolio of politically portable
achievements. John McCain came to the 2000 Republican primaries
identified mainly with an unsuccessful if valiant effort to reform
the campaign financing system. Bill Bradley came to the Democratic
primary identified mainly with tax reform. Energetic governors, by
contrast, can write a legislative resume that cuts across many
fields and can be marketed as a coherent body of work.
</P>
<P>
   This may account for the decreasing importance of the Senate and
increasing importance of the statehouses as sources of presidential
timber. From 1960 until 1976, the Senate provided nearly all the
party nominees and most of the serious candidates for the
nomination. Former senators _ Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon _ occupied
the White House from 1961 to 1974. But for 20 of the last 24 years,
governors have run the place _ Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, already outlining the makings of a campaign
platform, said that as governor he would establish a statewide
day-care system, stop suburban sprawl, give prescription drug
benefits to the middle class and broaden the public school system
to include 4-year-olds. Any one of these would be a career-defining
achievement for a senator. But for a prospective governor, such an
agenda is not far-fetched.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 22:
</P>
<P>
   A model effort to create an equitable, multiethnic society in
the South Pacific island nation of Fiji has been derailed by the
forced removal of the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister.
The United States and other democratic nations should press Fiji's
new leaders to honor its Constitution, which in 1997 awarded ethnic
Indian citizens the right to hold high office.
</P>
<P>
   The recent upheaval was largely the work of George Speight, a
part-Fijian businessman who stormed the Parliament in May with a
group of armed followers and held three dozen people hostage,
including Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, until last week. He
accused Chaudhry of promoting pro-Indian policies. Speight says
that Indians, who make up 44 percent of Fiji's population of
812,000, have too much economic and political clout. The siege
ended when military leaders bowed to Speight's demands for a new
government.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's new president, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, and its new prime
minister, Laisenia Qarase, attempted to challenge Speight by not
appointing rebel supporters to key cabinet positions. Speight
responded by forcing Iloilo, who is elderly and ill, to make room
in the administration for rebels and possibly for himself as well.
</P>
<P>
   The international community should help Chaudhry's People's
Coalition regain power. Britain, Australia and New Zealand have
recalled their ambassadors because of the unrest, which has
included looting and arson against Indian-owned stores, and are
pushing Fiji to adopt constitutional rule again. On Friday Britain
went further, canceling assistance programs and military visits.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji's military and new government seem intimidated by Speight
and his small band of rebels. Speight is a demagogue who does not
speak for the majority of indigenous Fijians. His racist,
anti-democratic ideas will prevail unless Fiji's democrats and army
commanders work together peacefully to renew constitutional rule.

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ When Maryam Barati first left her home in Isfahan
three years ago to attend college in the capital, she prayed
silently as ech of the 200 miles rolled by.
</P>
<P>
   She prayed that her father, who was at the wheel, would not
suddenly turn the car around and say that she, like all the women
in her family for uncounted generations, could leave the family
nest only to get married.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very reluctant to let me go away to a different city to
study,'' recalled Barati, a 23-year-old physical education
teacher-in-training at Alzahra University in central Tehran. ``But
he finally decided it was all right, and he realized that this has
been an incredible experience for me. Here we have to learn how to
live on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Her adventure in independence is being repeated all over Iran,
where young women now make up nearly 60 percent of university
entrants although women represent barely half the school-age
population.
</P>
<P>
   In a quiet revolution in political and social relations, they
are leaving home as single women in historically high numbers,
forsaking their conservative villages and small towns to seek
higher education wherever they can get it.
</P>
<P>
   Their self-assured mobility _ an independence of action that
their mothers and grandmothers could not even imagine _ represents
a grand social experiment whose impact is making itself felt on
campus and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phenomenon will change the country in ways we cannot even
predict as they enter the labor market and the professions,'' said
Elaheh Koulai, an administrative dean at Tehran University and a
reformist member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that old taboos against higher education for women
have collapsed is that Iranian universities, under the overall
control of Muslim religious leaders, offer worried parents strict
controls over their daughters' lives on campus. Often, the
prohibitions are far more severe than they would have faced at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Their dress, their visitors, even their music and reading
materials are closely monitored. Still, the women say, they are
relishing a fresh sense of freedom even as they realize that their
newfound access to education does not guarantee them jobs
commensurate with their skills.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the educational development of women has been
building for decades, as overall literacy rates have climbed and
the poor and middle-class gained access to education that was the
near-exclusive preserve of the urban rich before the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The women _ and men _ now clamoring for university spaces are
the children of that revolution, born in a baby boom that began in
the early 1980s and slowed only in the last few years. From 1976 to
1986, the national population grew from 33.7 million to 49.4
million. Today it is estimated at 61 million, with 40 percent of
the people under 15.
</P>
<P>
   The desire of women for university slots skyrocketed. From 1990
to 2000, the number of women entering universities tripled as baby
boomers came of age. In some disciplines, like medicine and social
sciences, women now far outnumber men.
</P>
<P>
   And while they have not yet broken into the labor force in
comparable numbers, they have made their expectations and demands a
factor in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The landslide election in 1997 of President Mohammad Khatami, a
moderate cleric who pledged wider social freedoms, is widely
attributed to his popularity among young people and especially
among young women. The failure of conservatives to retain their
hold on Parliament after elections earlier this year is also widely
attributed to a backlash from young women against their support for
hardline social restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the conservatives as a whole have begun to
really understand what the impact will be of having so many
educated young women graduating from our universities,'' said
Mohammad Javad Larijani, a veteran hard-line parliamentarian who
lost his seat in the reformist wave, in an interview after the
elections. ``These women are going to demand that society give
value to their skills and their degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Women have long been underrepresented in politics and the
professions in Iran. They make up just 14 percent of the labor
force, according to a recent United Nations report on human
development in Iran. When they do find jobs, it is in government,
where they hold 23 percent of the public sector posts, and in
farming. They are overrepresented in comparison to men _ by a
factor of 2 to 1 _ only in the unemployment rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many trained and skilled women and girls must stay at home
because of social and traditional obstacles from their families,''
said Dr. Koulai. ``Many men in our society don't want their wives
working outside the home. But this is going to change. The process
is unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   Those obstacles have not deterred many families from breaking
tradition and pushing their daughters to get a university degree at
any cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our daughters don't study, they won't have anything in
life,'' said Ashraf Juyandeh, a 49-year-old cafeteria worker in the
city of Shiraz who is trying to get her two daughters into the
local university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself only finished sixth grade,'' she added. ``Back then,
the rich could afford to send their daughters to school, but
traditional families considered it a bad thing. My mother was never
allowed to go to university and my father could never have afforded
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Juyandeh was married at 14 and widowed at 39. She says she will
get as many jobs as she can to earn enough money to send both her
daughters to university _ anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where religious traditions and the conservative
clergy still dictate a subservient role for women in many families,
the movement of young women out of their hometowns in search of
education and work has already brought about changes in attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience I am having _ and other girls are having _ is
going to affect this country in many ways,'' said Raziyeh Bigonah,
23, an arts student at Alzahra University. ``People who leave their
homes to go to a bigger city experience different things. I'm sure
my generation of women will make itself felt in society.''
</P>
<P>
   She came to Tehran from Tabriz, about 330 miles away, leaving
behind four older housebound sisters who had no desire and no
encouragement from their parents to go to university. ``I try to
keep up my relations with my sisters,'' Bigonah said. ``But now, I
prefer to live here for the rest of my life.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Iranian authorities have tried at different times in recent
years to control the impact of the demand by the new generation of
school-age women for higher education. For nine years, from 1989
until 1997, they limited the number of university slots for women
in order to provide space for male veterans of the war with Iraq.
They have been slow, as well, to build new dormitories at big
campuses where out-of-town women are required to live, sometimes by
their families and sometimes by the university itself.
</P>
<P>
   To control the activities of women on campus, for example, the
universities enforce strict rules at dormitories. Young women are
required to wear the traditional black chador _ the all-enveloping
cloak _ over long coats and tightly pinned headscarves, not only
outside the dorm but inside as well. There are curfews, bans on
visitors and music, and constant supervision of reading material
brought into the dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the regulations, which often are more severe than
what students faced at home, many women say they have learned an
independent way of thinking that can not be unlearned. ``I'm sure
it will affect our choices in marriage,'' said Barati, the Alzahra
student who once feared that her father would not even let her
begin studies. ``I'm educated now, and, young people like me, we
all have more expectations from life these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking just about economics,'' she continued.
``Actually our parents' economic situation was probably better. But
because my future husband and I will both be people who separated
from our parents to go to university and faced the problems of
being independent, we will understand each other better than our
parents probably did when they married.''

REFERENDUM MAY BRING MORE POLITICAL TUMULT TO IVORY COAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS ``cocoa'' to ``cacao'' in 5th graf from end)  
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ This onetime redoubt of political
stability and steady growth in West Africa has been through a lot
in the last year: the fall of an unpopular president, the first
coup in its history and military misrule that twice in the last
month raised the possibility of another army uprising.
</P>
<P>
   During all this tumult the spotlight has stayed on one man, a
former prime minister and mild-mannered international banker,
Alassane Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ouattara returned here a year ago from Washington, where
he served as the International Monetary Fund's deputy managing
director, his political fortunes have been on a roller coaster. He
is down again _ and, along with him, maybe the chances of Ivory
Coast's smooth transition back to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Ivoirians are to vote on a constitutional referendum
whose key parts were intended specifically to exclude Ouattara from
running in the presidential election scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with a bitterness and a weariness that people say are
new to him, Ouattara, 58, vowed in an interview last week to win in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this group of mediocre people,'' Ouattara said of his
main political opponents and the military government. ``They know
that they could not stand competition. They have their toys they
want to keep to themselves. They know that if we open up, they are
so mediocre they would lose everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's military ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, declared a
four-day state of emergency Friday , which members of his junta
said was intended to ensure that the referendum take place
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the former president, Henri Konan Bedie, who was
ousted in the coup, had tried to eliminate Ouattara as a rival by
arguing he was less of an Ivoirian than others because his father
was from neighboring Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Bedie's strategy was part of an overall concept of Ivoirite,
which he argued were values shared by pure Ivoirians, but which was
essentially tribalism that sought to draw a line between Christian
southerners and Muslim northerners like Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   The cleavage was strange in a country that had long been known
for its ethnic tolerance. But even though Ouattara always
maintained that both of his parents were Ivoirian and he himself
was as Ivoirian as anyone else, ethnic divisions have widened in
the Ivory Coast in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   For a few months after the fall of Bedie, Guei, preached ethnic
reconciliation, and the two men appeared to be on friendly terms.
</P>
<P>
   But as Guei's intentions to hold on to power have become
clearer, the two men have stopped cooperating. The general, a
member of a minority ethnic group from the southwest, has adopted
the same ethnic strategy against Ouattara. A commission set up to
prepare the referendum recommended that a presidential candidate
must be Ivoirian-born of a father or mother born in the Ivory
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, just six days before the referendum, Guei
issued a decree saying that a presidential candidate must be
Ivoirian-born of a father and mother born in the Ivory Coast. In a
news conference, the general claimed that 15 of the country's 18
administrative regions had pressed him to change the ``or'' to
``and.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have expressed their wish,'' said the general, who
came to power after young soldiers mutinied throughout the Ivory
Coast in late December. ``We are here to respond to their wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the change was widely interpreted as another effort to
dislodge Ouattara. Another clause _ that a candidate should never
have availed himself of another nationality _ also seemed targeted
at Ouattara, who represented Burkina Faso for a regional financial
institution earlier in his career, a relatively common practice at
the time.

</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the December coup, Ouattara described it as a
``popular revolution.'' He said he had hoped that the new military
ruler would not try to cling to power, the way others have
typically done in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general was in retirement,'' Ouattara said. ``So we
thought he was really coming to help the process of restoring
democracy as he said he would. But obviously once in power he
wanted to confiscate and grab power. And this is quite a
disappointment for all of us who consider ourselves democrats.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that none of these clauses affected his eligibility,
Ouattara has told his followers to endorse the referendum, as have
the country's two other major parties. So while the outcome may not
be in doubt, it will yield hints as to how September's election
might unfold.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional court that will rule on the eligibility of
presidential candidates recently got a new head: one of Guei's
legal advisers. If Ouattara is prevented legally from running, it
is likely that the battle will spill onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'll get popular support,'' Ouattara said. ``But I
hope it will not get to that point. I hope that the international
community, the regional partners and domestic pressure will put
sense into the head of the general.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, in a news conference a day after meeting
Guei, the U.S. ambassador, George Mu, said Washington was worried
about Ivory Coast's stability. The ambassador restated the State
Department's position that Guei, having seized power by force,
should not stand as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Mu's comments came after two days of rioting by soldiers in
downtown Abidjan. Displeased that they had not received money they
claimed had been promised them, the soldiers shut down businesses
and the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Guei took refuge in the police headquarters and was able to
defuse the situation only after agreeing to give soldiers about
$1,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Guei accused Ouattara's party of fomenting the riots, a charge
he denied. The U.S. ambassador said they appeared to be strictly
over money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mutiny reduced the popularity of the general, who now
looks weakened,'' said a Western diplomat here.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was a reminder that even the general has never had
full control over the country's 14,000-member military since the
December coup. A military emboldened even further and ensuing
instability would make it harder to reverse the Ivory Coast's slide
and would turn it into a source of problems for the region, many
Ivoirians and foreigners here believe.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Second to Nigeria, the Ivory Coast is the economic leader in
West Africa. It stands as the world's largest cacao producer and at
the top of French-speaking Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But Abidjan, an African bright spot famous for its smooth roads
and solid infrastructure, is beginning to show the signs of being
led by a government that has little money left. Gaping potholes and
collapsed highway ramps have been left unrepaired for months.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he will run and win in September, Ouattara promised an
IMF-style cleanup of the Ivory Coast's economy that would include a
sweeping anti-corruption campaign and an overhaul of an inefficient
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Having left the IMF only a year ago, Ouattara said he was
pessimistic about Africa. He has seen too many African countries
ground down by men whose only concern was to capture or keep power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if you have a system where the people can vote you
out, the situation will be different,'' Ouattara said. ``But many
people that get in are rigging elections or doing it by coup
d'etat, because they are mediocre. They know they cannot stand
competition. They confiscate power and continue to rule the
country.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ John Danforth, the special counsel investigating the
1993 tear-gas assault by federal agents on the Branch Davidian
compound, Friday issued a sweeping report that cleared Attorney
General Janet Reno and the government of any wrongdoing in the
deadly episode.
</P>
<P>
   Reminding a crowded news conference of his initial pledge to
answer the ``dark questions'' surrounding the case, Danforth, a
former Republican senator from Missouri, did not mince words. He
declared that agents did not shoot at the Branch Davidians and did
not start the fire that destroyed the compound on April 19, 1993,
claiming the lives of about 80 people.
</P>
<P>
   He said the military was not used improperly and that the
government ``did not engage in a massive conspiracy and cover-up.''
Danforth placed blame and responsibility for the deaths on members
of the religious sect, particularly the group's leader, David
Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certain,'' he said, reading from a statement. ``And I
give you these conclusions with 100 percent certainty. ``The blame
rests squarely on the shoulders of David Koresh. ``This is not a
close call.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Danforth exonerated the government, he also rebuked it.
He spoke pointedly and passionately about how public confidence in
government had eroded because certain officials failed to speak
candidly about aspects of the case. His own appointment by Reno had
come in September after disclosures that agents of the FBI, despite
repeated denials, had fired pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters capable
of starting a fire into the compound on the day it burned.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Danforth said that Reno and other high-ranking
government officials had not known that agents fired such
projectiles. But he blamed ``a few government lawyers and an FBI
agent'' for concealing the use of the projectiles. They were
launched hours before the fire and did not contribute to it,
Danforth said.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that FBI agents fired three pyrotechnic
rounds at a construction pit about 75 yards from the living
quarters of the Davidians. The rounds did not cause any damage, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Danforth report comes one week after an advisory jury
hearing a federal wrongful death civil lawsuit ruled that the
government was not liable for the deaths of the Branch Davidians.
The jury's verdict is not binding and the ultimate decision will be
made by the judge hearing the case.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said he waited to publish his report in order not to
influence the jury's deliberations. He called his investigation
``95 percent complete,'' saying another 3 1/2 months will be needed
to determine whether ``further action'' is necessary against those
involved in covering up the use of the projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in a conference room at a downtown hotel, Danforth
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us should be more skeptical of those who make
sensational accusations of evil acts by government. At the same
time, government personnel, especially government lawyers, owe the
American people an openness and candor that was lacking in response
to the tragedy at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the government did nothing evil on April 19, 1993,
the failure of some of its employees to fully and openly disclose
to the American people the use of pyrotechnic devices undermined
public confidence in government and caused real damage to our
country.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder issued a
statement praising Danforth's findings. ``Today's independent
review sheds further light on the truth, and discredits many of the
unsubstantiated allegations that have skewed the public's
perception of the events of April 19, 1993,'' Holder said. ``We
join Senator Danforth in wishing that this report begins the
process of restoring the faith of people in their government.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder said he was concerned about the findings that government
lawyers had withheld the information about the pyrotechnic rounds
but ``heartened'' that those rounds had not caused the fire. He
also said the report underscored the attorney general's ``diligent
efforts to learn the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Freeh, the FBI director, said: ``The simple truth, as the
FBI has maintained since April 19, 1993, has been unmistakingly
confirmed again today. The FBI fired no shots on that day and the
Davidians started the fire that ultimately engulfed the compound.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caddell, the lead lawyer for the Branch Davidians in the
wrongful death lawsuit, expressed disappointment with Danforth's
findings and found particular fault with his conclusion that
federal agents had not fired weapons. Next month, Caddell and
government lawyers will litigate that issue as a separate, but
related, part of the wrongful death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said Danforth disregarded flaws in a special simulation
conducted in March to help discern if weapons were fired. The
simulation was intended to determine if flashes that appeared on an
aerial, infrared videotape filmed the day of the fire were caused
by gunfire. A British company hired by Danforth to conduct the
simulation determined that the flashes were caused by reflections
from water and metal, not gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell had initially sought the test, but he later argued that
the simulation was imprecise. He said overlooking the flaws, such
as the poor quality of the simulation tape and what he termed
mistakes by the British company in carrying out the simulation,
``is both irresponsible and a disservice to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Friday's news conference, Danforth emphasized that
the scope of his probe was limited to ``whether government agents
engaged in bad acts, not whether they exercised bad judgment.'' He
said his parameters were confined to certain specific questions:
Did federal agents start the fire? Did they shoot at the Davidians
on April 19? Did they use pyrotechnic devices? Was there any
illegal use of the military? Was there a cover-up?
</P>
<P>
   An ordained Episcopal minister, Danforth was chosen, in part,
because of his reputation in the Senate for integrity and
rectitude. In conducting his inquiry, he had 16 lawyers and 38
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidian episode began on Feb. 28, 1993, when a
gunfight broke out as Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents
attempted to serve a warrant on Koresh at the compound near Waco.
Four ATF agents were killed. The ensuing 51-day standoff ended on
April 19 when FBI agents sought to subdue the Branch Davidians by
firing tear gas into the compound with tanks. The wooden structure
erupted in flames and burned to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Government critics have claimed that federal agents, frustrated
and angry, were either partly, or completely, responsible for the
deaths of those inside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The remainder of the investigation will address the actions of
those who hid information about the use of pyrotechnic rounds,
which have disappeared from evidence collected at the scene. In the
report, Danforth criticizes government lawyers for making
misleading statements about the rounds during the discovery process
of the civil wrongful death lawsuit. He also criticized the FBI's
failure, until September 1999 to release an audiotape of Richard
Rogers, the head of the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, authorizing the
use of the explosive rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth said Reno and then-FBI Director William Sessions had
sought and received reassurances from field agents that pyrotechnic
rounds had not been used on April 19. Both testified to this before
Congress in 1993. The report stated that Rogers sat behind them
silently and his failure to correct their statements was `a
significant omission that contributed to the public perception of a
cover-up, which permitted a false impression to persist for several
years.`
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he was not paying attention to their comments during
the testimony. Danforth said the remainder of his investigation
would address questions surrounding why government lawyers and FBI
officials hid the existence of the pyrotechnic rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's office will not pursue any further investigation of
Rogers or any other members of the hostage rescue team, the report
said.

CHAPLIN IN HIS ELEMENT AS OLYMPIC TRACK COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Those who know him figure it's the role of
a lifetime. He begs to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing God,'' John Chaplin insisted, deadpan. ``I'm
not smart enough _ even though a lot of you don't believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Chaplin, the irrepressible track coach at Washington State
University from 1973 to 1994, is quite far from divinity, he is in
fact something of a track god these days _ head coach for the U.S.
men's team being assembled this weekend at the trials at Cal-State
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 62, his acerbic, contentious style has lost none of its
bite. His appointment to lead the world's most formidable track
team has only enhanced his legendary sense of righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   To many, including injured decathlete Dan O'Brien, that's just
about a perfect resume for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely deserving,'' O'Brien said Friday while
spectating at Hornet Stadium. The Idaho resident's years of
training in the Palouse made him a confidant, and fan, of the
ex-Cougars coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could have gotten a better guy,'' he said.
``The biggest thing is he's not afraid to make a decision some
people won't like, and not lose a bit of sleep over it. And he's a
good decision-maker too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin showed he was up for the media-swordfight part of the
job this week when he was bombarded with questions about relay-team
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Yanks are always strongest when the track distance is
shortest, the relays are where the world expects the U.S. to
dominate.
</P>
<P>
   So when America in 1996 lost the 4x100 gold to Canada, well, the
shame was enough to inspire thoughts of barricading the northern
border. The U.S. coach, Erv Hunt, will live in infamy as the man
who failed to put Carl Lewis in the relay.
</P>
<P>
   The relay-selection process, especially for the shorter race, is
legendary for its politics, controversies and second-guessing. As a
veteran of more than 30 years in national and international track,
Chaplin succinctly summarized the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' he said. ``Win the relay, or I'm dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Prompting his denial of divinity was a series of questions
seeking his plan for selecting from a stable of great sprinters.
Growing a little exasperated, Chaplin denied any brilliance, as
well as any plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look guys, we take the six fastest, and any two others off the
rest of the team,'' Chaplin said. ``We'll sit down after the meet
and agree on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to who will run the relay in Sydney, we may not know until
the day before the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Chaplin said that University of Washington
sprinter/footballer Ja'Warren Hooker was still in the running for a
berth in the 4x400 pool. Although the Ellensburg native finished
seventh in the 400 finals Sunday, the top seven were asked to sign
up for pool eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ja'Warren looked very good,'' Chaplin said. ``He's got great
skills from 60 to 400 meters. We know that. We also know we have a
very good 4x4 team. But we wouldn't have signed him up if we're not
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooker still has heats to run today in the 200. If he makes the
field of eight for Sunday's finals, featuring Michael Johnson
against Maurice Greene, he might be eligible for the 4x100 pool as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The relay pools are necessary at the Olympics because the top
sprinters often skip preliminary rounds to concentrate on
individual races.
</P>
<P>
   The prickly, occasionally subjective selection process demands a
thick skin. When it comes to such matters, Chaplin has a rhino
hide.
</P>
<P>
   His unblinking steadfastness was evident the last time America
laid eyes on him. At the '96 Games in Atlanta, Chaplin was meet
referee when defending 100-meter champion Linford Christie of Great
Britain was disqualified for two false starts.
</P>
<P>
   Furious, Christie refused to leave the track, folding his arms
defiantly. It was Chaplin, virtually alone, who confronted Christie
and convinced him to move into the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have crossed Chaplin and his considerable ego may have
a different view, but others will say he has what's required for
the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a long history with the man,'' said John Smith, the
1972 Olympic 400 champ who now coaches several sprinters and
hurdlers at the trials. ``He tried recruiting me to WSU. But I
thought UCLA was a little better than Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a wealth of wisdom and experience that will be
instrumental in problem solving. He's experienced in all levels in
the sport _ coaching, officiating as well as administrative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some folks in Pullman might take issue with the latter, since
the Cougars spent the last two years of his tenure on Pac-10
probation. Chaplin and his baseball counterpart, Bobo Brayton, were
busted for failing to calculate tuition waivers into their sports'
annual budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver, which cost WSU its 1985 and 1991 Pac-10 track
titles, was part of Chaplin's attempts to spread his 12 track
scholarships among as many as 25 athletes.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be forever fighting the limited resources WSU and
the NCAA gave to track. He railed loud and long about the poverty,
particularly since he had high-end tastes. He was among the first,
and perhaps the best, at importing foreign athletes, particularly
Kenyan distance runners _ ``The Long Crimson Line,'' as it was
known.
</P>
<P>
   His aggressive international recruiting earned WSU three
second-place finishes in the NCAA national meets, plus an indoor
championship in 1977. His candor and loquaciousness also served him
well in the Cougars' athletic heyday of the 1970s and 1980s when
George Raveling was basketball coach and Jim Walden was football
coach.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been hard to get kids to Pullman, but it wasn't hard
to pull a good quote out of there.
</P>
<P>
   His provocative tactics regularly drew the ire of rivals. Track
fans still talk of the time in 1978 in Eugene, Ore., when Cougars
distance star Henry Rono was on his way to a world record in a
prelim heat only to be ordered by Chaplin to slow down so the
record wouldn't be broken on the ground of the hated Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   But the most memorable facet of Chaplin for O'Brien was the
treatment of his charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``What comes through the most is he takes care of his
athletes,'' O'Brien said ``It's so impressive the way he treats his
people, especially the athletes he recruited from other countries.
Whether it was personal or academic problems, he was there for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he gets criticized for favoring his stars, but he's
been very successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's in charge of a nation's entire team of track stars.
Inevitably, there will be some who won't like it. Chaplin will be
the last to care.
</P>
<P>
   He has a relay to win.

KARROS COMES TO THE RESCUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers have remained in
contention largely because of Gary Sheffield's remarkable season at
the plate, but there are times when even he doesn't come through.
</P>
<P>
   That's what made Friday so sweet for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   In a spot primed for Sheffield's heroics, he popped out in the
eighth inning. Then Eric Karros provided the hit everyone figured
Sheffield a lock to get.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' three-run homer lifted the Dodgers to a 6-5 win against
the second-place San Francisco Giants in front of a season-high
53,563 at Dodger Stadium in the first of a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek led off against Giants starter Shawn Estes
with a walk and Shawn Green singled. Felix Rodriguez relieved and
got Sheffield to pop out just in front of home plate.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez (3-1) fell behind Karros 3-0, and Karros
eventually hit a 3-1 pitch into the left-field bleachers to give
the Dodgers the one-run advantage. It was Karros' 26th homer of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges allowed a run in one inning of relief but got the
win to improve to 7-0. Jeff Shaw, the former closer who had blown
seven of 20 save chances, recorded his 14th save with a scoreless
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Carlos Perez was spectacular for five shutout
innings, allowing four hits. He threw just 46 pitches, nine of
which were balls. But the sixth inning was a different story that
had a pair of sub-plots.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Giants figured out Perez. Calvin Murray started it
off with a bunt single and he went to third on Russ Davis' single
to right. Barry Bonds hit a sacrifice fly to left and Jeff Kent hit
a liner to the gap in right-center field. Shawn Green caught up to
it on the warning track for a tough running catch.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, that's where the Dodgers' fortunes turned. Green spun
quickly and fired the ball into second base, but had he realized
Davis was already at second base and instead threw to first, it
would have been an easy double play.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the inning continued. Ellis Burks singled to left, Rich
Aurilia singled in a run with a ground-rule double to left and J.T.
Snow hit a flare to short left field to score a pair of runs and
give the Giants a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Perez allowed four runs on nine hits in seven innings. His
control remained sharp as he didn't walk and batter for the third
time in four starts and struck out two.
</P>
<P>
   The second part was how the Dodgers typically frittered away a
great chance to tie it in the bottom of the sixth against lefty
Shawn Estes.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield led off with his second double. But Karros failed to
move him to third, instead striking out. Adrian Beltre, who's 4 for
his last 29 with runners in scoring position, and Todd
Hollandsworth each grounded out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds hit his 32nd homer of the season off Herges in the
eighth inning to increase the Giants' lead to 5-3. Bonds trails
Sheffield in the National League home runs race by one.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers went ahead 3-0 in the second inning, and it was
Sheffield starting the rally. He doubled to left-center to extend
his hitting streak to 12 games, one shy of his season high. Karros
and Beltre walked to load the bases and Hollandsworth delivered a
sacrifice fly to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Elster struck out, but Perez helped himself with a triple
down the left field line to score Karros and Beltre. It was the
second triple of Perez's career. &QL;

WADE A WINNER, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Larry Wade didn't rise to No. 3 in the world in the
110-meter high hurdles last year by running around any obstacles.
Wade can't afford to be afraid of hurdles in his path; he makes his
living facing 10 of them head-on.
</P>
<P>
   The resident of Canoga Park, a Los Angeles neighborhood, has
surmounted incredible odds to compete today at the U.S. Olympic
Track and Field Trials. On the penultimate weekend in April, Wade
was involved in a car accident so physically and emotionally
jarring, he continues to drive miles out of his way to avoid the
intersection of Nordhoff and De Soto.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hurdles he has cleared in his career, you see, Wade
can't bring himself to negotiate the crossroads where he suffered
injuries that nearly killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Wade, 25, was returning from a Sunday workout at the UCLA track
when a woman pulled out in front of the native Texan's late-model
convertible. Three months later, the skid marks from the accident
are still there, Wade said. So obviously, are the tracks on his
psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he approaches the intersection, ``I drive extra slow
and my heart beats extra fast,'' Wade said. ``There's a bank right
there. It's just a couple blocks from my house, but if I need money
I'll drive blocks out of my way, to another branch. I still get a
little nervous when I get in that area. I don't know how long that
will last.''
</P>
<P>
   The violent merging of metal left Wade's car looking like a
crushed aluminum can. Wade walked away with no more, he thought,
than a concussion and a head laceration that required 15 staples to
close.
</P>
<P>
   For a week-and-a-half after the accident, Wade felt fine. Then
he started experiencing fevers, headaches and cold sweats. He was
in and out of the hospital ``four or five times,'' Wade said. His
doctors treated him for post-concussion syndrome and then a
bacterial infection and all the while Wade was feeling worse and
worse.
</P>
<P>
   His girlfriend, sprinter Inger Miller, could tell that he wasn't
feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inger and I had conversations,'' Wade said. ``She kept telling
me I had to be tough. I took it totally out of context. I thought
she meant I was supposed to ignore how bad I was feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Wade kept saying he was okay when he clearly was not.
Finally, on May 17, Miller rushed Wade to the hospital emergency
room against his wishes. Doctors discovered his heart was swollen
to twice its normal size because it was absorbing fluids like a
sponge.
</P>
<P>
   They performed emergency surgery, draining a half-liter of fluid
from Wade's heart. When Wade regained consciousness, he had all
kinds of tubes sticking out of him and a six-inch incision on his
chest. His doctors said the internal bleeding was caused by his
automobile's air bag, which inflated at impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors said if I had stayed at home, I would have
suffocated,'' Wade said. ``Inger saved my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As May gave way to June, his doctors were pessimistic about the
possibility of Wade resuming his hurdling career. Certainly not
this year, they told him. They instructed him that it was a miracle
he didn't need open-heart surgery, which promptly earned Wade the
nickname ``Miracle Child'' among his Hudson-Smith International
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after the three-hour surgery, Wade returned to
the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to teach my body to walk all over again,'' said Wade,
who walked 400 meters in five minutes that first day before
becoming too winded to continue. In those first few weeks back,
Miller and HSI sprinters Ato Boldon and Jon Drummond pumped Wade up
as best they could.
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Smith is not one to pamper his athletes and Wade was
no exception. Within two weeks, Smith had Wade doing hurdling
drills. Wade struggled mightily, but everybody persisted in telling
him how great he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, that is, except Maurice Greene, the world's fastest
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back from meets in Europe and said, `You look like
trash,' '' Wade said, smiling. ``Maurice is my best friend. I
appreciated his honesty. I needed to hear that from him. From that
time on, I got back to running faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week what kind of shape he was in, Wade was vague.
``I'm in whatever shape it takes to be in the top three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he said his preliminary heat today _ Wade's first
race since September _ will mark the first time in months that he
has negotiated more than eight consecutive hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot better than I did last week,'' Wade said. ``It's
like I've had an extra week to cram for an exam.''
</P>
<P>
   That would seem small consolation to someone who, in a split
second on a sunny Sunday afternoon, went from a favorite to make
the 2000 Olympic team to a decided darkhorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all fall,'' Wade said, waxing philosophical. ``We get right
back up and go again. I'm so grateful and thankful to be here. No
way can I sit here and feel bummed at what has been dealt me.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how Wade fares this weekend, he already has won. In a
split second on a sunny Sunday afternoon, Wade nearly lost his life
but gained a wonderful perspective. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-LIBEL-LAW (Undated) _ In the United States, with its
ironclad belief in the right to free speech, libel plaintiffs need
to prove not only that the speech in question is false, but also
that it was published with a reckless disregard for the truth. In
England, the burden is in exactly the other direction: the
offending speech is presumed to be false, and it is up to
defendants to prove that it is in fact true. That tends to have a
dampening effect on what newspapers print and what publishers
include in books, especially when the material is likely to offend
someone who is powerful, rich or particularly litigious. By Sarah
Lyall.

</P>
<P>
   EPA-GRACE-ASBESTOS (Undated) _ The EPA is investigating why it
ignored evidence for 18 years that W.R. Grace and Co. produced ore
for its consumer products that was laden with asbestos. An agency
study in 1982 found alarming levels in material that Grace said was
virtually free of asbestos, but the agency shelved the report,
scuttled its planned follow-up studies and continued to accept the
company's lower figures, EPA officials say. Grace officials on
Friday did not dispute the EPA report, but said their own studies
have consistently shown much smaller amounts of asbestos. At issue
now is how much asbestos _ in a form known as tremolite _ made its
way into those products as a contaminant. By Michael Moss and
Adrianne Appel.

   NY-AIRPORT-DENTIST (New York) _ Dr. Robert M. Trager is the man

entry to the United States. By Chris Hedges. 1,500 words.

   SEX-SURVEYS (Undated) _ Sex surveyors are bedeviled scientists.
People lie about sex. Those who don't lie often say inaccurate
things. And most sex researchers aren't exactly neutral. Sex
surveys give ``a hardened imitation of reality,'' says John H.
Gagnon, an emeritus professor of sociology at SUNY Stonybrook. We

   BUSH-BIO-IV (Houston) _ George W. Bush left Yale University in
the spring of 1968 with a diploma in hand, but no plans on what to
do with it. So for five years, not unlike many young men his age,
he drifted. He lived in three states, had at least seven apartments

promote its fall lineup by leaving taped messages on viewers' home

known for aggressively seeking unusual new ways to promote its
programming, outlined the plan this week to reporters at an annual
fall-season briefing in Pasadena, Calif. By Stuart Elliott.

   AETNA-HMO (Undated) _ Call it bad luck, bad timing, bad judgment
or all of the above: Aetna, an old-line insurance company,
transformed itself into a hard-charging tightly managed health care
company four years ago, just in time to become a main target of a
backlash against managed care, especially the kind Aetna was

   VOICESTREAM-DEUTSCHE (Hong Kong) _ For years, Li Ka-shing has
foraged in the darker corners of the telecommunications industry: a
paging service in Australia, an upstart mobile-phone operation in

   NEW YORK _ After a three-hour meeting at the league office in
Midtown Manhattan late Friday, the MetroStars and Major League
Soccer reached an agreement with Lothar Matthaeus that will keep
the German star with the MetroStars. The agreement came after two
tumultuous weeks following a back injury to the defender.

   Nick Sakiewicz, general manager of the MetroStars, said
Matthaeus would join the team for practice Wednesday and it would
be some time before he could start playing. The MetroStars play

PETTITTE GOES TO BOY'S AID IN STANDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte sprinted from right field just as
Yankees batting practice was ending. He saw that the fans in the
stands were more interested in screaming for autographs than in
attending to the fallen child around them.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte saw the ball fly out of a batting cage and strike
12-year-old Rashad Harris in the left eye. Pettitte ran to the
seats behind the tarpaulin in right field and scooped the boy _ a
regular at batting practice who was without parents or guardians
Friday _ and flopped him onto his back.
</P>
<P>
   With a trail of concerned teammates behind him, Pettitte rushed
Rashad into the Yankees' clubhouse. Ten minutes later, the boy was
wheeled out of the Yankees' training room on a stretcher. He was
conscious, having responded to the questions of team doctors, but
he had a swollen eye and was taken to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center.

RECORD RUN HAS JACOBS THINKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 c.2000 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ At age 36, Regina Jacobs has hit her stride.
</P>
<P>
   The queen of American distance runners ripped off a blistering
final 1,000 meters to smash her own national record in the women's
5,000 meters at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials at
Sacramento State on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs clocked 14 minutes, 45.35 seconds, well ahead of her
two-year-old record of 14:52.49, as well as runner-up Deena
Drossin, who ran 15:11.55.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs last week won the 1,500 meters here and is expected to
concentrate on the metric mile at the Sydney Olympics two months
hence. But after running the fastest time in the world this year in
the 5,000, she might be tempted to attempt a double _ or shift to
the 5K entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say this (the 5,000) is my event and why am I
not doing this,'' Jacobs said. ``But I have a lot of unfinished
business in the 1,500.''
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, American-record holder Bob Kennedy couldn't
duplicate Jacobs' act, finishing a distant sixth behind Adam
Goucher in the men's 5,000. Last week, Kennedy passed on the men's
10,000 last weekend citing nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pappas, 23, was the surprise winner of the decathlon with
8,467 points, passing pre-meet favorite Chris Huffins on the final
event, the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Kip Janvrin, 35, earned an Olympics berth in his 70th
decathlon, running a gutsy 1,500 to finish third with 8,057 points
_ just ahead of the Olympic standard of 8,050.
</P>
<P>
   Connie-Price Smith did what she always does in the women's shot,
winning her 22nd national title with an effort of 61 feet, 1
inches. Jesseca Cross was second.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA alumna Dawn Dumble was third in the women's shot, but in a
replay of 1996 doesn't have an Olympics berth because she has not
achieved the international qualifying standard of 60-0. She went
57-1 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dumble could still go to Sydney if she gets a qualifying mark by
Sept. 11. In 1996, a special, one-event ``meet'' was held at UCLA
to attempt to get her to the qualifying standard, but she fell
short.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Deal, silver-medalist at the 1996 Olympics, dominated
hammer-throw competition, winning his eighth national championship
with an effort of 258 feet, 9 inches. Kevin McMahon was second.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal for Sydney is very simple,'' Deal said. ``To throw a
personal record in the final.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint Wars resume today, the penultimate day of
competition, with the first round of the men's and women's
200-meter run. Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene appear headed for
a Sunday collision on the men's side, and Marion Jones will attempt
to hold off Inger Miller again on thewomen's.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary competition Friday:
</P>
<P>
   __ World-record holder Stacy Dragila had no trouble moving out
of the women's pole vault prelims, clearing the opening height of
13-2 on her first try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt fast and light and quick,'' Dragila said. ``If I go in
Sunday feeling like I did today, I think you're gonna see another
world record.''
</P>
<P>
   __ UCLA's Jess Stretzel led all qualifiers in the men's 800, at
1:46.37.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make a name for myself,'' Stretzel said. ``The
more TV time I get, the better. I plan to go into acting and
directing.''
</P>
<P>
   The first semifinal finished in a five-man blanket finish, with
.09 seconds separating first from fifth. Khadevis Robinson won at
1:48.01, and Bryan Woodward of Long Beach was second in 1:48.06.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Clark family moved into the final of the women's 800-
meter run.
</P>
<P>
   American-record holder Jearl Miles- Clark won her semifinal heat
in 2:02.80, and sister-in-law Joetta Clark-Diggs was third. Hazel
Clark, Joetta's sister, won the first semi. Miles-Clark is coached
by (and married to) J.J. Clark, Hazel's and Joet &QL; 
- ta's brother.
</P>
<P>
   __ Defending Olympic gold-medalist Derrick Adkins went out in
the semifinals of the men's 400 hurdles. Adkins, a theology
student, declared his retirement from the sport. Angelo Taylor had
the top time, 48.59 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   __ LaMark Carter led the men's triple jump prelims with a modest
effort of 54-10. Walter Davis, already on the Olympic team as a
long-jumper, qualified second for the final at 54-9.
</P>
<P>
   __ Five-time national champion Charles Austin was among 12
high-jumpers who cleared the prelim mark of 7-2, as was former
playground basketball legend Matt Hemingway, who returned to the
sport after he was spotting dunking from the free-throw line.

ANGELS ON THE MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Oakland A's pitcher Tim Hudson has so much potential,
the Anaheim Angels reportedly asked for him in exchange for Jim
Edmonds during the winter meetings last December _ and the A's said
no.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Hudson has shown this season why he is so highly
thought of, taking a 10-2 record, including a nine-game winning
streak, into Friday night's game against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, however, gave Hudson a beating unlike any he's
experienced in the majors, defeating A's, 12-3, before 13,236 at
the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The victory propelled the Angels past the A's into second place
in the A.L. West for the first time since May 30. It also put the
Angels, who are four games behind first-place Seattle, in the lead
for the wild-card spot. Overall, the Angels have won 10 of their
past 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (10-3) had not lost since April 20 in Cleveland, going
9-0 with a 3.56 ERA in his next 14 starts. Including last season he
was 21-4 in his career, one of only five pitchers in major league
history to win 21 of their first 25 decisions, joining King Cole,
Whitey Ford, Vida Blue and Juan Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels hammered him for nine runs and 12 hits, including
four by Orlando Palmeiro, three by Tim Salmon and home runs by Matt
Walbeck (5), Garret Anderson (28) and Mo Vaughn (25). Vaughn's
homer with one out in the sixth spelled the end for Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn also had a two-run double later in the game for five RBI,
increasing his team-leading total to 76. The Angels had 16 hits in
all.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he needed it, but Angels starter Jarrod Washburn was
the beneficiary of all the offense. Washburn (6-2) gave up one run
and three hits in six innings, continuing an impressive trend by
the young Angels starters.
</P>
<P>
   In their past 12 starts, Washburn, Brian Cooper and Seth
Etherton are 9-1 with a 3.62 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels put pressure on Hudson in the early innings. They had
two hits and a walk in the first inning but couldn't score. In the
second they got two more hits, including a solo homer by Walbeck
for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the third they finally got the big hit, Anderson's line-drive
homer over the right-field fence that followed singles by Palmeiro
and Salmon. It gave the Angels a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washburn gave up a single in the first inning and a
walk in the second before finding trouble in the third. With two
outs, Randy Velarde walked and Jason Giambi and Olmedo Saenz each
walked to load the bases for Ben Grieve.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn escaped when Grieve flied out to left.
</P>
<P>
   The A's broke through agaisnt Washburn in the fourth when Matt
Stairs hit a high fastball into the seats in right to cut the
Angels' lead to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels broke the game open in the fifth with two more runs.
Anderson and Adam Kennedy each had an RBI single to give the Angels
a 6-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the sixth, the Angels knocked Hudson out of the game on
Vaughn's three-run homer taking a 9-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels continued their onslaught against the A's bullpen
getting three more runs in the eighth, two on a double by Vaughn
and another on a double by Salmon.

M'S RAIN RUNS ON RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Welcome home.
</P>
<P>
   After playing 15 of their previous 18 games on the road, the
Mariners returned to Seattle Friday night for their longest
homestand of the season and settled right in. Padding their major
league-best home record, Seattle scored seven runs in the first
inning en route to a 12-3 rout over the Rangers in front of a
packed house at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everything clicked for the Mariners. Starter Paul
Abbott pitched seven strong innings. Shortstop Carlos Guillen,
still subbing for injured Alex Rodriguez, had a career-high four
hits, including two singles in one inning. Mark McLemore and Jay
Buhner homered. And center fielder Mike Cameron brought the 44,765
fans to their feet with a fence-crashing catch in the eighth
inning, going all out even with a 10-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, the roof still works, too, much to the dismay of
the fans who booed loudly when it slowly slid closed during a brief
thunderstorm. Which was about the only thing they jeered when the
Mariners played at home for just the fourth time since June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the longest stretch of road games since I've been
part of the team,'' Abbott said. ``It seemed like we were here for
just a blink of an eye when we played the Dodgers (two weekends
ago).
</P>
<P>
   ``The fan support is tremendous here. You feel extremely
comfortable _ it's like sleeping in your own bed. That's the
feeling you get when you walk in here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are 31-13 at home, with their next 12 games here in
an important stretch. After Texas, Seattle plays Oakland, Toronto
and Boston, all with winning records, all with post-season chances.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle and Texas have ruled the AL West since the league
divided into three divisions but things are looking bleak for the
Rangers this year. The Rangers were tied for first place as
recently as June 5 but the loss knocked Texas 10{ games back.
That's the sort of grave from which only slasher-movie villains
climb, especially when your pitching is struggling as much as the
Texas staff is.
</P>
<P>
   Texas entered the game with a 5.14 ERA and starter Matt Perisho
raised it with a terrible performance. He allowed seven runs and
didn't get out of the first inning, walking three consecutive
batters to end his brief night. The first inning lasted 44 minutes
and when it ended Seattle led 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   While Texas struggles, the Mariners continue to show they can
overcome most anything thrown their way. Jamie Moyer and Freddy
Garcia go on the disabled list the same weekend? No problem.
Rodriguez gets hurt? Big deal. The Mariners are 7-4 since losing
Rodriguez, who could return to the lineup soon.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen got off to a terrible start this season as Seattle's
third baseman but he's finally coming around while subbing for
Rodriguez at shortstop the past 11 games. He had a career high
three hits Tuesday, two hits Thursday and a career-high four hits
Friday night, raising his batting average above the Mendoza Line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's swinging the bat well,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
``He's helping us a lot. It won't be any dilemma (when Alex comes
back). I'll be able to rotate my club a lot and keep everyone nice
and rested. Getting Alex back will allow us to play some different
combinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle scored another five runs in the third when McLemore hit
a two-run homer and Buhner hit a three-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the run support, Abbott didn't need to pitch
particularly well but he did so anyway, giving the Mariners another
of his strong performances since joining the rotation in May. He is
6-3 with a 3.67 ERA since then and has held opponents to three runs
or less in 12 of his 14 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's steady and relaxed,'' Piniella said. ``He goes out and
gives you a professional effort. He's been a savior for us in a lot
of ways. When we had some injuries, he stepped into the void and
solved some problems.''

JACOBS WINS SECOND EVENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SACRAMENTO _ Regina Jacobs, four-time Olympian, queen of
American distance running _ and confirmed palm-reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never remember what the times are supposed to be on each
lap, so my husband Tom had me write a number on my hand,'' Jacobs
said Friday night. ``He told me, `If you're close to this number
with two laps left, then you go!' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   The number was 12 minutes, 35 seconds, and when Jacobs checked
her palm she was some 20 seconds ahead. She went on to shatter her
own American record in the 5,000-meter run with a clocking of
14:45.35 at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials at Sacramento
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty awesome,'' Jacobs said with a smile, after eclipsing
her two-year-old mark of 14:52.49.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who at 36 seems to be getting better with age, won the
1,500 here five days earlier. She said Friday she will concentrate
on the metric mile at the Sydney Olympics two months hence. But she
left open the possibility she might reconsider, however, given that
her 5,000 time is the best in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got some unfinished busines in the 1,500,'' Jacobs said.
``I want to medal and I want to get under Mary Decker Slaney's
American record'' of 3:58.92. Jacobs ran 4:01.01 in winning the
1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs credited runner-up Deena Drossin, the 10,000 champ here,
for setting a fast early pace. And she credited Drossin's fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were chanting 'Deena, Deena' and I told myself they were
saying 'Regina, Regina,' &UR;  &LR; '' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, American-record holder Bob Kennedy couldn't
duplicate Jacobs' act, finishing a distant sixth behind Adam
Goucher in the men's 5,000. Last week, Kennedy passed on the men's
10,000, citing nagging injuries from an automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pappas, 23, was the surprise winner of the decathlon with
8,467 points, passing pre-meet favorite Chris Huffins on the final
event, the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Kip Janvrin, 35, earned an Olympics berth in his 70th
decathlon, running a gutsy 1,500 to finish third with 8,057 points
_ just ahead of the Olympic standard of 8,050.
</P>
<P>
   Connie-Price Smith did what she always does in the women's shot,
winning her 22nd national title with an effort of 61 feet, 1
inches. Jesseca Cross was second.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA alumna Dawn Dumble was third in the women's shot but in a
replay of 1996 doesn't have an Olympics berth because she has not
achieved the international qualifying standard of 60-0. She went
57-1 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dumble could go to Sydney if she gets a qualifying mark by Sept.
11. In 1996, a special, one-event ``meet'' was held at UCLA to
attempt to get her to the qualifying standard, but she fell short.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Deal, silver-medalist at the 1996 Olympics, dominated
hammer-throw competition, winning his eighth national championship
with an effort of 258 feet, 9 inches. Kevin McMahon was second.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint Wars resume today, the penultimate day of
competition, with the first round of the men's and women's
200-meter run. Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene appear headed for
a Sunday collision on the men's side, and Marion Jones will attempt
to hold off Inger Miller again on the women's.
</P>
<P>
   In preliminary competition Friday:
</P>
<P>
   __ &UR;  &LR; World-record holder Stacy Dragila had no trouble moving out
of the women's pole vault prelims, clearing the opening height of
13-2 on her first try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt fast and light and quick,'' Dragila said. ``If I go in
Sunday feeling like I did today, I think you're gonna see another
world record.''
</P>
<P>
   __ &UR;  &LR; UCLA's Jess Stretzel led all qualifiers in the men's 800, at
1:46.37.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make a name for myself,'' Stretzel said. ``The
more TV time I get, the better. I plan to go into acting and
directing.''
</P>
<P>
   The first semifinal finished in a five-man blanket finish, with
.09 seconds separating first from fifth. Khadevis Robinson won at
1:48.01, and Bryan Woodward of Long Beach was second in 1:48.06.
</P>
<P>
   __ &UR;  &LR; The Clark family moved into the final of the women's
800-meter run.
</P>
<P>
   American-record holder Jearl Miles-Clark won her semifinal heat
in 2:02.80, and sister-in-law Joetta Clark-Diggs was third. Hazel
Clark, Joetta's sister, won the first semi.
</P>
<P>
   Miles-Clark is coached by (and married to) J.J. Clark, Hazel's
and Joetta's brother.
</P>
<P>
   __ &UR;  &LR; Defending Olympic gold medalist Derrick Adkins went out in
the semifinals of the men's 400 hurdles. Adkins, a theology
student, declared his retirement from the sport. Angelo Taylor had
the top time, 48.59 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   __ &UR;  &LR; LaMark Carter led the men's triple jump prelims with a
modest effort of 54-10. Walter Davis, already on the Olympic team
as a long jumper, qualified second for the final at 54-9.
</P>
<P>
   __ &UR;  &LR; Five-time national champion Charles Austin was among 12 high
jumpers who cleared the prelim mark of 7-2, as was former
playground basketball legend Matt Hemingway, who returned to the
sport after he was spotting dunking from the free-throw line.

ANGELS ON THE MOVE
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Oakland A's pitcher Tim Hudson has so much potential,
the Anaheim Angels reportedly asked for him in exchange for Jim
Edmonds during the winter meetings last December _ and the A's said
no.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Hudson has shown this season why he is so highly
thought of, taking a 10-2 record, including a nine-game winning
streak, into Friday night's game against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, however, gave Hudson a beating unlike any he's
experienced in the majors, and topped the A's in the process, 12-3,
before 13,236 at the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The victory propelled the Angels past the A's and into sole
possession of second place in the AL West for the first time since
May 30. It also put the Angels, who are four games behind first-
place Seattle, in the lead for the American League wild-card spot.
Overall, the Angels have won 10 of their past 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not excited about second place,'' said Angels first
baseman Mo Vaughn, who bounced back from a beaning Thursday to go 2
for 4 with a homer and five RBI Friday. ``We're out every day doing
what we've got to do do get to first place. . . We did the things
we needed to do tonight. When you've got a team that thinks that
way, you've got a mentally tough ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if those guys look at the standings,'' Angels
manager Mike Scioscia said of his team, which improved to nine
games over .500 (53-44) for the first time since the 1998 season.
``Because it's not going to have an effect on what we do tomorrow.
We have to come out tomorrow and play another strong game.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense flexed its muscle against Hudson, who beat the
Angels July 2 in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (10-3) had not lost since April 20 in Cleveland, going
9-0 with a 3.56 ERA in his next 14 starts. Including last season he
was 21-4 in his career, one of only five pitchers in major-league
history to win 21 of their first 25 decisions, joining King Cole,
Whitey Ford, Vida Blue and Juan Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels hammered him for nine runs and 12 hits, including
four by Orlando Palmeiro, three by Tim Salmon and home runs by Matt
Walbeck (No. 5), Garret Anderson (No. 28 and 100th of his career)
and Vaughn (No. 25). Vaughn's homer with one out in the sixth
spelled the end for Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had 16 hits in all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't make many mistakes,'' Scioscia said of Hudson. ``But
when he did, our guys jumped on him. We had a disciplined approach.
They were able to lay off the split-finger and make him put it in
the zone. When he came with the fastball the guys didn't miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he needed it, but Angels starter Jarrod Washburn was
the beneficiary of all the offense. Washburn (6-2) gave up one run
and three hits in six innings, continuing an impressive trend by
the young Angels starters.
</P>
<P>
   In their past 12 starts combined, Washburn, Brian Cooper and
Seth Etherton are 9-1 with a 3.62 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the number of talented arms we had, this is what we
envisioned,'' Scioscia said. ``It's not about what they're doing
right. This is what we expected and they're delivering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're doing anything different, we're just
pitching well,'' said Washburn, whose six wins are tied for the
team lead. ``I think everyone is just stepping up right now and
doing the job. It's fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone suggested to Scioscia that the Angels are playing so
well they're making it look easy, but Scioscia didn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at it as being easy,'' he said. ``I look at it as
the pieces of the puzzle being solidly in place. It's not always
going to go smoothly, but in this stretch of the second half,
obviously the piece of the puzzle most in place is the starting
pitching. From the All-Star break to now, they've been
tremendous.''

<P>
   Time was when a professional athlete who wanted a second career
would become a sports commentator, an actor or a restaurateur. Not
anymore. Today, the path off the playing field is leading
increasingly into the recording studio. Shaquille O'Neal of the Los
Angeles Lakers, his teammate Kobe Bryant and Ricky Watters of the
Seattle Seahawks have all recently made rap albums.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most extreme example of this crossover is the former
sumo wrestler Konishiki, whose debut rap/reggae/R &AMP; B compact disk,
``Konishiki KMS'' _ short for ``Konishiki Master Sumo'' _ has just
been released by 125th Street Records. Born as Salevaa Atisanoe in
Hawaii to Samoan parents, Konishiki (pronounced co-NEESH-kee and
meaning Delicate Embroidery) retired from the ring in 1998 after a
16-year career in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his new CD, he says, ``There are aspects of sumo
like the concept of `makenai-desu' _ an attitude of, `I will not
lose' _ which I've used in the ring.'' Indeed, the influence of
sumo, which in its modern form dates to the 17th century, permeates
the album in, well, unusual ways.

   Time was when a professional athlete who wanted a second career
would become a sports commentator, an actor or a restaurateur. Not
anymore. Today, the path off the playing field is leading
increasingly into the recording studio. Shaquille O'Neal of the Los
Angeles Lakers, his teammate Kobe Bryant and Ricky Watters of the
Seattle Seahawks have all recently made rap albums.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most extreme example of this crossover is the former
sumo wrestler Konishiki, whose debut rap/reggae/R &AMP; B compact disk,
``Konishiki KMS'' _ short for ``Konishiki Master Sumo'' _ has just
been released by 125th Street Records. Born as Salevaa Atisanoe in
Hawaii to Samoan parents, Konishiki (pronounced co-NEESH-kee and
meaning Delicate Embroidery) retired from the ring in 1998 after a
16-year career in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his new CD, he says, ``There are aspects of sumo
like the concept of `makenai-desu' _ an attitude of, `I will not
lose' _ which I've used in the ring.'' Indeed, the influence of
sumo, which in its modern form dates to the 17th century, permeates
the album in, well, unusual ways.

IRANIAN DRESS CODE: A BURST OF COLOR IS NOW ISLAMIC

   Since the beginning of Iran's revolution, by far the most
relentless struggle over the social restrictions of the Islamic
Republic has concerned what women wear. Now, because of a slight
easing of the rules last week, prepubescent schoolgirls will be
allowed to wear colors to school.
</P>
<P>
   Under new guidelines issued by the Ministry of Education,
schoolgirls through fifth grade will be allowed to wear ``gay,
light colors,'' including light blue, beige, pink, light green and
yellow. Until now, only black, brown and navy blue were allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of light colors helps to create a cheerful
atmosphere'' and to ``safeguard the mental health of students,''
the ministry directive stated. But ``loud and gaudy colors'' that
are ``not in harmony with the spirit of education'' will not be
allowed. Although the all-encompassing black chador remains the
favored Islamic dress, it ``in no way can be imposed on the
students,'' the directive said.
</P>
<P>
   The color shift follows a campaign by Zahra Rahnavard, an artist
who is president of Al Zahra University, a school for women, to
allow girls and women of all ages to wear colorful clothing. ``As
an artist I believe colors are important,'' she told a seminar
during Women's Week last fall. ``Black is not the color of the
revolution and bright colors are divine colors that do not have an
anti-revolutionary meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   She has also claimed that osteoporosis has increased among
women, even young women, because sunlight, which helps the body
form Vitamin D, does not penetrate their dark clothing. Women in
many parts of the countryside have always worn colorful clothing.
Many dermatologists, meanwhile, complain that the rubbing of the
head covering against the skin contributes to acne and rashes.
</P>
<P>
   The easing of the rules goes only so far. Even though girls
younger than 9 do not have to wear Islamic dress on the streets,
they must do so in state-run schools. So schoolgirls will still
have to wear smocklike coats that fall below their knees; pants,
and hoods that cover their heads and necks and expose only their
faces. The dress code makes it particularly difficult for
schoolgirls to take part in sports like soccer and basketball and
run races outdoors. And what kid wants to have to cover up in
100-degree heat?
</P>
<P>
   The new decree coincides with a quiet but determined revolt
among women of all ages against the constraints of their dress.
Newspapers have published articles about teen-age girls who cut
their hair short and dress as boys to avoid having to wear Islamic
dress. Women in Tehran are wearing tighter and shorter coats over
their pants this summer. And since baring the feet is acceptable in
Islam, more women are wearing sandals and painting their toenails
in bright colors.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with the new decree about schoolgirls. The
conservative newspaper Ressalat charged that the ministry had not
adequately explained why the change was necessary, and it worried
what would come next. ``This decree will allow female students to
demand other freedoms,'' the newspaper said.

their shantytown. Like their neighbors, they lived here amid the
filth and flies and degradation because the living was good. Mostly
upwardly mobile migrants from the barren countryside, they were
feeding their families and putting their children through school.
Like Roberto, they had struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you have a family of four,'' said Matthew Westfall, an
urban development specialist with the Asian Development Bank, which
is based here. ``The kids go to school part time and pick trash
part time. You could get up to 15,000 or 16,000 pesos a month,
possibly.'' That sum, about $400, ``puts you above the poverty
line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The people of the dumpsite, which they call Promised Land, are
not an aberration. They are part of the changing face of poverty _
a vast population shift taking place in much of the world, from the
joblessness and hunger of the countryside to the comparative wealth
of the cities. But for most of these migrants, that comparative
wealth is found in places like the Manila dumpsite, part of a
growing sea of poverty that laps at the edges of small, high-rise
islands of urban affluence.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, where cities of 10 million people or more are spreading
as fast as anywhere in the world, this urban landscape is replacing
the fields and trees of the villages for an increasing proportion
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years ago, Westfall said, only one in five Asians
lived in cities. Today the ratio is one in three. Twenty years from
now, more than half the population will be urban. In 1990, he said,
the region's cities needed a total of $38 billion a year to provide
urban services like water, sanitation and transport. In 20 years
that figure is expected to rise to an impossible $292 billion.
</P>
<P>
   These huge ``megacities,'' groaning with their burden of the
disenfranchised poor, will dominate the 21st century, it is said,
the way the nation-state dominated the 20th century and empires
ruled in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Urbanization, of course, is not just an Asian phenomenon. Nor is
the misery of the poor. Garbage mountains rise in Latin America and
Africa as well. But it is in Asia, perhaps, with its enormous
population pressures, that the issue is drawn most strikingly.
</P>
<P>
   Manila today, for example, has 13 percent of the Philippines' 74
million people but generates 30 to 40 percent of the nation's
wealth. Bangkok has 10 percent of Thailand's population but
generates 40 percent of its wealth. ``People in rural areas have no
alternative but to migrate,'' said Anil Deolalikar, a professor of
economics at the University of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But garbage dumps aside, said Naved Hamid, a senior policy
planner with the Asian Development Bank, these poor see little of
the cities' wealth.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one pattern for urban poverty and therefore no
single cure. In China, the pattern is predominantly one of a vast
floating population of migrant workers who follow jobs from city to
city. In Manila, where many urban services have broken down, it
also includes people like civil servants and teachers, whose pay
puts them above the poverty line but who often have no alternative
to living in the ugliest of slums.
</P>
<P>
   The urban underclass for the most part lives apart from the
social and economic structure of its city, invisible to most
residents and without the political weight to demand their share of
services. So they create their own separate _ though dependent _
economies. Some 80,000 squatters cluster around Manila's garbage
mountain, for example. They include perhaps 3,000 scavengers and
another 9,000 or so people whose livelihoods depend directly on
what urban experts call ``the recycling waste chain.''
</P>
<P>
   As planners seek new ways to address the growing disaster of
urban poverty, the world's millions of slum dwellers find their own
ways to survive. The art of scavenging, it appears, is one of the
great tributes to human inventiveness. There are children who dive
for golf balls in the water hazards of golf courses and there are
daring teen-agers who scurry for brass shell casings on military
firing ranges.
</P>
<P>
   In Laos, people use old bombshells to construct their houses. In
America, the urban poor dig for aluminum cans (and cold slices of
pizza) in garbage bins.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria this month _ in a tragedy that is a companion to the
garbage landslide in Manila _ hundreds of scavengers died in an
explosion and fire while trying to earn their living by puncturing
a pipeline and siphoning off gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   People like this not only make a living; they make a home for
themselves. The shanties at Manila's dump are hung with flower pots
and posters of soccer teams. There are tiny barbershops and ice
cream stands. There are births and weddings and school graduations.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people in the family of Jennifer Gino Evangelista died in
the landslide, including her parents. Twenty-one survived. None of
them want to move away.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, said Evangelista, 27, her father brought the
family here from the countryside after taking them from place to
place in search of a living. ``Every year we would move,'' she
said. ``We never had a permanent address. We were tourists in our
own country.''
</P>
<P>
   That homeless life ended here on the fringes of the Promised
Land dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we've stayed the longest _ 12 years,'' she said.
``This is where we've multiplied. This is where we've put down
roots. So this is our home now.''

   MANILA, Philippines _ Roberto Aquino, 14, says he finds ``false

   HOLLYWOOD _ The story goes like this: Several people are walking
down the middle of the street in the middle of the night. Suddenly,
a truck comes along and flattens them. How can you tell which one
is the movie studio executive? He's the guy who jumps up and says,
``Here's why that just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect hindsight is a common Hollywood trait. So is the ability
to explain, as though to a simpleton, exactly why such-and-such a
movie was a box-office bomb or why some superstar's latest movie
failed to open at the levels anticipated. The constantly shifting
ground upon which the Current Prevailing Wisdom rests must be
updated each weekend _ especially when something comes along that
contradicts the prevailing wisdom going into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the issue of PG-13 _ at the top of the Current
Prevailing Wisdom list at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, Hollywood studios are insisting that filmmakers
guarantee they will deliver a movie that will get at most a PG-13
rating from the Motion Picture Association of America _ and not an
R, which requires any moviegoer under 18 to be accompanied
(theoretically) by a parent or guardian. This is stressed in cases
of big summer releases, when it is important to get as many people
into the theaters as possible and grease _ not restrictions _ is
needed at the turnstiles. ``The question is, where does the largest
audience lie?'' said Dan Fellman, president of distribution for
Warner Brothers. ``At the end of the day, it's within the PG-13.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense on paper. Certainly if more people are allowed
into a movie theater, then the pool of ticket buyers is larger and
a movie should, by rights, have a better shot at making a bigger
pile of money. But is this Current Prevailing Wisdom really
correct?
</P>
<P>
   Follow the bouncing ball:
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend just before the Fourth of July, two major movies
were expected to compete to be No. 1 at the box office: ``The
Perfect Storm'' from Warner Brothers (rated PG-13) and ``The
Patriot'' from Columbia Pictures (rated R). In the run-up to the
weekend, ``The Patriot'' was widely seen as the likelier winner.
Both films had top-notch directors, but ``Patriot'' had a more
bankable star in Mel Gibson. Prerelease polling indicated that
audiences were more eager to see the period epic. Instead,
``Perfect Storm'' ended up making almost twice as much as
``Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monday-morning quarterbacking settled on three explanations.
``The Patriot'' ran too long for summer audiences (160 minutes).
Audiences don't really like Colonial-era stories. ``Patriot'' was
rated R.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it was said, PG-13 trumps R in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the next weekend. The only major opening was ``Scary
Movie,'' a decidedly R-rated spoof of horror films. Predicted to be
a decent-sized hit, it was a phenomenon, earning more than $40
million, the largest opening ever for an R-rated film. Wham!
Anybody get the number of that truck?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this was the movie that was the exception to the rule,''
said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, which
monitors box-office performance. ``They don't come along every day,
but there are some movies where the rating doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so PG-13 is better than R _ except sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, ``X-Men'' opened. Again, the polling predicted a
sizable hit. Instead, it opened huge, earning more than $54
million. Its rating: PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   To get some historical context into this debate, Exhibitor
Relations crunched the box-office numbers for the last three
summers, the four months in which the studios do 40 percent of
their annual business.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the films that finished in first place in each of the
18 weekends from early May to Labor Day in 1999, a record year at
the movie box office, 11 weekends saw a PG-13 movie in first place,
three weekends saw a PG, one weekend saw a G and only two weekends
saw an R. In 1998, it was a closer call; eight weekends had a PG-13
movie in first place, eight weekends had an R and two had a PG.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 11 weeks of this summer, PG-13 films were in first
place on five weekends, R films on five weekends and a PG film on
one weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the difference between PG-13 and R isn't so great
after all? Not so fast, Dergarabedian said. One must also look at
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitor Relations looked at all 265 films released last
summer. The largest number of them, 157, were rated R. Less than
half, 67, were rated PG-13. The average R film made $20 million
while the average PG-13 made $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands to reason,'' Dergarabedian said. ``That's what R
means, restricted. You're restricting the audience. But I'd hate
for this somehow to cause a chilling effect on the artistic
process.''

   Do you want to escape into the dark, violent world of a graphic
novel? Do you want to act out its ghastly denouement with its last,
grim death laugh? Try flipping a tiny switch and carrying out a
miniature execution.
</P>
<P>
   Death Row Marv, the rock-jawed anti-hero of the graphic comic,
``Sin City,'' by Frank Miller (Dark Horse Comics, 1994), is the
latest toy from McFarlane Toys, which is owned by Todd McFarlane,
the creator of Spawn, another comic-book anti-hero.
</P>
<P>
   Marv, who apparently needs no last name, is railroaded to the
electric chair, condemned to die for what he regards as a
justifiable revenge killing. The battery-operated toy, which is
sold in specialty shops and music stores for about $20 and marketed
for ages 13 and up, is not for the faint of heart: ``Watch Marv
convulse as the switch is thrown,'' say the words on the box,
``then hear him say, `That the best you can do?''' His eyes ``glow
red as he fries.''
</P>
<P>
   The toy's typical buyer is the 15- to 45-year-old male.

<P>
   Do you want to escape into the dark, violent world of a graphic
novel? Do you want to act out its ghastly denouement with its last,
grim death laugh? Try flipping a tiny switch and carrying out a
miniature execution.
</P>
<P>
   Death Row Marv, the rock-jawed anti-hero of the graphic comic,
``Sin City,'' by Frank Miller (Dark Horse Comics, 1994), is the
latest toy from McFarlane Toys, which is owned by Todd McFarlane,
the creator of Spawn, another comic-book anti-hero.
</P>
<P>
   Marv, who apparently needs no last name, is railroaded to the
electric chair, condemned to die for what he regards as a
justifiable revenge killing. The battery-operated toy, which is
sold in specialty shops and music stores for about $20 and marketed
for ages 13 and up, is not for the faint of heart: ``Watch Marv
convulse as the switch is thrown,'' say the words on the box,
``then hear him say, `That the best you can do?''' His eyes ``glow
red as he fries.''
</P>
<P>
   The toy's typical buyer is the 15- to 45-year-old male.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first production was completely sold out in pre-order
sales, before we even shipped,'' said Beau Smith, director of
marketing at McFarlane Toys, who did not provide production
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon, as I saw Marv _ oh, man! _ I had to have one,'' said

UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GIFTS, COUPONS AND CASH

<P>
   If money changes everything, why not use it on people?
</P>
<P>
   It is the cash the women want, says Barbara Harris of Anaheim,
Calif., founder of Children Require a Caring Kommunity, known by
its acronym Crack, which since 1997 has paid drug users $200 to be
sterilized or to use contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Not only cash but discount coupons, gifts and vouchers have
become incentives in programs to encourage healthy behavior,
whether the issue involves reproduction, drug treatment or even
organ donation. Yet some experts question whether such methods
actually work in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   At least 246 women have taken up the offer, according to Crack's
Web site: www.cracksterilization.com. Harris hopes a new $50
referral bonus will bring in additional clients.
</P>
<P>
   Crack's promotional slogan _ ``Don't Let a Pregnancy Interfere
With Your Drug Habit'' _ bluntly conveys why cash can be such a
powerful motivator for drug addicts, many of whom become pregnant
repeatedly and whose babies are underweight and at risk for birth
defects. Although Harris does not track how the women spend the
money, she said, ``Sure, some use it to buy more drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years before Crack began its program, a dollar-a-day
program was established in Colorado to persuade young women to
delay pregnancy. The cash is part of a program that includes weekly
support-group meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But criticism has dogged international population-planning
efforts. Widespread condemnation followed revelations in 1998 that
Peruvian women were being sterilized in exchange for dresses,
T-shirts and food in cases where informed consent was doubtful and
post-operative care inadequate. In March, members of Congress
questioned whether aid to Peru was violating prohibitions against
the use of federal funds for forced family planning abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives have also encouraged women to  &UR; have &LR;  children. In
Scotland, the Catholic Church undertook an initiative in 1997 to
pay women not to terminate their pregnancies, in one case paying
the family of a 12-year-old girl. Elsewhere, moral objections over
abortion are not the issue; low birthrates are. In Japan, private
companies are offering cash bonuses to employees who have more than
one child.
</P>
<P>
   Whether cash is an undue inducement depends on the
circumstances. ``Cash is a very effective incentive that we use all
the time,'' said Bonnie Steinbock, chairwoman of the philosophy
department at the State University of New York at Albany, who has
studied incentives in reproductive decision-making. ``It isn't
necessarily coercive.''
</P>
<P>
   Offers of cash to do good are nothing new. And paying donors for
plasma, for example, has caused officials at blood banks to worry
about needy participants lying about their health histories.
</P>
<P>
   But do incentives involving reproductive decisions really work?
Sometimes, say Dr. Cheri Pies and Dr. Sarah Samuels, researchers
with the Incentives Project, a two-year program of the School of
Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley. They
found only 11 rigorous studies of such inducements, which varied
from cash and small gifts to coupons for infant formula combined
with education, support and counseling. The cash incentives could
not be linked to the success or failure of the programs in the
studies, said Pies and Samuels, who advocate using money for
achievable short-term outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Cash has also been dangled to keep teen-agers off drugs. In
Florida, Arkansas and Pennsylvania programs, participants get
discounts at local shops and exemptions from curfew rules when they
pass a voluntary urine test and agree to future random tests.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schlichter, a financial adviser and member of the
Chamber of Commerce in Chambersburg, Pa., lobbied to bring the
Arkansas anti-drug program Truce, the acronym for Teens Resisting
Unhealthy Choices Everyday, to his rural community. About 20
percent of the students in grades 8 through 12 have been
voluntarily tested. ``It was the first program we heard about that
involved a carrot and not a stick,'' Schlichter said.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law prohibits commerce in human organs and
tissues (with an exemption for replenishable material like blood,
plasma, sperm or eggs), Pennsylvania health officials attracted
attention last year with a proposal that circumvented the 1984
statute. They designed an experimental program in which families of
organ donors would receive a $300 reimbursement for funeral
expenses. Fearful of violating the law, they recently scaled back
and now propose paying some hotel and travel costs for donor
families directly to the lodging and transportation providers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the introduction of cash incentives could
result in fewer people donating their organs. Money has the
potential for dirtying the process, said Bob Spieldenner, a
spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing. ``Paying might
very well drive out altruism,'' Spieldenner said.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the debate about money versus altruism might be
gullibility as far as organ donation is concerned. The Department
of Health and Human Services recently began to investigate certain
practices in harvesting tissues, including skin, tendons, bones and
foreskins. Many people may be unaware that their freely given
donations may end up fattening lips or enlarging penises in what
has now become the vast, lucrative enterprise of cosmetic surgery.
Federal rules limit reimbursement for tissue to reasonable
administrative and processing costs, although some interpret those
rules expansively.
</P>
<P>
   Although the examples of cold, hard cash enlisted to encourage
health and good works is growing, one particular program has failed
to catch on. The Frederick Christian Fellowship in Frederick, Md.,
gave $10 bills to first-time visitors in 1994, which succeeded in
almost doubling attendance. Few churches, though, have followed
suit.

   WASHINGTON _ In 1928, the Supreme Court took up the case of Roy
``Big Boy'' Olmstead, a bootlegger whose phones had been tapped by
federal agents without a warrant. The court ruled that evidence
obtained in that way was legal, prompting a remarkable dissent by
Judge Louis D. Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The progress of science in furnishing the government with the
means of espionage is not likely to stop with wiretapping,''
Justice Brandeis wrote in a dissent that the court adopted as the
law nearly 40 years later. ``Ways may some day be developed by
which the government, without removing papers from secret drawers,
can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be enabled to
expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ubiquity of e-mail and the ingenuity of the FBI,
that day has arrived. Over the last couple of weeks it has been
widely reported that the FBI is now using a computer program called
Carnivore, which, once installed on the network of an Internet
service provider, can troll through millions of e-mail messages and
hone in on the electronic correspondence of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the FBI has reported using the program fewer than 25
times since it was developed 18 months ago, but that number is
expected to grow quickly, since the the bureau expects it to become
an indispensable law enforcement tool, particularly in
international espionage and terrorism cases.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, say critics, but Carnivore is also capable of
simultaneously monitoring the communications of people not
suspected of a crime. That has caused civil liberties groups and
privacy advocates to worry that the technology might be used to
monitor unpopular groups or political enemies, and not just
suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill began voicing their
concerns, the White House moved to calm the growing storm. John
Podesta, President Clinton's chief of staff, outlined legislative
proposals that would set legal requirements for surveillance in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that some kind of legislation is needed to make
sense of the existing patchwork of laws and court cases on
electronic surveillance. At present, for example, e-mail sent via
cable modem is more strictly protected that any other communication
form _ even telephone conversations _ while law enforcement
requests for lists of telephone calls to or from a particular line
must be granted without question by a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposed replacing these illogical distinctions
with a uniform, rational set of standards. Civil liberties and
privacy groups support this idea in principle, but are highly
critical of the administration for refusing to explain how broadly
it intends to use Carnivore or to describe what safeguards are in
place for preventing its abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say that computer systems like
Carnivore are necessary because e-mail is becoming more frequently
used for communication among criminals. And the officials note that
these cybermonitors can actually be set to record communications
much more selectively than a phone tap.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore could, for instance, be programmed to pick up the
e-mail from only one sender and a particular computer, while
excluding such e-mail as messages to or from, say, the sender's
lawyer or wife. Phone taps, on the other hand, pick up everything.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing on Friday, top FBI officials also announced
plans to submit Carnivore to analysis by independent academics, and
noted that the system kept a log of what it was asked to pick up,
which could be used by a court to spot any violations.
</P>
<P>
   In making their case, supporters of cybersurveillance say that
the only way to track e-mail is by combing through all of the
messages on a particular network, because e-mail consists of a
series of digital packets that are broken apart at the sending end
and transmitted along multiple electronic paths before being
reconstituted by the recipient's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, privacy groups and some Internet service providers,
or ISPs, say there remains a less intrusive alternative. The
providers, like AOL or the Microsoft Network, could be ordered by a
court to turn over specific material, rather than give the FBI
unlimited access to a network. That is precisely how telephone
companies are treated; they cooperate with warrants for wiretaps
and lists of telephone numbers called from a particular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is who should be in control,'' said James X.
Dempsey, staff attorney for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a civil liberties group in Washington. ``It upsets the
balance among competing interests and privacy for law enforcement
to, in essence, kick the companies out of the way, hook up a black
box, and say, don't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said that it was time for a reappraisal of all the
standards used by the government to eavesdrop, particularly as the
world moves into an era of digital communications that can be more
readily monitored by computers and more easily masked by
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   As even household appliances begin to be wired into the Internet
and many of our most personal thoughts and associations are now
shared with the computer, the issue has taken on a new imperative
and is being debated on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The British government (whose house-to-house searches in the
English colonies led to the Fourth Amendment prohibition against
unreasonable searches) is near to adopting a law, the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Bill, or RIP, that would require Internet
service companies to finance the permanent installation of a
Carnivore-like system for government use.
</P>
<P>
   A similar system is already in place in Russia, while in the
Netherlands a debate is raging over whether the government should
have the authority to tap into e-mail at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate really cries out for a return to first
principles,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, a research organization that studies
privacy issues and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important of such principles, he said, is that
the government should always use the least intrusive investigative
techniques before taking the invasive step of trying to intercept
telephone calls or e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the solution?'' he asked. ``A lot of oversight, a lot
of accountability, and a great deal of concern about the potential
surveillance capabilities of the electronic police state.''

international espionage and terrorism cases.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, say critics, but Carnivore is also capable of
simultaneously monitoring the communications of people not
suspected of a crime. That has caused civil liberties groups and
privacy advocates to worry that the technology might be used to
monitor unpopular groups or political enemies, and not just
suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as lawmakers on Capitol Hill began voicing their
concerns, the White House moved to calm the growing storm. John
Podesta, President Clinton's chief of staff, outlined legislative
proposals that would set legal requirements for surveillance in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that some kind of legislation is needed to make
sense of the existing patchwork of laws and court cases on
electronic surveillance. At present, for example, e-mail sent via
cable modem is more strictly protected that any other communication
form _ even telephone conversations _ while law enforcement
requests for lists of telephone calls to or from a particular line
must be granted without question by a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposed replacing these illogical distinctions
with a uniform, rational set of standards. Civil liberties and
privacy groups support this idea in principle, but are highly
critical of the administration for refusing to explain how broadly
it intends to use Carnivore or to describe what safeguards are in
place for preventing its abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say that computer systems like
Carnivore are necessary because e-mail is becoming more frequently
used for communication among criminals. And the officials note that
these cybermonitors can actually be set to record communications
much more selectively than a phone tap.
</P>
<P>
   Carnivore could, for instance, be programmed to pick up the
e-mail from only one sender and a particular computer, while
excluding such e-mail as messages to or from, say, the sender's
lawyer or wife. Phone taps, on the other hand, pick up everything.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing on Friday, top FBI officials also announced
plans to submit Carnivore to analysis by independent academics, and
noted that the system kept a log of what it was asked to pick up,
which could be used by a court to spot any violations.
</P>
<P>
   In making their case, supporters of cybersurveillance say that
the only way to track e-mail is by combing through all of the
messages on a particular network, because e-mail consists of a
series of digital packets that are broken apart at the sending end
and transmitted along multiple electronic paths before being
reconstituted by the recipient's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, privacy groups and some Internet service providers,
or ISPs, say there remains a less intrusive alternative. The
providers, like AOL or the Microsoft Network, could be ordered by a
court to turn over specific material, rather than give the FBI
unlimited access to a network. That is precisely how telephone
companies are treated; they cooperate with warrants for wiretaps
and lists of telephone numbers called from a particular phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is who should be in control,'' said James X.
Dempsey, staff attorney for the Center for Democracy and
Technology, a civil liberties group in Washington. ``It upsets the
balance among competing interests and privacy for law enforcement
to, in essence, kick the companies out of the way, hook up a black
box, and say, don't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said that it was time for a reappraisal of all the
standards used by the government to eavesdrop, particularly as the
world moves into an era of digital communications that can be more
readily monitored by computers and more easily masked by
encryption.
</P>
<P>
   As even household appliances begin to be wired into the Internet
and many of our most personal thoughts and associations are now
shared with the computer, the issue has taken on a new imperative
and is being debated on a global scale.
</P>
<P>
   The British government (whose house-to-house searches in the
English colonies led to the Fourth Amendment prohibition against
unreasonable searches) is near to adopting a law, the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Bill, or RIP, that would require Internet
service companies to finance the permanent installation of a
Carnivore-like system for government use.
</P>
<P>
   A similar system is already in place in Russia, while in the
Netherlands a debate is raging over whether the government should
have the authority to tap into e-mail at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate really cries out for a return to first
principles,'' said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center, a research organization that studies
privacy issues and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most important of such principles, he said, is that
the government should always use the least intrusive investigative
techniques before taking the invasive step of trying to intercept
telephone calls or e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the solution?'' he asked. ``A lot of oversight, a lot
of accountability, and a great deal of concern about the potential
surveillance capabilities of the electronic police state.''

   DETROIT _ Walk into a department store these days and you can
buy a holster for a cellular phone that looks just like a holster
for a snub-nosed pistol. Visit a consumer electronics store and
you'll find that the computers are no longer white and
cheery-looking but black, sleek and faintly menacing. Stop at an
auto dealership and there will be an array of tall sport utility
vehicles designed to intimidate other motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Designers of a wide variety of consumer products say that the
American public is increasingly entranced by styling that suggests
a high level of aggression. They point to the popularity of black,
red and white as colors, the prevalence of crisp, even sharp, edges
for many products, and a declining emphasis on personal comfort in
everything from furniture to clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like `sex sells' _ in this case, violence
sells,'' said William Stumpf, a Minneapolis-based designer best
known as the inventor of the Aeron chair. ``There's a meanness
aesthetic being developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce R. Hannah, a professor of industrial design at the Pratt
Institute in New York, said his young design students were
particularly captivated by ideas that emphasized rawness and even
pain over comfort. One student, for example, was interested in
spiky jewelry that would be painful to wear and light switches with
sharp edges. And Hannah sees the same extremism at work in young
people's fashion. ``There are these big, black, chunky, almost
storm-trooper shoes and crisp trousers; there isn't the rumpled
look of the '60s and '70s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some older designers complain that there is little on the market
that they want to buy. Clyde Foles, the 56-year-old chairman of the
industrial design department at the Center for Creative Studies, a
design institute in Detroit, said he had been unable to find a
radio for his summer cottage because the clean, rectangular,
Bauhaus-style designs he was looking for had given way to alarming
combinations of curves and sharp edges. The prevalent design these
days, ``looks like Darth Vader's helmet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Where this aggression is coming from is a mystery. Designers and
market researchers most commonly cite video games, with their
emphasis on violence and exotic yet menacing shapes for androids,
space aliens and other threats. Others point to Jung's observation
that people behave worse when times are better, and suggest that
the end of the Cold War and the nation's economic boom have left
Americans freer to explore their deepest psychological feelings,
including the fear of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers single out the wealth of research showing that
Americans remain very much afraid of crime, even though crime has
actually fallen. Federal crime surveys show that violent crime
dropped 22.7 percent between 1993 and 1998. Rates for other crimes
have fallen even more sharply, including a 43.2 percent plunge in
motor vehicle thefts. But Gallup polls since 1989 have consistently
found that a majority of Americans believe that crime is worsening,
although the size of that majority has shrunk over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward playing on fears of crime is most noticeable in
transportation products, Stumpf said. Powerboats are now often low,
lethal-looking craft influenced by the stealth fighter's design.
Bicycles have studded, off-road tires instead of racing tires.
Skateboards have images of fire-breathing dragons instead of racing
stripes. And tall, large sport utility vehicles have replaced
sleek, low sports cars as the favorite choice of image-conscious
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Archetype Discoveries Worldwide, which is based in Boca Raton,
Fla., does psychological consumer researcher for many large
clients, including Seagram, Procter &AMP; Gamble, DaimlerChrysler, Ford
and General Motors. Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, the company's founder
and chairman, contends that the United States is in some ways
becoming a medieval society, in which people live and work in the
modern equivalent of castles _ gated communities, apartment
buildings with doormen and office buildings with guards _ and try
to shield themselves while traveling between them. They do this by
riding in sport utility vehicles, which look armored, and by trying
to appear as intimidating as possible to potential attackers.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study for Ford, for example, Rapaille concluded that
``bigger is better'' by itself was not enough for sport utility
vehicles. The reason the immense Ford Excursion, which is the
world's largest SUV, was not selling well, Rapaille said, was that
it didn't look menacing enough. ``It's like a big, fat elephant
that's a little dumb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rapaille has also been involved in the design and advertising of
Chrysler's PT Cruiser, an extraordinarily popular new model that
combines a minivan with a 1930s gangster-movie roadster. Customers
perceive it as ``Al Capone's car,'' Dr. Rapaille said approvingly.
``The message this car gives is: `Don't mess with me. I might have
a machine gun inside.'''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of research, which has revealed the consumer's desire
for aggressive products, has also contributed to tension between
auto marketing executives and safety engineers. The safety
engineers worry that tall sport utility vehicles are more likely to
roll over, more likely to override the bumpers and doorsills of
lower-riding cars and more likely to blind other drivers with
high-mounted headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Rapaille, incidentally, only half exemplifies the results of his
research. While he lives in a gated community outside New York,
nary a bulked-up SUV is to be found in his garage. He owns instead
two Rolls-Royces and a Porsche, partly because he worries more
about the danger of rolling over in a tall vehicle than he does
about auto theft.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may consciously or unconsciously fear crime when they
go for a drive, Rapaille said, but ``this is definitely not the
reality, it is the perception.''

<P>
   For all the curative powers of a booming economy, the
overflowing prosperity of the last four years has failed to raise
the second-class incomes of the one-third of American adults who
have not gone beyond high school.
</P>
<P>
   Just as near-universal high school education was one of the
great achievements of 20th-century America, politicians and
business leaders have long sought to lure more students to college,
reasoning that the college-educated would earn more in a ``new
economy'' that now more than ever rewards a bachelor's degree.
College, they believed, could help close the gap between the
economic haves and have nots. Yet the proportion of Americans who
have only a high school diploma has barely budged for 30 years,
through good times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Where many saw college as the answer, nearly everyone also
counted on the booming economy as a way to narrow the income gap.
Prosperity created a tight labor market that drove up wages, which
have indeed risen faster than inflation for everyone. But as
college graduates' earnings rose even more quickly, the wage gap
widened, not shrank.
</P>
<P>
   These stubborn education and income gaps are barely mentioned on
the campaign trail. Politicians and policy-makers speak mainly of
sending more people to college, without recognizing that a steady
third of adults 25 and older have only finished high school _ and
that percentage does not seem likely to come down soon. For a host
of reasons _ age, lack of tuition money, inadequate secondary
schooling, reluctance to study, discouragement from family and
friends _ college is not a viable option for a significant portion
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The data suggest that neither a robust economy nor policies that
try to push people through college can significantly narrow the
income gap.
</P>
<P>
   Harry J. Holzer, a labor economist and a visiting fellow at the
Urban Institute, would improve the lot of the lower-paid through
greater ``institutional support'' _ more government subsidies for
health care, for example, better unemployment insurance, a broader
earned income tax credit and larger subsidies for child care and
housing.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration endorses some of these steps, while
Gov. George W. Bush emphasizes tax cuts that would leave low-income
workers with more take-home pay. But college has become the favored
approach, the one that business most applauds. Nearly $13 billion
in federal funding has gone this year into college scholarships and
tax credits for college tuition. Bush favors similar subsidies and
so does Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who do not go past high school, and that will
always be the case,'' said Martin Bailey, chairman of President
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. ``Over time, however, the
goal is to reduce that proportion, because in this new economy, a
college education is increasingly important.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of the nation's 131.6 million jobs are classified by the
Labor Department as not requiring a college education. Yet for many
employers, high school diplomas are simply not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a bachelor's degree just to apply for the best
jobs,'' said Stephen Rose, a senior economist at the Educational
Testing Service. ``That is as it should be for doctors, lawyers,
scientists, engineers, computer specialists. But look at
middle-level managers. In 1960, only 40 percent had a bachelor's
degree and today it is 80 percent.'' Many such jobs don't
necessarily require a B.A., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But in the high-technology economy, employers say they
value a college degree as evidence that a job applicant has learned
to think and to master new ways of working, and is also
sufficiently disciplined to work hard. The high school diploma no
longer sends that message to employers.
</P>
<P>
   Education has always raised incomes. For more than a century,
the college educated have been at the top of the earnings pyramid,
the masters of each new, complicated technology. High school
prepared hundreds of millions of ordinary workers for the modern
workplace and helped to lift their incomes, shrinking the gap
between their pay and that of the college educated. But since 1980,
that gap has widened again. The economic boom did narrow the
earnings gap a bit in the mid-1990s, as employers competed to hire
low-wage workers. But starting in 1997, the wages of college
graduates pulled ahead, according to the Economic Policy
Institute's latest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Higher-level jobs for the college educated are among the fastest
growing, the Labor Department reports _ those for computer
analysts, engineers, upper level executives and secondary-school
teachers. But lower-paying jobs that require only high school
training are also among the fastest growing _ jobs for retail sales
people, cashiers, truck drivers, office clerks and home health care
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this demand, the wages of people with only a high school
diploma _ rather solid in the days of unionized blue collar factory
work _ have fallen steadily behind for 20 years, making college
seem the only route to the $20.58 an hour that college graduates
earned, on average, last year, according to the Economic Policy
Institute. By comparison, the high school educated averaged only
$11.83; adjusted for inflation, the earnings gap has risen nearly
70 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The gap has widened partly because union strength has declined,
and with it many of the higher-paying jobs once available to high
school graduates. And the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, is
not as high today as it was in the late 1960s. ``The deterioration
of unions and the minimum wage probably explains up to one-third of
the increase in the earnings gap in the past 20 years,'' Holzer
said.

Gov. George W. Bush emphasizes tax cuts that would leave low-income
workers with more take-home pay. But college has become the favored
approach, the one that business most applauds. Nearly $13 billion
in federal funding has gone this year into college scholarships and
tax credits for college tuition. Bush favors similar subsidies and
so does Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who do not go past high school, and that will
always be the case,'' said Martin Bailey, chairman of President
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. ``Over time, however, the
goal is to reduce that proportion, because in this new economy, a
college education is increasingly important.''
</P>
<P>
   Half of the nation's 131.6 million jobs are classified by the
Labor Department as not requiring a college education. Yet for many
employers, high school diplomas are simply not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a bachelor's degree just to apply for the best
jobs,'' said Stephen Rose, a senior economist at the Educational
Testing Service. ``That is as it should be for doctors, lawyers,
scientists, engineers, computer specialists. But look at
middle-level managers. In 1960, only 40 percent had a bachelor's
degree and today it is 80 percent.'' Many such jobs don't
necessarily require a B.A., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But in the high-technology economy, employers say they
value a college degree as evidence that a job applicant has learned
to think and to master new ways of working, and is also
sufficiently disciplined to work hard. The high school diploma no
longer sends that message to employers.
</P>
<P>
   Education has always raised incomes. For more than a century,
the college educated have been at the top of the earnings pyramid,
the masters of each new, complicated technology. High school
prepared hundreds of millions of ordinary workers for the modern
workplace and helped to lift their incomes, shrinking the gap
between their pay and that of the college educated. But since 1980,
that gap has widened again. The economic boom did narrow the
earnings gap a bit in the mid-1990s, as employers competed to hire
low-wage workers. But starting in 1997, the wages of college
graduates pulled ahead, according to the Economic Policy
Institute's latest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Higher-level jobs for the college educated are among the fastest
growing, the Labor Department reports _ those for computer
analysts, engineers, upper level executives and secondary-school
teachers. But lower-paying jobs that require only high school
training are also among the fastest growing _ jobs for retail sales
people, cashiers, truck drivers, office clerks and home health care
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this demand, the wages of people with only a high school
diploma _ rather solid in the days of unionized blue collar factory
work _ have fallen steadily behind for 20 years, making college
seem the only route to the $20.58 an hour that college graduates
earned, on average, last year, according to the Economic Policy
Institute. By comparison, the high school educated averaged only
$11.83; adjusted for inflation, the earnings gap has risen nearly
70 percent since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The gap has widened partly because union strength has declined,
and with it many of the higher-paying jobs once available to high
school graduates. And the minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, is
not as high today as it was in the late 1960s. ``The deterioration
of unions and the minimum wage probably explains up to one-third of
the increase in the earnings gap in the past 20 years,'' Holzer
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These financial pressures have indeed pushed more Americans into
college. College graduates now represent nearly 25 percent of all
adults, up from 17 percent in 1980. The proportion of workers with
only a high school diploma has correspondingly fallen to 34 percent
from 39 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if one-third of the population continues to balk at moving
past high school, then one solution is to raise the quality of that
education. More than 40 states are now requiring students to pass
achievement exams at various stages of their schooling. In the
attempt to raise standards, governments and school districts have
stepped up spending to train teachers, reduce class size, improve
courses, provide vocational training or apprenticeships, expand
Head Start and link schools to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is a downside, however, to raising standards and then
failing students who don't meet them. A system could emerge that is
less forgiving than American public schools have traditionally
been, less willing to give poor students a second or third or
fourth chance, says Paul Attewell, a sociologist at the College of
the City University of New York. ``It has not happened yet, but in
such a system you are likely to produce a large number of poor kids
and minority kids who drop out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, he added, may be a case in point: Hundreds of
young people failed qualifying exams but didn't show up for
compulsory schooling this summer. Richard Murnane, an economist at
Harvard's Graduate School of Education, acknowledges the risk.
``That is a problem,'' he said, ``but the alternative of graduating
students without stronger skills will penalize them for a
lifetime.''

JERUSALEM: THE HOLIEST CITY, THE TOUGHEST CONFLICT, THE HIGHEST
STAKES

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When the late afternoon sun turns the crenellated
limestone walls of the Old City to warm glowing gold, it is easy to
understand the intense emotional hold of this tiny place.
</P>
<P>
   Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman sultan, built these walls
in 1538 _ rebuilt them, really, from the stones left behind by
Romans, Jews, Muslims, Byzantines, Crusaders, the Arab armies of
Saladin and the Mamelukes. They are walls that enclose sites holy
to the three great monotheistic religions.
</P>
<P>
   That well-known fact places Jerusalem at the very heart of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue so difficult, so sensitive,
that until now peace negotiators simply put it off. The city, and
the idea of it as a capital, is a central icon to both sides. Jews,
after centuries of dispersion and persecution, still end their
Seder each Passover: ``Next year in Jerusalem.'' And in virtually
every Muslim home in every Palestinian refugee camp there hangs a
picture of the Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   But now the negotiating teams at Camp David are trying to come
to grips with Jerusalem, and they are finding it an extraordinarily
difficult task _ to imagine the unimaginable, a truly united (or
fairly divided) Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   It may be tempting to think that the easiest basis for a
settlement would be to admit that the two sides share a heritage
and guarantee all groups access to the holy sites. But in 50 years
of conflict _ and more than 20 years of peacemaking _ achieving
that kind of formula in Jerusalem has only become harder. That is
because new layers of grievance, resentment and reason for distrust
have been added on both sides. And in many Israeli and Palestinian
minds, these only reinforce the idea that their one best guarantee
of access and security is sole political control of all or part of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, the holy place is the Western (or Wailing) Wall, the
remains of the Second Temple built on Mount Moriah after the return
from exile in Babylon. For Muslims, it is the plateau on the Temple
Mount above the wall, known as the Haram al-Sharif, or noble
sanctuary, from which the prophet Muhammad made a visit to heaven
on his winged horse. The sanctuary contains the Dome of the Rock
shrine and Al Aksa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. It is
exactly the same place, and both Jews and Muslims share the belief
that the rock itself is where Abraham prepared his son for
sacrifice. For Christians, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a
short distance away, is where Jesus was crucified, buried and
resurrected to redeem mankind's sins.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem and its holy sites were deemed so unique that, under
the doomed 1947 United Nations partition plan for turning the
British Palestine mandate into Arab and Jewish zones, the city was
to become an international district. It was an idea acceptable then
to David Ben-Gurion and his overwhelmingly secular Zionist
associates, who had more regard for security considerations than
for controlling religious shrines.
</P>
<P>
   But the Arab armies attacked instead, and Israel as born in a
bitter war. Israeli troops fought their way desperately up the
twisting road through the hills to relieve Jews besieged with
little food or water in the new city that had grown up outside the
Ottoman walls. The rusted hulks of their makeshift armored cars
still line the road as monuments. But the Jordanian King Abdullah's
Arab Legion, trained and led by British officers, held the heights
above Jerusalem, captured the Old City and incorporated it into
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   From 1948 to 1967, Jerusalem was a divided city _ half
Jordanian, half Israeli _ with limited passage allowed through the
Mandelbaum Gate, mostly for international officials and Christian
clergy. Most important for the future, the Old City was sealed off
to Jews and many of their religious sites were defiled. Then, in
the 1967 war, Israel took all of Jerusalem and the West Bank, its
triumphant army chaplain, Shlomo Goren (later to become a chief
rabbi of Israel) blowing his ram's horn at the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 30 years, Israelis created their own facts on the
ground, building settlements in the West Bank, expanding Jewish
neighborhoods into East Jerusalem and neglecting services to the
Arab areas. Even since the Oslo accords, Israelis have continued to
build Jewish housing in Arab neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has made decisions on how to treat Jerusalem in a
peace settlement extraordinarily difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Khalil Shikaki, a Palestinian academic who has advised the
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said last week that ``the
Palestinian public will not tolerate less than full sovereignty
over all of East Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif.
Palestinians will not tolerate Israeli border police or Israeli
checkpoints. That is not sovereignty, that is not control.
Palestinians no longer want to ask Israelis for permission to build
their homes, to educate their children, to live their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, he said that if they were persuaded that
the Israeli approach was genuine, ``the Palestinian street would
certainly be flexible.''

   Moshe Amirav knows this city well. As a young paratrooper who
had already been wounded in the 1967 war, he climbed out of a
hospital window to rejoin his unit when he heard it was trying to
retake the Old City. He entered politics with the hard-right Likud
youth movement, served on the City Council and worked under the
famous Mayor Teddy Kollek on roads, planning and other municipal
matters. His political views moved toward the left years ago, and
he is now one of a handful of Israelis who have been trying to find
solutions for Jerusalem, meeting frequently with the local
Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini, whose forebear died commanding
the Arab force trying to block the road to Jerusalem in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem is a two-fold problem,'' Amirav said. ``The
emotional and psychological problem and the very practical
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Old City, he noted, is a mere one square kilometer in a city
that now measures 120 square kilometers. (In 1967, West Jerusalem,
the modern Jewish part of the city, was 37 square kilometers, and
Jordanian East Jerusalem was 7.) And, he said: ``Jerusalem is not a
united city. It is a divided city, one of the most divided in the
world. More divided than Belfast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the euphoria of 1967, we annexed 28 Arab villages that
later on became Arab neighborhoods,'' he said. ``Our aim was to
enlarge the Jewish population, but we did all the most stupid
possible things.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible solution, said Dr. Amirav, who teaches conflict
resolution at Hebrew University, is redrawing the boundaries of the
city to ``enlarge the pie'' and devising ways to share power. As
for the sensitive religious sites, he says Israelis need to be
reminded that since 1967 the Temple Mount has been under the
control of the Waqf, the Islamic charity directed by the mufti of
Jerusalem, a decision made by the Israeli military hero and former
defense minister, Moshe Dayan.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel may well be thinking along
similar lines. Last week, he called Reuvan Merhav, a former Foreign
Ministry official and member of the Jerusalem Institute for Israel
Studies, to join him at Camp David. The research institute had
prepared a report, bristling with complicated maps, showing various
options for enlarging Jerusalem by adding several large Jewish
settlements, including Ma'aleh Adumin in the West Bank, to the
municipality while at the same time giving a kind of ``functional
sovereignty'' to Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal on the table is literally building a bridge between
the village of Abu Dis, where there is already an imposing new
building believed destined to be the Palestinian Parliament, and
the Haram al-Sharif. Thus, Muslims, including Arafat, would be able
to go directly to their holy sites without having to pass through
Israeli territory or encounter Israeli police.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Dis, still a dusty little place, already partly inside
municipal borders, is on the Mount of Olives, directly overlooking
the Dome of the Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the leaders met at Camp David, Israelis clogged
the phone lines to call-in shows with their own suggestions for how
to resolve Jerusalem's status. Much of the talk was pragmatic. And
yet, the fact of deep distrust and political resistance remains.
Arafat has declared that ``the Arab leader has not been born who is
willing to forfeit the rights of Muslims in Jerusalem,'' and has
reportedly told President Clinton he fears assassination if he is
seen giving up the goal of Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, whose own mentor, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was
gunned down for his peace efforts by an ultra religious Israeli,
saw his uneasy coalition government implode even as he departed for
Camp David. He was told last week of a newspaper poll back home
that reported that 70 percent of all Israelis believe that Israel
must not concede any part of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians in
any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, who took his Russian immigrant party out of
Barak's coalition, has declared that ``Jerusalem is the very soul
which unites and fortifies the nation in its entirety.'' And two
former chief rabbis took out a newspaper ad to proclaim, ``Whoever,
God forbid, will lift his hand against the land of Israel and
Jerusalem and the Temple Mount will be written in shame and
disgrace for all generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to solve the problem, suggested Professor Rami Friedman,
the director of the Jerusalem Institute, who worked on the options
study, is perhaps not to solve it; that is, not to be too specific,
for each side has too much to lose. For the holy sites, he
suggested, perhaps it is best to muddle along. ``It sounds crazy
conceptually,'' he added, ``but it's very practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much history, so much religion, so much
nationalism embedded in that one square kilometer,'' he said,
``that any solution will create more conflict than you had
already.''

   Barak, whose own mentor, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was
gunned down for his peace efforts by an ultra religious Israeli,
saw his uneasy coalition government implode even as he departed for
Camp David. He was told last week of a newspaper poll back home
that reported that 70 percent of all Israelis believe that Israel
must not concede any part of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians in
any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, who took his Russian immigrant party out of
Barak's coalition, has declared that ``Jerusalem is the very soul
which unites and fortifies the nation in its entirety.'' And two
former chief rabbis took out a newspaper ad to proclaim, ``Whoever,
God forbid, will lift his hand against the land of Israel and
Jerusalem and the Temple Mount will be written in shame and
disgrace for all generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The way to solve the problem, suggested Professor Rami Friedman,
the director of the Jerusalem Institute, who worked on the options
study, is perhaps not to solve it; that is, not to be too specific,
for each side has too much to lose. For the holy sites, he
suggested, perhaps it is best to muddle along. ``It sounds crazy
conceptually,'' he added, ``but it's very practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much history, so much religion, so much
nationalism embedded in that one square kilometer,'' he said,
``that any solution will create more conflict than you had
already.''

   Making Margin Calls in a Tightening Race
</P>
<P>
   In the album of Campaign 2000 cliches, get ready to paste in
``Too close to call.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a term that Americans are likely to hear frequently this
year, as strategists and journalists weigh in with state-by-state
analyses of the treacherous electoral map that confronts Gov.
George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The early conventional wisdom? It's too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Swing states in the presidential race like New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and Washington are
all rated as tossups or moving only marginally toward Bush, who is
strongest in the South and Rocky Mountain states, or toward Gore,
whose support is heaviest on the East and West Coasts. Factor in
the participation of third-party contenders like Pat Buchanan and
Ralph Nader, and it's hard to conclude anything except: It's too
close to call.
</P>
<P>
   The tightness of the race has, if anything, intensified the
guessing game of who the candidates will choose as their running
mates. With the Republican convention set to begin in Philadelphia
in eight days, most of the attention is on Bush's choice, which the
governor said he will make imminently.
</P>
<P>
   A leading contender is Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary
in the Bush administration. Other names mentioned frequently
include the Republican governors of two big industrial states, Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of New York, as well as
Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and
former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is the name with star power, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, who was reported to be softening in his
opposition to accepting the vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gore was making his case for the presidency in
Bush's own back yard, traveling to Texas to criticize his rival's
reign as governor, which got some Texans' dander up. ``Texas isn't
nearly as backward and third world as the Gore campaign would make
us out,'' said Michael Levy, the publisher of Texas Monthly
magazine. Proud of its homegrown candidate, Texas is probably not
too close to call.

   The Elian of the Animal Kingdom
</P>
<P>
   On one side stands a teary-eyed Russian couple whose Brooklyn
community has vowed to go to any length to help them keep their
adopted pet monkey. On the other side is an adamant state
government backed by a host of monkey experts and the power of the
endangered-species law.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle, oblivious to all the fuss, stands Cookie
Flikshtein, a rare diana monkey who is living the good life, eating
Rocky Road ice cream and wearing frilly red miniskirts, while her
fate is being decided.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after the conclusion of the Elian Gonzalez custody
battle comes an even stranger scuffle over little Cookie, age 6.
Her adoptive parents, Roman and Inna Flikshtein, have argued
unsuccessfully in court that there is no better place for Cookie
than their monkey-friendly home. The state attorney general's
office, meanwhile, maintains that Cookie is a member of an
endangered species and belongs in a special animal rescue program
at the Detroit Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   There are no immediate plans to wrest Cookie from the Flikshtein
home, where she has lived for five years in such familial bliss
that 13-year-old Michelle Flikshtein refers to the monkey as her
sister. But the Flikshtein's neighbors, many of whom are recent
immigrants from Russia, have closed ranks, promising to protect
young Cookie until the end.

   Congress Approves Tax Cut to Help Married Couples
</P>
<P>
   Congress finished work on a Republican bill to give an
election-year tax break to married couples. But President Clinton,
saying the measure was too costly, promised to veto it. The bill
would provide $292 billion in tax cuts over the next decade, and
was intended in part to address the marriage penalty, the quirk in
the tax code that forces many two-income couples to pay a higher
tax bill than they would if they had remained single. Democrats
said they also want to address the penalty, but do it in a less
expensive way that directs more benefits to low- and middle-income
people.

   Better Colon Cancer Test Urged
</P>
<P>
   The test used to screen healthy adults for colon cancer should
be changed, researchers say: Instead of the currently recommended
sigmoidoscopy, which examines the lower two feet of the colon,
patients should undergo colonoscopy, which probes its entire 4- to
5-foot length.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter test fails to detect abnormal growths high in the
colon, scientists warned in the New England Journal of Medicine.
But colonoscopy costs $1,500, and most insurers will not cover it
as a screening test.
</P>
<P>
   And the public has shown little enthusiasm for either test,
which require the insertion of long tubes equipped with cameras
into the rectum.

   Internet Gambling Bill Fails

   In a blow to casino owners, the House failed to approve a bill
to curb the exploding $1.2 billion industry of Internet gambling.
Most lawmakers favored banning online casino-style games, sports
wagers and lottery sales. But despite wide backing _ from Christian
evangelists to liquor store owners _ they fell short of the votes
needed to limit debate.

   Loan to Fight African AIDS
</P>

   The United States plans to lend up to $1 billion annually to
sub-Saharan African nations where AIDS and HIV afflict 25 million
people. The American loans, which will carry commercial interest
rates, can be used only to buy American-produced drugs, equipment
or medical services. Officials expect Japan and Europe to make
similar amounts available to support their medical exports.
</P>
<P>
   James A. Harmon, the Export-Import Bank president, said the bank
intends to do well for America by doing good for Africa. The effort
was generally praised by charity groups and African nations, but
some Clinton administration officials worried that the loans
undermined efforts to arrange debt relief for the same countries.

   Missile Offer by North Korea

   America needs a missile defense, some say, because of countries
like North Korea. One solution, according to Russian President
Vladimir Putin, who is rallying opposition to the missile plan, is
to remove North Korea from the equation. So he traveled to
Pyongyang, coming away with a North Korean offer to drop its
missile program _ if other nations provide it with rockets to
launch satellites. But that's a big if. As a former Pentagon
official put it, it's still unclear just ``what is going on in
North Korea.''

   Plan to Breach Dams Delayed

   A plan that could have led to the breaching of four dams on the
Snake River in the Pacific Northwest has been postponed. The plan
was aimed at easing the way for endangered species of salmon to
return to spawning grounds. But the White House chose instead to
embrace an alternative course. Trying to balance voters' support
for the salmon with regional officials' opposition to any breach,
it will propose smaller steps to help the species while deferring
until at least 2005 any razing of the dams.

   After a 21-year-old gay Army private was bludgeoned to death

last July, the Army opened an investigation into the atmosphere at

Barry Winchell and has concluded that no climate of homophobia

neutrino, it is the last of a notoriously slippery family of

kinds, pass through other matter almost without a trace. But they
are crucial elements of the theory that particle physicists believe
explains the structure of all matter.

   MIDEAST-JERUSALEM-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Jerusalem is at the heart
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue so complex that peace
negotiators simply put it off until now. Common sense seems to
dictate that the easiest basis for a settlement would be to share
the heritage and guarantee all groups access to the holy sites. But
for decades, achieving that kind of formula has only become harder,
as new layers of grievance, resentment and reason for distrust have
been added on both sides, only reinforcing in many Israeli and
Palestinian minds that their one best guarantee of access to the
shrines is sole political control or all or part of the city. By

a booming economy, the overflowing prosperity of the last four
years has failed to change the second-class incomes of the
one-third of Americans over age 24 who have not gone beyond high
school. Through good times and bad, that proportion has barely
fluctuated for more than 30 years, despite all the recent
encouragement to go on to college. In the computerized modern
economy, business and government count on college to raise a
person's income and close the gap between the haves _ the college
graduates _ and the have nots. But nearly 60 million adults have
failed to make the leap into higher education. By Louis Uchitelle.

   MIDEAST-JERUSALEM-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ Jerusalem is at the heart
of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue so complex that peace
negotiators simply put it off until now. Common sense seems to
dictate that the easiest basis for a settlement would be to share
the heritage and guarantee all groups access to the holy sites. But
for decades, achieving that kind of formula has only become harder,
as new layers of grievance, resentment and reason for distrust have
been added on both sides, only reinforcing in many Israeli and
Palestinian minds that their one best guarantee of access to the
shrines is sole political control or all or part of the city. By

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A gathering area of low pressure near the Southeast coast will
direct showers and thunderstorms into the Carolina Piedmont on
Sunday. Thunderstorms will also develop in northern Florida, where
fitful bursts of rain will fall. Farther to the west, there will be
showers and thunderstorms along the Gulf coast as a front becomes
nearly stationary over the region.
</P>
<P>
   A slow area of low pressure in southern Canada will drag patches
of clouds and isolated showers into northern New England on Sunday.
Meanwhile, sunshine will be filtered by scattered clouds in the
Middle Atlantic states. Readings will stay below seasonal levels in
this region.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will remain very warm with temperatures over 100
degrees in many places. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms are
likely in the Rocky Mountains and the deserts of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE COOLING BEGINS
</P>
<P>
   The mercury has hovered near 100 each day for the past two weeks
in much of the interior Southeast. While some relief from the
oppressive heat is occurring from eastern Texas to the Southeast
coast this weekend, heat is expanding in the West. Yet, in the
midst of the notable heat of the summer of 2000, the inexorable
slide into winter is beginning. In most of the nation, average
temperatures are at their highest during the next week. While the
change is initially subtle, normal temperatures in most of the
Northern states fall by nearly 5 degrees between now and the end of
August.

AUSTRIA POLITICIAN SOMETIMES DOWN BUT NEVER OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ There is a beloved figure in Viennese folklore
named Dear Augustin, a musician who got so stupefied while
pub-crawling during the 1681 plague that he was taken for dead and
thrown in a ``pestilence pit.''
</P>
<P>
   He recovered the next day, climbed out and composed one of the
17th century's top hits, ``Oh, Dear Augustin, Everything's Gone,''
an ode to life in spite of setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a perfect simile for Joerg Haider, the Austrian
politician who is feared because of past remarks that seemed to
minimize Nazi crimes, but there are parallels. People write off the
leader of the Freedom Party for one gaffe or another, and then he
makes a comeback. Some are glad to see him, some are not _ but
everyone is a little nervous about the company he has been keeping.
</P>
<P>
   His recent visits to Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, for
example, have not helped matters. Nor has the possibly accidental
use of an SS motto in a speech by a young leader in his party. Nor
has Haider's suggestion that the leader of a rival party be
indicted for treason for sipping champagne with France's prime
minister _ particularly when the new minister of justice, Haider's
former personal lawyer, was beside him and agreed that the idea was
worth exploring.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, whose party's entry into government was the reason the
14 other European Union members imposed sanctions on Austria in
February, is technically not in power. He resigned as party leader;
his only national government role is on an advisory council; and he
remains merely governor of Carinthia province.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not remain in obscurity. He is still the glue
binding the Freedom Party, which he led from 5 percent of the vote
in 1986 to 27 percent and a share of government last year.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say his coalition partners, the People's
Party, think they have him where they want him: playing the game
rather than spoiling it; sinking in opinion polls; and leading a
party headed for a power struggle between him and one of his
proteges, the 31-year-old finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics like Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof, foreign editor of Profil
magazine, say it works the other way. Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel
``still has the illusion that he's domesticating Haider, while the
fact is that Haider is Haiderizing the whole government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone mentions one photo: Schuessel recently visited Haider
in Carinthia and took a ride in his new Porsche. Photographers
caught their boyish grins, and caption writers noted gleefully that
Haider was in the driver's seat. Schuessel laughed it off, saying:
``As chancellor, I have several chauffeurs.''
</P>
<P>
   As Andreas Unterberger, editor of Die Presse, a center-right
paper, puts it, their coalition is more ``a psychological game''
than political deal-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, who Unterberger said had wide mood swings, needs to be
reassured that he is accepted rather than ostracized.
</P>
<P>
   On domestic issues, it is hard to say Haider is driving. Most of
his campaign promises have been ignored. He had backed a ban on
immigration, a flat tax, $400 monthly checks for new mothers (to
encourage larger families) and a crackdown on crime and
child-molesting.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his campaigning, Austria had already tightened its
borders, but it just allowed immigrants hoping for asylum to hold
jobs legally. Crime and child-molesting were populist scare
tactics, never a real problem. The flat tax and $400 check ideas
have disappeared. In fact, the finance minister, Karl-Heinz
Grasser, a Haider appointee, has proposed an austerity plan meant
to balance the budget by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Austria, like Germany, recently agreed to pay reparations
to Third Reich slave workers. Some years back, Haider criticized
war reparations, saying tax money ``shouldn't go to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Since entering government, Haider's ``blue'' party has fallen in
the polls _ as it had in the past, only to rebound at election time
_ while Schuessel's has risen. The Green Party too is up, while the
Social Democratic reds, who finished first in the 1999 election
with 33 percent of the vote but could not form a coalition, are
stumbling; their leader, Victor Klima, just quit to become a
Volkswagen executive in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   But the outside world is watching only one issue: the European
Union sanctions. They have done no economic damage, but they
humiliate Austrians, up to 80 percent of whom oppose them in polls.
``We are treated like a colony,'' said Andreas Khol, No. 2 in the
People's Party. ``France would never accept such treatment. Italy,
never. Spain, never. Germany, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   On this issue, Haider is very influential, but one could say he
is merely driving only if ``driving'' is what goes on in
``Bullitt'' or ``Dukes of Hazzard.'' He careers.
</P>
<P>
   He demanded a referendum asking Austrians whether they wanted to
use their veto to block all European Union actions until the
sanctions were lifted. (In a recent poll, 70 percent favored the
move.) He hinted that the veto could be used for only six months,
until Sweden replaced France as the European president, since the
French are seen as Austria's persecutors. Haider called President
Jacques Chirac of France a ``pocket Napoleon.''
</P>
<P>
   Khol, going along, drafted a carefully worded referendum. It
does not use the word ``veto'' and he denies it is a threat. It is,
he says, a ``hint'' to government, ``a channeling of the wishes of
the people who say we can't sit here like a lamb until we're
slaughtered.''
</P>
<P>
   If the sanctions were dropped, he said, the referendum would be
too.
</P>
<P>
   But Haider complicates all delicate diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He visited Libya in May as a guest of Gadhafi's son Saif
al-Islam, a personal friend from a Vienna business school; he
returned in June with a group of businesspeople and then announced
that Libya would deposit $25 million in a bank owned by the
Carinthian government. Gadhafi promptly criticized the sanctions as
the European Union ``giving in to Zionist whims.''
</P>
<P>
   Khol declined to say whether Schuessel had privately asked
Haider to avoid moments like that.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a new provincial leader in the Freedom Party used the
phrase ``Unsere Ehre heisst Treue'' _ ``Our Honor Is Fidelity'' _
in a speech to party workers. He later denied knowing it was the
motto of Hitler's SS troops, saying he was born after World War II.
Haider, born in 1950 to parents who were once staunch Nazis, partly
defended him, saying honor and fidelity were good principles.
</P>
<P>
   The party's Vienna leader, Hilmar Kabas, was heard to call
President Thomas Klestil a ``lump,'' which means ``little honorless
thief.'' Cornered by reporters, he denied it, saying he must have
said ``hump'' or ``dump,'' words that mean nothing in German. He
then started posing with mascots _ two stuffed elephants named
Humpi and Dumpi.
</P>
<P>
   And several party members have coined a new word,
``Vernaderung,'' which seems to mean ``vandalism by a gnawing
rodent,'' and they now apply it to Austrian politicians who act
friendly with French officials, as Alfred Gusenbauer, the new
leader of the Social Democrats, did, prompting Haider's suggestion
that he be charged with treason.
</P>
<P>
   Haider has also unleashed a spate of libel suits to silence his
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Suits for small amounts are a feature of Austrian political
life, but they are now more intimidating, writers who have been
sued say, because the lawyer who filed many of them, Dieter
Boehmdorfer, is now the minister of justice. Also, conservative
judges are finding in Haider's favor, making awards of $500 or
more, plus legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   In Austria, libel suits can be brought over statements that are
clearly opinion, which they cannot under U.S. law. Haider sued a
major news magazine that pictured him with devil's horns on its
cover and then a small leftist weekly that reprinted the picture
with an article about the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   And, because espousing Nazi ideas is a crime, Haider sues those
who link his ideas with Nazism. He sued a University of Innsbruck
political science professor for saying on Italian television that
his remark that concentration camps were really punishment camps
``trivialized Nazism.'' He won $5,000, then sued the professor
again for a CNN interview in which he said Haider's comparison of
immigrants and parasites used ``similar feelings and prejudices''
as those exhibited by Nazis. Haider denied using the word
``parasites'' specifically against foreigners. That suit is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't put anyone out of business, but it's muzzling free
expression,'' said Hans Rauscher, a columnist for the center-left
daily Der Standard, who is the object of a similar suit.
</P>
<P>
   The hope of those being sued is that they will be able to turn
the tables on Haider by appealing to the European Court of Human
Rights, which is, coincidentally, in France. Its rulings give freer
rein to political comment, Rauscher said, ``and the court says
politicians have to endure more criticism than other people.''

   HOLLYWOOD _ The story goes like this: Several people are walking
down the middle of the street in the middle of the night. Suddenly,
a truck comes along and flattens them. How can you tell which one
is the movie studio executive? He's the guy who jumps up and says,
``Here's why that just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect hindsight is a common Hollywood trait. So is the ability
to explain, as though to a simpleton, exactly why such-and-such a
movie was a box-office bomb or why some superstar's latest movie
failed to open at the levels anticipated. The constantly shifting
ground upon which the Current Prevailing Wisdom rests must be
updated each weekend _ especially when something comes along that
contradicts the prevailing wisdom going into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the issue of PG-13 _ at the top of the Current
Prevailing Wisdom list at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, Hollywood studios are insisting that filmmakers
guarantee they will deliver a movie that will get at most a PG-13
rating from the Motion Picture Association of America _ and not an
R, which requires any moviegoer under 18 to be accompanied
(theoretically) by a parent or guardian. This is stressed in cases
of big summer releases, when it is important to get as many people
into the theaters as possible and grease _ not restrictions _ is
needed at the turnstiles. ``The question is, where does the largest
audience lie?'' said Dan Fellman, president of distribution for
Warner Brothers. ``At the end of the day, it's within the PG-13.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense on paper. Certainly if more people are allowed
into a movie theater, then the pool of ticket buyers is larger and
a movie should, by rights, have a better shot at making a bigger
pile of money. But is this Current Prevailing Wisdom really
correct?
</P>
<P>
   Follow the bouncing ball:
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend just before the Fourth of July, two major movies
were expected to compete to be No. 1 at the box office: ``The
Perfect Storm'' from Warner Brothers (rated PG-13) and ``The
Patriot'' from Columbia Pictures (rated R). In the run-up to the
weekend, ``The Patriot'' was widely seen as the likelier winner.
Both films had top-notch directors, but ``Patriot'' had a more
bankable star in Mel Gibson. Prerelease polling indicated that
audiences were more eager to see the period epic. Instead,
``Perfect Storm'' ended up making almost twice as much as
``Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monday-morning quarterbacking settled on three explanations.
``The Patriot'' ran too long for summer audiences (160 minutes).
Audiences don't really like Colonial-era stories. ``Patriot'' was
rated R.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it was said, PG-13 trumps R in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the next weekend. The only major opening was ``Scary
Movie,'' a decidedly R-rated spoof of horror films. Predicted to be
a decent-sized hit, it was a phenomenon, earning more than $40
million, the largest opening ever for an R-rated film. Wham!
Anybody get the number of that truck?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this was the movie that was the exception to the rule,''
said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, which
monitors box-office performance. ``They don't come along every day,
but there are some movies where the rating doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so PG-13 is better than R _ except sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, ``X-Men'' opened. Again, the polling predicted a
sizable hit. Instead, it opened huge, earning more than $54
million. Its rating: PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   To get some historical context into this debate, Exhibitor
Relations crunched the box-office numbers for the last three
summers, the four months in which the studios do 40 percent of
their annual business.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the films that finished in first place in each of the
18 weekends from early May to Labor Day in 1999, a record year at
the movie box office, 11 weekends saw a PG-13 movie in first place,
three weekends saw a PG, one weekend saw a G and only two weekends
saw an R. In 1998, it was a closer call; eight weekends had a PG-13
movie in first place, eight weekends had an R and two had a PG.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 11 weeks of this summer, PG-13 films were in first
place on five weekends, R films on five weekends and a PG film on
one weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the difference between PG-13 and R isn't so great
after all? Not so fast, Dergarabedian said. One must also look at
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitor Relations looked at all 265 films released last
summer. The largest number of them, 157, were rated R. Less than
half, 67, were rated PG-13. The average R film made $20 million
while the average PG-13 made $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands to reason,'' Dergarabedian said. ``That's what R
means, restricted. You're restricting the audience. But I'd hate
for this somehow to cause a chilling effect on the artistic
process.''

   HOLLYWOOD _ The story goes like this: Several people are walking
down the middle of the street in the middle of the night. Suddenly,
a truck comes along and flattens them. How can you tell which one
is the movie studio executive? He's the guy who jumps up and says,
``Here's why that just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect hindsight is a common Hollywood trait. So is the ability
to explain, as though to a simpleton, exactly why such-and-such a
movie was a box-office bomb or why some superstar's latest movie
failed to open at the levels anticipated. The constantly shifting
ground upon which the Current Prevailing Wisdom rests must be
updated each weekend _ especially when something comes along that
contradicts the prevailing wisdom going into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the issue of PG-13 _ at the top of the Current
Prevailing Wisdom list at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, Hollywood studios are insisting that filmmakers
guarantee they will deliver a movie that will get at most a PG-13
rating from the Motion Picture Association of America _ and not an
R, which requires any moviegoer under 18 to be accompanied
(theoretically) by a parent or guardian. This is stressed in cases
of big summer releases, when it is important to get as many people
into the theaters as possible and grease _ not restrictions _ is
needed at the turnstiles. ``The question is, where does the largest
audience lie?'' said Dan Fellman, president of distribution for
Warner Brothers. ``At the end of the day, it's within the PG-13.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense on paper. Certainly if more people are allowed
into a movie theater, then the pool of ticket buyers is larger and
a movie should, by rights, have a better shot at making a bigger
pile of money. But is this Current Prevailing Wisdom really
correct?
</P>
<P>
   Follow the bouncing ball:
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend just before the Fourth of July, two major movies
were expected to compete to be No. 1 at the box office: ``The
Perfect Storm'' from Warner Brothers (rated PG-13) and ``The
Patriot'' from Columbia Pictures (rated R). In the run-up to the
weekend, ``The Patriot'' was widely seen as the likelier winner.
Both films had top-notch directors, but ``Patriot'' had a more
bankable star in Mel Gibson. Prerelease polling indicated that
audiences were more eager to see the period epic. Instead,
``Perfect Storm'' ended up making almost twice as much as
``Patriot.''

OFFICIALS SAY SKEPTICAL U.S. PLANS TO WORK WITH FUJIMORI 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After harsh denunciations of Peru's recent
presidential election, top Clinton administration officials say
they do not have enough leverage to force a new vote and will work
with President Alberto K. Fujimori while continuing to press for
reform.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a week before Fujimori is to be sworn in for a
third term after an election and campaign widely criticized for
gross irregularities, administration officials say they will send
the U.S. ambassador in Lima, John Hamilton, to attend Fujimori's
inauguration next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's presence will signal ``the reality'' that Fujimori
``is going to head the government of Peru at least for the
foreseeable future, and we acknowledge that we have mutual,
bilateral business to conduct,'' a senior administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in Congress and human rights groups say the softening of
the U.S. stance sets a troubling precedent in a hemisphere where
several elected leaders have recently taken steps toward more
authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Peru is perhaps the United States' best-performing ally in the
fight against the illegal drug trade in the region, and
administration officials privately acknowledged that concerns about
maintaining anti-narcotics cooperation played a hand in their
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   They also attributed the shift to a number of other factors:
resistance from key Latin American governments to tougher action;
Fujimori's ample financial reserves, which would make sanctions
less effective; and discomfort with the leader of Peru's
opposition, Alejandro Toledo, whom they see as too weak and
inexperienced to lead a successful drive to restore democracy in
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Congress eliminated $42 million in aid to Lima last month and
the Senate approved a provision to cut off more funds for Peru if
the president reports that Fujimori has failed to make
``substantial progress in improving its respect for human rights.''
But exemptions for counternarcotics and humanitarian help left the
actual amount of aid at stake at less than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials acknowledged having doubts that Fujimori is
prepared to make key democratic reforms, they say that in the end
they decided to follow the lead of the 34-nation Organization of
American States, a consensus-driven group that has called for
negotiations with Fujimori and has ruled out more forceful action,
like sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing report on Peru's election, the group's own
monitors denounced the harassment of opposition candidates,
government control of the media, arrests of would-be voters and the
mutilation of ballots in the first round. Toledo ultimately asked
to have his name scratched from ballots in the May 28 runoff,
charging he could not get a fair vote.
</P>
<P>
   But at the OAS annual assembly last month in Canada, Mexico,
Brazil and Venezuela steered the region toward negotiations with
Fujimori, administration officials said. A high-level OAS
delegation then drew up proposals aimed at ``strengthening
democracy'' under the current Peruvian government and appointed an
envoy to monitor any progress.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they favored a call for new
elections in Peru using the threat of multilateral economic
sanctions as leverage. ``There's a little bit of uncertainty as to
how to proceed,'' said one State Department official. ``The U.S.
was hoping the OAS would take the ball and run with it.'' Instead,
the official said, the OAS ``has taken new elections off the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   While withholding some aid to Peru could set back U.S. efforts
to eradicate drug crops and disrupt trafficking, critics of the
administration decision say the greater risk is tolerating stolen
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk here is sending a message to the rest of the
hemisphere that if you cooperate with us on narcotics interdiction,
everything else you do including the suppression of democracy is
fine,'' said Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.

IN THE NEW AZERBAIJAN, AN OLD FOX HANGS ON TO POWER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan _ President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan, a wily
veteran of Soviet politics and of the KGB, has cautioned his
Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, a comparative political novice
who served the KGB in Russia and Germany, that he must deal with
former Soviet republics as equals, not as erstwhile client states
with interests and policies subservient to those of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Putin's program to have a closer cooperation among
the countries in general is useful, but it is to be based on the
principles of equality and mutual benefits,'' Aliyev said in an
interview. ``It cannot allow the hegemony of any country, including
that of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's recent push to regain control of far-flung Russian
regions and to recapture lost influence in former Soviet republics
presents a new challenge for Aliyev, at 77 a crafty survivor of
Kremlin intrigue who moved from KGB general to head Azerbaijan's
Soviet-era Communist party.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev, president of independent Azerbaijan since 1993, has
sought to align his country with the West while retaining
sufficient ties with Russia and managing equally delicate relations
with Iran, Azerbaijan's neighbor to the south. Some Azeris fear
that Iran wants to export more radical Islam to this Muslim nation
while at the same time hindering development of Azerbaijan's oil
and natural gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev has been credited with bringing a measure of economic
stability to this country of 8 million people, particularly by
forging joint ventures with Western oil companies to exploit
Caspian Sea oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
   He also negotiated a cease-fire in the war with neighboring
Armenia over the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, although the
Armenians still occupy a fifth of Azerbaijan's territory and a
peace settlement remains elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complain that little of the promised oil wealth has
trickled down to the general population, which includes a million
impoverished refugees, most from the war with Armenia. Some also
accuse Aliyev of stifling political dissent by keeping opposition
parties weak and substituting his strong personality for lasting
institutional change.
</P>
<P>
   The president, blunt and confident, scoffed at such criticism in
an 80-minute interview on Friday in the presidential palace
overlooking dozens of aging, abandoned oil derricks. He portrayed
himself as the only leader with the ability and experience to guide
Azerbaijan through the transition from communism to capitalism, at
one point comparing himself with George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting concerns about his age and quadruple bypass surgery
last year, he also vowed to run for re-election in 2003, though
some question whether the country's constitution allows him another
term. And he sharply chided the U.S. Congress for blocking
government assistance to his country, blaming this on the
influential Armenian-American lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Under sanctions imposed by Congress in 1992, Azerbaijan cannot
receive direct financial assistance or training from the U.S.
government. Armenia, on the other hand, receives $100 million a
year in U.S. aid. The situation rankles Azeris at all levels of
society and has made it more difficult to deal with the country's
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Congress, which likes to give lessons to the world about
human rights, ignores human rights in this instance,'' Aliyev said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his confidence, Aliyev has difficulties at home. In the
late 1990s, the capital, Baku, was awash with dreams that huge oil
strikes would transform the poor country into the next Saudi Arabia
or Kuwait. But those dreams have not come true, as the biggest
recent oil finds have come on the other side of the Caspian in
Kazakhstan. The result is a general restlessness and concern that
the country placed too much reliance on oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations were so high a year ago and only now are people
realizing that you have to develop other sectors of the economy,
too,'' said Haver Kambaizadeh, a former history professor who now
works for a Western oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev appeared aware of the disappointment, saying that his
government is working to develop other parts of the economy and
that 60 percent of the foreign investment in the country last year
went into sectors other than energy.
</P>
<P>
   However, some of that increase stems from a decrease in
energy-sector money. Some Western companies, in oil and other
fields, have cooled on Baku recently because of concerns about
Aliyev's health and the lack of a clear successor if he left
office.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Aliyev also seemed conscious of those fears.
He boasted that his health is excellent, confirming statements by
his aides that he has not taken a day off in seven years and
intends to remain in office. ``I will always be the president
here,'' he said with a laugh.

NADER TALKS, LABOR LISTENS AND MANY DEMOCRATS WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Ralph Nader was on a tear, railing against
chief executives' salaries, the corporate-dominated campaign
finance system and cuts in factory inspections. Several of the
steelworkers seated around him were nodding, and then nodding
again, in silent approval.
</P>
<P>
   For a few minutes at least, it seemed as if the steelworkers'
cynicism about politics and politicians had evaporated, and they
were receiving the truth, or at least a truth they rarely hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the guys who work hard,'' said Nader, the Green Party
candidate for president. ``You're the guys who pay the taxes.
You're the guys who fight the wars, and then they say, `Tough.
We're closing the factory. It's globalization.' And then they use
factories overseas where dictators repress the wages to compete
against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader _ whose words, though not his speaking style, are laced
with emotion _ then laid into Vice President Al Gore and other
Democratic politicians, saying they have done little for labor
because they have been able to take labor's support for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're taken for granted, you're taken,'' he said. ``When
organized labor can say to these candidates, `You're not going to
take us for granted anymore, we have an alternative and the
alternative is Nader and the Green Party,' then they'll start
calling, then they'll start catering to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the 20 steelworkers who had squeezed into a small
Ohio State University classroom to hear Nader gave him rave
reviews, and many of them vowed to vote for him this November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say Nader is the best of anyone,'' said David Cole, an
electrician at AK Steel's mill in Mansfield, who drove 75 minutes
to hear Nader. ``I really like him. I haven't seen much from anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend and co-worker Larry Pugh was just as enthusiastic.
``I think he has the right answers,'' said Pugh, a crane operator
at the plant, where management locked out 620 workers last
September. ``He gives us a choice because the Democrats and
Republicans have sold us down the river.''
</P>
<P>
   This outpouring of enthusiasm for Nader worries many Democrats,
who fear that so many steelworkers, autoworkers, Teamsters and
other union members will vote for him this fall that it could cause
Gore to lose in Ohio and other large Midwestern swing states. For
the Democrats, an added concern is that two of the largest, most
powerful unions in the Midwest, the Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers, have flirted with Nader and have not endorsed Gore, even
though the AFL-CIO is backing the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Many steelworkers are still angry at Gore because he backed the
agreement to normalize trade relations with China, an accord that
many union members fear will accelerate the exodus of U.S.
factories to China. Although Nader is best known for his crusading
on consumer protection and the environment, he has grown closer to
labor unions in recent years, fighting alongside them against the
China trade deal, the World Trade Organization and the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although all the steelworkers at Columbus hailed Nader, several
said they would still vote for Gore, explaining that they feared
Gov. George W. Bush would win if Nader drained too many votes away
from the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank you for championing our issues,'' Skip Hall,
another steelworker who drove in from Mansfield, told Nader.
``You're terrifying the Democrats. You know this is going to be a
very close election. In 1980, I was dissatisfied with Jimmy Carter.
I backed Ted Kennedy, and we ended up with Ronald Reagan. He gave
us a bad Supreme Court. We're still living with that today. That's
the dilemma we face today. The same thing could happen with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement generated by Nader also concerns some labor
leaders. John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, has repeatedly
urged union members to back Gore, saying it is important to prevent
Bush from winning because working with a Republican Congress, he
might push through legislation to weaken unions and job safety
laws.
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,
was one of labor's most vociferous critics of the China trade deal,
but he now says it is time to line up behind Gore. He said in an
interview that labor's support for Nader was modest and would grow
smaller, and he predicted that many union members leaning toward
Nader would ultimately vote for Gore upon realizing that Nader
cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two viable candidates, Al Gore and George W. Bush,
and we're picking the one closest to the viewpoints of our members
and the issues of working people,'' Becker said. ``Nader's a fine
man. He takes a lot of positions that are near and dear to us. But
he is not a viable candidate. In that regard, anybody who would
support Ralph Nader we think would lessen Al Gore's chances of
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said that
the race between Gore and Bush was close in his state, but that he
did not think Nader would hurt the vice president. Recent polls
show Nader getting 4 percent of the vote in Ohio, compared with
more than 10 percent in California, but Leland said those were
high-water marks that were bound to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people know a vote for Ralph Nader is a wasted vote at
best and a vote for George Bush at worst,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said he hoped Gore would become more outspoken on
workers' issues to excite union members about his candidacy.
Indeed, on Monday, Gore is scheduled to hold a town hall meeting in
Cleveland with 75 steelworkers from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana and
Illinois. The Nader campaign sees this as a move to keep union
members from drifting toward their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said a central purpose of his candidacy was to move the
Democratic Party left on labor and other issues. To make it easier
for unions to organize, Nader called for making it legal for a
union to boycott not just the company it is striking against but
other companies that do business with it. (Such boycotts were
banned by the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947.) He also called for
requiring employers to pay triple damages when they illegally fire
workers for supporting a union.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that he should be included in any presidential
debates, Nader said he would seek to force Gore and Bush to address
work-related issues, like occupational safety, that have been
largely ignored during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore will tell you, `I'm for you. I'm going to fight for you.
I'm for a ban on using replacement workers in strikes,''' Nader
said. ``But what has he done in eight years? I don't care what
you're for. I want to know what you've done. Talk is cheap.''

<P>
   G8-CLINTON (Noga, Japan) _ Turning from what has become an
annual ritual _ the gathering of leaders of the world's largest
industrialized nations _ President Clinton shaved short his
meetings here Saturday to plunge back into the fervid search for a
historic peace in the Middle East. By Marc Lacey.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS (Thurmont, Md.) _ The peace teams at the Camp

</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-U.S.-SERVICEMEN (Okinawa, Japan) _ Thousands of Okinawan
children have been abandoned by U.S. servicemen, but, with no
agreement in force to make the servicemen pay child support, the
mothers faced little recourse. Until now. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   EQ-GUINEA-OIL (Malabo, Equatorial Guinea) _ With significant oil
production now a couple of years old here, people in Africa and the
West are watching closely what the government does with its money.
The scrutiny comes at a time when governments and human rights
organizations in the West have rallied around the reality that
Africa's riches _ diamonds or oil _ have seldom improved the lives
of average Africans and often enriched only corrupt African leaders
and their Western partners. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   PERU-POLITICS (Washington) _ After harsh denunciations of Peru's
recent presidential election, top Clinton administration officials
say they do not have enough leverage to force a new vote and will
work with President Alberto K. Fujimori while continuing to press
for reform. By Christopher Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-HAIDER (Vienna, Austria) _ People write off Joerg
Haider, the Austrian politician who is feared because of past
remarks that seemed to minimize Nazi crimes, for one gaffe or
another, and then he makes a comeback. Some are glad to see him,
some are not _ but everyone is a little nervous about the company
he has been keeping. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   AZERBAIJAN-RUSSIA (Baku, Azerbaijan) _ President Heydar Aliyev
of Azerbaijan, a wily veteran of Soviet politics and of the KGB,
has cautioned his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, a comparative
political novice who served the KGB in Russia and Germany, that he
must deal with former Soviet republics as equals, not as erstwhile
client states with interests and policies subservient to those of
Moscow. By Douglas Frantz.

   U.N.-U.S.-REFUGEES (United Nations) _ The U.N.'s emergency
relief coordinator has placed herself in opposition to the United
States, and particularly its ambassador to the U.N., Richard
Holbrooke, by proposing that existing U.N. agencies _ rather than
designating a new or lead agency _ pay more attention to the
millions of people displaced each year by civil war or ethnic
violence. By Barbara Crossette.

   GENERIC-DRUGS (Undated) _ The drug industry is aggressively
fending off one of its biggest threats: competition from generics,
which in the next five years could eat away at tens of billions of
dollars in sales from brand drugs whose patents are about to
expire. To shed light on this trend, The New York Times examined
hundreds of pages of court records and other public documents in
Washington and various states, and interviewed regulators and drug
company executives. The review showed how efforts to extend a
profitable drug's monopoly, as much as the pursuit of scientific
discoveries, drive decisions in one of the world's most lucrative,
and secretive, industries. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Jeff Gerth.

SHORT STAFFING HAS L.A. PARAMEDICS WORKING LONG WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 - LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles has so few city paramedics that Capt.
Steven Lilienthal had to work an extra 24-hour shift last week -
again.
</P>
<P>
   And his Van Nuys station had to borrow a paramedic from
elsewhere to fill a vacancy, leaving him to work 48 hours straight.
Shortages across the city forced three engine companies and an
ambulance out of operation.
</P>
<P>
   For Lilienthal and other paramedics, the problem has grown
critical, hampering emergency medical service in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are up all night some times and you might not even get
back to the station all night long,'' he said last week, nine hours
into his second 24-hour shift in three days. ``You just get worn
down, and when you have a shortage like we do - it gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more people and it's going to take more time to get
more people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the department has 51 vacancies for paramedics, but
critics said 350 more are needed to ensure solid patient care, cut
overtime and lower the resident-to-paramedic ratio to national
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The department's resident-to-paramedic ratio of 8,000-to-1 is
double the national average of 4,000-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Lilienthal's expectation of working overtime is not unusual. One
paramedic worked seven days last week - making for a 168-hour week,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials have acknowledged it is common for
paramedics to work 120-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   LAFD Chief of Staff John Ware declined to comment about the
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   However, fire officials have said the city's focus on police has
taken away money needed for paramedics. And recruiting paramedics
is difficult because of a requirement that they also train as
firefighters, they said.
</P>
<P>
   For the paramedics, the staffing shortages and excessive amounts
of overtime have raised a critical question: Is it possible for
them to work that many hours in a row, with little to no sleep, and
still be effective without raising a risk to public safety?
</P>
<P>
   ``Effective? That's an issue. Having a partner helps, but only
to a point,'' Lilienthal said. ``They're up all night and they go
home exhausted. And now we're having the effects of people burning
out and not wanting to be paramedics.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last year alone 22 paramedics dropped their medical
certification completely, according to the paramedic association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should never have been in this situation, because it's one
we could have avoided,'' said Rob Linnell, president of the Los
Angeles Paramedic Association. ``This is the result of poor EMS
planning. That's what's so despicable about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the department's dispatch center downtown strives to keep
the city covered, staffing shortages have added strain to
operations. One day last week, 13 pieces of equipment were removed
from service across the Valley - including seven fire engines - due
to staff training or mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics contend that sometimes ambulances are not close by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they just can't fill the resources fast enough, and
there'll be a delay, and sometimes that delay is that you have
resources coming from long distances,'' Lilienthal said. ``It's a
real juggling act downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the streets, professionalism reigns.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week about 5:47 p.m., the alarm sounded, and
Lilienthal moved across the garage at a fast clip, getting into his
captain's car. The paramedics were already on the ambulance, the
garage door opened and the sirens wailed.
</P>
<P>
   Checking the mobile data terminal in his car, Lilienthal knew he
was going to see an 82-year-old woman complaining of difficulty
breathing. He also knew, as did the paramedics in the engine, that
she has a history of cardiac problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``So at this point they are already thinking about what
equipment they'll need at the scene, and what sort of problems they
might encounter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By 5:52 p.m., the ambulance from station No. 100 had arrived to
find a paramedic assessment engine from station No. 83 from Encino
already there.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics from No. 100 acted quickly and quietly. Amid the
hustle of Ventura Boulevard, they were an anomaly: stealthy and
calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the job,'' Lilienthal said. ``If we're not in
control, we lose control.''
</P>
<P>
   The four paramedics work in unison: gathering medical history,
soothing the patient, checking the nearest hospital for bed
availability. Within seven minutes they had the patient on the
gurney and were moving her to the ambulance. Luckily, there was a
hospital close by with beds available, which isn't always the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they simply don't have the room, and then that ties
up the ambulance, takes it out of the picture until they can free
up a bed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fire Department statistics, there are nearly two
times more engines than ambulances, but paramedics spend twice as
much time handling calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``So two people on the ambulances are doing twice the work of
four people on the engines,'' Linnell said. ``You can see who is
doing a majority of the work. This is a real problem.''

GROWTH ISSUE POLARIZES TINY CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOSEPH GIORDONO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FILLMORE, Calif. _ Hollywood painting contractor Paul Harding
was skeptical when his wife started talking about escaping the
hectic pace of the city eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But on a weekend drive through Ventura County, the couple
discovered Fillmore, a farming community of 13,000 that time
seemingly has passed by. They fell in love with the seemingly
endless expanses of citrus groves, the mountains framing the
skyline and the downtown rebuilt in a 19th century style after the
devastation of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   On that first visit, they bought a home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fillmore reminded me of what Southern California was a long
time ago, and it really appealed to me from the first time that I
saw it,'' said Harding, 52.
</P>
<P>
   The Hardings' vision of a quieter time and a gentler place is
now under threat - in great part by people like the Hardings
yearning for a taste of the rural life and city officials hoping to
improve economic opportunities for the poorest area in Ventura
County.
</P>
<P>
   Farmland and open space have been gobbled up by new housing and
commercial development. And the Fillmore City Council took a
pro-development stance when it withdrew from a lawsuit seeking to
block the massive Newhall Ranch project in exchange for a $300,000
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very clear indication to the community that the
City Council had no intention of keeping its promise to resist the
pressures for development at all costs,'' Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Harding and others are fighting back, sponsoring the
Fillmore Save Open-space and Agricultural Resources initiative, a
November ballot measure that would require voter approval for
commercial and residential development outside a designated
boundary around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Several other cities in Ventura County passed SOAR initiatives
in 1998, including Camarillo, Moorpark, Oxnard, Simi Valley and
Thousand Oaks, but the Fillmore ballot might be the most
restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Fillmore officials have countered with Vision 2020 - an
initiative that would significantly broaden the development
boundary outside the city limits. The two largest additions would
be 830 acres north of the city and 630 acres southeast of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The SOAR initiative would limit development to an area roughly
equal to the Fillmore city limits until 2021, unless individual
developments are approved by voters.
</P>
<P>
   With both measures approved for the Nov. 7 ballot, Fillmore -
the self-proclaimed ``last, best small town in Southern
California'' - is at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a choice between preservation and development at all
costs,'' Harding said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just a question of development. It has become an
issue encompassing history, economic priorities and race.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1998 study, ``FOCUS: Ventura County,'' Fillmore
has the county's lowest per-capita income, its third-lowest
household income, the third-highest unemployment rate and the
highest minority population.
</P>
<P>
   While the study notes that such characteristics are not unusual
for an almost exclusively agricultural economy, city officials say
the only way to improve those conditions is to diversify revenue
sources.
</P>
<P>
   And that means development and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   According to Economic Develoment Director Shirley Spitler, the
city will now focus on luring smaller high-tech companies and
promoting the area as a regional tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   It is a natural progression for a town that is still struggling
to recover from the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, which destroyed
much of downtown Fillmore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earthquake really devastated a lot of businesses and
either shut them down or forced them to take out heavy loans to get
back on their feet,'' Spitler said. ``SOAR would keep businesses in
town from fully recovering and likely keep out some of those we are
trying to attract.''
</P>
<P>
   Fillmore Mayor Evaristo Barajas, an outspoken critic of the SOAR
initiative, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The businesses are starting to make a recovery, and we are
trying to provide a bit more of a market for them,'' said Barajas,
a real estate agent. ``The SOAR initiative is basically trying to
stop all of that.''

(FILLMORE, Calif: all of that)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to city officials, there are tangible signs that the
town has recovered. Three large developments totaling about 300
houses are under construction in Fillmore, with homes ranging from
$150,000 to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   But future residential and industrial development, including an
18-hole golf course dotted with large homes planned for the open
land surrounding a state fish hatchery southeast of the city, would
be blocked if SOAR passes.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Griffin Industries, the developer of the
proposed golf course project and a sponsor of the city's Vision
2020 plan, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know of any developers who would be willing to go
through the entire process of courting a city's voters and pumping
in all that extra money to wait three or four years before
building,'' City Planner Kevin McSweeney said. ``They could just as
easily go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Several shop owners declined to be quoted on the record,
expressing private concerns that their businesses could be targeted
by partisans of either side if they made their positions on the
issue known.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report by City Manager Ron Payne, the Fillmore
SOAR initiative would result in a 26 percent increase in water
rates, a 9 percent increase in sewer rates and require existing
residents to shoulder the responsibility for $2.2 million in
existing debt for capital improvements made in anticipation of
future development.
</P>
<P>
   The SOAR initiative, Payne says, will not slow population
growth. In fact, it would cause the residential area in Fillmore to
be completely built out by 2005 and cost the city some 2,500 new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   SOAR restrictions would limit home building to the point that
the population could grow by just one person per year from 2005 to
2020, Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of SOAR say they don't oppose all development, but do
want a say in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel that the city is exercising a great enough sense
of economy in developing the remaining land they have,'' said SOAR
sponsor Harding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about building a golf course on 200 acres of
prime agricultural land. It makes you wonder what their genuine
concerns are.''
</P>
<P>
   SOAR supporters also criticize the statistics cited in Payne's
report, saying they only represent the worst-case scenario. Having
voters decide the fate of proposed developments does not mean all
developments will be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Behind all of the numbers, though, some residents see a more
disturbing trend. City officials, they claim, want to lure business
and upper-income families to reshape the ethnic makeup of the
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estate lots and golf courses and ranch homes are all ways to
say bring in upper-middle-class white families and push aside the
minorities who helped build this community,'' retiree Ron Lima said
as he sat chatting with a group of friends under a shade tree by
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``How quickly do you think those people are going to be
forgotten if you have upper-income people just living here but
commuting to L.A. and other places?''
</P>
<P>
   City officials dismiss the claims as ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   All they are concerned with is bringing in the businesses and
residents that will keep Fillmore from being left behind as the
landscape of Southern California changes, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many residents are wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If being left behind means not becoming overrun with SUVs and
Radio Shacks and Wal-Marts, then I'm all for it,'' said Gary Wayne,
a Fillmore native who commutes to Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture is always subject to the whims of the economy and
Mother Nature, but it is the heart and soul of this community.
Always has been, and, hopefully, always will.''

GAY COUPLES FLOCK TO VERMONT FOR CIVIL UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga., N.Y., Mich., Britain)   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, Vt. _ This week, Jennifer Kacak and Jill Poste drove
more than five hours from their home in Suffern, N.Y., to this
maple-sweet Vermont town to get as close as they could to marrying.
</P>
<P>
   They paid $20 for a civil union certificate from the town clerk,
then exchanged vows and rings _ rings they had first traded long
ago _ by a waterfall before a justice of the peace. They did not
bring family or friends; they are celebrating at home this weekend.
And they knew that Vermont's civil union law allowing gay and
lesbian couples to wed in all but name does not cross state lines,
at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   But after seven years together, ``It was just the next step for
us to take,'' Kacak, 27, said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Vermont became the first state to offer gay and lesbian
couples marriagelike civil unions on July 1, this has been perhaps
the most striking effect of the law: Most of the couples taking
advantage of it are from out of state, and many of them are
whizzing in and out of Vermont for a certificate of highly
questionable legal value back home.
</P>
<P>
   Some town clerks report that two-thirds or more of the
certificates they issue are to couples from out of state. And the
laconic New England explanation some give is that the couples seem
to be coming because, well, they can.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Woodstock, where the notice on procedures for civil
unions is posted on a town hall bulletin board near announcements
about dog licenses and auditions for ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown,'' the assistant town clerk, Raymond Jillson, said all four
civil union certificates the town has issued have gone to people
who don't live in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In Brattleboro, of the first 68 people who handed in their
certified civil union licenses, only three were town residents, and
some couples came from as far as London, California and Georgia. In
Burlington, 41 civil union licenses have been issued _ as many as
the number of heterosexual marriage licenses issued in June, the
town vital records clerk said _ and 26 of those 41 went to people
from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of them do just the quickie ceremony,'' said
Melissa Murphy, the assistant town clerk, adding that she did not
mean to cheapen the ceremony by calling it a quickie. ``Most people
are just here because they want that piece of paper, and I think
they're hoping when they do go home to their home state, they can
say, `Look what Vermont did for us, now how come you can't do
this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Some plan to say even more than that. Deb Price, a columnist for
The Detroit News who wrote an article about getting the civil union
license with her partner of 15 years, Joyce Murdoch, said she
planned to send copies of their certificate to their state and
federal representatives, asking them to emulate Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, Price said, she and Murdoch plan to carry a
small copy of the certificate in their wallets as proof of
relationship; so that if, for example, one of them has a medical
emergency, it will be easier for a doctor to understand that the
other is effectively a spouse and should participate accordingly in
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Some couples from out of state who are getting civilly united
plan not only to speak out in their home state but to act. In
court.
</P>
<P>
   Six couples from the Rochester, N.Y., chapter of the
Dignity-Integrity Church, a gay and lesbian Roman Catholic and
Episcopal worship organization, plan to get certificates in Vermont
this weekend, said Jennifer L. Gravitz, a lawyer and participant.
Then, she said, she planned to try to get her Vermont union
recognized in New York, though she did not know what form that
legal battle would take and was seeking advice from gay groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us had previously been married to men,'' Gravitz said,
and as a lawyer, ``I especially knew the profound rights and
privileges and responsibilities that came with that. For me
personally, I just want that same status.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say they expect a state-by-state battle over
whether Vermont civil union certificates, which confer
marital-style benefits from tax breaks to insurance coverage to
inheritance rights, must be recognized in other states. They
predict the issue will be decided by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of civil unions had warned of just such legal battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said from the beginning that it wasn't proper for Vermont
to be introducing lawsuits into other states by allowing residents
of other states to come and get civil union certificates,'' said
Craig Bensen, vice president of Take It to the People, a group that
opposes gay marriage. ``If Vermont wants to do its own thing,
contain it within the state. If Vermont wants to set national
policy, that's another question.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, state officials who gather private records report that
75 out-of-state and 17 in-state civil unions have been recorded,
but all records for July do not have to be mailed to the state
until Aug. 10, so the numbers are sure to be higher. A Burlington
Free Press survey of 50 town clerks counted 132 civil union
licenses sold in the first week, with 60 percent going to people
who do not live in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculate that many Vermont couples are in less of a rush
to get all-but-married, while out-of-state couples either are more
worried the law will be repealed, or are taking advantage of
vacation time to travel, or are simply eager after waiting so many
years.
</P>
<P>
   While the civil unions may have legal and political
significance, they are, first and foremost, deeply personal
ceremonies, participants say. Justices of the peace who have
presided over several say they tend to be more private, with fewer
guests, than typical heterosexual weddings, and at times even more
tear-jerking.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Hadash, a minister at the Unitarian Universalist Church
in St. Johnsbury who was himself civilly united recently with his
partner of 17 years, had performed plenty of gay commitment
ceremonies in the past, he said, and ``it's the same thing. The
only thing different is I have a little piece of paper to fill out
now and it's a lot more emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, just as civil union advocates had wanted to show, the
sky here has not fallen. But small changes are apparent. There has
been a bit of a boost to the Vermont wedding industry, which is
already strong because the state combines verdant beauty with a
lack of requirements for blood tests or other delays.
</P>
<P>
   And consider this July 2000 moment bespeaking change: In the
Woodstock town hall, Jillson could be overheard fielding a
telephone inquiry about local justices of the peace, and one of his
first questions was, ``Is this a civil marriage or man and wife?''

ANALYSIS: BUSH LOOKS TO SAFE AND SOLID IN PICKING HIS RUNNING MATE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., N.Y., Mo., Pa., Ky., Wyo., Neb., Ohio, Tenn.) (Eds.: 2nd take could be used as a separate story on pros and cons
of the possible choices.)   
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Walter Mondale tapped Geraldine Ferraro as his
running mate in 1984, he was so far behind that he felt, as he put
it the other day, he had to ``reshuffle the deck because the
economy was good and Reagan was popular.''
</P>
<P>
   When George Bush turned to Dan Quayle in 1988, his media
adviser, Roger Ailes, hoped that the young senator would have such
sex appeal that women might try to tear at his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bob Dole settled on an old foe, Jack Kemp, four years
ago, a crucial consideration was that it would be a surprise. Scott
Reed, the Dole campaign manager, said his boss had not worried
about how they would get along in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all about winning the election,'' Reed said. ``I had
confidence that the compatibility issue could be worked out
later.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas seems to be steering
clear of the glamour and gloss _ and more toward the safe and
solid.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush secludes himself at his Texas ranch this weekend to make
up his mind on his single most important campaign decision so far,
a leading choice, his advisers say, is Richard Cheney. Cheney is a
respected but hardly electrifying former defense secretary and
former congressman who is running Bush's search for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have apparently survived to the homestretch include
two governors who are known more for their steadiness than star
quality: Frank Keating of Oklahoma and George Pataki of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney is the CPA choice,'' one prominent Republican
strategist said. ``Competent. Quiet. And dull.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be by design. Bush's advisers say the governor is so
confident he will win the election that he is focused less on bald
electoral calculations for November 7 _ like whether his running
mate would make a state more competitive _ and more on who he wants
beside him on January 20, when he expects to be sworn in as the
next president.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Bush appears to be less concerned about a No. 2
with pizazz is his recognition that, thanks to Bill Clinton, the
role of the vice president has broadened markedly. In picking Al
Gore, Clinton made the vice presidency more than an understudy's
job. It is now one that voters expect to be filled with a person of
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be thought that vice presidential nominations were
decided on the basis of a hunch or right off the top of the head,''
said former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, who apparently also
sits high on Bush's list _ and is known for his rectitude, not his
personality. ``Nowadays, it's a much more serious thing. The role
of the vice presidency has changed. It's not just the cipher job
that it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney would make ``a terrific choice,'' Danforth said, because
he has the credentials and temperament to function well in the
White House. Asked about another possibility, Sen. John McCain,
Danforth alluded to lingering strains between Bush and McCain from
the hotly contested primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president has to pick somebody he likes and is very, very
comfortable with,'' Danforth said. ``Or else, the vice president is
going to be stashed in a closet somewhere. It would be a reversion
to the previous idea of what a vice president is.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' Bush himself said:
``There's been the time in the past where people, competent people,
said, `Well, let's just pick the vice president. Don't worry, we'll
dump him once we get elected.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words,'' he added, ``use the person just for the
election vehicle. I'm not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a choice that does not appear to be baldly political _
unlike picking Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania so he could deliver
his state's 23 electoral votes _ may have more appeal among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may be moving toward a less flashy choice because there are
only so many flashy possibilities. Several of his advisers agreed
that there was only one true marquee candidate who would bring
added value to the ticket _ Colin Powell _ and that Bush would snap
him up if he thought Powell was interested.
</P>
<P>
   Many advisers said McCain would also enliven the ticket, but
that Bush questioned how well he would tolerate McCain in the White
House. Some Bush advisers also said the governor would cringe at
the perception that he was forced to turn to McCain to assure him a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain would add the most oomph to the ticket,'' said Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican pollster, agreed, saying
McCain accomplished something few other Republicans have: ``He is
such an incredible choice that he's even had people in Hollywood
give him money.'' But she said ``an unexciting choice'' like
Keating or Cheney would be safe because ``we know in the end people
decide whom to vote for based on the top of the ticket rather than
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be, of course, that Bush is using the speculation over
Cheney as a distraction while he readies his true decision, and has
a colossal surprise in mind. Maybe (with help from his father) he
can persuade Powell after all. Maybe there is even a mystery
selection.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Kemp suggested that even Powell might not be so
perfect. ``The fact that he doesn't want it,'' he said, ``makes
them want him even more.''
 &UR;  &LR; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Powell aside, for every prospect, the upsides seem to cancel out
the downsides.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush picked Cheney, he would win plaudits from Republicans
who think Cheney would bring dignity and weight to the ticket. And
while he has a solidly conservative voting record in Congress,
Cheney has always worked well with moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big leaguer,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who
has pressed for Cheney for weeks. ``No one would say, `I can't see
this guy as president.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others warned that Cheney, 59, is from a small state, Wyoming,
that is already safe bet for Bush to win. And, they said, he is
risky because of his health: He has had three heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   If he picks Keating, Bush would win raves from Republicans who
admire Keating's handling of the Oklahoma City bombing and his
credentials as a former prosecutor. Another plus is that he is
Roman Catholic, and Bush has been trying to reassure Catholics
after opponents suggested he was anti-Catholic. Others warn that he
is from a small state that is already solidly Republican and that
his conservative background would not broaden the ticket's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of McCain would energize moderates and
independents. But many conservatives warn that they would not abide
such a selection _ and would openly denounce McCain when the
Republican convention opens in Philadelphia in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of problems,'' said David Keene, chairman of
the American Conservative Union. ``A lot of conservatives would be
very upset. It's hard to see him as a loyal team player who would
not be trying to upstage everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There are pros and cons to the other prospects. Ridge, for one,
has a riveting rags-to-respectability biography and comes from a
battleground state. But some conservatives would deride his
abortion rights stand. Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska has a
compelling military history and he has the foreign policy expertise
that Bush lacks. But he is relatively green in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki hails from a big state, but not even his own advisers
predict that he could deliver it to the Republicans. Another
factor, seemingly trivial, is that Pataki is about a half-foot
taller than Bush, and nominees never like being overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, who would bring
vitality and a knowledge of Congress. But he has what some Bush
advisers say is the Quayle problem: he exudes youthfulness _ and
seems to lack gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   One who has star quality is Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He
was a movie actor, after all. But some Bush advisers express
concern that as a single man, Thompson would not project the
appropriate family image.
</P>
<P>
   The new imperatives for a running mate have made the selection
process complicated, if not confounding. Bush, and Gore, face often
conflicting pressures: They want running mates who can be both be
effective on the stump and in governing. They want someone who can
excite party loyalists but also attract independents.
</P>
<P>
   They want drama. But they have to be mindful that reaching for
the spectacular can be like a blind date with history. The result
can be fresh and intoxicating _ like Gore eight years ago _ or
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   When Mondale picked Ferraro, he thought she would be an instant
draw for women. He was wrong. Four years later, the elder Bush
thought voters would find Quayle fresh and exciting. They did not,
but the ticket won anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Quayle did carry shock value. He was so little
known, even by Bush's own aides, that in New Orleans, the site of
the convention, they busily photocopied his biography in the
Almanac of American Politics so they could find out just who he
was.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said their candidate has learned from his father's
experience that he need not be fixated on springing a surprise
(though he does like surprises) and that, more important, the
campaign has to be well prepared before announcing the choice. Bush
also learned a lesson from watching his father serve as Ronald
Reagan's No. 2 for eight years: He wants someone who is as loyal to
him as his father was to Reagan, but who also offers sound advice _
and does not stir the pot.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be so much simpler _ and swifter. In 1976, President
Gerald Ford began his deliberations in earnest only hours before
his No. 2 was announced. ``The meeting to decide on the nominee
didn't begin until 3:15 a.m.,'' Ford wrote in his memoirs, ``A Time
to Heal.'' Among those in the room was his chief of staff who would
resurface decades later in vice presidential politics: Dick Cheney.

President Clinton Saturday shaved short his meetings here to plunge
back into the fervid search for a historic peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrived in Japan a day late from the Camp David
meeting with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians, has
received several briefings daily on their continuing talks with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, administration officials
said. They said Clinton heeded advice from aides, however, to avoid
making calls from Japan to either Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel or the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The president will depart from Okinawa half a day early, after
meeting Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain on Sunday morning, to
rejoin the Camp David talks Sunday evening, Eastern time, said the
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is attending his last summit meeting with the
leaders of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan and
Russia, spent his day in meetings with those men. American
diplomats said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, making his
debut on the international diplomatic stage, had impressed the
group, displaying alacrity and a lack of the ebullience often
associated with his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   With no history to be made thousands of miles from Camp David
and no crises to distract them, the leaders aired issues that
traditionally have taken a secondary place at the annual gathering,
and issued a declaration focusing on the importance of getting the
developing world hooked up to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said that in discussions that often resembled
philosophical discourses the leaders also pondered the human
genome, infectious diseases and rain forests, reaching common
ground that will be reflected in a joint statement to be released
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to previous summits meetings, overshadowed by crises
like fighting in the Balkans or the financial crisis in Asia,
``there was not one major problem we needed to address,'' said
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Therefore, he added, ``you
will see a list of subjects addressed in the communique.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Okinawa, I would say, is shaping up as the development
summit,'' said Lael Brainard, Clinton's adviser on international
economic issues. ``Often the summits get overwhelmed by outside
events. This year, what has been notable is a very disciplined
focus on the development agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders' new-found concern with what has become known as the
``digital divide'' _ between those who are part of the new
computer-driven economy and those who are not _ found little
sympathy from critics in nongovernmental groups that seek less
sophisticated aid to the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Activists with Jubilee 2000, an organization pushing for debt
relief, burned a laptop computer outside the news media center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't eat computers,'' said Kewesi Owusu, the group's
African coordinator. ``People are dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Seth Amgot, a spokesman for Oxfam, the British charity with
extensive operations in the poor countries of the world, said,
``The Internet is going to have to wait until the electricity grid
is extended, the phone grid is extended and more kids learn to
read. The private sector is handling this computer revolution
pretty well on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders said they would create what they called a ``dot
force'' _ or digital opportunity task force _ to marshal public and
private resources to bring the computer revolution to poorer
nations. The force is supposed to report to next year's gathering
of the leaders, to be held in Genoa, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders cited statistics showing that of the estimated 332
million people who use the Internet, fewer than 1 percent live in
Africa. Part of the problem is just telephone lines. The developed
world has about 50 phone lines per 100 people compared to 1.4
phones in low-income countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone, everywhere should be enabled to participate in and
no one should be excluded from the benefits of the global
information society,'' the leaders agreed in their statement. ``The
resilience of this society depends on democratic values that foster
human development such as the free flow of information and
knowledge, mutual tolerance, and respect for diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also agreed in principle to revive World Trade
Organization negotiations on the launching of another round of
global trade talks by the end of this year. However, they remained
at odds throughout the day on the details of the next round.
Disagreements over that round _ principally between the United
States and Europe, but also between the developed world and poorer
nations _ proved so divisive at the world trade meeting in Seattle
last year that it collapsed in discord.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders here also discussed the importance of good health to
a functioning economy and vowed to aid the developing world in
combating infectious diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and
malaria. Japan led the way with a $3 billion fund to fight diseases
in poor countries, along with a $15 billion aid package aimed at
helping countries take advantage of the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said that Putin _ whose own country, Russia, has
spotty Internet access and telephone service _ came up with a
suggestion in the computer arena that quickly won the backing of
his colleagues. He suggested that the leaders themselves remain in
contact in between their annual summit meetings by electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said Putin represented a remarkable
contrast with Yeltsin, who could be irascible at such gatherings.
</P>

<P>
   During a one-on-one meeting with Clinton, Putin gave up no
ground when the president scolded the Russian for not respecting
press freedom. But Putin brought smiles to the faces of the
American delegation when he told them about his visit to North
Korea, en route to Japan, and the striking similarities with the
Soviet Union of Stalinist times. North Korea's economic situation,
Putin reportedly said, reminded him of the former Soviet Union in
the 1950s. Putin said 1 million North Koreans turned out to see
him, noting that some of them probably did not volunteer to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As with all such annual gatherings, most of the declarations
made and agreements reached came in the form of general commitments
with no dollar figures attached. Blair had sought to round up funds
from the group to relieve the debt of impoverished nations but, in
Sunday's statement, the leaders will instead restate their
intention to carry out an agreement they reached at their summit
meeting last year in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the senior statesman among the group, was ending his
eighth and final such meeting of industrialized nations. When he
started, the group was the Group of 7. Inviting Russia was a
measure of the rapport Clinton had with Yeltsin and of America's
anxiety to draw a newly democratic Russia into the global fold. At
the group photo, the president brought smiles to his colleagues
when he said: ``This is my last photo _ so be serious.''

<P>
   MALABO, Equatorial Guinea _ With no luck at all, the Spaniards
and then the French long searched for oil in the waters around this
tiny nation, half of which sits on the Central African mainland and
half on an island in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Then all of a sudden in 1996, after Spanish and French oilmen
had left, the Americans struck liquid gold. The discovery was so
unexpected that the State Department, in a cost-cutting measure,
had closed its embassy in Equatorial Guinea several weeks earlier
and begun handling relations with this economic backwater from its
embassy in neighboring Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy has yet to reopen, but U.S. investments here are now
estimated at nearly $5 billion. The figure would rank this obscure
nation fourth in U.S. investments in sub-Saharan Africa, behind
only more familiar places like South Africa and the two oil giants,
Nigeria and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said there was no interest and no possibility of finding
oil in Equatorial Guinea,'' Cristobal Manana Ela, the country's
minister of mines and energy, said of the earlier exploration
companies. ``But we were very optimistic about our geology. We knew
it was logical that if Nigeria was producing, Cameroon was
producing and Gabon was producing, here in Equatorial Guinea we
could be producing.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the capital, which is groaning under the weight of an
influx of foreigners, there is heady talk of Equatorial Guinea _
population 465,000 _ becoming a Kuwait of Africa. There is also an
acute awareness that the same term was applied decades ago to
countries like Gabon, which despite a small population and huge oil
reserves remains dependent on foreign aid because of mismanagement
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   So Equatorial Guinea stands at a crossroad: Significant oil
production started a couple of years ago, and it will be a couple
before the oil begins filling the government's coffers with piles
of cash unimaginable until now.
</P>
<P>
   People in Africa and the West will watch closely what the
government does with its money, as well as how the oil companies,
especially ExxonMobil, the main producer, operate here.
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny will certainly be greater than it has been
elsewhere because Equatorial Guinea's oil production comes at a
time when governments and human rights organizations in the West
have rallied around the reality that Africa's riches _ diamonds or
oil _ have seldom improved the lives of average Africans and often
enriched only corrupt African leaders and their Western partners.
Indeed, African oil has perhaps never been as politicized as it is
now, as suggested by the recent fierce debates surrounding the
World Bank's endorsement of a $3.7 billion pipeline between Chad
and Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Manana, who was accompanied by Gabriel Nguema
Lima, the secretary of state at the ministry of mines and energy
and a son of Equatorial Guinea's president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema
Mbasogo, said the government had already held a conference to
examine how and why its neighbors had squandered their oil dollars,
``to evaluate what to do not to have the same thing happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An international development official who has been in Equatorial
Guinea for three years said there had been some positive changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government and the country are much more open to the
outside than when I first arrived here,'' the official said. ``But
so far there have been few positive effects on the lives of
Equatorial Guineans. That has been the case for all of Central
Africa. A country's natural resources are regarded as the patrimony
of the head of state. We'll have to wait and see if things will be
different here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The outside interest will be a big change for Equatorial Guinea,
which long remained severely isolated for a number of reasons. Its
capital lies on an island connected to the mainland only by
irregular flights, most of them aboard rickety second-hand
Soviet-era planes. Its Spanish-speaking citizens are surrounded by
people who speak French or English.
</P>
<P>
   And then its first post-independence president, Francisco Macias
Nguema, ruled with a brutality comparable to that of tyrants like
Idi Amin of Uganda, driving a third of the population into exile,
but escaping the world's notice because of his country's geography.
He was overthrown in 1979 and then executed by a regime led by his
nephew, the current president, Obiang.
</P>
<P>
   Obiang cautiously opened up the country, building links to
France and French-speaking African nations. But there is still
little political openness here, and other legacies of the country's
long isolation survive. In Malabo, there is not a single newsstand
and foreign magazines like Time or the Paris-based Jeune Afrique,
found everywhere else on the continent, cannot be bought at all.
</P>
<P>
   The country's leaders would have probably continued ruling
quietly, unnoticed by the rest of the world, had it not been for
the oil found in 1996. In 1997, gross domestic product shot up 76
percent, according to the African Development Bank, and has kept
climbing by two digits since then. Today, ExxonMobil pumps 112,000
barrels a day. A new $560 million platform started production last
month, even as another U.S. company, Triton Energy, announced an
important find. Other U.S. companies are expected to arrive this
year to search in unexplored waters.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Keag, the director general here of CMS Energy, a Houston oil
company, described the oil companies' interest in Equatorial Guinea
as ``intense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unreasonable to imagine Equatorial Guinea producing
one barrel per person per day in a few years,'' Keag said, alluding
to production of half a million barrels a day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   CMS Energy, which pumps a modest 9,000 barrels a day, and two
other U.S. companies are building a $420 million methanol plant
here scheduled to be completed next year. As an indication of how
ill prepared Equatorial Guinea was for all this new investment, the
plant's builders have had to be completely self-sufficient. They
have built a camp to house about 800 foreign workers because of the
severe shortage of hotels and housing in Malabo; they have their
own electrical power and their own fresh water filter and sewage
treatment systems.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays, this city of Spanish colonial buildings now buzzes
with car and pedestrian traffic. It is nothing on the level of a
typical African capital but enough that every day recalls the
activity seen only on payday before the oil boom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More than anything the city buzzes with the intangible, the
promise of oil and its potential benefits. ``Bar Internet,'' said
the sign on a hole in the wall here with plenty to drink but not
one computer.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people in the government and the oil companies know
how much money Equatorial Guinea has earned so far from oil, and
neither side is saying. Manana, the mines and energy minister,
pointed instead to the improvements that the government has made in
the last two years in Malabo: the new paved roads and a new
electricity plant that provides reliable power for most residents
of Malabo, whose population has topped 50,000 since the oil boom
started. Before being the host for a conference of Central African
nations for the first time last year, the government built a
convention hall and 17 villas for visiting dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other developments the government shies away from
publicizing: the new presidential wing at the airport, a shiny
glass structure with a dozen parking spots that sits incongruously
on the side of a simple airport made up essentially of a runway and
a small building. A drive through the rich neighborhood known as
Little Spain shows construction workers busy on new villas _ houses
that pale in comparison with the villas of, say, Nigeria, but dwarf
the shanties in the slum of Newbuil across town.
</P>
<P>
   Newbuil, whose name is short for ``new building,'' il is a
sprawling collection of wobbly houses jammed together beside open
gutters. The neighborhood was created some four decades ago to
house mostly Nigerians who had come to work on Equatorial Guinea's
cocoa plantations. It enjoyed a certain seedy reputation _ to
describe someone as a ``Newbuil girl'' or ``Newbuil guy'' still
amounts to an insult understood by everyone in Malabo.
</P>
<P>
   Newbuil's dirt streets were muddy from the rains on a recent
Friday. Still, there were signs that the oil money had begun
trickling down. Antennas rose from aluminum roofs, above houses in
which there had been no television sets until a year or two ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no traffic lights before and now we have
electricity 24 hours a day,'' said Nicanor Obama, 22, who was
selling medication by the pill at the Botiquin drugstore in
Newbuil. ``It is a development that should accelerate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of a greater variety of goods at the main
market, especially second-hand clothes with ``Nike'' and ``Adidas''
tags from Europe, had taken away business from Emil Epee, a tailor.
Voicing a simmering resentment that most were still afraid to
express, Epee said: ``All I know is that I have to eat and it is
you who are eating our oil money. We are not eating any of this oil
money. The only money I eat is from my clothes. It's our oil, but
it's you Americans who are eating our oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether these feelings become more widespread will surely depend
on how wide the distance between Newbuil and Little Spain becomes.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the reforms have been mixed. Most people
acknowledge that years of severe repression have given way to
greater freedom. Soldiers do not harass ordinary people as openly
or frequently as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can walk freely,'' said Isabel Tonka, 25, who is a
member of the Bubi ethnic group, the indigenous people of this
island, which is now dominated by Bantu people from the mainland.
``It is not like before. I can go to my village and come back to
Malabo without hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   Raimundo Evemba Melenga, the director of a private publishing
group, and others recalled applying for a permit to start a
newspaper. The application languished for two years, Evemba said,
so they submitted an application for another newspaper. To their
surprise, both applications were approved by the government a
couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have published several times since then without any
government interference,'' Evemba said of the two newspapers,
Tiempo and La Opinion, which locals and foreigners in Malabo said
have been sharply critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of opposition parties said that in other ways the
government's control had grown tighter. Before oil was discovered,
the government often yielded to foreign pressure to allow some
degree of political openness, said Placido Miko Abogo, the
secretary general of the Convergence for Social Democracy party and
the country's best-known opponent of the prevailing political
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they have money, they don't care what the outside
thinks,'' Miko said. ``Oil has made them more arrogant, more
intolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   The government argues that municipal elections last month, won
overwhelmingly by the president's party, were free and fair.
Foreign observers agreed, but pointed out there was no real
political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Truly independent parties boycotted the election. Miko said
others were bought by the ruling party. ``There's a lot of oil
money that the government can use simply to buy people off now,''
Miko said. ``It's a new strategy, but the end is the same. We are
returning to a situation with only one political party.''

   NAGO, Japan _ Turning from what has become an annual ritual _
the gathering of leaders of the largest industrialized nations _
President Clinton Saturday shaved short his meetings here to plunge
back into the fervid search for a historic peace in the Middle
East.
</P>

   Clinton, who arrived in Japan a day late from the Camp David

MIDEAST NEGOTIATORS AT CAMP DAVID AWAITING CLINTON'S RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ The peace teams at the Camp David summit meeting
moved into a waiting-for-President-Clinton mode Saturday as the
Jewish Sabbath imposed an informal day of small group discussions.
</P>
<P>
   American officials, who have honored a news blackout, did not
even divulge the daily schedule or menu Saturday. It remained
unclear whether progress has been made in Clinton's absence, or
whether he will return to face the same key dispute over
Jerusalem's sovereignty and whether that dispute still holds the
power to shut down the open-ended summit meeting without any
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, indirectly
through confidants, and Clinton, directly to reporters, both
expressed hope that the meeting could produce an agreement, which
suggested that the impasse had been broken.
</P>
<P>
   But from Egypt, a spokesman for President Hosni Mubarak, whom
all three leaders have consulted during their days here, said that
the situation inside had deteriorated since Clinton's departure,
with the Israelis demonstrating inflexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wait until Clinton comes back,'' Maged Abdel Fattah, the
spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Fattah said that he was not sure if the Egyptian president
had played a role in extending the meeting, which was pronounced
dead and then reborn within the space of an hour and a half late
Wednesday night. Mubarak had been asked to help and he was trying,
the spokesman said. In his phone call with Clinton on Wednesday,
the conversation focused on Jerusalem and specifically ``on ways
and means to convince Chairman Arafat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But President Mubarak stressed that Jerusalem is the core
issue in this whole conference,'' Abdel Fattah said. ``The issues
of refugees and the percentage of land are issues that, with some
compromise, will fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have reportedly softened their position to consider
extending limited or joint sovereignty to the Palestinians in some
Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem, while leaving the status quo
frozen in the walled Old City, home to Christians, Muslims, Jews
and holy sites for all three monotheistic faiths.
</P>
<P>
   But Arafat has insisted repeatedly that he does not have a
mandate from the Arab world to do anything less than regain
sovereignty over all of East Jerusalem, which was lost to Israel
during the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have full trust in Arafat's judgment,'' Abdel Fattah
said. ``We don't cast any doubt on his handling of Jerusalem and
the holy places. Most _ well maybe you can exclude some like in
Iran _ believe this.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stakes were high on Feb. 2, 1998, when Zenith
Goldline Pharmaceuticals and Abbott Laboratories squared off here
in patent court. For three years, the companies had been fighting
about whether Zenith could market a generic version of Hytrin,
Abbott's $500-million-a-year drug for high blood pressure and
prostate enlargement. Now a federal appeals judge would hear them
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott makes a million dollars a day for every day it keeps us
off the market,'' Bill Mentlik, Zenith's lawyer, argued in court.
Without a cheaper generic, he warned, ``the public is losing.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument, though, would soon give way to more businesslike
concerns. When the courtroom oratory ended, the two sides headed to
the elegant Hay-Adams Hotel, a block from the White House, for a
private lunch.
</P>
<P>
   After small talk about the weather and golf, Zenith's lawyers
proposed an end to the legal wrangles: They could become partners
in an introduction of a generic drug. Abbott's lawyer, Kenneth
Greisman, declined, court records show. His company, he said,
preferred ``a straight numbers deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was sealed on March 31, 1998: Abbott would pay Zenith
as much as $2 million a month not to produce its generic, up to a
maximum of $42 million. The next day, Abbott agreed to pay another
rival, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, even more: $4.5 million a month, as
much as $101 million over the life of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was not until August 1999 _ when Geneva and Abbott,
facing an antitrust investigation, scuttled their agreement _ that
Hytrin's generic equivalent, terazosin, finally made its market
debut.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what Congress envisioned in 1984 when it passed a
law intended to keep drug prices down by speeding up the entry of
generic drugs. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term
Restoration Act was intended to foster competition between brand
and generic companies, and it has. It was not supposed to prompt
rivals to join hands in keeping drugs off the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law has been turned on its head,'' said one of its
authors, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. Referring to Hytrin, he said,
``We were trying to encourage more generics and through different
business arrangements, the reverse has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was intended to help people like Ewald Grosskrueger, an
80-year-old retired barn builder from rural Wisconsin. By the time
the generic version of Hytrin became available, he had been taking
the brand-name treatment for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   At $52 a month _ the generic version costs $23 _ Hytrin is
hardly the most expensive prescription drug on the market. But it
was the most expensive in Grosskrueger's medicine cabinet. He and
his 81-year-old wife, Lavera, take six prescription drugs between
them, and they are among nearly one-third of elderly Americans who
have no insurance to cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Grosskruegers make ends meet the way sturdy, old-fashioned
farm couples always have: by growing their own fruits and
vegetables, burning wood for fuel in the winter, clipping grocery
coupons. Even after a stroke, Grosskrueger still mows the lawn
twice a week. ``The medication is so very expensive,'' Mrs.
Grosskrueger said. ``It's a problem, being on a retirement
income.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grosskruegers, now plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Abbott,
had little idea of the company's behind-the-scenes negotiations.
But the deals Abbott struck are hardly unique. Rather, they are
part of an increasingly aggressive effort by the industry to fend
off one of its biggest threats: competition from generics, which in
the next five years could eat away at tens of billions of dollars
in sales from brand drugs whose patents are about to expire.
</P>
<P>
   To shed light on this trend, The New York Times examined
hundreds of pages of court records and other public documents in
Washington and various states, and interviewed regulators and drug
company executives, with a particular focus on Hytrin. The review
showed how efforts to extend a profitable drug's monopoly, as much
as the pursuit of scientific discoveries, drive decisions in one of
the world's most lucrative, and secretive, industries.
</P>
<P>
   The Hytrin deal has spawned 13 private antitrust lawsuits
against Abbott, including the Grosskruegers' and others filed by
health maintenance organizations, pharmacies and drug wholesalers.
Company officials, citing the suits, declined to be interviewed.
But records show Abbott worked hard to beat back Hytrin generics.
</P>
<P>
   It filed numerous additional patents on the drug's key
ingredient, terazosin. It improperly listed a Hytrin patent in the
Food and Drug Administration's registry, according to a federal
appeals court; the move would have extended Hytrin's patent life
had the court not ordered the patent struck from the registry.
Abbott also filed lawsuits against five generic drug manufacturers,
and countersued a sixth.
</P>
<P>
   No judge ever ruled in Abbott's favor, but the maneuvering kept
the company's monopoly on Hytrin alive for four years after a
patent on the key ingredient ran out. During that time, Abbott's
Hytrin revenues totaled roughly $2 billion _ most of it pure
profit.
</P>
<P>
   The legal fight to protect Hytrin culminated with the 1998 cash
payments. No one knows how many similar deals between drug makers
and their generic rivals exist; experts say most are kept
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   But other agreements have recently come to light through
government investigations and private lawsuits; they involve
tamoxifen, the breast cancer drug; Cardizem CD, a heart medication;
K-Dur, a potassium supplement; and Cipro, an antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   And these deals, like the Hytrin case, are causing consternation
among judges and regulators, legislators like Waxman and Vice
President Al Gore, who said in a recent interview that such
agreements ``perpetrate a fraud on the American people by denying
them the benefits of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is taking a hard look; in March, it
accused Abbott and Geneva (but not Zenith) of violating antitrust
laws. The companies defend their agreement as proper, but signed a
settlement with the FTC agreeing not to make any other similar
deals. The settlement was the first of its kind for the FTC; the
agency warned that companies might not be treated so lightly in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal judge declared the Cardizem agreement an
illegal restraint of trade; in that case, a brand company, Hoechst
Marion Roussel, paid a generic competitor, Andrx Pharmaceuticals,
$90 million not to market a generic alternative. The companies have
denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is also stepping in. The agency, concerned that deals
like the one covering Hytrin may be costing the public millions of
dollars in higher drug prices, is pressing for new rules to
discourage them _ rules that trade groups for both brand and
generic drug makers oppose.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   These regulatory moves come in the middle of one of the election
season's most closely watched debates: the dispute in Congress
about whether to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats are bickering over the size and shape
of the benefit, which might cost taxpayers more than $200 billion
in the next decade, but both sides assume generics will save money.
Yet little attention has been paid to how delays in generic
competition are driving up drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generics have saved the American consumer billions and
billions of dollars,'' said Roger L. Williams, who once ran the
FDA's office of generic drugs and is now chief executive of the
U.S. Pharmacopeia, a nonprofit standard-setting organization. ``In
an era of soaring costs, and perhaps a prescription drug benefit
for Medicare, you are going to have to have good generics or else
your system will sink.''
</P>
<P>
   A Well-Timed Creation
</P>
<P>
   The invention of Hytrin, roughly 20 years ago, could not have
come at a better time for Abbott Laboratories, a company with $13
billion in sales _ nearly $4 billion coming from its prescription
drugs division _ that is among the most profitable in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott has long prided itself on research and development,
dating to the days of the company's founder, Dr. Wallace C. Abbott,
who tinkered with pill-making in his apartment on Chicago's North
Side a century ago. But by the early 1980s, when Abbott sought FDA
approval to sell Hytrin to treat high blood pressure, the company
was at a tail end of a long dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing new had come out of Abbott pharmaceutical research in
over 20 years, until Hytrin came along,'' said Nelson Levy, then
the company's director of research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Hytrin itself was hardly a breakthrough. Levy said Abbott's
chemists ``basically knocked off'' an existing hypertension
medicine, changing a few molecules to turn prazosin, a Pfizer drug,
into terazosin, a patentable compound that would later take the
brand name Hytrin. Hytrin did, however, have a therapeutic
advantage: It was given only once a day, while prazosin had to be
taken twice.
</P>
<P>
   In the drug business, such ``copycats'' are not uncommon. The
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association of America,
the industry trade group, argues that its members spend, on
average, $500 million on research for every new drug _ thus
justifying their prices.
</P>
<P>
   But many of today's medicines are, in industry parlance,
``me-too'' drugs. In 1997, according to the Boston Consulting
Group, which provides advice to the industry, 42 of the 100
top-selling medicines were me-too drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the differences between the Abbott and Pfizer drugs were
significant enough for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to
issue a series of patents on terazosin, the first on May 31, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   When terazosin was invented, patents lasted for 17 years from
the date they were awarded; under current federal law, the term is
20 years from the date the application is filed. Then and now,
though, the challenge for the drug industry is to maximize the time
its commercial product is protected by a patent.
</P>
<P>
   That would become a problem for Abbott. The FDA did not approve
Hytrin for high blood pressure until 1987, 10 years into the life
of the original terazosin patent. And it was not until 1993 that
the agency gave Abbott permission to market Hytrin for its most
lucrative purpose, the treatment of enlarged prostate, a condition
that affects at least half of all men older than 60.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Hytrin had become a huge hit; the drug generated annual
sales of more than $500 million, accounting for a fifth of Abbott's
drug revenue. But a key patent for terazosin was due to expire that
year, and generics were already lining up to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, though, was prepared. The company had already filed
requests for six so-called secondary patents on its compound,
covering particular crystalline forms of the drug, its
manufacturing method and a special formula to release the
medication in a steady, time-delayed dose.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to lay the groundwork for future patent
infringement lawsuits against generic companies _ suits that could
keep rivals off the market, or at least delay them.
</P>
<P>
   In this, Abbott was hardly alone. Most drug makers would react
the same way, said Alex Zisson, an analyst with Chase H&AMP;Q; some
have gone so far as to patent the color of the pill, or the shape
of the bottle the drug comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big drug companies are becoming much more aggressive in trying
to use secondary patents to delay generics,'' Zisson said.
``They're patenting everything they can think of, just because the
stakes are so high.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bid to Unleash Competition
</P>
<P>
   Just two decades ago, companies like Abbott rarely had to worry
about generic competition. That changed in 1984, when Congress
passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, now known as Hatch-Waxman after its sponsors,
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Waxman, was a balancing act. It came
on the heels of a failed attempt by the pharmaceutical industry to
persuade Congress to extend the patent life of brand-name drugs.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the law gave the brand companies the patent
extensions they coveted _ a move that would, in essence, delay
generic competition. On the other hand, it eased the regulatory
burden on the generics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of running costly clinical trials to prove their drugs'
effectiveness, generic companies would now only have to prove
``bioequivalence,'' that is, that their drugs contained the same
key ingredients as the brand, and worked the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The law also offered the generics a bounty: a 180-day
competition-free period _ in essence, a six-month monopoly _ for
the first generic-drug maker to seek approval for a particular
medicine. For a small generic company, that could mean big dollars.
When Geneva finally began selling terazosin, court records show, it
earned as much as $11 million a month from the drug, a tidy sum for
a company whose total sales in 1997 were about $25 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the law rewarded the brand companies by giving
them patent extensions of up to five years. And there was another,
little-noticed benefit for the brands that would also push back the
clock on generic competition: Once a generic company had requested
FDA approval, the brand company could sue for patent infringement,
and the FDA was prohibited from making a decision for 30 months
while the courts weighed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   When the law took effect, the generic industry took off,
flooding the FDA with approval requests: 800 applications in the
first seven months. Then the lawsuits began.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the center of some of the earliest skirmishes was Albert B.
Engelberg, a lawyer and lobbyist who helped write Hatch-Waxman and
represented generics manufacturers. In 1988, in one of his first
cases, he hit the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved a popular muscle relaxant, Flexeril, by Merck
&AMP; Co. Engelberg recalled that a judge ruled in his favor, enabling
his client, a division of Schein Pharmaceuticals, to sell a
generic. His fee, a cut of the profits, was $75 million. It was an
``unexpected bonanza,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victory changed the legal dynamic surrounding Hatch-Waxman,
Engelberg said. Not long after, he said, a brand-name drug company
offered to settle a case by giving his client cash payments to stay
off the market, a tactic similar to the one Abbott would later try
with Hytrin. The settlement was kept secret, and Engelberg would
not disclose details. But he said the concept caught him by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me that you could settle a case by paying
one of your opponents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch-Waxman, he said, was supposed to give generic companies an
incentive to compete, not to take money in exchange for not
competing. ``It's the evolution,'' he complained, ``of greed vs.
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, a decade later, such deals are only starting to come to
light. In March, protracted delays in marketing a cheaper
alternative for tamoxifen, the breast cancer drug made by
AstraZeneca, prompted sharp criticism from U.S. District Judge
Ricardo M. Urbina for the District of Columbia, who said he found
the situation absurd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hatch-Waxman,'' Urbina wrote, ``intended to provide an
incentive for drug companies to explore new drugs, not a market
`windfall' for crafty, albeit industrious market players.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations of Big Sales
</P>
<P>
   Like Abbott, Geneva was stuck in a dry spell when it sought FDA
permission to market its generic version of terazosin. The company,
based in Broomfield, Colo., at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, had
not introduced a significant new product in years. Hytrin, said
Charles T. Lay, the company's former president and chief executive,
looked like a good bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a $500 million seller,'' Lay said in a recent
interview. ``That was certainly attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   With 800 employees, Geneva is a relatively small company. But it
has a big parent: Novartis AG, the Swiss health and agricultural
conglomerate, a company nearly twice the size of Abbott. A number
of brand-name drug makers have entered the generic business, only
to abandon it later. Not so Novartis. Lay said the parent company's
secret was simple: ``They pretty much left us alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Terazosin would prove an exception to that rule.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva set its sights on a Hytrin alternative as early as 1990,
court records show. On Jan. 12, 1993, the company became the first
generic maker to file with the FDA, angling for the coveted
six-month period of exclusivity, according to the terms of
Hatch-Waxman. Eighteen months later, Zenith Goldline
Pharmaceuticals filed similar plans. Eventually four other
companies would do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott responded as the drafters of Hatch-Waxman envisioned: it
sued. But for all its litigiousness, the big drug company made a
crucial misstep. In filing patent infringement claims against
Geneva, Abbott's in-house lawyers sought to block only a tablet
version of Hytrin, neglecting the generic maker's plans for a
terazosin capsule, the most popular form of Hytrin.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Abbott's outside counsel, Jeffrey I. Weinberger, would be
called upon to explain the omission to U.S. District Judge Patricia
Seitz in Miami. It was, he said, ``a botch-up'' that the company
did not discover until two years later, when Geneva received FDA
approval for terazosin.
</P>
<P>
   The omission was important because it meant Geneva would not be
tied up in litigation about the capsule when the FDA decided. But
it did not leave Geneva completely free of legal liability; Abbott
could still sue for patent infringement once the generic capsules
came to market.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1998, according to Lay, the former Geneva president,
and FTC documents, Geneva was going ahead with plans to make and
market a generic Hytrin. On Feb. 2 of that year _ the same day
lawyers for Zenith and Abbott met for lunch at the Hay-Adams in
Washington _ those plans were on the agenda at Geneva's board
meeting in Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Lay was gung-ho. He wanted to introduce the generic as soon as
the FDA granted approval. ``I was convinced,'' he said, ``that we
had as strong a case as you could want, and that we would not lose
in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   But the board's new chairman, Jerry Karabelas, the head of the
pharmaceutical sector for Novartis, took a different view.
Karabelas was new at Novartis; he had arrived just six weeks
before. As an experienced American drug executive, he said, he
believed that marketing the terazosin capsules was risky.
</P>
<P>
   With Abbott still suing Geneva over the tablet, Karabelas
worried that a loss in court could throw its subsidiary, Geneva,
into a financial tailspin, costing $100 million or more _ money
that, in the end, Novartis might have had to pay. ``Nobody,'' he
said, ``can absorb that kind of loss.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Karabelas prevailed. ``I was overruled,'' Lay said.
</P>
<P>
   An Alternative to Selling
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, 1998, Geneva got what it wanted: FDA approval.
While the lawsuits about the tablet were continuing, the 30-month
waiting period required by Hatch-Waxman had expired, clearing the
way for the agency to make a decision. Geneva, being first in line,
was well positioned to go to market. But, records show, company
officials responded not by shipping the drug, but by calling Abbott
that same day, to inform their counterparts of their intention to
go to market _ unless they were paid not to.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah McIntyre, Geneva's general counsel, placed the call to
Greisman, a senior lawyer for Abbott. Greisman, through an Abbott
spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed. McIntyre declined to
discuss details, except to say what he has since said in court: The
demand was a bluff, as Geneva was not yet ready to go to market,
because of technical problems manufacturing the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Bluff or not, FTC documents and court records, including
Greisman's notes of the conversations, show the nitty-gritty
calculations that both sides relied on during two days of phone
discussions between the two lawyers and other company executives.
</P>
<P>
   Greisman was a day away from closing his ``straight numbers
deal'' in which Abbott would pay the other generic rival, Zenith
Goldline, as much as $2 million a month not to market its version
of terazosin. In that deal, Zenith would settle its lawsuit with
Abbott by agreeing not to contest the validity of the Hytrin
patent. But the settlement would let Zenith enter the market for
terazosin if another generic did.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that, Greisman was inclined to listen to Geneva's pitch,
because Geneva held the rights to 180-day exclusivity. Thus, Geneva
could block other generics, including Zenith, from coming to market
simply by not introducing its own product.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for the first time, Greisman was learning that his and
Abbott's negotiating position was even weaker than he had thought,
because Abbott had neglected to sue over the terazosin capsule. It
was ``a total surprise and shock,'' Abbott's outside lawyer,
Weinberger, would later say in court, explaining that the company
was willing to pay because Geneva had such powerful negotiating
leverage.
</P>
<P>
   For both companies, the negotiations hinged on the bottom line:
How much would Geneva lose if it stayed out of the terazosin
market, and how much would Abbott lose if Geneva entered?
</P>
<P>
   Generic competition would drastically reduce Hytrin's profits. A
recent study of 30 top-selling drugs in the last decade found that
generic competition would eventually reduce their prices by 60
percent to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is consistent with Abbott's internal projections about
Hytrin; the company forecast losing 70 percent of its market to
generics, or $185 million, in just six months.
</P>
<P>
   Geneva, meanwhile, regarded terazosin as its own blockbuster,
forecasting $84 million in profits before taxes from the drug
during the first year of sales.
</P>
<P>
   So when the talks began that day, March 30, 1998, Geneva threw
out an opening bid: $7 million a month. Too high, Abbott said. It
had its own projections of Geneva's earnings, suggesting that the
company would bring in no more than $1.5 million a month from
terasozin, because Geneva would not always have the generic market
to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Arthur Higgins, the president of Abbott's
pharmaceuticals products division, was prepared to be generous.
When negotiations resumed the next day, March 31, he told Geneva
officials that Abbott was willing to pay ``a premium in the range
of $2 million to $3 million a month.''
</P>
<P>
   That offer would later raise the eyebrows of federal antitrust
investigators, who viewed the large payments as evidence of
restraint of trade. ``It certainly bore no relationship to the
money that Geneva could have made if they entered the market,'' the
FTC chairman, Robert J. Pitofsky, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   For the next several hours, the two companies haggled over the
monthly fee. At 1:45 p.m., Chicago time, they settled on $4.5
million. ``4.5 works!'' Greisman wrote in his notes.
</P>
<P>
   The courts were never told; there was no need for it, because
Geneva, unlike Zenith, was not settling its case. Under terms of
the deal, Abbott would pay Geneva until the Supreme Court reached a
decision in the Hytrin case, or February 2000, when a Hytrin patent
was to expire _ whichever came sooner.
</P>
<P>
   During the life of the contract, Abbott's payments to Geneva
would exceed $101 million. If Geneva won the suit, its right to
come to market would be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, Karabelas, the Novartis official who beat back
Lay's efforts to go to market, learned of the deal, and sent Lay a
congratulatory note. Lay himself was apparently satisfied. When the
deal was signed, according to the FTC, he proclaimed it ``the best
of all worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was delighted. On April 1, 1998, Abbott put out a
release on both deals, announcing ``agreements on Hytrin patent
litigation,'' but omitting details. The news lifted Abbott's stock
by about 5 percent, and prompted several analysts to issue ``buy''
recommendations for Abbott shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite being off patent since 1995, Hytrin ($519 million in
1997 U.S. sales) continues to enjoy market exclusivity through
successful litigation,'' Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, the precursor to Chase
H &AMP; Q, told investors in a report written by Zisson, a week after
Abbott's announcement. It added that ``two settlements last week
hold the two leading contenders at bay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Effect of a High Price
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Wall Street was bad news on Main Street, where
customers without health insurance were paying full freight for
Hytrin. Among them were Ewald and Lavera Grosskrueger.
</P>
<P>
   For all but one of their 54 married years, the Grosskruegers
have lived in the same house in Loganville, Wis., a picturesque
town of 228 people and countless big red barns, a bank, a gas
station, a cafe and no stoplight. The nearest pharmacy is 12 miles
away in Reedsburg, but until June 1998, the Grosskruegers had
little need for it.
</P>
<P>
   A car accident changed that. The Grosskruegers' Buick was hit
broadside; Ewald Grosskrueger apparently suffered a slight heart
attack. He spent a week in the hospital, where doctors had trouble
keeping his blood pressure under control. They prescribed Hytrin;
Grosskrueger was familiar with it, having taken the bright red
capsules once before to treat an enlarged prostate.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Grosskrueger's health began to slide, culminating in a
stroke that October. Today, husband and wife both require pills to
regulate their blood sugar. He takes a blood thinner, and medicine
for gout.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the drugs, Hytrin cost the most, slightly less than $60 a
month at the Reedsburg pharmacy. The price is a bit more than some
city drugstores charge, which is typical, according to a recent
White House report that found that rural Americans often pay the
most for their prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Neither destitute nor wealthy, the Grosskruegers are, like many
elderly Americans, getting by with what they have. Their income is
fixed at $1,261 a month in Social Security payments and a small
pension from Lavera Grosskrueger's 18-year career as a cook at the
local elementary school. Of that, more than a tenth, $148, goes
toward prescription medicines. It is an expense the couple has had
trouble absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   Help arrived in the form of Trish Vandre, a benefits specialist
for the Sauk County Commission on Aging. Like an old-style circuit
judge, Vandre travels the little towns of Wisconsin's dairy
country, working as a consumer advocate for the elderly. More often
than not these days, she said, the big problem is prescription drug
prices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, when Vandre was at the village hall in Loganville,
the Grosskruegers came out to meet her. She told them they might
qualify for help from the drug makers, which run patient assistance
programs for people who cannot afford their medicine. Typically,
companies provide the medication for a limited time, with patients
making a small co-payment to the pharmacist or no co-payment if the
drug is sent directly to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott runs such a program for Hytrin, but the Grosskruegers,
with their income of slightly over $15,000 a year, apparently
earned too much to qualify. Instead, Abbott enrolled them in a
rebate plan that offered patients who buy a one-month supply of
Hytrin a $10 check and a $10 certificate toward the next purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement irked Vandre. ``My client has to lay out the
upfront money, which infuriates me,'' she said. ``A $60 medication
and a $10 rebate is no great shakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The first check came in December 1998. By this time, Ewald
Grosskrueger had had his stroke, and the medicine bills were
mounting. His wife appreciated the assistance. ``Every little bit
helps,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until nearly a year later _ when Steve Meili, a
lawyer from the nearby city of Madison, alerted Vandre _ that the
Grosskruegers learned of Abbott's deals with its generic rivals.
Meili was considering a lawsuit; Vandre told the Grosskruegers to
get in touch if they were interested. The usually taciturn Lavera
Grosskrueger summed up their reaction with startling bluntness.
``We thought we got ripped off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meili now represents the Grosskruegers in their lawsuit against
Abbott and Geneva. The case, filed in October and seeking
certification as a class action, seeks damages for patients who
bought Hytrin when the generic was not available. It is pending
before Seitz in Miami, who is also considering other Hytrin-related
suits, filed mostly by pharmacies and drug wholesalers, some of
which have sued Geneva and Zenith as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Grosskruegers were not the only ones feeling the pinch. As
head of drug purchasing for the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in
Oakland, Calif., one of the country's largest health maintenance
organizations, Dale Kramer was counting on a Hytrin generic. Kaiser
doctors prescribe about 2 percent of all prescription drugs in the
United States; to stock its 300 pharmacies, the HMO buys $1.5
billion a year in medicines. So Kramer keeps tabs on when patents
expire and when copycats can hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, Kramer said, it was well known among health plan
managers that Geneva and Zenith Goldline had applied to the FDA to
sell terazosin. He called officials from both companies, as he
often does, and said that after those talks, he was ``pretty well
convinced that someone would have the product in '98.''
</P>
<P>
   So convinced, in fact, that when he submitted his 1998 budget to
state regulators, he projected $5 million in annual savings from a
generic Hytrin. The company, a nonprofit corporation, was held to
that budget, Kramer said. In the end, he said, such miscalculations
inevitably led to higher premiums for patients. Abbott, he
complained, took ``advantage of the situation'' to extend its
patents ``at the expense of individual consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cost of Doing Business
</P>
<P>
   In August 1999, Abbott lost its monopoly on Hytrin's market.
Geneva walked away from the deal, leaving $45 million on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Lay had already retired from Geneva. But, as he had predicted,
the courts had ruled in Geneva's favor. In September 1998, just six
months after their deal was signed, Geneva beat Abbott in federal
district court. In July 1999, an appeals court upheld that finding.
And there was another complication: The FTC was investigating.
</P>
<P>
   With the victories in the lower courts, Geneva could no longer
justify staying off the market. Now that the product was
commercially viable, Karabelas said, the company had an obligation
``to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Terazosin _ the long-awaited generic alternative to Hytrin _ hit
the marketplace on Aug. 13, 1999. That same day, Miles White, the
chief executive of Abbott, sent a note to his subordinates,
notifying them of the development.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott had made the costly mistake of not suing Geneva, and
incurred the losses in court, as well as the decision by a panel of
appeals judges to strike one of its patents from the FDA registry.
Even so, in White's view, all the company's legal maneuverings were
a smashing success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take this opportunity,'' White wrote, ``to
recognize the truly outstanding work of our legal team, which
successfully defended Hytrin's patent protection against challenges
for nearly four years. This has been one of the most important
contributions to Abbott's success in this decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Lay, not surprisingly, takes a different view. He is irritated
at the brand companies' penchant for filing what he calls
``facetious lawsuits,'' and said the litigation drives up the cost
of developing a generic drug from an average of $500,000 a decade
ago to over $5 million today. That, in turn, raises the price of
generics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the brand companies,'' Lay complained, ``throwing $10
million or $20 million in legal fees at a product is chicken feed,
so long as they can keep away generic competition.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ewald Grosskrueger, he switched to Geneva's generic
terazosin last September, a month after it came out. Vandre, the
patient benefits specialist, had called Abbott asking for another
$10 certificate. The rebate program for Hytrin, she was told, was
over.

OKINAWAN WOMEN FIGHTING FOR CHILD SUPPORT FROM U.S. SERVICEMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Ill.)   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GINOWAN, Japan _ Shortly after moving to this military town in
Okinawa two years ago, Etsuko Higashiyama, a 29-year-old secretary,
fell in love with a U.S. Marine from Arkansas. They dated for more
than a year, and when Higashiyama became pregnant, the couple
considered marriage, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Marine, who finished his tour of duty in Okinawa last
December, left without warning for the United States, leaving
Higashiyama to raise their daughter _ now 7 months old _ alone in a
country that is not always charitable to children of mixed
parentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last contact I had with him was by e-mail when I informed
him that I had given birth to a girl,'' Higashiyama said. ``He
didn't respond. I don't think he wanted to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there was little that Higashiyama or thousands
of other abandoned Okinawan women and children could do about this
predicament. U.S. servicemen left the island with no reprisals, and
there was no agreement in force between Japan and the United States
to make them pay child support.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Annette Eddie-Callagain has taken up the cause of the
Japanese women whose desperate faces, she said, came to haunt her
when she was a U.S. Air Force lawyer stationed in Okinawa 10 years
ago. Large numbers of women came to her for help in obtaining child
support from U.S. servicemen, but she had little recourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could do is write to the base commander, who, if he
chose to, would hunt down the serviceman and convince him to assume
his responsibilities,'' she said. ``But after a few months of
payments, the child support usually stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Eddie-Callagain returned to Okinawa and opened a
private law practice where she is waging her own private war on
deadbeat military dads.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she has filed cases on behalf of 50 Okinawan women,
including Higashiyama, who are seeking child support from men who
have returned to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Social service agencies and children's rights advocates estimate
that there are about 4,000 Okinawan children abandoned by U.S.
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Many single mothers have not heard from their husbands or
boyfriends for months, if not years, and cannot afford to raise
their children alone, the advocates said. In some cases, the women
face eviction because they lack rent money. Many of the women no
longer qualify for, nor can they afford to send their children to,
racially mixed military and Christian schools. So their children go
to Japanese schools, where they are often bullied and many drop
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine the physical and emotional trauma that these
Okinawan women and their children suffer when these United States
servicemen desert them,'' said Naomi Noiri, a professor of law at
the University of the Ryukus in Okinawa. ``They fall between the
cracks in our society because there are no legal or social
mechanisms in Japan or the United States to provide for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has signed reciprocal agreements with
countries like Germany, Sweden and Britain to enable the mother of
a child whose father has returned to his homeland to seek financial
support with the help of government authorities. But no such pact
exists with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 22,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in
Okinawa prefecture, and the local government estimates that about
200 Amerasian children are born in Okinawa annually.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, in the run-up to the annual meeting of the
world's largest industrialized nations in Okinawa, the Japanese
media have reported widely on the racial discrimination, poor
education and financial distress that many of these biracial
children endure in Japanese society. The news reports have
characterized the plight of the Amerasian children as yet another
example of the social ills caused by the many U.S. military bases
in Okinawa _ not exactly the tone the Japanese government was
seeking when it decided to hold the meeting here, putting one of
the country's poorest regions in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of a bilateral agreement with Japan regarding
child support, Eddie-Callagain is taking her clients' cases
directly to the child enforcement offices in each of the 50 state
governments in the United States. She is trying to convince states
where the deadbeat fathers reside to prosecute them in family
court.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie-Callagain said she won her first case in March 1999 when
Illinois began docking the wages of a former U.S. serviceman to
provide financial support for his two children in Okinawa.

DNA samples to establish paternity in the event that accused men
claim they are not the fathers.

<P>
   In addition to their battle for child support, Okinawan mothers
of Amerasian children are demanding better education, free of the
abuse the children often suffer in Japanese public schools, which
are notorious for bullying children who do not fit in.
</P>
<P>
   But the Japanese and U.S. governments have so far ignored the
mothers' pleas for better schooling. Two years ago, a group of
mothers took matters into their own hands and turned a rented
two-story house here into the country's first school for Amerasian
children.
</P>
<P>
   Midori Thayer, principal of the AmerAsian School in Okinawa,
said the fledgling institution provided a nurturing atmosphere
where children could learn in both English and Japanese, and did
not have to feel ashamed of their dual backgrounds. Her three
biracial children, whose father had abandoned them, were among the
first pupils. About 70 percent of the school's 40 students come
from single-parent homes.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a struggle keeping the school running. It receives
no support from the United States or Japan, and there are only a
few private donors. Parents often find the $250 monthly tuition a
bit steep. Thayer buys old textbooks at garage sales and begs
Japanese schools for old desks and other furniture. She is seeking
donations and financing from international aid organizations to
move the school to a larger building where she can accommodate
dozens of students on a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   For 12-year-old Arisa Garrison, who is of mixed race, attending
Tomishiro Elementary, a Japanese school here, was sheer torture.
Her classmates called her ``half'' _ a racial epithet _ and
ridiculed her because she did not speak English well, although she
looked American. Many Amerasian children speak poor English because
Japanese is the primary language at home.
</P>
<P>
   At the Japanese school, Arisa often found tacks in her shoes or
nasty notes that said she was stupid and should go back to America.
``I hated going there,'' she said of her two years at Tomishiro.
``I was bullied almost every day. I missed many days of school
because I was so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Since transferring to the Amerasian school three months ago,
Arisa has not missed a day and is inseparable from her new friend,
13-year-old Nicky Miyagi. ``She's easy for me to talk to because
she knows exactly how I feel,'' Arisa said. ``At my old school, I
felt like I was on a hostile planet.''

CLINTON CALLS TAX-CUT BILLS BY THE GOP ILL ADVISED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Saying that Republicans in Congress were treating
the projected federal budget surplus ``as if they'd won it in the
lottery,'' President Clinton on Saturday defended his promise to
veto the main tax cuts passed by the House and Senate, and he
called for bipartisan cooperation in setting the nation's fiscal
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, taped in Japan _ where he is
meeting with the leaders of the big industrial nations _ Clinton
said Republicans were rushing toward spending all of the projected
surplus outside of Social Security on tax cuts that would go
primarily to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   He said the drive for tax cuts was putting at risk the
government's opportunity to eliminate the national debt, failing to
address the needs of working people and undermining efforts to
shore up the Social Security and Medicare systems.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came at the end of two weeks in which Republicans
completed work on two major tax-cutting bills, one that would
reduce taxes for married couples and another that would repeal the
federal estate tax. Congress is still working on bills that would
expand tax-deductible contributions to retirement savings accounts
and roll back part of the tax on Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot sign one expensive tax break after another without
any coherent strategy for safeguarding our financial future,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans showed no inclination to back down.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., said Clinton did not understand that
the surplus came from tax revenues, and ought to be returned to the
people who earned it, the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   `` Clinton, we're asking you to put aside election-year politics
and help families live the American dream,'' Grams said in the
weekly Republican radio address. ``If you do your part and sign the
bills we have sent you to repeal the marriage penalty and death
tax, Americans can keep a little more of their hard-earned money,
for their families and their future.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stakes were high on Feb. 2, 1998, when Zenith
Goldline Pharmaceuticals and Abbott Laboratories squared off here
in patent court. For three years, the companies had been fighting
about whether Zenith could market a generic version of Hytrin,
Abbott's $500-million-a-year drug for high blood pressure and
prostate enlargement. Now a federal appeals judge would hear them
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott makes a million dollars a day for every day it keeps us
off the market,'' Bill Mentlik, Zenith's lawyer, argued in court.
Without a cheaper generic, he warned, ``the public is losing.''
</P>
<P>
   That argument, though, would soon give way to more businesslike
concerns. When the courtroom oratory ended, the two sides headed to
the elegant Hay-Adams Hotel, a block from the White House, for a
private lunch.
</P>
<P>
   After small talk about the weather and golf, Zenith's lawyers
proposed an end to the legal wrangles: They could become partners
in an introduction of a generic drug. Abbott's lawyer, Kenneth
Greisman, declined, court records show. His company, he said,
preferred ``a straight numbers deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was sealed on March 31, 1998: Abbott would pay Zenith
as much as $2 million a month not to produce its generic, up to a
maximum of $42 million. The next day, Abbott agreed to pay another
rival, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, even more: $4.5 million a month, as
much as $101 million over the life of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was not until August 1999 _ when Geneva and Abbott,
facing an antitrust investigation, scuttled their agreement _ that
Hytrin's generic equivalent, terazosin, finally made its market
debut.
</P>
<P>
   That is not what Congress envisioned in 1984 when it passed a
law intended to keep drug prices down by speeding up the entry of
generic drugs. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term
Restoration Act was intended to foster competition between brand
and generic companies, and it has. It was not supposed to prompt
rivals to join hands in keeping drugs off the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law has been turned on its head,'' said one of its
authors, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. Referring to Hytrin, he said,
``We were trying to encourage more generics and through different
business arrangements, the reverse has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The deals Abbott struck are hardly unique. Rather, they are part
of an increasingly aggressive effort by the industry to fend off
competition from generics, which in the next five years could eat
away at tens of billions of dollars in sales from brand drugs whose
patents are about to expire.
</P>
<P>
   To shed light on this trend, The New York Times examined
hundreds of pages of court records and other public documents in
Washington and various states, and interviewed regulators and drug
company executives, with a particular focus on Hytrin. The review
showed how efforts to extend a profitable drug's monopoly, as much
as the pursuit of scientific discoveries, drive decisions in one of
the world's most lucrative, and secretive, industries.
</P>
<P>
   The Hytrin deal has spawned 13 private antitrust lawsuits
against Abbott, by private citizens, health maintenance
organizations, pharmacies and drug wholesalers. Company officials,
citing the suits, declined to be interviewed. But records show
Abbott worked hard to beat back Hytrin generics.
</P>
<P>
   It filed numerous additional patents on the drug's key
ingredient, terazosin. It improperly listed a Hytrin patent in the
Food and Drug Administration's registry, according to a federal
appeals court; the move would have extended Hytrin's patent life
had the court not ordered the patent struck from the registry.
Abbott also filed lawsuits against five generic drug manufacturers,
and countersued a sixth.
</P>
<P>
   No judge ever ruled in Abbott's favor, but the maneuvering kept
the company's monopoly on Hytrin alive for four years after a
patent on the key ingredient ran out. During that time, Abbott's
Hytrin revenues totaled roughly $2 billion _ most of it pure
profit.
</P>
<P>
   The legal fight to protect Hytrin culminated with the 1998 cash
payments. No one knows how many similar deals between drug makers
and their generic rivals exist; experts say most are kept
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   But other agreements have recently come to light through
government investigations and private lawsuits; they involve
tamoxifen, the breast cancer drug; Cardizem CD, a heart medication;
K-Dur, a potassium supplement, and Cipro, an antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   And these deals, like the Hytrin case, are causing consternation
among judges and regulators, legislators like Waxman and Vice
President Al Gore, who said in a recent interview that such
agreements ``perpetrate a fraud on the American people by denying
them the benefits of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is taking a hard look; in March, it
accused Abbott and Geneva (but not Zenith) of violating antitrust
laws. The companies defend their agreement as proper, but signed a
settlement with the FTC agreeing not to make any other similar
deals. The settlement was the first of its kind for the FTC; the
agency warned that companies might not be treated so lightly in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal judge declared the Cardizem agreement an
illegal restraint of trade; in that case, a brand company, Hoechst
Marion Roussel, paid a generic competitor, Andrx Pharmaceuticals,
$90 million not to market a generic alternative. The companies have
denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is also stepping in. The agency, concerned that deals
like the one covering Hytrin may be costing the public millions of
dollars in higher drug prices, is pressing for new rules to
discourage them _ rules that trade groups for both brand and
generic drug makers oppose.
</P>
<P>
   These regulatory moves come in the middle of one of the election
season's most closely watched debates: the dispute in Congress
about whether to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats are bickering over the size and shape
of the benefit, which might cost taxpayers over $200 billion in the
next decade, but both sides assume generics will save money. Yet
little attention has been paid to how delays in generic competition
are driving up drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generics have saved the American consumer billions and
billions of dollars,'' said Roger L. Williams, who once ran the
FDA's office of generic drugs and is now chief executive of the
U.S. Pharmacopeia, a nonprofit standard-setting organization. ``In
an era of soaring costs, and perhaps a prescription drug benefit
for Medicare, you are going to have to have good generics or else
your system will sink.''

STRICT RULES RECOMMENDED FOR NURSING HOME STAFFING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Maine, Alaska, Hawaii, Okla., Kan., Iowa)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal health officials have concluded that most
nursing homes are understaffed to the point that patients may be
endangered. For the first time, the government is recommending
strict new rules that would require thousands of the homes to hire
more nurses and health aides.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to Congress based on eight years of exhaustive
research, the Clinton administration says that understaffing has
contributed to an increase in the incidence of severe bedsores,
malnutrition and abnormal weight loss among nursing home residents.
Many of the patients end up hospitalized for life-threatening
infections, dehydration, congestive heart failure and other
problems that could probably have been prevented if the homes had
more employees, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes with a low ratio of employees to patients are
``significantly more likely to have quality-of-care problems,'' the
study says, and ``substantial increases'' in staff may be required
to ensure that homes do not endanger the safety or health of
patients. The 200,000-word report is to be sent to Congress this
month.
</P>
<P>
   It recommends new federal standards to guarantee, for example,
that patients receive an average of two hours of care each day from
nurse's aides. It says that 54 percent of nursing homes fall below
this ``proposed minimum standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of care depends not only on the number of nurse's
aides, the lowest-skilled workers, who help feed and bathe
patients, but also on the number of registered nurses and licensed
practical nurses, who supervise the aides, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the report says that nursing homes should have
enough registered nurses to provide at least 12 minutes a day of
care to each resident, on the average. But, it says, 31 percent of
nursing homes do not meet that standard.
</P>
<P>
   The government emphasized that the proposed levels of staff were
not the optimal levels, but the minimum needed to prevent patients
from being exposed to ``a substantially increased risk'' of
poor-quality care.
</P>
<P>
   The report, from the Department of Health and Human Services,
was required by a 1990 law and was originally supposed to be
completed by Jan. 1, 1992. But health officials experienced many
delays, and the scope of the project grew as they conducted more
research and analyzed huge amounts of data from nursing homes
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Federal researchers said they found that staffing levels were
much higher at nonprofit nursing homes than at for-profit homes.
Large nursing home chains that experienced financial difficulties
in the last two years, including chains that filed for protection
under the bankruptcy law, have cut staff to control costs, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts come when nursing home residents are typically sicker
than in the past, with more serious disabilities. Hospitals have
reduced the length of stays, releasing patients ``quicker and
sicker.'' Many people with less severe conditions, who might have
gone to nursing homes 15 years ago, now receive care in their own
homes from visiting nurses and aides.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes said it was unrealistic for the government to
specify minimum levels of staff when it was providing what they
called inadequate payments under Medicaid and Medicare, the
programs for low-income people and those who are elderly or
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, nursing home executives said it was hard to attract
and retain good workers in a booming economy, when the unemployment
rate is at a 30-year low and other industries offer less demanding,
better-paying jobs. Nurse's aides provide more than 70 percent of
the hours of care given to nursing home residents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The American Health Care Association, a trade group for the
industry, said it could not support ``minimum staffing ratios''
unless the government agreed to help pay the additional cost, which
could total several billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.6 million people receive care in 17,000 nursing homes
nationwide. Ninety-five percent of the homes participate in
Medicaid or Medicare and are therefore subject to federal
standards. But, the report says, the federal law and regulations
are ``too vague'' to guarantee an adequate number of employees.
</P>
<P>
   The law, adopted in 1987, says that nursing homes must have
enough staff to provide services enabling each patient to achieve
``the highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial
well-being.'' Neither the law nor the rules indicate the minimum or
appropriate numbers of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Congress could amend the law or health officials could revise
the rules to set tougher, more explicit standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes, like hospitals and other health care providers,
are lobbying Congress to restore money cut from Medicare in 1997.
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Special Committee on
Aging, said he would consider earmarking some of the money to
ensure that nursing homes hire additional workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half of the nation's nursing homes don't meet a
minimum benchmark for staffing,'' Grassley said. ``That means
residents don't get fed enough. They don't get turned to prevent
bedsores. They end up in the hospital much more often than they
should.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that nursing homes with low staffing levels
tended to have large numbers of residents with nutrition problems.
Many frail elderly patients need help with meals but do not receive
it, and their health declines as a result, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   When employees are in short supply, they often prod patients to
eat faster, forcing ``huge spoonfuls of food into their mouths,''
so the patients cough and choke, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics compiled by the government show that 47 percent of
nursing home residents need some assistance in eating, and 21
percent are totally dependent on assistance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To prevent severe bedsores, also known as pressure ulcers,
patients must be turned or moved every two hours, the report said,
but this is unlikely to occur in homes with low numbers of nurse's
aides. The sores can be painful, become infected and damage
underlying muscle and bone.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
said last year that more than one-fourth of nursing homes had
deficiencies that ``caused actual harm to residents or placed them
at risk of death or serious injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlene A. Harrington, a professor at the School of Nursing of
the University of California in San Francisco, said, ``Medicare
payments are calculated on the assumption that nursing homes will
have certain levels of staff, but the government does not require
homes to have the amount of staff they are paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said the staff-to-patient ratio was lower in the
United States than in other countries like Britain, Sweden and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing homes in Delaware, Maine, Alaska and Hawaii consistently
have high ratios of employees to patients, the report said.
Staffing levels are low in Oklahoma, Kansas and Iowa. New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut fall in between.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid pays for the care of 68 percent of nursing home
residents. A 1980 law required that such payments be ``reasonable
and adequate'' to cover the costs of ``efficiently and economically
operated facilities.'' Many nursing homes invoked that law to get
higher reimbursements. But in 1997, Congress repealed the law, at
the behest of states, which share Medicaid costs with the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that repeal of the law had put downward pressure
on nursing home payment rates in some states like Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Several nursing home chains have filed for bankruptcy protection
in the last two years. They include Sun Healthcare, Vencor,
Integrated Health Services and Mariner Post-Acute Network.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Leonard, a spokesman for Sun, said, ``There has been a
reduction in therapy provided to patients in our nursing homes, and
we've had a significant reduction in therapy staff, because of
Medicare policies that sharply reduced the amount of therapy for
which the government will pay.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the Clinton administration gave inspectors new guidance
on how to determine if a home had sufficient nursing staff to meet
the residents' needs. But even with this guidance, the report said,
there is ``no evidence'' that inspectors can actually determine
whether homes comply with the general federal requirement to have
sufficient staff.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors are supposed to make unannounced visits to each
nursing home at least once a year to assess compliance with federal
standards. But, the report said, patients ``report a fear of
retaliation from staff or other residents'' if they express concern
about the staff, and employees ``have also voiced the fear of
losing their jobs if they discuss staffing issues with the survey
team.''

SPORTS COLUMN: AN INSPIRATIONAL ARMSTRONG WITH A STORY TO TELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tour de France is a metaphor for life, Lance Armstrong tells
us, because it can be ``exalting and heartbreaking and potentially
tragic'' and it can pose ``unspeakably bad luck, unthinkable
beauty, yawning senselessness and, above all, a great, deep
self-questioning. It even tests you morally.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he declares that given the choice ``between winning the
Tour de France and cancer, I would choose cancer.'' As last year's
winner and the favorite to win Sunday, and as a survivor of
late-stage testicular cancer that had invaded his brain, Armstrong
is the only person alive who could even seriously consider such a
choice. As with any hero who has returned from somewhere dangerous,
he has a story to tell. The third happy surprise (after almost four
years of survival after diagnosis and victory in the Tour) is how
good a story it is and how well the smooth, often elegant, writing
of Sally Jenkins helps him tell it.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's new autobiography is called ``It's Not About the
Bike: My Journey Back to Life'' (Putnam) and it ranks very high on
the list of two genres of which I have read too much, the memoirs
of sports stars and of cancer survivors. Tough, direct and filled
with useful information about racing a bicycle, coping with cancer
and even in vitro fertilization, the book also offers up a
fascinating portrait of an insecure, fatherless momma's boy who is
still in honest struggle to grow up and be a good father himself.
</P>
<P>
   His mother was 17 when Lance was born and his father left them
when the boy was 2. Armstrong dismisses him as ``a non factor'' who
merely ``provided the DNA.'' When a Texas newspaper traced his
biological father last year, Armstrong not only expressed lack of
interest in finally meeting him but called the man's expression of
pride opportunistic. It is as if he is still trying to abandon the
old man right back.
</P>
<P>
   Lance's stepfather, Terry Armstrong, is described as ``a
Christian who used to beat me for silly things.'' That may help
explain why Lance later describes himself as ``agnostic.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7, he was liberated by a Schwinn Mag Scrambler; ``a bike is
freedom to roam, without rules and without adults.'' He was
probably safer on the road. His favorite game, which he invented,
was ``fireball.'' He and a friend, wearing garden gloves, played
catch with tennis balls which they soaked in gasoline, then set
aflame.
</P>
<P>
   The central character in the book is his mother, Linda, who
worked several jobs as she put herself through school, and was his
constant source of strength. She taught him to never quit. She
moved them to upper middle-class Plano, Texas, for the schools, and
then protected him from classism and the local epidemics of
adolescent drug addiction, depression and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   No football player in a football-crazy town, Lance found his
outlet in triathlons. In this lottery sports world, there is a
tendency to overpraise those who do it the hard way, but often they
have no choice. In biking, Lance admits, he found a way to inflict
physical pain on himself that smothered the emotional pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cycling is so hard,'' he says, ``the suffering is so intense,
that it's absolutely cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a perfect candidate for chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The precancerous Lance Armstrong was known as the Texas Bull, an
aggressive, disrespectful rider fueled by the rage that covered his
fears. He likes himself much better now. Unlike most cancer
survivor/writers who profess moral improvement, his claim seems to
be more than a way of finding something worthwhile in unspeakably
bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   While he says that cancer made him a better person, more
interestingly it made him a better racer. Before his months of
chemo, he had been a star of one-day races. After chemo, he
discovered his strength was in endurance for the long haul, which
is what the 23-day, 2,274-mile Tour de France is all about. As well
as life. Without cancer, he believes, he would not have won the
Tour. Don't try this or fireball at home.
</P>
<P>
   The superstar and survivor genres come together in Armstrong's
descriptions of the computers, blood tests, online research,
emotional support and teamwork that goes into both bike racing and
cancer treatment, as well as how he channeled his attacking race
style into being an aggressive, noncompliant patient.
</P>
<P>
   Delicious small facts abound: I had no idea that he wore a heart
monitor during the Tour so his coach in a chase car could tell him
when to pedal harder or slow down. Or that EPO, the red-blood cell
enhancer banned in the Tour, was a drug he had to take when chemo
suppressed his immune system. He stopped taking EPO after his
cancer treatment ended and has been on record as fiercely
anti-drug.
</P>
<P>
   Rare among cancer survivors or superstar athletes these days,
Armstrong does not offer that kind of cloying religious advice that
fits on a T-shirt but not in the real world. What he does offer,
however, is worth taping to your handlebars: ``We can take
responsibility for ourselves and be brave.''

THEY'RE OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD TURN 100 
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, IND. _ At 5:20 p.m. sharp Thursday, Dr. Richard R.
Rutter, 68, took off over the University of Indiana in a hot air
balloon dressed as the Wizard of Oz in a top hat and frock coat
with nine plastic pigs on it.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Rutter is a professor of orthodontics at the
School of Dentistry at the University of the Pacific in San
Francisco. But for 10 brief minutes until he drifted down to an
athletic field, Rutter imagined that he was the Wizard himself on
his way to the Emerald City, pulling baby pigs out of his sleeves
and letting them run up and down his shoulders. ``Oh, I felt very
wizardly, yes,'' Rutter said, after landing.
</P>
<P>
   Rutter was one of some 400 Oz fans who came to the University of
Indiana for a weekend celebration of the centennial of L. Frank
Baum's book, ``The Wizard of Oz.'' The event was sponsored by the
International Wizard of Oz Club, and the group was here to honor
the timeless story of a little girl, Dorothy, who is blown out of
Kansas by a cyclone and encounters the Wizard, who lives in the
Emerald City and promises to help her find her way home.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of ``The Wizard of Oz'' in 1900 ushered in ``a
new era of American children's literature,'' Michael Patrick Hearn,
an Oz scholar, said in the celebration's keynote address. ``The
fairy is eliminated _and the fearsome morality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baum dared to offer delight without instruction,'' said Hearn.
</P>
<P>
   The story has worked its way into the national psyche as a fable
of eternal hope in which things are not always as fearsome as they
seem, even lions are cowards, wizards are just pretending to be
fierce, and it is always best to be at home. ``It's like a
religion,'' said the author Alison Lurie, who was here to give a
talk. ``It has its holy relics, its laity, its clergy'' _ the Baum
descendants and the heads of the Oz fan clubs.
</P>
<P>
   With 5 million copies sold until it went into the public domain
in 1956, ``The Wizard of Oz'' was the Harry Potter of its time. It
is impossible to know how many of the Oz books have been sold since
then, Hearn said, who is the author of an annotated version of the
``The Wizard of Oz.'' But Hearn estimates that more people have
seen the 1939 MGM movie of ``The Wizard of Oz'' with Judy Garland,
and more times, than any other movie ever made. An updated
centennial version of Hearn's book, complete with references to
Ezekiel, ``The Pilgrim's Progress,'' and Ralph Waldo Emerson, is
being published this September by W.W. Norton.
</P>
<P>
   At the celebration, there were lectures on every aspect of
Baum's life and work, displays of Oz collectibles, and a church
service with an Oz theme. Three of the original Munchkins from the
1939 movie came. One, Clarence Swenson, a pituitary midget, wore a
replica of his original Munchkin soldier costume with a fez-like
hat and fuzzy plume. One participant, Ricky Birran, a professional
storyteller from Eugene, Ore., who calls himself Sir Readalot,
began a marathon reading session, intending to read from a series
of Oz books for 24 hours straight, reciting one chapter from each
from memory.
</P>
<P>
   Gita Morena, a great-granddaughter of Frank Baum, appeared
wearing a pair of silver shoes like Dorothy in the book. On
Thursday, Morena, the author of ``The Wisdom of Oz,'' gave a talk
on how she uses Oz in her psychotherapy practice. Morena said her
original name was Dorothy, but she changed it in 1981 to Gita at
the suggestion of an Indian mystic. ``I believe the magic key was
given to me to open the doors to sympathy and understanding,''
Morena said, quoting her great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We travel together through the inner world to find our way,''
she said. ``Initiates must travel through the chaos of the
windstorm to find the storm's center point.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Morena said, ``Even though the journey is difficult,
success is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   One theme running through the celebration was Baum as a champion
of women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Erisman, a professor of literature at Texas Christian
University, said in a talk that Baum's mother-in-law, Matilda
Joslyn Gage, a drafter of the Woman's Bill of Rights with Elizabeth
Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, exerted a major influence on the
author. On Friday, Lurie lectured on ``Oz and the New Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   All the activities at the celebration were centered at the
Indiana Memorial Union, which was decorated with 300 pounds of red
silk poppies in honor of the Deadly Poppy Field that Dorothy
encounters on her way to the Emerald City. A mock yellow brick road
led through the lobby to a 15-foot-high replica of the Emerald City
on the stage of Alumni Hall, with 40 Munchkin mannequins, and a
pair of huge red ruby slippers. The University of Indiana was
chosen as the site of the celebration, said Peter E. Hanff,
president of the club and deputy director of the Bancroft Library
at Berkeley, because of the extensive collection of Oz material in
the University's Lilly Library, which was on display for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those attending were collectors. One of the best-known
in the group was Edith Hollister of Santa Barbara, Calif., famous
among Oz fans for owning the pencil with which Baum wrote the first
Oz book.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never too old to have a happy childhood,'' said Lee
Jenkins, a paralegal who owns an Oz store.
</P>
<P>
   Robin McMaster, who has a mail order business selling Oz items,
gave a talk that was standing room only on how to incorporate Oz
ornaments into Christmas decorations. ``I'll be going over the
ornaments one by one,'' she said, as she showed slides of her two
immense Christmas trees from last year packed with Oz figures.
</P>
<P>
   Rutter, who took off in the balloon, is another collector. He
has a room in his home in Redwood City, Calif., devoted to Oz, he
said, complete with its own yellow brick road.
</P>
<P>
   Rutter joined the international club 25 years ago after he began
collecting, ``though it's easier for me to go to Winkie meetings,''
he said, referring to local meetings on the West coast. The Winkies
are the yellow peoples of the Western part of Oz who are the
subjects of the Wicked Witch.
</P>
<P>
   Rutter attended the Friday afternoon costume party wearing his
Wizard costume with the pigs on it. Another was dressed as a field
of poppies, and one as a yellow brick road with a hat meant to
represent the Emerald City. There were several Dorothies,
``traditional,'' younger-looking Dorothies, based on the drawings
of W.W. Denslow in the first Oz book, and Judy Garland Dorothies
based on the movie. After the party, at dinner, Baum's
great-grandson, Robert Baum, gave a talk about Baum's life, and
some participants attended a performance of Patrick Shanahan's play
``Oz'' at the Bushkirt-Chumley Theater.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a dizzying array.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really marvelous event,'' said Mel Rubin, a lawyer
and mediator from Key Biscayne, Fla., as he watched Rutter take off
in his balloon. Rubin, who is 56, had come to Bloomington with his
wife Susan Scholz, a psychologist. Rubin said he had been
captivated by the Oz books ever since the Wicked Witch scared him
when he was 5 or 6 years old. His wife doesn't share his interest
in Oz, Rubin said. ``She just sits there and relaxes and realizes
what a mistake she made.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rubin said, ``I wish more people would do this. I think
they'd leave each other alone, if they'd just concentrate on the
Wizard and all the great things in the Emerald City.''

<P>
   Pharmaceuticals are a risky, but lucrative, business. Drug
companies turn scientific advances into life-saving medicines that
can generate millions of dollars in sales each day, but the process
takes time _ an average of 12 to 15 years _ and money.
</P>
<P>
   Through a recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, the
prescription drug industry is increasingly global. But the
companies earn most of their profits, and do most of their basic
research, in the United States, the last drug market free of price
restraints. The industry consistently ranks as the most profitable
among Fortune 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   In this election year, with prescription drugs now the
fastest-growing component of the United States' health-care bill,
the political debate is centered on how to help elderly people pay
for their medications. So politicians and consumers are taking a
close look at the drug industry, a business that closely guards its
financial and scientific secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Drug Discovery
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical companies spend over $20 billion annually on
research and development, a figure that has nearly doubled every
five years since 1970, according to industry data. The industry
estimates that the average cost of developing a successful drug is
over $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The actual cost of developing a particular medicine _ the
laboratory equipment, the raw materials, the researchers' salaries,
the clinical trials _ is just a small percentage of the $500
million. The rest is the cost of lost opportunity: years and
dollars spent on scientific leads that prove fruitless, and
research money that could have generated interest had it been
invested elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The $500 million figure is extrapolated from a 1991 study by
researchers at Tufts University. Some experts say the estimate,
drawn from confidential industry data not subject to outside
review, is inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Companies spend more on drug development _ the D in R&AMP;D _ than
they do on research. While clinical trials account for the biggest
development expense, experts say that some development costs, like
consulting fees paid to doctors, are more appropriately categorized
as marketing than as research.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical Testing
</P>
<P>
   For every 5,000 to 10,000 compounds that the industry screens as
potential new medicines, 250 make it to the stage of testing in
animals. Of these, the industry says, five enter testing in people,
in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   The trials have three phases. First, the drug is given to a
small number of healthy volunteers to test its safety and establish
the proper dose. The second trial tests for effectiveness and looks
for side effects in a larger number of patients who have the
condition that the drug is meant to treat.
</P>
<P>
   The costliest clinical trial is the phase 3 study, in which
thousands of patients may be tested, so that scientists can assess
the drug in a diverse population, over an extended period.
Depending on the drug and the amount of medical care involved,
experts say, a phase 3 clinical trial can cost $10,000 to $20,000 a
patient.
</P>
<P>
   The Regulators
</P>
<P>
   For years the drug makers complained that the Food and Drug
Administration, the federal agency that regulates medication, took
too long to approve new treatments, eating into the valuable life
of a patent. That changed in 1992 when Congress passed the
Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which enabled the agency to speed
drug reviews with the help of industry money.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1997, the industry paid the agency $327 million
to hire 600 new reviewers. Today, the average drug approval time
has dropped to 12 months, from about 30 months before the law was
passed. And the number of new medicines the agency approves each
year is rising.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say that in relying on drug companies to supplement
its budget, the FDA has become too close to the industry. They
point to a rash of drugs withdrawn in recent years after serious
side effects surfaced once the drugs were in pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Patenting
</P>
<P>
   Patents, as much as science, are critical to the success of a
new drug. A patent is a property right. It confers a
government-authorized monopoly for a set period _ in the United
States, 20 years from the date the application is filed. During
this period of market exclusivity, the patent owner can recover the
costs of the original investment.
</P>
<P>
   Patents were not always of paramount importance in medical
research; many academic scientists once believed that knowledge
should not be treated as proprietary. After Jonas Salk invented a
polio vaccine, the journalist Edward R. Murrow asked him who owned
the patent. ``There is no patent,'' Salk replied. ``Could you
patent the sun?''
</P>
<P>
   And when a Rutgers University professor, Selman Waksman,
invented a breakthrough antibiotic, streptomycin, in the 1940s, he
patented the drug but gave away the rights. The result: Many
companies sold streptomycin, keeping prices _ and profits _ low.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is far different today. Drug companies often derive
the bulk of their sales from a handful of top-selling medications,
so the pressure to invent the next blockbuster, and maximize its
time under patent, is intense. In the industry, this is known as
``life-cycle protection''; one way the drug makers protect their
products is simply to file more patents.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA keeps a registry of all drug patents. But the agency
does not evaluate whether the patents are valid; it simply takes
the company's word. So the listing creates a barrier to rivals,
which often wind up challenging patents in court.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have also fought hard to win patent extensions.
In 1995, an international trade agreement pushed back the
expiration date of patents. Several companies benefited handsomely
from a loophole in that extension.
</P>
<P>
   While drug makers say they need longer patent protection to
generate profits for research, some experts say that patent
expirations, not extensions, spur innovation. Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., for
instance, is pursuing new anti-depressants now that the patent on
its best seller, Prozac, is about to run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prozac patent expiration,'' the company's 1998 annual
report said, ``is serving as a catalyst to bring greater intensity
to everything we do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Generic Competition
</P>
<P>
   Prozac is not the only blockbuster drug threatened by the loss
of its patent. In the next five years patents are due to expire on
some of the most lucrative drugs in the history of medicine, among
them Prilosec, the ulcer medication; Claritin, for allergies; and
Zocor, for high cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   Generics can erode a brand drug's market share within months. A
1999 report by Boston Consulting Group, which advises the industry,
predicted that the average top drug company would lose 30 percent
of its sales to generics by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   If the threat of generics creates angst on Wall Street about the
industry's profitability, it creates even more inside the
companies, where scientists, patent lawyers and business executives
are taking a variety of steps to beat back competition.
</P>
<P>
   When a drug produced by a joint venture of Dupont and Merck, the
blood thinner Coumadin, faced a generic challenge, the companies
hired a battery of lobbyists to press state legislators and
pharmacy boards to adopt rules that, in effect, restricted the
ability of pharmacists to substitute the generic for the brand
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Claritin's maker, Schering-Plough, has taken its lobbying
efforts to Washington; it has asked Congress to insert a provision
into a spending bill that would extend the drug's patent.
</P>
<P>
   When generic makers tried to sell a version of Taxol, a leading
breast-cancer drug, Taxol's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, sued for
patent infringement _ not on the drug, but on the method of
delivery, which the company had also patented. Courts in Britain
and the United States found for the generics earlier this year, but
the case is on appeal and there is still no generic on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 20 percent of all prescriptions were filled with
generic drugs in 1984. That year Congress passed a landmark law,
the Hatch-Waxman Act, intended to facilitate generic competition.
By 1996 generics had captured 43 percent of the market and were
saving consumers $8 billion to $10 billion annually, according to a
study by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   But because generics cost much less than brand drugs, they
account for only a small fraction of the industry's total sales.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the combined
prescription sales of the top 20 generic-drug makers in 1998
totaled $7 billion, less than a tenth of those of the top 20 brand
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Going to Market
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the last free market for pharmaceuticals:
Other developed nations control drug prices, as in Japan, Canada,
and France, or drug company profits, as in England. So Americans
typically pay higher prices for new medications than people
anywhere else in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   How the drug companies set prices, though, remains something of
a mystery; they do not discuss their pricing strategies. The drug
makers say price is dictated by the high cost of research. But the
calculus behind any single pricing decision is complex, and largely
shaped by market forces.
</P>
<P>
   Does the new drug offer therapeutic advantages over existing
medicines? How big is the patient population? Is there generic
competition? Paradoxically, the arrival of generic competition
often results in raised prices for the brand-name counterparts, as
companies seek to maximize revenue in a shrinking market.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the industry's emphasis on R&AMP;D costs, the top drug
makers in 1998 spent, as a percentage of sales, three times as much
on marketing and general and administrative expenses as they did on
research and development, the Kaiser Family Foundation said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no set price for a single drug in the United States:
Health plans, the government and individual patients all pay
different rates, depending on their power in the marketplace. More
than three-quarters of Americans younger than 65 have prescription
drug coverage; their insurers typically negotiate discounts. But
the size of those discounts is kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Among elderly Americans, who account for 13 percent of the
population but roughly one-third of all drug expenditures, it is a
different story. One-third of the nation's senior citizens lack
drug insurance and must pay out of pocket for their pills. As a
result, they typically pay the highest prices.

COMMENTARY: SAINTS AND PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Saints,'' wrote George Orwell, ``should always be judged
guilty until proved innocent.'' I don't think he was talking about
garden-variety hypocrisy _although many supposed ascetics do turn
out to have something to hide. The more important point is that
there are other temptations besides those of the flesh. And those
who renounce small pleasures may be all the more susceptible to
monomania, to the urge to sacrifice the good in pursuit of the
perfect. In other words, beware the cause of the rebel without a
life.
</P>
<P>
   Some commentators have made much of the secrecy shrouding the
accounts of Ralph Nader's organizations, of the revelation that
speaking fees and stock market investments have made him a
multimillionaire, and of hints that his lifestyle might not be
quite as austere as it seems. But what should worry those
sympathetic to Nader are not his vices, if he has any, but his
virtues _ and his determination to impose those virtues on the rest
of us.
</P>
<P>
   Nader did not begin as an extremist. On the contrary: In the
1960s, when he made his reputation, the striking thing about Nader
was his relative moderation. Fashionable radicals were preaching
revolution; he was demanding safer cars. And because his radicalism
was practical and realistic, it left a lasting legacy: Our
tradition of consumer activism, a tradition that rightly honors
Nader as its founding father, makes this country a better place.
One might even give Nader some credit for our current prosperity:
If Japan had shared our healthy distrust of claims that what is
good for General Motors is good for America, its current economic
morass might have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere along the way, the practical radical disappeared.
The causes that Nader and his organizations have pursued in the
last couple of decades seem to have less and less to do with his
original, humane goals.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows about Nader's furious opposition to global trade
agreements. But it is less well known that he was equally adamant
in opposing a bill removing barriers to Africa's exports _ a move
that Africans themselves welcomed, but which Nader denounced
because of his fear that African companies would be ``run into the
ground by multinational corporations moving into local economies.''
(Most African countries would be delighted to attract a bit of
foreign investment.) Similar fears led Nader to condemn South
Africa's new constitution, the one that ended apartheid, because _
like the laws of every market economy _ it grants corporations some
legal status as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider another example, one closer to home _ my home, in
particular. When my arthritis stopped responding to
over-the-counter remedies, I brought it back under control with a
new regime that included the anti-inflammatory drug Feldene. But
Nader's organization Public Citizen not only tried to block
Pfizer's introduction of Feldene in the 1980s; it also tried to get
it banned in 1995, despite what was by then a firm consensus among
medical experts that the drug's benefits outweighed its risks.
</P>
<P>
   If you look for a unifying theme in all these causes, it seems
to be not consumer protection but general hostility toward
corporations. Nader now apparently believes that whatever is good
for General Motors, or Pfizer, or any corporation, must be bad for
the world. To block opportunities for corporate profit he is quite
willing to prevent desperately poor nations from selling their
goods in U.S. markets, prevent patients from getting drugs that
might give them a decent life and prevent a moderate who gets along
with business from becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   At times Nader's hostility to corporations goes completely over
the edge. Newt Gingrich disgusted many people when, in his first
major speech after leaving Congress, he blamed liberalism for the
Columbine school shootings. But several days before Gingrich spoke,
Ralph Nader published an article attributing those same shootings
to _ I'm serious _ corporate influence.
</P>
<P>
   And was I the only person who shuddered when Nader declared that
if he were president, he wouldn't reappoint Alan Greenspan _ he
would ``re-educate'' him?
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who are thinking about voting for Nader probably
imagine that he is still the moderate, humane activist of the
1960s. They should know that whatever the reason _ your amateur
psychology is as good as mine _ he is now a changed man.

   NURSING-HOMES (Washington) _ After eight years of exhaustive
research, federal health officials have concluded that more than
half of the nation's nursing homes do not have enough employees to
care for patients and that the government should therefore set
stringent new standards requiring homes to hire additional workers.

   GENERIC-DRUGS (Undated) _ The drug industry is aggressively
fending off one of its biggest threats: competition from generics,
which in the next five years could eat away at tens of billions of
dollars in sales from brand drugs whose patents are about to
expire. To shed light on this trend, The New York Times examined
hundreds of pages of court records and other public documents in
Washington and various states, and interviewed regulators and drug
company executives. The review showed how efforts to extend a
profitable drug's monopoly, as much as the pursuit of scientific
discoveries, drive decisions in one of the world's most lucrative,
and secretive, industries. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Jeff Gerth.

COMMENTARY: WORLD'S DULLEST MEN

   PASADENA, Calif. _ The conventions are the only reality shows
nobody wants to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In television, drama is being pushed out by reality, but in
politics, reality is being pushed out because it lacks drama. Or
perhaps because it lacks reality.
</P>
<P>
   Politics has become so artificial, prewashed, prechewed and
preordained that there is no chance for bite and spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   Without bite and spontaneity, there is no chance for ratings.
Without ratings, there is no chance for rapt attention from the
networks. And without network prime time, how can a presidential
candidate persuade us he is the One?
</P>
<P>
   If red, white and blue confetti falls in an empty living room,
does it get in anybody's hair?
</P>
<P>
   Viewers' embrace of ``The West Wing'' puts the lie to the notion
that Americans won't watch substantive discussions of ideas. Ideas
just have to be presented with real human passion.
</P>
<P>
   But since the exit of John McCain, who managed to make campaign
finance reform seem romantic, it's been hard to find real human
passion anywhere but on a fictional TV drama. It's impossible to
tell what George W. Bush and Al Gore really care about, besides not
making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   There has been moaning about how awful it is that the networks
are cutting back coverage to practically nothing and shunting it
off to cable. But given what lousy TV the conventions are _ dull,
obsolete, self-serving _ the parties should feel lucky that they
haven't been relegated to Webcasts.
</P>
<P>
   As programmers here at the summer TV press tour scramble to put
reality on their schedules _ UPN is looking for shockumentaries
about Nasty Neighbors, Cheating Spouses and perhaps even World's
Meanest Ladies _ I asked television's leading reality impresario
how the conventions could be made more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davies, the British-born producer of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' thinks American politics has boxed itself in:
</P>
<P>
   ``The great Monte Hall once said great TV has one moment where
the protagonist either wins everything or loses everything. Quiz
shows, the best sporting events, our favorite sitcom episodes _
they all have that. Conventions have lost that. They need a new
hook, a moment of `Drumroll, please.' They have to engineer more
drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies wryly suggests the always-popular vote-out. ``Like
`Survivor,' you kick out one state every year, or vote somebody off
the Democratic National Committee every night.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventions need to get interactive. ``Vice-presidential
selection could be more like ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?' and people could vote from home,'' Davies says.
``Or like `Blind Date.' We follow the nominee as he goes out with
three vice-presidential prospects. Maybe we see pop-up thought
bubbles that tell us what he really feels about a possible mate _
how the guy droning on about ethanol is a snore.'' (Wouldn't we
have loved to see the pop-up bubbles over Dick Cheney's head as he
interviewed VP contenders: ``I'm better, I'm better, I'm better.'')
</P>
<P>
   The producer muses that the best way for a convention to win an
audience is to pay people to watch _ let viewers win money by
guessing how many times George W. Bush will use the word ``heart''
in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art of performance has been lost in American politics,''
he contends. ``You can find C-Span debates in Parliament that are
utterly absorbing. The pols are funny and liable to say stupid
things when there aren't 100 people writing and producing for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``America should import the British system for one convention
week. You have the two parties on opposite sides of a big
convention center, like Parliament, jeering, pointing across the
aisle, while Bush and Gore debate each other extemporaneously.
You'd have to have somebody in the role of the speaker, Betty
Boothroyd _ maybe Judge Judy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As TV producers say, the conventions need to relax and find
their voice. They've lost touch with the original idea. There's no
introduction of characters, no conflict, no second act, and the
resolution is predetermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``And on top of all that, the lighting is really bad.''

40 PERCENT IN NEW YORK CITY ARE FOREIGN-BORN, STUDY FINDS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A human tidal wave has added 1 million immigrants to
New York City in the last decade, propelling foreign-born residents
to 40 percent of the population, an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau
figures shows.
</P>
<P>
   That level of immigration has not been equaled for nearly a
century. As recently as 1990, the figure for foreign-born residents
was 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures come not from the 2000 census, whose results
will not be known till next year. Instead, they are derived from
the recently released results of a 15,417-household survey taken in
1999 by the Census Bureau. That study is done every three years to
see if housing vacancies are below 5 percent, the legal threshold
for continuing rent regulation. Because the sample is large and the
bureau conducts the survey, the data are considered highly
reliable. They jibe with the census, which is undertaken every 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a preview of the full census,'' said Dr. Andrew A.
Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College who analyzes census
data.
</P>
<P>
   Although the surge has been evident for years, its sheer size is
stunning. ``Boy, that is some number _ wow, wow!'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, co-author of ``Beyond the Melting Pot,'' a 1963
treatise on race and ethnicity in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enriching experience for us,'' Moynihan said. ``It's
wonderful _ I mean, we have to think of it that way. If we think of
it any other way, it won't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Without immigration, for example, New York's overall population
would be shrinking. Instead, the stream of people from around the
world is offsetting the loss of city residents to death and
relocation to the suburbs and other regions. The result has been a
modest net gain of about 130,000 since 1990, to an estimated total
of 7.4 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent immigration, we would be seeing a very different New
York, with neighborhood abandonment and depopulation,'' said Dr.
Philip Kasinitz, a sociology professor at Hunter College. Dr.
William H. Frey, a demographer at the State University of New York
at Albany, said, ``These groups are revitalizing and re-energizing
these neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar flows from abroad are bolstering the population of other
major cities across the nation, although New York has had the
largest influx. A big difference, however, is that other places
have ethnically concentrated immigration, such as the Cubans in
Miami, while the new New Yorkers are extraordinarily diverse by
race and nationality. ``This is a region that is going to continue
to be very different from any other areas of the country,'' said
Frey.
</P>
<P>
   City Planning Commission officials declined to be interviewed
about the findings. An agency spokeswoman, Jennifer Chait, voiced
caution. ``These projections are based on data that is incomplete
and inadequate for drawing significant conclusions,'' she said.
``Our expectations are that the definitive Census 2000 data will
show a substantial increase in New York City foreign-born
population but not to as nearly as high as 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beveridge said his figures were actually conservative. The
Census Bureau sample showed that 44 percent of heads of households
were foreign born. Estimating the figure for the entire city, he
reduced the percentage to adjust for factors like children of
immigrants being born here. The margin of error is 0.8 percent, he
said. He also noted that the planning agency itself had estimated
immigration at around 100,000 a year, which in 10 years adds up to
1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Further, official statistics undercount immigrants who decline
to respond because of language barriers, wariness of the government
or concern about the legality of their immigration, jobs or
housing. Immigration data also exclude native Puerto Ricans, who
are U.S. citizens, though it can be argued that by language,
culture and geography, they have much in common with immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Beveridge's findings were backed by two other experts. Dr. John
Mollenkopf, director of the Urban Research Center at the City
University of New York's Graduate Center, said: ``That's consistent
with what other sources, like the current population survey, are
showing,'' referring to yet another Census Bureau sampling. His
work on that survey indicates 54 percent of children through the
age of 18 are either foreign born or have foreign-born parents.
``Well over half the kids are not native stock,'' he said. And Dr.
Aristide R. Zolberg of New School University's International Center
for Migration, Ethnicity and Citizenship said he used a 40 percent
estimate for the immigrant population.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1910 has New York's percentage of foreign-born
residents been so high. That era of immigration, through the halls
of Ellis Island, transformed the city and sparked debates over the
role of newcomers that still echo today. To house the last wave, a
staggering 600,000 dwellings were built in the 1920s. Radicalized
newcomers enlivened local politics. And sweatshop exploitation of
immigrants, spotlighted by the fatal fire at the Triangle
Shirtwaist factory in 1911, galvanized the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   The latest tide continues unabated into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the current wave was accelerated by the enticing
economic boom and New York's refurbished image as a safer, cleaner
city. And there is the age-old tradition of new arrivals following
the footsteps of friends and relatives to ethnic enclaves
throughout the five boroughs.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Immigration is as old as the city itself. Back in 1643, when New
York was called New Amsterdam, the 500 residents spoke 18
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Major ethnic shifts within the current immigration are changing
the city's makeup. Beveridge's estimates show that New Yorkers born
in the former Soviet Union, who numbered 81,000 in 1990, had nearly
tripled to 229,000 by 1999. Other fast-growing groups include
Mexicans, who nearly quadrupled to 133,000 in 1999 from 35,000 in
1990, and South Asians from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, who
more than doubled to 146,000 in 1999 from 67,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to climb as a major Hispanic group, Dominicans rose
more than two-thirds, to 387,000 in 1999 from 230,000 in 1990.
(Puerto Ricans born on the island dropped 21 percent to 290,000 in
1999 from 367,000 in 1990. Adding those born on the mainland,
Puerto Ricans here totaled 744,000 last year, an 11 percent drop
from 834,000 in 1990.)
</P>
<P>
   The statistics confirm the changing face of the city witnessed
on the streets every day by native New Yorkers, themselves
descended from earlier immigrants. Mexican shops are sprouting in
western Queens, Middle Eastern businesses now compete with the
Greek establishments of Astoria and very little of Italy is left in
Little Italy, where Chinese-Americans are the absolute majority and
Hispanics have been jostling for second place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gateway to America,'' says the welcoming sign at Kennedy
International Airport in Queens. So many newcomers have stepped off
and made their home in that borough that its 167 nationalities and
116 languages make it the nation's most diverse county.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens borough president, Claire Shulman, said: ``I'm
continually looking for school seats and sites to build, because we
are minus 30,000 seats and growing 10 percent a year. The other
thing is there really isn't enough affordable housing, which has
led to a lot of illegal conversions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts call for a strategic plan for dealing with
immigration. ``We need to get out in front and plan and strive to
do better,'' said Michael H. Schill, a professor at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has often voiced support for immigrants.
His press office did not return calls seeking comment from him and
from the immigrant affairs office on the latest figures.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration has produced tensions. The visiting baseball pitcher
John Rocker made his distaste well known. One man paid for
anti-immigration billboards, and City Councilwoman Julia Harrison
objected to Chinese and Korean business signs without English
translations.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say that immigrants are a plus for the city. While
many may be dependent when they arrive, Schill said, ``that rapidly
changes as they move up the ladder and contribute more in taxes
than they consume.'' He added, ``Immigrants tend to be very
resourceful, or they wouldn't be here in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Shulman agreed: ``They're all wonderful. For the most part
they're all working; our unemployment is under 5 percent. I go to a
lot of graduations, and they're winning a lot of valedictorians and
salutatorians and walking away with lots of good scholarships. The
vitality, the energy, the chemistry from people all over the world
is what makes New York City unique and makes New York City great.''
She named another benefit to Queens: ``Hey, listen, we have the
best restaurants in the city.''

the U.S. is stepping into a Vietnam-style quagmire by sending
military advisors and sleek new helicopters to help battle
Colombia's drug lords, who along with Marxist guerrillas control
vast areas in the countryside. Meanwhile, Colombian President
Andres Pastrana is battling plummeting public support, a deep

Affairs and divorces have been on the upswing for years in China,
but men in Guangdong have taken marital infidelity to a new level _
they are known to take a mistress _ or even two or three _ set them
up in a house, even have children with them. For wives who want a
divorce, laws are so inadequate, it could mean years of poverty for
them. The problem has become so serious, the province issued anew
legal directive that makes it easier for wives to get a share of

   ALADUMP _ LOWNDESBORO, ALA. _ The historic Selma-to-Montgomery
voting rights trail, U.S. Highway 80, runs through rural Lowndes
County, meandering past tracts of dusty farmland, boarded-up gas
stations and sacred civil rights-era ground. A racially mixed group
of developers and county officials, including some who hold office
thanks to the voting rights crusade, feel the 670-acre landfill is
just the thing to jump-start the economy of one of the state's
poorest counties. But landfill opponents, also a mix of blacks and
whites, say a dump near U.S. 80 would be an affront to the memory
of the marchers and hurt both the environment and a fledgling
tourist industry. Last week, the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management granted a permit for a landfill. We take a

without them,'' said the College of Charleston English instructor
and self-appointed guardian of the historic district's exterior
window dressings. Though few, if any, are so fretful, Wilkinson
said the shutters are disappearing as well-heeled out of towners
snap up historic houses and, during renovation, are not aware, or

   BRUNSWICK _ BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ When Kendra McCrae stormed into the

it was another sign of the continuing unrest in the coastal city

28-year-old secretary, was upset over mistreatment she says she and
other blacks received at the hands of police during a July 4th
altercation. That holiday weekend confrontation, which eventually
turned violent, led to a subsequent protest march on Monday (July
17) with others planned. It has also revealed a wider set of
grievances. A loose coalition of residents and ministers is now
calling for sensitivity training for police, a community-wide forum
to discuss racial differences and better economic opportunities for
the city's black population. We examine the continuing evolution of
a city in transition. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   GROWING PAINS FOR THE INTERNET

<P>
   Eds: The following two stories, about growing pains for the
Internet in a period of rapid worldwide growth, are suitable for
twinning or use as a series.

<P>
   INTERNET-HARDWARE _ WASHINGTON _ Even as the Internet is hailed
for expanding the horizons of millions of users and energizing the
world economy, there's concern it could become the victim of its
own success. Rapid growth of sites and users poses the very real
nightmare that this massive online structure,
</P>

in gigantic cyber-traffic jams. (Glass, Cox News Service)

   INTERNET-SOFTWARE _ WASHINGTON _ WWW.any-site.com. To American
ears, this familiar pattern identifies a World Wide Web site on the
Internet. The system seems simple and settled, but a global battle
is being waged this summer over how addresses will be assigned to
keep pace with rapid Internet growth. The stakes are enormous. If
plans to establish private control over the Internet's address
system founders on technical details and political disputes, the
global expansion of the online community could become gridlocked.
But if it succeeds, Americans will have to get used to having the
Internet governed by an international body that may be located in
Switzerland (Geewax, Cox News Service)

   VOTERS-SUBURBMOMS _ DATELINE TK _ Four years ago, ``soccer
moms'' gained almost mythical stature as the coveted voting bloc
that would reelect President Clinton or give Republican Bob Dole a
fighting chance. In a close presidential race in 2000 between Al
Gore and George W. Bush, the women's vote is all-important, but
more difficult to define and to attract. So far, polls are showing
that more men are strong supporters of their choice, where women
tend to be more flexible _undecideds or soft supporters of Gore or
Bush. In addition to the gender gap, there is a particularly large
``marriage'' gap. Clinton led Dole among married women 53% to 43%
in 1996; Gore trails Bush 42 percent to 50 percent. (Holmes, Cox

computers and a bustling Internet cafe. In 20 years, the village
has grown a sheepskin backyard business into a multi-million dollar

half of China's total sheepskin imports. Technology has helped fuel
the growth. (Chao, Cox Washington Bureau) Art includes a 4-column

   SYDNEY _ Sydney _ In going from Georgia to Australia, then, the
Olympics have gone from one British penal experiment to another.
This odd kinship of outcasts dawned on me as I was sitting at a
cafe beside Sydney Cove, the aquamarine inlet that sets off the
heart of the city like a jade pendant. Ferry boats were churning
through the whitecaps of crisscrossing wakes. On one side of the
cove, the Opera House roof loomed like the upturned prows of a
dozen giant rowboats. On the other side, blue Australian flags
streamed in the breeze atop the long steel arch of the Harbour
Bridge. It's hard to imagine now, but this postcard spot was where
the First Fleet landed in 1788 with a thousand convicts and
sailors. Ten thousand miles from home, they struggled and almost
starved yet somehow managed to transform their bitter exile into a
city and nation that will soon command the world's attention.

 &HT;    All the rage on the road

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Video games, DVD players and even the PC are
moving out of the home and onto the road, which has made owning a
simple CD or cassette player for your set of wheels last century's
news.
</P>
<P>
   Luxuries usually strewn about the family room are becoming
popular gadgets in cars and in roomy SUVs. Ever since Oldsmobile
introduced a videocassette player for its minivans in 1998,
car-stereo enthusiasts have been adding more dazzle to audio
systems with the addition of video. And the automotive world is
jumping on the bandwagon; every major manufacturer now offers video
in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment systems, equipped with everything from video-game
consoles to TV tuners, are not only making the open road more
enjoyable but also more peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Want to keep the kids occupied on a long road trip? Let them
watch their favorite movies on 5- to 7-inch headrest monitors or on
overhead screens in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of families bring the minivans in,'' says Jason Krimm,
owner of Stereo-In-Dash in Dayton. ``We'll hook up a VCR or DVD
player and a few screens with headphones, and you don't have to
hear Barney singing. All the noise will stay in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   The booming sales of comfy SUVs and the continuing popularity of
spacious minivans have created a growing market for video-enhanced
joy rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In-car entertainment seems to be the most popular catch phrase
right now,'' says Sean Pate, public relations coordinator for
Pioneer, one of the biggies in the world of car electronics.
``People want to set up their cars like they would their homes with
DVD and video games and surround sound. Sales show that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the price tag for such systems isn't as exciting. Most
systems require some type of controlling head unit for the
dashboard. Add a few screens and a six-disc DVD/CD changer, and
you'll be looking at approximately $5,000 for a Pioneer system.
</P>
<P>
   Panasonic has a similar setup. Head unit ($2,000), DVD player
($1,200), a 7-inch LCD screen ($1,100) and a Dolby processor for
surround sound ($800) will run $5,100.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a display screen in the front seat? Check out
Clarion's motorized head unit equipped with a 6.4-inch LCD screen
($1,100) and audio/video inputs. Tack on another $1,000 for video.
</P>
<P>
   But these high-tech gadgets aren't all about fun. Get some work
done on the go with Clarion's AutoPC, which runs on Microsoft's
Windows CE software. The information superhighway can be accessed
while on the interstate with the mobile minicomputer's wireless
connection. E-mail and even stock quotes are a few clicks away.
</P>
<P>
   Want to groove to trendy MP3 music files? Software should be
available soon for the AutoPC to play your favorite downloads.
</P>
<P>
   But the features don't stop there. The $1,300 voice-activated
system can be outfitted to get navigation directions, check your
gas mileage or to alert you of engine problems. And though sales
are sluggish now, Krimm sees a future for in-car information
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could run a business right out of your car if you wanted
to,'' said Krimm. ``You can get full-blown computers installed in
your trunk with wireless keyboards. But you're going to pay five
times as much for the (mobile) versions. It'll probably get big in
the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   But bombarding a driver with so many distractions does have its
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``These video systems pose the same threat as using a cellular
phone does,'' says Sergeant Eric Widmyer of the Ohio Highway
Patrol. ``If you're going to include one of these systems, be sure
that all display devices are out of the driver's view. There's too
much happening on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some states ban all display devices within the driver's
view, Ohio has no such law.
</P>
<P>
   Widmyer says that voice-activated systems provide a better
alternative than systems that require fiddling with knobs and
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like with a cell phone,'' he says. ``If you need to
divert your attention, pull over and get off of the road.''

 &HT;    Sound comes alive with stereo enhancer
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Theater 2000 is a device that promises to
``enhance'' the performance of your home sound system by ``allowing
listeners to hear music or sound effects as if they were literally
in the middle of a live recording or concert hall.''
</P>
<P>
   And while it's hard to describe exactly what the unit is doing,
it actually does seem to give music a more full-bodied,
three-dimensional feel.
</P>
<P>
   Like other electronic stereo enhancement products I have tested,
the Theater 2000 seemed to be adding a bit of extra power to some
treble and bass frequencies, giving the sound a more compelling
feel. But unlike some others, the Theater 2000 didn't add
distortions that made the sound seem less natural.
</P>
<P>
   I tested the unit on an older (about 1990 vintage) stereo system
of moderate quality. It took about five minutes to connect the
Theater 2000 using cables that came with the product.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions were clear and the unit came with a remote
control that made it easy to use and adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into the Theater 2000 gave the immediate impression that
the room was more full of sound, partly because the music was
slightly louder. Flipping the system on and off and listening
carefully led to the conclusion that only certain frequencies were
being boosted, an effect that couldn't be duplicated by simply
increasing the volume in standard stereo mode.
</P>
<P>
   The Theater 2000 has two modes _ one meant primarily for music
and one for audiovisual inputs such as DVD, videocassettes and
games. The unit increased the intensity of sound in the audiovisual
mode but not as dramatically as in the music mode.
</P>
<P>
   Theater 2000 is available online at www.theatersound.com for
$199.95. Spectrum Research said the product should be available
through other electronics retailers by the end of the year at a
suggested price of $229.95.
</P>
<P>
   By clicking on an icon on the Web site you can download a sound
file that demonstrates the Theater 2000 effect.

 &HT;    Surviving cancer to win last year's Tour made him a hero . . .
But is Lance the best?
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Should he claim his second straight Tour de
France championship today, Lance Armstrong will hardly be unique _
there have been 18 other multiple winners. But it would put his
accomplishment in position to spark debate over topics that have no
definitive answers.
</P>
<P>
   Does overcoming cancer to claim back-to-back titles in cycling's
most difficult and prestigious event elevate Armstrong to the
status of one of the all-time greats in the sport? Has he eased
past three-time winner Greg LeMond to become the top cyclist in
United States' history?
</P>
<P>
   The latter question is more open to speculation than the former.
Even Armstrong considers the former question a waste of time when
measured against the legacies of five-time winners Miguel Indurain
of Spain, Bernard Hinault and Jacques Anquetil of France and Eddy
Merckx of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merckx, Indurain, Hinault and Anquetil, they were a lot more
talented than I am,'' Armstrong said at a press conference on the
off day before leading into the final week of the Tour. ``It would
be crazy for me to say I will win five in a row. If I want to win
five, I will have to ride (in) six or seven because there are lot
of other good riders and you can't win every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe you can call Jim Ochowicz crazy. The U.S. road
cycling coach for the 2000 Olympics believes Armstrong can join the
select crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Ochowicz asked. ``It's certainly not inconceivable.
After getting the second one under his belt, it's my personal
feeling that a third one will come with it because he's in that
range.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong turns 29 on Sept. 18, the prime age for many cyclists.
``I can't tell you how long he'll ride, but he could win five
Tours,'' Ochowicz said. ``Many riders in their early 30s have won
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also is uncertain how much longer he'll compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have the motivation through all the years, I will do it,
but I can't promise,'' he said at a press conference. Family
considerations would probably keep him from riding more than
another four years or so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour's five-time winners generally are acknowledged as the
absolute creme de la creme of cycling. Ochowicz readily concedes
that Merckx, who won the Tour from 1969-72 and again in 1974, is at
the top of the list, but he believes Armstrong has the potential to
be included in the exclusive club.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all added up in the end, you'll have to put Lance in
the top 10,'' Ochowicz said. ``Maybe the top five.''
</P>
<P>
   Merckx _ the ``ck'' is silent _ usually is considered the
standard by whom all others are measured. While Armstrong is
regarded as a powerful climber, Merckx wrote the book. Tall for a
cyclist at 6 feet 4 inches, he was known as ``The Cannibal'' for
his ability to dominate all phases of the game.
</P>
<P>
   That's reflected in Merckx's record of 525 career victories in
1,800 races. Among his many accomplishments was wearing the Tour de
France's yellow jersey 96 days and winning 35 stages, both records.
At the 1969 Tour, he became the first and only rider to win the
yellow jersey (overall winner), green jersey (points winner) and
polka-dot jersey (King of the Mountains).
</P>
<P>
   ``Merckx is the big player in our sport,'' Ochowicz said. ``He
was at the top and did everything well.''
</P>
<P>
   THE U.S. DEBATE
</P>
<P>
   More intriguing is the Armstrong-LeMond matchup as the top rider
in U.S. history. It's a two-man mythical race because they are the
only Americans to win the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   LeMond also shares another trait with Armstrong: overcoming a
potentially fatal setback. LeMond was critically injured in a 1987
hunting accident when he was accidentally shot with a shotgun by
his brother-in-law while turkey hunting. Sixty pellets were found,
but doctors could only remove 30, and LeMond spent two years
recovering before resuming competitive cycling. He captured that
year's Tour de France, erasing a 50-second deficit on the final day
to win by eight seconds.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for a LeMond-Armstrong comparison, most cycling
insiders do more dancing around the subject than Fred Astaire. But
when pressed, they tend to give Armstrong the edge by an eyelash,
although LeMond has three Tour victories (1986, 1989-90).
</P>
<P>
   ``If I absolutely had to pick one, I'd probably go with Lance
because of the intangibles he brings to the table, but they are so,
so close,'' said Sean Petty, director of athlete performance for
USA Cycling, the sport's national governing body. ``Greg was so
tough and could really roll with the punches, but because of what
he's had to overcome physiologically and psychologically, I think
Lance would maybe edge him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Ochowicz: ``Greg certainly has earned the right to brag
about what he's done. But Lance has taken it a little further than
that with his ability to win it (Tour de France) with an American
team vs. Greg with a French team that had Tour winners on it in
Hinault and (Laurent) Fignon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This distinguishes Lance from Greg to a certain extent. Lance
also has quite a broader career because he's won World Cup one-day
races as well. Greg was very competitive in those, but didn't have
the same success.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Kiefel, a retired cyclist who was Armstrong's teammate for
six months when Armstrong competed for Motorola, refused to get
drawn into the hypothetical debate. But Kiefel, who now owns
cycling shops in Denver, said the two have different personalities
and competitive tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg is much more gregarious. He's very people-oriented while
Lance is very businesslike,'' Kiefel said. ``Lance is friendly, but
he likes to get the task done. Greg was focused on cycling but had
distractions. Lance doesn't allow those distractions into his life.
He just doesn't take no for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance has an incredible amount of power on the mountain
stages, but is so fluid on the bike. Greg was much more of a big
gear rider. He really wrestled with that bike to get everything out
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer who's better,'' Kiefel added. ``All I know is
they've both had a huge impact on American cycling.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Menci will vouch for that.
</P>
<P>
   Menci, 72, is events director and curator of the 14-year-old
U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame in Somerville, N.J. He's also an
unofficial historian of the sport and was a competitive cyclist in
the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some very lean years in this country in the '40s, '50s
and '60s,'' Menci said. ``But it's so much better now. People like
Lance and Greg come around maybe once every 50 years or more. They
really generate a lot of interest in the sport for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of riders who are national champions, but
outside of the cycling community, no one knows they are national
champions,'' Menci added. ``But when Greg LeMond started coming up,
a new set of junior racers began to develop. And now Lance has
become a household name. He'll generate more interest and more
riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's better, but I do know they've both been
great for the sport in this country.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Scores of would-be protesters have bivouacked in
the Malibu mountains at a training camp featuring vegetarian
cooking and classes in climbing skyscrapers. The mayor has
published a stern warning against violent protest and nonviolent
civil disobedience, with tough talk about rubber bullets and pepper
spray, stiff fines and jail.
</P>
<P>
   And a federal judge has ruled that the police department's
initial plan to keep demonstrators fenced far away from the
entrance to the Democratic National Convention was
unconstitutionally restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Los Angeles where, as usual, worlds collide.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when civic leaders fought to get their first
national political convention since the Democrats nominated John F.
Kennedy here in 1960, they promised that it would be a chance to
celebrate the city's comeback from the plagues of the early 1990s
with a four-day, internationally televised fiesta of the first
order.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, practically nothing has gone as planned, and the
convention, Aug. 14 to 17, is shaping up as the biggest test in
years for this sprawling, congested, divided city's mettle and its
perpetually searching sense of itself.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council, all but three of whose 15 members are
Democrats, has sought to block the use of city money to cover
expected convention cost overruns, largely out of enmity for the
convention's chief booster, Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican
whom many of them loathe.
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire businessmen who promised to sponsor the
convention have fallen to feuding in public. And no one knows what
mischief a loosely connected confederation of protesters whose
concerns range from economic globalization to capital punishment,
abortion, environmental justice, homophobia, housing and campaign
finance might wreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to understand it, as one law-enforcement official who
I will not name told me, is like managing a week of peaceful,
unlawful activity in order to keep it peaceful,'' said state Sen.
Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, the ``Chicago 7'' alumnus who says he
finds in the protesters some echoes of his 1960s radical roots.
``That's the challenge. The lawlessness is in the eye of the
beholder, because it will be mostly misdemeanors, like blocking
traffic and crossing against the light. I think it can be
managed.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials, mindful of the recent protests in Seattle and
Washington, have been less sanguine, and they went to federal court
to fight an effort by the local chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union to overturn the security zone around the convention
site at the downtown Staples Center as impermissibly broad.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in a sharp rebuke, Judge Gary Feess ruled that the
city's plan to seal off a 186-acre site around the convention, and
keep protesters penned in a parking lot out of earshot and direct
sight of the convention delegates, was unconstitutional. The judge
also ruled that the city's permit application process for parades
and use of public parks for protests, which requires a 40-day
advance application, was unconstitutionally restrictive and vague.
</P>
<P>
   Feess said the security zone ``burdens speech more than is
necessary,'' but he suggested that some relatively minor
modifications to the northeast corner of the zone, near the arena
entrance, could satisfy his concerns. The city, the police, the
Secret Service and convention planners were scrambling to come up
with an acceptable alternative, to be presented to the Civil
Liberties Union over the weekend and reviewed on Monday, though
they warned it would require more officers.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Riordan surprised many of his top aides and appalled
convention planners 10 days ago with a sharply worded op-ed article
in The Los Angeles Times that even some of the mayor's strongest
supporters called a miscalculation likely to inflame the situation
and rile potential demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan denounced an umbrella organizing group of protesters
called D2KLA as anarchists bent on violent disruption and property
destruction, when in fact the group's Web site pledges nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't stick your head up and make yourself a target,'' said
one convention planner, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
``And don't get your facts wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest groups were particularly incensed that Riordan not only
vowed not to tolerate violence or vandalism but also said, ``We
cannot tolerate nonviolent civil disobedience, such as the blocking
of access to roads or buildings,'' time-honored protest tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is making a concerted effort to criminalize people of
conscience, particularly the peaceful activists,'' said John
Sellers, director of the Ruckus Society, a group based in Berkeley
that co-sponsored the five-day training camp for 200 demonstrators
in the Santa Monica Mountains this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making every effort to marginalize us, vilify us before
we even get into town, and therefore to make it easier for us to be
dismissed and brutalized in the streets of Los Angeles and to scare
more everyday folks away from being out in the streets with us with
their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   While protesters at past conventions have been confined mainly
to designated areas, such areas have usually been directly across
from the convention arena, and most big city police departments,
including New York's, typically try to negotiate a certain amount
of permitted civil disobedience (like blocking part of a street) in
exchange for avoiding greater unplanned disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Los Angeles Police Department has a reputation for
comparative high-handedness, and several local politicians said it
should have been clear from the start that the plan for keeping
protesters across the street from the Staples compound, behind a
14-foot fence, with their view to the arena blocked by a parking
lot full of temporary trailers and television equipment, would
never pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Los Angeles department is comparatively
small, about one-third the size of New York's. Los Angeles has just
9,346 officers (including supervisors), while the convention is
expected to draw 5,000 delegates, nearly 15,000 journalists and an
unknown number of demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman, Lt. Horace Frank, said the department was
confident that its planning for convention security, in progress
for over a year, would be up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   The department has canceled all vacations and regular days off
for officers and civilian employees alike, and has worked out
cooperation agreements with the county sheriff's department, in
which its deputies will handle transportation security for
delegates, and will be available to process the arrests of
protesters in the event of mass arrests. He said state officials
had also assured the department of additional help if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a massive endeavor, Herculean to say the least,''
Frank said. ``But it's one that we feel very good about and very
confident of. We recognize that the majority of protesters are
legitimate groups who are going to be behaving in a legal and
lawful manner, but we also know that there are those groups who are
going to inject themselves and try to do harm, and we're
prepared.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Hayden acknowledged that 50 to 200 protesters might actually be
from anarchist groups bent on destroying property to make a point.
Based on the experience at the World Trade Organization meeting in
Seattle last year, city officials' biggest fear is that such groups
might blend in with more peaceful ones and cause trouble when it is
least expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service was worried enough about the difficulties in
securing Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles that instead of
Vice President Al Gore staying at the Biltmore Hotel there, he will
stay in Century City, several miles away from the convention site.
And the federal court hearing on the security zone was so crowded
with demonstrators this week that even some news organizations
could not get in to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democratic Party officials and aides to Gore are
having to walk a delicate line between making sure their typically
fractious party is not seen as trying to stifle peaceful protests,
and exercising diplomacy with a police department and local
establishment whose help they need in order to have a successful
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the real action of the convention is going to be in
the hall, and we're real excited about it,'' said Peter Ragone,
speaking for the party's convention committee. ``We recognize the
possibility of demonstrations and protests, and we're confident
that the joint security team has the plans in place to deal with
potential situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden, who visited the protesters' training camp to lend moral
support, said the biggest potential problem remained the city's
unavoidable traffic and sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a normal day here, we're congested,'' he said. ``For God's
sake, the Indiana Pacers couldn't get from Santa Monica to the
Staples Center in time for the first game of the playoffs. In my
view, if the convention is shut down, it'll be simply because L.A.
itself is this great, congested colossus and it grinds to a halt.''

POLITICAL NEWS AND NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Del., Ky., Miss.)  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Age Is a Big Issue In One Senate Race  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delaware is a little state. But this year's U.S. Senate race
there looms large _ and, after last week, even larger.
</P>
<P>
   The state's senior senator, William V. Roth Jr., a Republican,
is going after a sixth term, and Democrats think that in Gov.
Thomas R. Carper, now finishing his second and final term, they at
last have the candidate who can take him out.
</P>
<P>
   If they are right, not only will Delaware get a brand-new
senator, but the 10-seat Republican edge in the Senate very well
might be narrowed. In only four or five other states are Democratic
hopes about the Senate as high.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that on Monday, when Delaware's Democratic
senator, Joseph Biden, introduced Carper at a rally celebrating the
official kickoff of the Carper campaign, he declared, ``This
election is a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   It became even bigger the next day with the release of a new
Mason-Dixon poll.
</P>
<P>
   Early polls had Roth trailing Carper by 10 points or so. The new
poll had him down by only 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   Both men tend to be middle-of-the-road politicians with few
sharp edges, which is the way Delawareans like their politics. So
what separates the pair more than anything else is age: the senator
turned 79 Saturday; the governor is 53. And age is what both are
focusing on.
</P>
<P>
   In his kickoff speech, Carper used the words ``energetic'' and
``future'' and the phrase ``new leadership'' no fewer than a dozen
times. Then, in his most pointed reference to Roth's 79 years _ 30
of them in the Senate and four in the House _ Carper said:
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than a third of a century, through the tenures of
seven presidents, Bill Roth has served the state of Delaware in
Washington. But this election, like all elections, is not just
about the past, it is about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth did not respond with his usual litany about having the
seniority to deliver to constituents in the future what no freshman
senator could ever hope to deliver. Rather, he pointed to the new
poll numbers and said, ``Our campaign is right where we want it to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   An Outspoken Ally Has Advice for Gore
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky has good ties to Vice President
Al Gore and will help preside over the Democratic National
Convention next month, when Gore is officially nominated. But he
worries about how Gore is playing around the country, especially in
Kentucky, considered a swing state this year.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back, Patton, who has a tendency to say precisely
what is on his mind, urged Gore to pay more attention to Kentucky,
noting that Gov. George W. Bush had an edge in the polls there and
had been raising a lot of money in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Now Patton has some more political analysis and advice for Gore
_ very frank and pointed analysis and advice.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the other day how the Gore campaign was shaping up, he
told The Courier-Journal of Louisville that the vice president's
problems in Kentucky, as in the nation as a whole, were largely
traceable to a lack of personality. Simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the whole campaign,'' the governor said, ``is
that people know Gore and he evidently doesn't have that
personality that is causing people to come to him.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Patton indicated that he thought Gore, with his latest round of
attacks on Bush's record as governor of Texas, was at last on the
right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he has to do right now,'' Patton said, ``is he's got to
bring George W. Bush's record out. We're exactly where we were in
1988, with a sitting vice president and an attractive governor who
can make a good speech _ and you know who won that one.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Vice President George Bush, Gov. Bush's father,
defeated Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, who had led in the
polls through most of the early and middle going.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Democrat Is an Also-Ran Again
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1964, Mamie Cunningham, then a 22-year-old college
student, was one of the black Freedom Democrats from Mississippi
who journeyed to the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic
City, N.J., to challenge the all-white makeup of her state's
delegation. The challenge caused considerable turmoil, but in the
end she was not allowed to be a delegate and was forced to observe
the proceedings from the boardwalk outside the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years and a civil rights revolution later,
Cunningham, now a 58-year-old teacher, is still involved in
Mississippi politics. In fact, two months ago she was chosen to be
a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it will not happen.
</P>
<P>
   In the civil rights movement, too, what goes around comes
around.
</P>
<P>
   An Asian-American challenged the makeup of this year's
Mississippi delegation, saying that when it came to male delegates,
only blacks and whites had been chosen and a slot traditionally
reserved for someone of another race had not been filled. Party
officials investigated, and while they found no merit in the
challenge, they did find that the delegation had two more women
than men.
</P>
<P>
   They made Cunningham an alternate delegate and gave her delegate
slot to a man, a state senator. A delegation out of gender balance,
they explained, might not be seated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be, more or less, an observer again,'' Cunningham
lamented.

NFL OWNERS ARE CLOSELY WATCHING THE ESTATE TAX BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time of year National Football League owners usually have
one thing on their minds: training camp. But in recent days their
attention has been divided. That is because they have been closely
monitoring a raging political debate that could alter the league's
ownership landscape in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   A number of millionaire owners, despite their large bank
accounts, face the possibility of losing their teams, not because
of bad investments or player salaries run amok, but because of
something that has dogged people for hundreds of years: taxes.
Specifically, estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax collects revenue from the richest Americans by
taxing estates up to 55 percent upon the death of the business
owner. Heirs are often forced to sell their estates, in many cases
farms or small businesses, to pay the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Republican congressional leaders are moving to repeal
it, saying that the tax penalizes success. Many Democrats want to
keep the tax because they feel it keeps the rich in check.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, professional football owners are nervously watching the
debate. Indeed, because of the estate tax, a number of owners and
their families, including some of the most respected football men
in the game such as the New York Giants' Wellington Mara and the
Pittsburgh Steelers' Dan Rooney, face the real prospect of losing
their teams because of the hefty tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we would like to keep the team,'' said Mara's son,
John, the Giants' executive vice president and general counsel.
``But I just don't know. At this point, I just don't know if we
will be able to do that. It could be nearly impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, in a way, serves as the perfect petri dish for the
estate tax arguments. Should fans care if rich football team
owners, who have made millions, if not billions, off of ticket and
television revenues, lose their teams?
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, President Clinton called July legislation to
repeal the estate tax ``a budget-busting bill that provides a huge
tax cut for the most well-off Americans at the expense of working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   But does the estate tax, as owners and league officials
maintain, seriously threaten the continuity of the NFL, which in
turn would hurt the sport? And does it penalize NFL families that
have for decades spent money wisely, built traditions and pumped
jobs and revenue into their host cities?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought government was supposed to protect our property, not
confiscate it, not penalize someone because they've been
successful,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Mara, for example, has guided the Giants, the
league's flagship franchise, for decades with skill and grace,
earning a spot in the Hall of Fame. Recently, his son has taken
over the reigns, and he has evolved into a respected football
executive. Things are set up for a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Mara family were forced to sell the team, it would
lead to a painful sale process that could last months, possibly
affecting the quality of play on the field. It is that scenario
that the league fears.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is the most prosperous of sports leagues, and currently
the sport is the healthiest it has been in decades. An issue like
the estate tax does not seem like a pressing problem.
</P>
<P>
   But owners and league officials maintain that it is a big issue.
Many of the NFL's elite owners are getting older. Some owners
believe that if the estate tax, nicknamed the death tax by
congressional Republicans, is not repealed, a string of teams could
be sold, causing the long-stable NFL to bubble slightly with
instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The estate tax may be the most important issue facing our
league in a long, long time,'' said Art Modell, the Baltimore
Ravens' owner. ``Under the present law, many owners in my league
would have to sell their teams to pay the estate taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL owners interviewed estimate that at least one dozen owners
face the loss of their teams in the coming years. It is hard to
tell exactly how many because understandably none will discuss in
detail their financial situations. Yet owners who are probably
closely watching the happenings in Washington include Buffalo's
Ralph Wilson, Tampa Bay's Malcolm Glazer, Mara and Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners, like Oakland's Al Davis, maintain they are prepared
for the estate taxes and will be able to keep the team in the
family. But most say it a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lawmakers did not have the NFL in mind when the
estate tax was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916.
Eventually other presidents supported it because they believed the
tax would decrease the gap between the rich and the poor. Now, the
top 2 percent of the wealthiest Americans pay the tax, which starts
at 37 percent and climbs to a maximum of 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the tax so formidable for football owners, especially
ones where the franchise is their main source of revenue, is the
staggering bill that is due upon their deaths. If, for example, the
Giants are valued at $600 million, that could mean a tax debt of
over $300 million for the Mara estate.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the government allows the bill to be paid in some
instances over 12 to 14 years, ``that is a staggering amount and
one that we simply might not be able to pay even over an extended
period of time,'' Mara said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners are crossing their fingers that relief might be on the
way. The Senate voted 59-39 on July 14 to repeal the tax over 10
years, and in June, the House voted 279-136 to repeal. But
President Clinton has vowed to veto the bill when it crosses his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   There is history to justify the concern of owners. The estate of
the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse was forced
to sell the team in 1995 because of hefty estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   When Rooney's father, Art, bought the Steelers in 1933, he did
so for a measly $2,500. After his death in 1988, estate taxes were
a pittance compared to what NFL owners would pay now, thanks to the
increase in franchise values over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are in precarious positions,'' Rooney said.
``We're crossing our fingers.''

   Swann's Surface Issue
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were quietly a part of the recent Eric Swann
sweepstakes and showed serious interest in the once-great defensive
tackle. But, at first, the interest was not reciprocated.
Originally, Swann, who has been slowed by a series of knee
injuries, had crossed the Giants off his list of teams he wanted to
play for.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason was that he thought the team still played on
artificial turf, which would have been harder on his knees. But
once Swann became aware the Giants had recently changed their
playing surface to grass, he changed his mind and was willing to
visit the team.
</P>
<P>
   But interest in the Giants again waned once Swann began visiting
other teams. The Giants never made an offer.
</P>
<P>
   XFL Hiring From NFL
</P>
<P>
   Dick Butkus, recently hired to coach the Chicago team in the
XFL, pro wrestling's football league, will most likely not be the
last high profile former NFL player the upstart league will attempt
to snag. The new league's approach is to chip away at the NFL's
prestige and history by using, in some capacity, an NFL Hall of
Famer in the top media markets.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Butkus was the first step in that strategy. According to
two people familiar with the league's negotiations, the XFL plans
to approach Hall of Fame tight end Kellen Winslow about a position,
possibly as a coach. Winslow played with the San Diego Chargers
from 1979 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The XFL is scheduled to begin play in eight cities in February
2001. &QL;

 &HT;    Actress Heuring, 25, settles into movie star role
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Barchas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Here's the scene: You're in the mood for a
deliciously silly movie. You trek to the theater, sink into your
seat with butter-dusted popcorn and wait for the lights to dim. And
then a preview comes on for a flick featuring you in the lead role.
Sound surreal? So it was for Austin native Lori Heuring when she
saw a trailer for ``The In Crowd,''a teen-age psychological
thriller in which she stars, while attending a different movie last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a really strange experience for me,'' Heuring
said of seeing herself on screen. ``All of a sudden I just had this
realization of, `Wow, I just reached one goal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Starring in major studio movies is part of a long list of things
Heuring wants to do. The University of Texas graduate from the
business honors program dabbled in television and modeling before
plunging into film, where she hopes to fully explore the ``movie
star'' role. ``It's like a Peter Pan world,'' Heuring said. ``You
get to wake up and be something different, put yourself in someone
else's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Portraying a different personality was challenging for Heuring
in ``The In Crowd.'' As Adrien, a 19-year-old recovering mental
patient with a penchant for sexual fantasies, Heuring flirted with
the thin separation between sanity and everything else. The strong
lesbian innuendoes in the movie were new for her, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read it in the script, I thought, `Ahh,' but when
you're actually doing it, you realize it's people just trying to
figure out who they are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for her role, Heuring spent time in mental hospitals,
dissecting what reality was like for patients there. ``For me, it
was just getting to that place where you don't feel loved and you
don't feel anyone listens or cares,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This feeling was foreign for Heuring, who credits her recent
success partly to the support of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great upbringing,'' she said. ``My parents listened to
everything that came out of my mouth, and I was told `I love you'
15 times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Heuring's father helped jump-start her career by taking her to
Los Angeles, where she now lives, the day after she graduated from
Anderson High School. At the premiere of ``The In Crowd,'' Heuring
sat next to her dad. ``I just kind of nestled down into him and was
so nervous,'' she said. ``During the kissing scene, I covered his
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Heuring splits her time between visiting her family in
Texas (she turned down Princeton for UT partly to be closer to
home) and pursuing her career in California. Austin will be the
sight of a future Heuring film if the 25-year-old has her wa.
Heuring calls the Austin film community a ``microcosm where it's
almost more pure than anywhere else, and they're so not pretentious
with it,'' and she gushes about the Austin Film Society, which she
says ``is truly amazing in not only their knowledge, but in their
pursuit to show films that are completely obscure and completely
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Heuring hopes someday she might be making those types of movies.
The director's chair is already beckoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're an actor and you watch a really deft director do
his or her craft, you're in awe, and it'd be something that I'd
love to do someday,'' she said. ``For me, when you can sit down for
two hours at a screen and get lost in it, forget that you're even
watching a movie just because the story is so good and the
characters are so bold and blatant, that's the kind of film that
I'd love to make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday'' is the operative word for Heuring. Right now, she's
busy reading about a dozen scripts a week as she scouts for future
films, having just wrapped up the independent feature ``Nailed.''
Don't expect her to get caught up in the superficial glamour of
Hollywood, however. Heuring lives by the advice of her father to
take what she does seriously without taking herself too seriously,
and she has no plans of forgetting where she came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one place that's important to me as far as my history
and myself, and that's Austin,'' she said. ``It's funny, because
I've never really felt like I was leaving Austin, because my
parents were there and it's such a part of me. It will always be
home.''

OUTDOORS: LODGE OWNER'S DEATH LEAVES THE UPSALQUITCH QUIET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Maine)   By PETE BODO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROBINSONVILLE, New Brunswick _ The canoe, anchored at the head
of Moore's Pool, rocked like a cradle in the gentle grasp of the
Upsalquitch River. The morning, the last one of my annual trip to
Maclennan Lodge, the camp where I have fished for Atlantic salmon
for 19 years without missing a season, was overcast.
</P>
<P>
   The air was still and leaden, magnifying every sound: the
rhythmic swishing of an airborne fly-line; the lapping of the river
against the old wooden boat; the abrupt, piercing shriek of a blue
jay. I had not yet caught a salmon on this trip, and time was
running out.
</P>
<P>
   Ollie Marshall, my guide and friend, sat square-shouldered at
the downstream, stern end, of the boat, watching the Green Machine
wet fly swing around in the current.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awful quiet,'' Ollie finally observed. ``Looks like the salmon
left with Tucker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You think?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw,'' he said, examining a fingernail as if it were the first
time he saw one. ``Tucker loved being wicked, but he wouldn't do
that to us.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, Ollie added, ``It's the evenings, after the
fishing, that I miss Tucker most. My God, how we all used to laugh,
sitting around the table in the kitchen. Now, every time the screen
door slams, we all still think the same thing: It must be Tucker,
going back to his cabin.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Tucker Cluett died after a brief illness last spring at age
65. A fastidious, sophisticated bachelor with loads of personal
style, a smart address in Blue Hill, Maine, and a taste for fine
art and rare books, Tucker will be missed by all who knew him. But
few people will mourn him as viscerally as his staff at Maclennan
Lodge, which he owned and operated here, among the towering spruce
trees and shimmering poplars of remote New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, who was free from pretension, threw all his energy into
making the camp an enchanted place. But what really distinguished
him from many other camp owners was that he wanted his staff to
enjoy the same camp experience as the fanciest of his guests.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the lodge, in this largely impoverished, fiercely rural
area, became Tucker's unlikely second home, complete with a family
of five: the guides, Ollie Marshall and David and Shane Mann, who
are brothers; and the cooks and housekeepers, Nancy Thomas and Anne
Murray. The guides and Nancy had worked for Tucker since the year
after he bought the lodge, in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't like our boss,'' David Mann said. ``He was more like
a brother.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marshall suffered a detached retina a few years ago, Tucker
drove him to Halifax, Nova Scotia, for surgery, and brought him
home as well, a seven-hour drive each way. And when Shane Mann's
infant son Blake had meningitis, requiring his father's presence at
a hospital in Moncton, New Brunswick, 212 miles away, Shane was
resigned to giving up his job. But Tucker wouldn't hear of it. Each
Friday while Shane remained away, he hand-delivered Shane's
paycheck to his wife, Kathy.
</P>
<P>
   The bond Tucker developed with his staff was deep, cemented with
humor and crude practical jokes like filling Ollie's shoes with
rocks, or setting off fireworks under the kitchen table. When
Tucker set out smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres for the staff, he
always made an odd number, because he enjoyed watching the guides
fight over the last piece. No fools, the guides invariably found
ways to turn the joke around.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday paydays the staff made a point of formality, driving
Tucker to distraction by calling him by a name for which he had
little use, Cluett. One Friday morning Tucker, feigning a fit of
anger, tore up the staff's pay packets, and stomped out of the
kitchen. He then watched through a back window as Nancy frantically
fished the checks out of the trash and, finding them blank, lit out
after him.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds a little silly, written down like this, but it
worked, probably because Tucker, who had been a painfully shy,
overweight child, got a reward he couldn't have anticipated when he
bought the camp: he got to be a kid again, and this time without
all the bad bits. And it worked because Tucker could truly be
himself among the spirited, cheerful, unspoiled people on his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tucker fit in better here than we ever imagined,'' Nancy said.
``I think we brought out something in him that he could only
express here.''
</P>
<P>
   The salmon took my fly on the last cast of what might very well
have been my last trip to Maclennan Lodge. It leapt like a hurled
knife, destroying the oppressive stillness as it fell back into the
river with a resounding splash. Ollie moved fast now, firing up the
motor, making for shore, as the powerful fish tore off line,
heading downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, time was moving, and fast. Far below, I saw a great,
momentary gleam of silver in the river. It vanished, just as
quickly as 20 years _ and a friend _ had passed.

RELIGION JOURNAL: RABBI SEES OPPORTUNITY IN FIRE AT HIS SYNAGOGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Rabbi David Bateman arrived in the United States from
Israel for a visit this month, he came with a harrowing story _ and
a determination to try to make good come from it.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman, 46, is the American-born spiritual leader of Kehilat
Ya'ar Ramot, a Conservative synagogue in Jerusalem, which became
famous a month ago after it was attacked by arsonists.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze occurred just after the Sabbath, consuming prayer
books and furniture. But it stopped short of the ark, leaving the
synagogue's three Torah scrolls undamaged. Still, the crime was so
traumatic within Israel that Prime Minister Ehud Barak declared
that it ``causes every Jew to shudder.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fire's immediate aftermath, some voiced suspicion that
the arsonists might be young men on an extreme fringe of a
fervently Orthodox group _ this in a nation where considerable
tension exists between Orthodox Jews, the dominant religious group
in a largely secular society, and the Reform and Conservative
movements, which are far smaller in Israel than in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bateman has spoken at American synagogues about the
incident, he said, he has made clear he does not want to cast
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it only contributes to the problem that set the fire,
by pointing fingers at communities that indeed are not
responsible'' for it, he said in an interview this week. Of the
attack, he added, ``No truly religious person would perform that
kind of act.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the rabbi regards the incident as an opportunity to
create understanding across lines that divide Jews in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Although the fire caused great shock, he said, ``within 48
hours, we had a public rally that drew hundreds.'' The gathering
drew Israelis from groups that do not often rub shoulders:
``Orthodox representatives, including ultra-Orthodox, the secular
community, Reform representatives,'' Bateman said, recalling who
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture of solidarity gave Bateman and his congregation a
vision of how things might be. It was, he said, ``a kind of peak
moment, where the significant differences that divide us were put
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed as a community to try to capitalize on that
peak moment,'' Bateman added, ``and hope to build with our
neighbors a communitywide program that will promote tolerance,
coexistence, and hopefully will be a model that will be replicable
in other communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bateman grew up in Portland, Ore., in what he described as a
not-too-observant household. In his youth, he found his way to
Orthodox Judaism, trained as a rabbi and served an Orthodox
synagogue in Randolph, N.J., for more than a decade, until he moved
to Israel two years ago. Last fall, he became rabbi at Khelit
Ya'ar, with about 100 families affiliated with the Masorti
movement, as Conservative Judaism is called in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   What he and his congregation would like to create, he said, is a
long-term effort to bring people together, with a speakers' program
for adults, an educational effort in schools, a summer camp for
children from different backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked what he made of the turn his life has taken: that
after he immigrates to Israel, he finds himself articulating a
vision of social peace and unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord works in mysterious ways,'' Rabbi Bateman replied.
``For years, I've considered myself a principled pluralist, which
is what enabled me to make the transition from a primarily Orthodox
orientation to the Masorti community. I've been deeply concerned
with the divisions among the Jewish community, and wanted to get
involved in narrowing those rifts and bringing people together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Through circumstances not under my control,'' he said, ``I've
been thrust into the middle of that undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Episcopalians Call For the Removal of Guns
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, when leaders of the Episcopal Church were wrapping
up their General Convention, a policy-making gathering that meets
every three years, news centered on how they handled a statement on
human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   But the Episcopalians also adopted several other resolutions,
with far less fanfare, one of which calls on members of the
2.4-million-member church to remove guns from their homes, as a
step toward protecting children from gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, says the resolution, ``calls upon all members of
the church to work intentionally in their several communities,
legislatures and institutions toward the removal of handguns and
assault weapons from our homes, other residential communities and
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution came from the church's Diocese of Chicago, which
adopted a similar statement this year. ``I think people are just
fed up with the amount of violence in our society and the ready
availability of guns for people of any age,'' said Bishop William
D. Persell of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``So often in the church, we call on the government or we call
on someone else to do something,'' he said. ``For credibility, we
should talk about our own lives first.''  &QL;

IN THE END, SMOKE SUCCUMBED TO ONE MAN'S FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The verdict turned, as many verdicts do, on which lawyer
the jury believed. In the history-making class-action suit filed on
behalf of some 500,000 Florida smokers against the tobacco
industry, the jury believed the lawyer for the plaintiffs, a tall,
lanky, balding, rumpled, studious man named Stanley Rosenblatt.
</P>
<P>
   And what the jury believed about Rosenblatt, who was prone to
flap his arms in agitation like some gigantic bird, was that he was
mad.
</P>
<P>
   Not mad as in insane, but foot-stomping, red-faced, hollering
mad, at everybody on the defendants' side of the room in Miami-Dade
Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   He was mad at the calm, measured, almost smug tobacco
executives, who said that yes, the companies had peddled a
dangerous, cancer-causing product but that they now wanted only to
be responsible corporate citizens.
</P>
<P>
   And he was mad at their lawyers, who were asking the jury not to
punish the industry for its negligence and fraud because their
clients were really good guys now. The tobacco lawyers, in
Rosenblatt's view, played the jury for a bunch of suckers. ``I have
a temper,'' Rosenblatt said, still a little angry a week later.
``And they made me mad.''
</P>
<P>
   To the jurors, speaking after their decision on July 14 to award
the plaintiffs a record $144.8 billion in punitive damages,
Rosenblatt's rants seemed like righteous anger, not just
role-playing by one more lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't like phonies, and there were a couple of them on
the other side,'' Rosenblatt said in an accent flavored in part by
his native Brooklyn and in part by a very specific vernacular that
people here call Old Miami Beach, from a time when the town was
still largely Jewish and the accents tended to be more Yankee and
European.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt, 64, and his wife, Susan Goldman Rosenblatt, 49, who
is also a lawyer, took this case six years ago, when others would
not touch it, scared away by what had been the industry's
relentless success in the nation's courtrooms. The Rosenblatts
handled every aspect of the fight themselves, from the research to
trial preparation to the actual courtroom battles that at times
became so loud that Judge Robert Kaye had to quiet down Rosenblatt
and the tobacco lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   As Rosenblatt argued his case, he often did so with a second
chair empty. His wife was back at the office, surrounded by a
jungle of files, boxes and legal documents, preparing the next
day's moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was chasing windmills,'' Mrs. Rosenblatt said of
how she felt when they first took the case. The opposition was just
so strong. On the other side of the courtroom, each of the
defendants, the nation's five top cigarette makers, would have a
battery of lawyers and staff.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Big Tobacco that should have worried.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, as the trial dragged on, the cigarette makers sat
in a glass house, and Stanley Rosenblatt stood outside the door
with a big pile of stones. The 400,000 deaths a year attributed to
cigarette smoke for the last 50 years could not be excused away, he
said. And as the tobacco lawyers tried to counter him, he just kept
flinging stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has left a half-century trail of deceit, which
has decimated millions of Americans,'' he said in his closing
argument. ``Never have so few caused so much harm to so many for so
long, and the day of reckoning has arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rosenblatt told the story of death and loss, at least one
juror was brought to tears. Later Joel R. Wolpe, a Miami lawyer who
has litigated against Rosenblatt and went to law school at the
University of Miami with Mrs. Rosenblatt, would say in an
interview: ``Stanley's trying to bring out the truth; the other
lawyers were not trying to bring out the truth. All juries want is
what we want _ the truth. That's not expecting too much. I think
Stanley's very sincere in a courtroom. He's a sincere, honest,
honorable man, and I think it comes across.''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the verdict, the front-page headline in The Miami
Herald read, ``No-Name Lawyers Make History.'' That irked
Rosenblatt a little, because although he and his wife were not
household names, they were well known in Miami's legal community.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he has been beating Big Tobacco for a while now. In
April he won $12.7 million in compensatory damages from the same
jury. And in 1997 he won $349 million in a class-action lawsuit
brought by flight attendants alleging harm from secondhand smoke.
He used money from his fees in that case to help finance this one.
</P>
<P>
   The battle required some sacrifices. The Rosenblatts have nine
children, ages 7 to 19, and family time was cut back.
</P>
<P>
   They live in Miami Beach, in a big house once owned by Anita
Bryant, the singer who became better known for anti-gay activism.
The house, Mrs. Rosenblatt said, is a disaster. ``Delegating
doesn't seem to work,'' she said of the children.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing the trial did not change was the exercise of their
religious beliefs. The Rosenblatts are Orthodox Jews, and never
worked on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt arrived in Miami Beach with his family when he was
10, because a sister had health problems and a doctor had suggested
a move from Brooklyn to a warmer climate. His father made a living
by selling secondhand restaurant equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt was a gifted student who finished college in two and
a half years, majoring in government at the University of Miami,
before moving on to law school there. He had started college at the
University of Florida in Gainesville but got homesick and came back
to finish in Miami. He became a lawyer, he said, because ``I like
to be my own boss; I follow my instincts _ the right or wrong is
usually very clear to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people once questioned why the Rosenblatts would take this
case. One reason, he said, was his discovery that his children's
pediatrician, a very intelligent man, was still addicted to
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That struck me,'' Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not personal, this battle, at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never bought a pack in my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then they made him mad.

HALL OPENS DOORS TO A STAR ONCE SHUNNED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ky., Ohio, Mass., Ill.)  (EDS: Sunday is July 23) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last spring, an off-Broadway theater presented ``Cobb,'' an
intriguing play about a well-documented baseball icon from the
early 20th century. Three actors portrayed Ty Cobb at different
periods of his life. Meeting moments after the death of the Georgia
Peach, the three Cobbs debated his athletic greatness, his racism
and his fiery temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Drifting and chatting among them was an actor playing the role
of Oscar Charleston, ``the Black Ty Cobb,'' who, like Cobb, is a
member of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
Charleston, the play suggested, might have been Cobb's equal but
could not play against him in the major leagues because of racial
restrictions that stood until 1947. The ghostly characters
represented an element of American history that still haunts both
the national pastime and the entire culture.
</P>
<P>
   That play came to mind last week because of what will take place
at Cooperstown on Sunday. The annual Hall of Fame induction
ceremonies will include Norman ``Turkey'' Stearnes, an outfielder
from the Negro leagues who would be 99 years old if he were still
alive. Stearnes had something in common with both Cobb and
Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cobb, Stearnes played center field for a Detroit team in
the early 1920s. Cobb was then the veteran star of the Detroit
Tigers in the American League and Stearnes was the young star of
the Detroit Stars of the Negro National League. When I interviewed
Stearnes in 1979, two months before he died, I asked, ``Who was the
best baseball player you ever saw?''
</P>
<P>
   Without hesitation, Stearnes said, ``Oscar Charleston,'' adding
quickly that ``Joe DiMaggio was one of the best in the white
league.'' He never played against Cobb, Stearnes told me, but he
barnstormed against Babe Ruth's 1927 Yankees. He told me other
things, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit in the bleachers, I know a lot of boys, and I have fun
out there with them,'' he said, referring to his senior years as a
fan in Tiger Stadium's center-field seats. ``We talk. We discuss
things without fighting.'' Of baseball, in general, Stearnes said:
``It's a good game. It's the best game known. People like it. You
go to see it, you'll enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   I have those quotes and others on an audio cassette from a Negro
leagues reunion in Greenup, Ky., in 1979. Although better-known
players attended, I worked for a Detroit newspaper then and
Stearnes was our local angle. When I played that tape again last
week, I also heard the voice of Stearnes' daughter, Joyce Thompson,
who was with her ailing father during the interview. At the time,
her father had cancer. He spoke in a thick accent of his native
Nashville. He was hard of hearing, having worked in the roar of the
foundry at the Ford Rouge plant for 27 years, so she helped keep
the conversation going.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the tape, I heard the voice of Ray Dandridge, another
Negro leagues star and Hall of Famer, who stopped by the table for
Stearnes' autograph. During the conversation, Joyce voiced a
poignant plea for her father. ``I wish he could get in the Hall of
Fame,'' she said. ``At one point, there was talk about it. They
never, ever follow through on it.''
</P>
<P>
   I had not talked with Joyce for more than 20 years, since her
father's funeral. Last week seemed like a good time to call. ``I
haven't cried in a long time,'' a joyful Joyce said from suburban
Detroit, where she teaches deaf children. ``But I was talking to my
daughter and I just started crying.'' Her daughter, a high school
senior, is a basketball player, an athlete just like her
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish she could have known him,'' Joyce said. ``I wish he
could have been here for his induction. People say, `Better late
than never.' Yeah, I guess. Better late than never.''
</P>
<P>
   Stearnes is the 17th Negro leagues player to be inducted. Also
entering Sunday will be Sparky Anderson, the former manager of the
Detroit Tigers and Cincinnati Reds; Tony Perez, the first baseman
on Anderson's Big Red Machine; Carlton Fisk, the catcher with
Boston and Chicago; and Bid McPhee, an infielder for the Reds in
the 19th century. I covered Anderson in Detroit and I like him, but
Stearnes interests me the most. At that reunion in 1979, Stearnes
kept his distance from most other Negro leaguers, who remembered
his individualistic ways when he was a home run-hitting All-Star.
Ray Sheppard, one of his Detroit teammates, said Stearnes ``was a
peculiar guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a loner,'' Sheppard said. ``He didn't run with anybody
or fool around or drink. You couldn't use his bat or glove.
Sometimes he didn't want a locker by you.''
</P>
<P>
   William ``Judy'' Johnson, a Hall of Famer from the Negro
leagues, told me that Stearnes was very particular about his bat.
``If he made out, he'd sit there holding it and talking. `I hit
that good,' he'd say,''' Johnson said. ``I believe sometimes he
carried that bat to bed with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said Stearnes carried the bat to center field during
pregame practice so that no one would borrow it. Highly paid at
$600 a month, Stearnes watched for holes in the outfield fence and
chased children back through them when they snuck into the ballpark
without paying.
</P>
<P>
   His career ran from 1923 through 1942, and he also played for
the Chicago American Giants and the Kansas City Monarchs, among
other teams. Stearnes said he got his nickname as a boy because he
had a pot belly and ran with his arms flapping. As a man, he was
tall and lean with big, strong hands.
</P>
<P>
   His left-handed batting stance, others recalled, was odd, with
his back foot in the bucket and his front foot raised. Statistics
of Negro leagues players are incomplete, but it is believed that
Stearnes led the Negro National League in home runs six times.
</P>
<P>
   Satchel Paige once called Stearnes ``one of the greatest hitters
. . . as good as anybody.'' Cool Papa Bell once said of Stearnes,
``If they don't put him in the Hall of Fame, they shouldn't put
anyone in.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he is in, with Paige, Bell, Cobb, Charleston, Ruth and
DiMaggio. My knowledge of Stearnes is the shallow and fleeting kind
of a journalist, but the memories of him are vivid and fond. In
Detroit, we visited home plate at Tiger Stadium, the first time he
had ever stepped on that field. We took a photograph in his batting
stance, wearing a dress suit and hat. I sat next to him on the
flight home from Kentucky. His daughter thought it was the first
time he had traveled in the air, but Stearnes said he had flown
previously with Paige and a team long before.
</P>
<P>
   A man born before the Wright brothers first flew at Kitty Hawk,
Stearnes told me he preferred the peaceful rhythms of train travel
and he recited station stops on the line to Los Angeles. For a
while, with the jet engines humming, he closed his eyes and sang,
in a low and melodic voice, about ``Old-Time Religion'' and ``My
Country, 'Tis of Thee.''
</P>
<P>
   Another song, I don't know the title, included the lyrics ``long
ago, long ago'' and ``everything's got to go.'' At one point,
Stearnes stopped singing, opened his eyes, looked out the window
and said suddenly: ``Lord, we're above the clouds. What man can
do.''

MICHAEL ALDRICH, 51, NEUROLOGIST AND AUTHORITY ON SLEEP DISORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., Va.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Sherman Aldrich, a neurologist who explored and
explained the mysteries of sleep and sleep disorders, died on July
18 at his home in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was bone cancer, said the University of Michigan
Health System, where Aldrich founded the Sleep Disorders Laboratory
in 1985. Three months ago the university named it for him.
</P>
<P>
   When Aldrich established the center, sleep disorders were still
regarded largely as a domain of psychiatry. He approached them as a
neurologist, looking for their roots in nervous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a person like Mike Aldrich to start systematically
studying normal sleep and abnormal sleep, and connecting sleep
problems to neurological disorders,'' said Dr. Sid Gilman,
neurology chairman at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich's earlier studies involved strokes, degenerative disease
and blindness with a neurological cause.
</P>
<P>
   After his focus shifted to sleep disorders, he contributed to
the understanding of apnea, which temporarily stops a sleeper's
breathing. He also became an expert on the effects of alcohol on
sleep and the interaction of sleep and epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest to Aldrich was narcolepsy, a frequent,
overpowering desire to sleep. He studied its causes and symptoms
and developed diagnostic techniques that allow physicians to
distinguish it from other types of abnormal sleepiness. His
knowledge of the subject gained him an international reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich's research produced four books, some 60 articles, and
many book chapters and abstracts. His latest book, ``Sleep
Medicine: Normal Sleep and Its Disorders'' (Oxford University
Press, 1999), presents a concise and comprehensive text for
clinicians, researchers and students.
</P>
<P>
   Under his stewardship the Sleep Disorders Laboratory grew into a
top-ranking center not just for research but for the diagnosis and
treatment of unusual sleepiness, insomnia and related conditions.
It also became a training ground for specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Aldrich grew up in Chicago where he developed an
interest in the field as a high school laboratory assistant to a
leading researcher of sleep deprivation, Dr. Allan Rechtschaffen,
at the University of Chicago. He continued to work in his mentor's
laboratory between semesters at Swarthmore College, from which he
graduated in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   While attending medical school at the University of Virginia he
became familiar with the psychiatric aspects of sleep disorders
when he spent a period with an expert in Edinburgh. He received his
medical degree in 1980 and trained in neurology at the University
of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich is survived by his wife, Dr. Leslie Aldrich; their three
children, Brian, Matthew and Jennifer; his parents, Dr. C. Knight
and Julie Aldrich of Charlottesville, Va.; two brothers, Robert, of
Washington, and Dr. Thomas, of Pelham, N.Y.; and a sister, Carol
Barkin of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.

DR. JOSEPHINE MARTIN, 84, HEALER OF RIGHTS WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., Miss., Ala.)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Josephine D. Martin, a psychiatrist who helped
rootless children, troubled adolescents and terrified civil rights
activists in a lifelong crusade to weld the healing of personal and
social wounds, died on July 6 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in
Manhattan. She was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, had long
battled an autoimmune disorder, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   She became known as the unofficial doctor to the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, or more personally, ``the
little lady doctor from up North.'' She had gone to Mississippi to
work with children under a precursor of the Head Start program and
diagnosed their bloated stomachs as resulting from acute
malnutrition. She soon found herself holding the hands of civil
rights workers as they experienced daily intimidation and
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just something we had never seen before,'' said Unita
Blackwell, one of the leaders in the fight to register black voters
in Mississippi in the 1960s, and now the mayor of Mayersville,
Miss. ``She was a white woman who was caring and loving.''
</P>
<P>
   As Molotov cocktails exploded on Blackwell's lawn in the Freedom
Summer of 1964, Martin sent Blackwell's traumatized 7-year-old son
to Vermont to attend summer camp. An abandoned New York City child
she took under her wing when he was 4 is now a lawyer who will help
direct a foundation to be set up in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Diaz was born in Tampa, Fla., on Dec. 31, 1915. Her
father was born in Spain, became a cigar maker, then immigrated to
Tampa. When Josephine was very young, her family moved to New York
City, where she attended elementary and high school.
</P>
<P>
   She contracted tuberculosis as a teen-ager and spent two years
in a sanitarium. At 19, she married a fellow patient, a social
worker named Earl Martin. They worked together organizing people
who had had tuberculosis to fight for better treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she attended several colleges. At the State
University of New York in Buffalo, she was offered a scholarship to
medical school, but the couple moved because of Earl Martin's job.
She eventually graduated from Hunter College.
</P>
<P>
   She then worked at jobs in medical research and marine biology.
Eventually, in her 30s, she entered medical school at Downstate
Medical Center in Brooklyn, borrowing and working to pay tuition.
</P>
<P>
   After divorcing Earl Martin, she married Cedric H. Belfrage, one
of the founders of the leftist National Guardian. He was forced to
leave the United States because of his political views, said
Martin's third and last husband, Robert J. Schwartz. ( Belfrage is
deceased, as is Earl Martin.)
</P>
<P>
   Martin went with Belfrage to London, where she qualified to work
for the National Health System; while there, she treated W.E.B. Du
Bois, the sociologist and black protest leader, for a heart
ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, she felt she needed to know more about patients'
personal histories and living conditions. Psychiatry seemed a way
to bridge the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, she entered a psychiatric residency at
Bellevue Hospital and stayed on as a full-time psychiatrist working
with children and adolescents. She started a day program for
mentally ill youths, and, because public schools often refused to
accept them, she also set up an educational program for them at
Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, after her divorce from Belfrage, she married Schwartz,
a banker who had helped her with financial matters. Schwartz was
also an economist who organized members of his profession to push
for arms reductions. He became a leading advocate of investing in
socially responsible enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my husbands were wonderful men, each appropriate for his
time,'' Martin liked to say.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, 1963, she and Schwartz went to Baltimore to
participate in a demonstration against an amusement park that
refused to admit blacks. They spent the night in jail. On July 8,
the Baltimore City Council passed an emergency resolution to set up
a human rights commission to mediate the park's racial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better way to spend the Fourth of July than to go to jail
in the war for independence for millions of Americans whose freedom
from tyranny did not come with the Declaration of Independence of
1776?'' she wrote in the National Guardian at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Martin took an extended vacation from Bellevue to go
south, where she worked in the Mississippi Child Development
Center, the forerunner of Head Start. Her interest in the South
dated to 1950, when she became friends with Claude Williams, a
white preacher working to integrate his church in Fungo Hollow,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly became involved in the civil rights movement as
tensions were escalating. She contributed her medical knowledge in
teaching sessions and her psychiatric skills in individual sessions
with frayed and frightened campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some, more disturbed, under constant stress, decompensated or
engaged in provocative behavior, putting themselves and others at
risk,'' Martin wrote in an autobiographical essay. ``On occasion,
hospitalization became necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   She sent the troubled civil rights workers to Manhattan, to
Gracie Square Hospital, where she had contacts, for fear of what
might happen to them in Southern hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1972 book, ``The Making of a Black Revolutionary,'' James
Forman wrote a personal inscription in the copy he gave Martin. It
said that she ``helped me to unravel many of the conflicting
tendencies caused by a very active life, enabling me to bring focus
and greater clarity to this head.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said that several times Forman, a leader in the
Southern struggle, would arrive at their Manhattan apartment saying
it was impossible to return to Mississippi. He would consult with
Martin, and ``10 days later he was back again,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Likening the situation to a MASH unit, Blackwell said, ``She was
the doctor who was on the battleground.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin soon found other battlegrounds back home. Working for St.
Luke's-Roosevelt, she set up an innovative home care psychiatric
program for residents of welfare hotels. At the Jewish Board of
Family and Children's Services, she worked with troubled
adolescents, homeless families and others who needed help.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she socialized in Schwartz's world of Wall
Street financiers. During a pause in the conversation, she would
say, ``How about giving some clothing to the poor kids at
Bellevue?''
</P>
<P>
   Boxes would soon arrive at the hospital's door.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said her life added up to simply doing the next right
thing. ``I had never had the notion that my role was to `do good'
or `empower' anybody,'' she said, ``but to be able to offer my
skills as needed, to live my life as seemed right to me.''

 &HT;    Are you older than 18? Of sound mind and body? Not acting under
undue influence? Then why don't you have a will?
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Welcome to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? The mortality rate is 100 percent. And contrary to
what the Egyptians believed, evidence points to the unsettling fact
that you cannot take it with you.
</P>
<P>
   Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. Then, someone, somewhere will don
your gay apparel, drive your car and raise your child. Want to be
able to speak from the grave and determine who gets the Spode
Christmas china? Don't trust relatives and friends to remember that
Aunt Charlotte's emerald ring goes to the first grandchild born on
a Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   You need a will. A duly executed, properly witnessed,
comprehensive will.
</P>
<P>
   The worst states to die in? California and Ohio, where
complicated laws and mandatory fees make distributing assets
expensive. That is just one of the things I learned from several
attorneys, all board-certified in wills and estates, and a
professor who literally wrote the book on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Wills make interesting reading, revealing so much about their
writers.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Franklin left daughter Sarah a picture of the King of
France (set with 408 diamonds) on the proviso that she would not
reset the diamonds into ornaments for herself or her daughters and
thereby ``countenance the expensive vain and useless fashion of
wearing jewels in this country. ``Ben and I do not share
philosophies here.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine poor Louis XVI of France, who from his prison cell
in 1792 wrote a last testament exhorting that his son, ``should he
have the misfortune of becoming king,'' to forget ``all hates and
grudges.'' (Louis was a better person than I.)
</P>
<P>
   And what was cobbler Charles Cairine conjuring when he left a
complex will bequeathing the rents from his Scottish farmlands to
his brother's male descendants with the birthday closest to Nov.
11? Last March, the latest beneficiary in the 256 years of Cairin
generosity learned he will receive more than $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis leave her good friend and
companion Maurice Tempelsman a Greek alabaster head?
</P>
<P>
   And who could forget poor Vivien Leigh's brilliant azure eyes?
She bequeathed them to an organ bank, only to have them rejected
because she suffered tuberculosis. Sometimes, you can take it with
you.
</P>
<P>
   Are you among the estimated 70 percent who do not have a will?
Do you regularly shush that nagging little voice that admonishes
you for not appointing a guardian and executing a durable power of
attorney? Wonder what the heck a power of attorney is, anyway, and
where to get one? Care to find out what power Frank Sinatra exerts
from the beyond and what the heck holographic means? Then this
edition of the Greig Files will enlighten and amuse you.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, experience will power _ Use this Greig Files as an
excuse to write a will, any kind of will.
</P>
<P>
   WHY IS IT CALLED A LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT?
</P>
<P>
   In early English law, personal property was disposed of by a
legal instrument called a will; however, real property (castles,
moats, real estate) was disposed of by a testament. So a person of
means had both a will and testament in order to dispose of both
types of property. Nowadays, the phrase is redundant because a will
disposes of both real and personal property.
</P>
<P>
   WHO NEEDS A WILL?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone 18 or older with a stick of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Want to hear something really scary? The Texas Legislature has
written a will for everyone, notes UT School of Law professor
Stanley Johanson. You can write your own will, of course. It is
legal to do so. But it is also legal to take out your own appendix
_ generally not a good idea, remarks Johanson. Even with a properly
executed will, sometimes tragedy strikes _ usually in the form of a
legal pad and pen as folks decide to write their own codicils. Mary
Mayfield Gooch did just that, and in the ensuing litigation (two
trips to the Texas Supreme Court and one denial by the U.S. Supreme
Court), the City of Austin, the Austin National Bank and the Humane
Society lost some of what Gooch (yes, the Mayfield Park Mary)
wanted to bequeath.
</P>
<P>
   WHO GETS THE LA-Z-BOY IF I DO NOT HAVE A WILL?
</P>
<P>
   Well, cowboy, when and how did you acquire the national chair of
Texas? (Is it leather?)
</P>
<P>
   In the Lone Star State, a community property state, your spouse
receives half of all the property acquired during marriage with the
remaining half passing to your children. Are your children the same
as your spouse's? (Not everyone's are.) Then all community property
is inherited by the spouse, notes attorney William Pargaman.
</P>
<P>
   Separate property (anything inherited during the marriage or
owned before the marriage) is governed by another set of rules.
Married with children? One third of separate real estate passes to
your spouse for life; the remainder goes to your descendants. Once
your spouse dies, his or her one-third must go to your children as
well. Separate personal property however, (items such as stocks,
jewelry or money), passes one-third outright to your spouse (who
may then bequeath the goods to anyone) and two-thirds to your
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a will, those who have smaller assets suffer the
most,'' concludes Pargaman, ``as their beneficiaries suffer the
expensive court costs to receive remaining assets.''
</P>
<P>
   DO MILLIONS GO TO THE DOGS?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes dogs receive the lion's share. Estates have been left
to fish and fowl.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that about 25 percent of pet owners include
animals in their wills. Making a conditional gift to a pet's
caregiver in trust is a reliable method of providing for Fido.
</P>
<P>
   The largest known bequest was to the lucky canines (all 150 of
them) of Quaker State heiress Eleanor Ritchey. Her estate was
willed to a veterinary research program at Auburn University in
1968 with the stipulation that her canine friends were well cared
for. Ritchey's original $4.2 million increased to more than $10
million before the last dog died.
</P>
<P>
   CAN'T I JUST WRITE MY OWN?
</P>
<P>
   If you must.
</P>
<P>
   Properly dated holographic wills _ written entirely by the
person whose will it is. Other wills (written by someone else,
typed or a form) must be properly executed, witnessed and signed by
two people in the presence of the person whose will it is, says
attorney Sara Atkins of Saunders &AMP; Norval LLP.
</P>
<P>
   When writing your will, be as specific as possible (``I give''
and ``I bequeath''), and remember, most wills are probated, or
proved to be genuine, so appoint an independent executor to serve
without bond.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to cause problems for heirs. Why not spend a
few hundred dollars up front to make sure the will is properly
drawn? A holographic will is better than no will at all. Going up
the ladder, a form will from a CD or book (reminds me of Mad Libs
for heirs), then a will drawn up by an attorney, any attorney.
</P>
<P>
   DID MAMA REALLY SAY YOU COULD HAVE THE MING DISH?
</P>
<P>
   Funny how what Mama promised but failed to write down can make
enemies of the best sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Itemizing your wishes is one gift to your heir that will not be
forgotten. Feeling feisty? Do what Frank Sinatra and Gene
Roddenberry did. Insert a provision that contesters are
automatically disinherited. That should stop the haggling _ or at
least publicly mute it.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS A DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY?
</P>
<P>
   In the event you are unable to make health-care decisions for
yourself, a medical power of attorney for health care gives another
person the authority to make decisions for you.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Marilyn G. Miller does a substantial amount of
elder-law work and advises clients that no document is
self-executing, and ``such papers are only as good as the agent you
select.'' Once this document is properly executed and witnessed,
make copies for everyone _ your spouse, your children, your
neighbors, your pastor, your physician.
</P>
<P>
   In the planning mood? Consider a living will, a medical
directive of specific instructions regarding end-of-life care
decisions (e.g., artificial nutrition and hydration).
</P>
<P>
   DO ALL WILLS GO THROUGH PROBATE?
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under limited circumstances, if all family members with an
interest in the estate enter into a settlement agreement, it is not
necessary to have the will admitted to probate,'' advises attorney
Tom Barton.WHADDAYA MEAN, REVIEW IT?
</P>
<P>
   That's what you should do to your will every two to five years,
advises attorney Stephen Saunders. Even though a will represents
what you reasonably see down the road, things change. Children
become adults (employed, even); property is acquired (especially
problematic if it is in Louisiana, which is the only state that has
laws based on French code) financial situations turn. Occasionally,
the law changes. Touching base with your attorney costs little
(often nothing) and can save your heirs heartache.
</P>
<P>
   CHILLING THOUGHT: FROZEN ASSETS
</P>
<P>
   Most attorneys recommend wills and other important documents be
stored in a safety deposit box with copies sent to executors and
relatives. Not interested in standard security measures? Why not
store your papers in the freezer between the Blue Bell and the
venison sausage?
</P>
<P>
   The end-of-life planning kit, ``Before I Go, You Should Know,''
from the Funeral Consumers Alliance allows you to do just that. The
information comes with a plastic button-tie pouch with
state-specific Living Will and other advance directives, such as
``Death Away from Home,'' a directory of U.S. funeral consumer
groups, and a checklist of other important documents to store (such
as military discharge papers), plus a 20-page write-in booklet with
illustrations by Edward Gorey. (Yes, some call it ``The Gorey
Details'' packet.)
</P>

   Good way to spend a sawbuck ($10 includes shipping). Call (800)
765-0107 to order.
</P>
<P>
   FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO PROBATE
</P>
<P>
   _ Shortest will: Karl Tausch, January 1967, ``All to wife.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Record will verbiage: 95,940 words (4 volumes) by the
loquacious Mrs. Frederica Stilwell Cook, dated November 1925.
</P>
<P>
   _ Largesse award: To Mrs. Robert Hayes, who in her will
requested that her husband marry her stepdaughter from a previous
marriage within a week of the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alas, poor Yorick medal: To an anonymous business executive
who left his money to endow acting scholarships with the condition
his skull be used in a performance of Hamlet. It was.
</P>
<P>
   _ The bequest that begat: Charles Millar, who left the bulk of
his $1 million estate to the woman who gave birth to the most
children in Toronto in the 10 years after his death. The money was
shared by four ``winners,'' each with 10 children.
</P>

JOHN CAMPBELL, 88, EXPERT ON U.S. FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Coert Campbell, a former member of the State Department's
policy planning council and director of political studies at the
Council on Foreign Relations, died July 16 at his home in Cohasset,
Mass. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a political scientist, wrote extensively on the Middle
East and U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   He was a consultant and adviser to the State Department from
1963 to 1980 and a member of its policy planning council in 1967
while the Arab-Israeli war was going on and in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s he also served on an advisory panel for the State
Department's Bureau of Near East and South Asian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   His earlier State Department posts included specialist in
Eastern Europe from 1942 to 1946. He was officer in charge of
Balkan affairs and a member of the policy planning staff from 1949
to 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In his 27 years as a senior staff member of the Manhattan-based
Council on Foreign Relations, he drew on his firsthand experience
in making policy to provide analyses of world affairs. He was the
council's director of political studies from 1955 to 1962, senior
research fellow from 1962 to 1978 and director of studies from 1977
until 1978, when he retired.
</P>
<P>
   His writings on the Middle East include the books ``The West and
the Middle East'' (1972), written with Helen Caruso, and ``Defense
of the Middle East'' (1958).
</P>
<P>
   In a 1982 essay on the Middle East, he wrote, ``Every new
administration needs time to find its footing in foreign affairs,
especially in a complex and changing area like the Middle East, and
the Reagan team has taken as much or more time than its
predecessors.'' He added philosophically, ``Earlier
administrations, after all, broke their heads on these same
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He was on the board of governors of the Middle East Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Among his writings on Eastern Europe are the books ``American
Foreign Policy Toward Communist Eastern Europe'' (1965, Books on
Demand) and ``Tito's Separate Road'' (1967). He won an award in
1980, for contributing to Slavic studies, from the American
Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, he received from a bachelor's degree, a
master's degree and a doctorate, all from Harvard. His doctoral
dissertation was on Romania.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary, whom he married in 1936; two
sons, Allan R., of Auburndale, Mass., and A. Bruce, of Denver; and
three grandchildren.

ANGELS HELPING TO MAKE THE NEW A . L. WEST THE DOMINANT DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-NOTEBOOK)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because the New York Yankees have been in first place since the
All-Star game, they have not been in the wild-card race. But they
have not been so far in first place that they have not had to
notice the wild-card race. And when they look at the wild-card
race, what do they see? A couple of American League West teams as
close to them as their own breaths.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the West is challenging the East as the dominant
division in the league. The Yankees, the Toronto Blue Jays and the
Boston Red Sox? They have nothing on the Seattle Mariners, the
Anaheim Angels and the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's games, the West trio was a collective 6 1/2
games ahead of the East trio. The second-place Angels, the AL Wild
Card leader, were only 3 percentage points shy of the first-place
Yankees and the third-place Athletics were a game behind. More than
two months remain in the season, but before the wild-card race is
over, the Yankees could find out how well they had it when they had
huge division leads and did not have to pay attention to the teams
fighting for the fourth playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stoneman, for one, is not surprised at the developments in
the new West. He is the first-year general manager of the Angels, a
team that has extricated itself from the muck engendered by a
dysfunctional family and become a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looked at the division with skepticism,'' said
Stoneman, not only the leader of a division contender but also a
cheerleader for the division. ``Everybody but those of us in the
American League West. I don't think this is a surprise. It's
happening because there are some good clubs out here. If it hadn't
been for some injuries, Texas might be right with us and they're
close.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Stoneman added, ``It's possible and maybe even likely
that the wild-card club will come out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   What a shock that would be to the East, especially if the
Yankees should slip out of first and join the ``fourth-division''
race.
</P>
<P>
   It was mid to late-May when the Angels and the Athletics had
losing records. But in nine weeks before Saturday, the Angels had a
34-23 record (.596, translating to 96 victories for a whole season)
and in nearly eight weeks leading to Saturday, the Athletics had
compiled a 26-18 record (.591, or 95 season victories).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, in comparison, had a 28-32 record since May 10, a
.467 winning percentage that would produce 75 victories for the
entire season.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics have surprised no one because they served notice
last season that they were ready to play for the playoffs. The
Angels, on the other hand, began the season as an unknown. They had
a collection of good young players, but the team was devastated by
internal turmoil last season and no one knew if they would suffer a
lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
   It is now obvious they have not.
</P>
<P>
   With Mike Scioscia, the new manager, providing a calming
presence, the Angels' young players have performed so well that
Stoneman credits them with providing the foundation for the team's
good play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we didn't know,'' he said, ``was how comfortable
would some of the younger guys be, most particularly our young
starting pitchers and our catcher and our second baseman. How would
they perform and how comfortable would they be at this level for
the season? I think we're finding out to our delight that they
belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy, acquired with Kent Bottenfield in the Jim Edmonds
trade, has been the second baseman all season, playing in all but
three games. Bengie Molina has been the primary catcher. Brian
Cooper, Seth Etherton and Jarrod Washburn make up three-fifths of
the active starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, Molina, Cooper and Etherton are rookies, Washburn not
far removed from rookie status. The three pitchers began the season
in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the members of the team who are more experienced
than that group but still young: Darin Erstad, Troy Glaus, Garret
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who'da thunk it _ 26 home runs at the break?'' Stoneman said,
discussing Anderson's career-high contribution. Who could have
anticipated Erstad's 158-hit contribution entering Saturday's
games, giving him 28 more hits than the next most prolific hitter?
</P>
<P>
   But third baseman Glaus, at 23 the youngest regular in the
lineup, had a .610 slugging percentage, best on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone mention Edmonds?
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew all winter and almost all spring that four outfielders
didn't fit into three positions,'' said Stoneman, who also had
Anderson, Erstad and Tim Salmon. ``All four were quality
outfielders. Something was going to give here. It helped us fill
second base and stabilize our starting pitching, particularly at
the start of the year. It gave us a little bit of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield (6-8), as it developed, has the only losing record
among the starting pitchers. But that's the beauty of the
development of the young Angels, to have Washburn at 6-2, Etherton
5-1 and Cooper 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just single out the young guys,'' Stoneman said,
``but they've been the surprise.''

LARKIN DISCONNECTED; ANDERSON-TYPE PLAYER; UNDERCUTTING ROBINSON
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBA-WEST)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a long time, callers to the Cincinnati Reds offices were
greeted by a recording: ``Hi, this is Barry Larkin. Thanks for
calling the Cincinnati Reds. It's always nice to hear from a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   A caller mentioned to Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager,
Friday afternoon that if he traded the team's shortstop, the Reds
would have to change the greeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably should do that anyway,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later the voice of an anonymous woman had replaced
Larkin. ``Thank you for calling the Cincinnati Reds,'' she said.
She did not announce that the Reds had traded her predecessor to
the Mets, contingent on his approving the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do what Barry wants,'' Bowden had said, without
disclosing the trade. ``We have a lot of respect for what he's done
for us so if he feels it's in his best interests to be traded now,
we'll trade him. If he wants to finish the year with the Reds,
he'll finish the year with the Reds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said he had met on July 8 with Larkin, who has spent his
entire 14-year career with the Reds. ``He said he wanted to be
signed or be traded,'' Bowden said. ``He wanted it behind him. He
didn't want all the negativity. If we can't pay him the $27.9
million he wants _ and it's not negotiable _ and we can't sign him,
we should trade him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden sounded as sad as he was deliriously delighted when he
acquired Ken Griffey Jr. last February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always envisioned him finishing his career with the Reds,''
the general manager said, ``have his last at-bat with the Reds,
take his jersey off and carry it to left field and put it on the
wall. But things have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson-Type Player
</P>
<P>
   Sparky Anderson, who goes into the Hall of Fame Sunday, would
have loved Shane Halter. The former Cincinnati and Detroit manager
loved to use players at different positions _ the ubiquitous Tony
Phillips was a favorite _ and Halter would have been perfect to
have on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Halter is on the Tigers' bench now, that is, he is there when he
is not playing one of the positions on the field. This season he
has played all but the one on the mound, and he has started at all
of the others except the one behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Halter, 30, with three years in the major leagues, has started
five games at first base, one game at second, six at shortstop, 11
at third, one each in left field and right and three in center. He
also caught one inning in a July 4 game against Tampa Bay. Before
the season is over, maybe he will have an opportunity to match his
1998 experience _ he pitched an inning, a scoreless inning, for
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Hocking of Minnesota has not started at all of the
positions Halter has, but he has made more starts: 14 at second,
seven at short, eight at third, eight in left, seven in center, six
in right, a total of 50 to Halter's 28. Terry Shumpert of Colorado
has started 32 games at six positions: one at first, nine at
second, two at short, six at third, 13 in left and one as
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Maxwell, a Twins rookie, has become a junior Hocking,
startig 23 games at four different positions: nine at second, one
at short, 12 at third, one in right.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McEwing has not played as much with the Mets as he did with
St. Louis last season (128 starts at five different positions), but
he has displayed his versatility: three starts each at second and
third, six in left, 10 in center.
</P>
<P>
   Undercutting Robinson
</P>
<P>
   Frank Robinson has been labeled the dean of discipline, but it
is not likely that he will hold the position beyond this season if
Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer, continues to
slice his sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The latest reduced suspension was for Pete Vuckovich,
Pittsburgh's pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   When Leonard Coleman was National League president, he fined
Vuckovich for his choice of vulgar phrases in arguments with
umpires. Last month the coach also bumped umpire John Hirschbeck in
an argument over a balk call. Robinson suspended him for three
games; Beeston lowered it to two.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding the discipline for Carl Everett after he twice
bumped umpire Ron Kulpa, Robinson was apparently leaning toward a
longer sentence than the 10 games he issued, 12 games perhaps. But
baseball lawyers urged him to make the suspension no longer than 10
games. If Beeston reduces this one on appeal, it could nudge
Robinson closer to suspending his position.

RUTH WERNER, 93, COLORFUL AND DARING SOVIET SPY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BINDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Werner, a colorful and successful Soviet spy whose exploits
included radioing invaluable atomic bomb data to Moscow in the
middle of World War II, died on July 7 in Berlin. She was 93.
</P>
<P>
   In her 20 years as an intelligence operative in China, Poland,
Switzerland and England, she had a number of close calls. But she
always managed to extricate herself from the predicament _ unlike
Klaus Fuchs, the agent who fed her the British atomic bomb secrets,
who was imprisoned in Britain for nine and a half years, or Richard
Sorge, the master spy who recruited her, who was executed in Japan
in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Her espionage work was entwined with her romantic life, which
included an affair with one of her spy chiefs; later she married a
British Communist to become a British citizen and only later came
to love him. She told some but not all of her story in a 1974
autobiography, still observing the iron rules of conspiracy by
never mentioning Fuchs, who was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Werner was known by the code name Sonja, which was given to her
by Sorge in 1933. Ruth Werner was her pen name. All of her various
identities had their roots in a prosperous Jewish household in
Berlin, where she was born Ursula Ruth Kuczynski, one of six
children of Robert Rene and Berta Kuczynski. Her father was a
distinguished economist.
</P>
<P>
   Werner was drawn early to the communist movement and became a
member of the German Communist Party at 19. She was immediately
fired by the publishing house where she worked. Soon afterward she
met and married Rolf Hamburger, an architect.
</P>
<P>
   She started writing for the party newspaper, Rote Fahne. In
1930, having been told by the party that she would be contacted in
Shanghai, she moved with her husband to China.
</P>
<P>
   They began a pleasant bourgeois life, but she was waiting
impatiently for the promised contact. It took four months and
friendship with Agnes Smedley, an American leftist journalist, who
introduced her to Sorge. Sorge, then 35, had been the Shanghai
agent of the Soviet army's intelligence service for a year. The
service was known by its Russian initials, GRU.
</P>
<P>
   Sorge asked whether she was ready to face danger. She nodded and
agreed to make room available for his clandestine meetings with
Chinese Communists, the chief interest of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Werner joined the ring without her husband's knowledge, stored
weapons and hid a Chinese comrade who was on the run. Two years
later, when Sorge left Shanghai for Moscow, he recommended her to
the GRU.
</P>
<P>
   Though her marriage was deteriorating, she and her husband had
had a son, Michael, while in Shanghai. When the GRU asked her to go
to Moscow for training, she left the boy with in-laws in
Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   In the GRU school she learned Morse code, Russian and how to
build radio transmitters and receivers. In February 1934 she was
sent to turbulent Manchuria, which had been seized from China by
the Japanese. Her boss was Ernst, a former sailor, with whom she
became romantically involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our transmitter was the link between the partisans and the
Soviet Union,'' she wrote. She sent coded messages twice a week,
and bought and transported chemicals for explosives for the Chinese
Communist partisans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Moscow, fearing the two spies were about to be exposed,
ordered Werner and Ernst to flee China. She accepted an assignment
in Poland, this time with her husband, although she was pregnant
with Ernst's child. Her daughter, Janina, was born in April 1936.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1938 she was sent to Switzerland to set up a new spy
ring, again with her husband, but he soon left for the Far East. In
February 1939 she met Len Beurton, an English Communist who had
fought in Spain with the international brigades. For him, he once
wrote, it was ``love at first sight; she had a very good figure.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, the GRU authorized a marriage of convenience by which
Werner became British, but the love came to be mutual _ the
marriage lasted until his death three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Werner had already begun clandestine transmissions from a radio
set she had built in her rented house near Oxford when, in 1941,
she met Fuchs, who was working at the British atomic research
facility nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The two spies would bicycle into the countryside for their
meetings, and Fuchs would hand over written materials that, Werner
once told an interviewer, were ``like hieroglyphics.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Moss, author of ``Klaus Fuchs: The Man Who Stole the
Atomic Bomb'' 1987), said that Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's chief
aide, set up the Soviet atomic bomb project in 1942 as a result of
the information transmitted by Fuchs and Werner, and that the
information saved the Soviet researchers a great deal of time. The
Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Werner was also running other agents, including a Royal Air
Force officer, a specialist in submarine radar and even her brother
and father. She was once told that the chief of GRU had said, ``If
we had five Sonjas in England, the war would end sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s she and her family _ another son, Peter, had
been born in 1943 _ left England for East Berlin. Her only
connection with the GRU after that was in 1969, when she was
invited to a ceremony to receive her second Red Banner, the highest
Soviet military decoration.
</P>
<P>
   She turned to writing, producing some short stories; a biography
of Olga Benario, a German Communist who was gassed by the Nazis in
1942; and her autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her three children, five grandchildren and
three sisters.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Werner, a colorful and successful Soviet spy whose exploits
included radioing invaluable atomic bomb data to Moscow in the
middle of World War II, died on July 7 in Berlin. She was 93.
</P>
<P>
   In her 20 years as an intelligence operative in China, Poland,
Switzerland and England, she had a number of close calls. But she
always managed to extricate herself from the predicament _ unlike
Klaus Fuchs, the agent who fed her the British atomic bomb secrets,
who was imprisoned in Britain for nine and a half years, or Richard
Sorge, the master spy who recruited her, who was executed in Japan
in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Her espionage work was entwined with her romantic life, which
included an affair with one of her spy chiefs; later she married a
British Communist to become a British citizen and only later came
to love him. She told some but not all of her story in a 1974
autobiography, still observing the iron rules of conspiracy by
never mentioning Fuchs, who was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Werner was known by the code name Sonja, which was given to her
by Sorge in 1933. Ruth Werner was her pen name. All of her various
identities had their roots in a prosperous Jewish household in
Berlin, where she was born Ursula Ruth Kuczynski, one of six
children of Robert Rene and Berta Kuczynski. Her father was a
distinguished economist.
</P>
<P>
   Werner was drawn early to the communist movement and became a
member of the German Communist Party at 19. She was immediately
fired by the publishing house where she worked. Soon afterward she
met and married Rolf Hamburger, an architect.
</P>
<P>
   She started writing for the party newspaper, Rote Fahne. In
1930, having been told by the party that she would be contacted in
Shanghai, she moved with her husband to China.
</P>
<P>
   They began a pleasant bourgeois life, but she was waiting
impatiently for the promised contact. It took four months and
friendship with Agnes Smedley, an American leftist journalist, who
introduced her to Sorge. Sorge, then 35, had been the Shanghai
agent of the Soviet army's intelligence service for a year. The
service was known by its Russian initials, GRU.
</P>
<P>
   Sorge asked whether she was ready to face danger. She nodded and
agreed to make room available for his clandestine meetings with
Chinese Communists, the chief interest of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Werner joined the ring without her husband's knowledge, stored
weapons and hid a Chinese comrade who was on the run. Two years
later, when Sorge left Shanghai for Moscow, he recommended her to
the GRU.
</P>
<P>
   Though her marriage was deteriorating, she and her husband had
had a son, Michael, while in Shanghai. When the GRU asked her to go
to Moscow for training, she left the boy with in-laws in
Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   In the GRU school she learned Morse code, Russian and how to
build radio transmitters and receivers. In February 1934 she was
sent to turbulent Manchuria, which had been seized from China by
the Japanese. Her boss was Ernst, a former sailor, with whom she
became romantically involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our transmitter was the link between the partisans and the
Soviet Union,'' she wrote. She sent coded messages twice a week,
and bought and transported chemicals for explosives for the Chinese
Communist partisans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Moscow, fearing the two spies were about to be exposed,
ordered Werner and Ernst to flee China. She accepted an assignment
in Poland, this time with her husband, although she was pregnant
with Ernst's child. Her daughter, Janina, was born in April 1936.

FOR KELLY AND RAINES, OLYMPIC DREAMS BEGIN FAR FROM THE MAJORS
</HEADLINE>
  By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEWATER, N.J. _ Uncustomarily, the two former New York
Yankees _ both, it happens, coming from Florida _ paid for their
own flights, dug into their own pockets for rental cars and lugged
their own luggage to the hotel in order to play in four games for,
yes, the Somerset Patriots, an independent team ensconced in the
middle of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Both Tim Raines, the outfielder, and Pat Kelly, the second
baseman, had been cut from the Yankees and the Angels,
respectively, in spring training and, after illness and injuries,
it appeared that the sun had sunk on their playing careers.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, at 40 and a veteran of 21 major league seasons with four
teams, was sitting home in Lake Mary, Fla., organizing the opening
in late summer of the Tim Raines Baseball School in nearby Sanford,
when he received a phone call in June from Bob Watson, the former
Yankees general manager and now chairman of the selection committee
for the U.S. Olympic baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim,'' Watson said, ``do you think you can still play?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, yes,'' replied Raines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, do you want to play?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Where?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bridgewater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridgewater!''
</P>
<P>
   ``With hopes of making the Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' said Raines.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, in Tampa, had received a similar call from Watson, while
at home with his wife, Rebecca, who had given birth on March 31 to
their first child, Charlotte. ``I was just home playing dad when
Bob called,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, at 32 and primarily a fringe nine-year major league
player with four teams, had retired from baseball after a last
attempt with the Angels last spring, and after a third operation on
his right shoulder, the one he uses to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob knew that Rebecca is from Australia, and that her family
still lives in Adelaide,'' Kelly said. ``And since the Olympics are
in Sydney this year, he thought I might have a special interest in
trying out for the team and going there.'' He laughed, recalling
this. ``When I told Rebecca, she said, `Get that arm going!'''
</P>
<P>
   So here he was, before the game last Tuesday evening, in the
dugout and wearing the pinstripes of the Somerset Patriots. And
Raines, a seven-time All-Star, was nearby. Each was hoping to
impress the selection committee, to show not only that they have
retained a semblance of their hitting and fielding skills, but that
they were truly dedicated to contributing to the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I had to come here to do that,'' Raines said, ``I
thought it would be worth the try. What an opportunity _ to have a
chance at an Olympic gold medal, to go along with my World Series
rings. The Olympics were always a dream for me, but making the
major leagues was a bigger dream. And I achieved that. And the
Olympics were always held during the baseball season, and they were
always for amateurs, so there was no chance for me. Now there is.
Now everything has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said, ``To be wearing the `USA' across your chest, to be
representing your country, is an honor. I thought my shoulder would
hold up, and so I wanted to give myself a shot at making the team.
And it's my last chance to play in an organized setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Some former big leaguers were not so enthusiastic about having
to audition for the Olympic team. Wade Boggs, Jimmy Key and Chili
Davis apparently believed that their resumes were enough to warrant
consideration for a spot on the team. They weren't. Terry
Steinbach, the catcher, is the only other former major leaguer with
legitimate Olympic aspirations. He is playing in an independent
league in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday evening, Watson himself was in the stands at
Somerset Baseball Park to observe the two former Yankees, and give
himself a better idea of whom to recommend to the selection
committee. What Watson saw was a somewhat chubbier-than-normal
Raines and a still youthful-looking Kelly, both brimming with
enthusiasm. They were playing against good competition _ most of
the players in the league have had at least some Triple-A
experience, and some of them have played in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no hometown beer league,'' said Sparky Lyle, the
former Yankees pitcher and manager of the Patriots who, at 56,
retains his handlebar mustache, though it is now mostly white.
``Some are young and were on the bubble of making it from college
to signing with a major league organization, and some are older and
at the end of their rope. But all these guys can play.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the four games would be a legitimate test for both
Raines and Kelly, both of whom were coming back from physical
problems. Last season, Raines, while playing for Oakland, had
contracted lupus, a disease that attacks the body's immune system.
The stocky, 5-foot 8-inch Raines had lost 15 pounds and a lot of
strength, going down to 170, but has recovered and put back those
15 pounds, plus perhaps another 20. The Yankees gave him another
look in the spring, but he broke his toe, and that ended his
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Both Raines and Kelly had worked out on their own before coming
to New Jersey. ``But hitting off a tee and running sprints,''
Raines said, ``isn't the same thing as live competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In their first three games, all against the Bridgeport Bluefish,
Raines and Kelly had traded off being the designated hitter, as
well as serving time in the field. Each was playing his first game
in four months. Raines had two hits in eight tries with one run
batted in _ one of his hits came on an infield roller that the
one-time base-stealing ace beat out, though he appeared winded from
the sprint. Kelly was 2 for 9, with one run batted in as well. Each
had performed adequately at his position in the field.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when guys retire, they shut down,'' said Watson,
before last Thursday's game against the Atlantic City Surf. ``And
both Raines and Kelly retired. I want to see what their enthusiasm
is, how they set up in the field _ if they're in the game _ and how
they run and field and hit. I want to see what their bat speed is
like, if they've knocked some of the rust off. Right now, there are
about 70 candidates for the 24 positions on the Olympic team, plus
six alternates. For Tim and Pat, their credentials speak for
themselves. But they still have to be better than someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In last Thursday's game, with Watson watching, Raines had two
hits in three at-bats, with a double off the center-field fence
that missed being a homer by about a foot. Kelly also went 2 for 3
_ two singles _ and threw well but made an error when the ball
popped out of his glove on a tag play at second.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Watson said he was impressed with Raines and Kelly. ``I
like what I've seen,'' he said. ``I like their body language. They
took up my challenge to play in competition. I feel positive about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Raines, who thinks he may also have a few more major league
seasons left, and Kelly, who knows he doesn't, understand that even
if they make the Olympic team, they may not even be starting
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team will be mostly Triple- and Double-A All-Stars,'' said
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   In the two previous Olympics in which baseball was a medal
sport, the United States team consisted only of amateurs and ended
up with one bronze medal to show for its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the selection committee may be looking for guys like
Tim and me for experience, guys who've been in pressure situations
_ like the playoffs and World Series,'' added Kelly. ``If we can
work with the younger guys, and maybe even just be there for
important pinch-hitting, that'll be fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines agreed. ``If I'm not selected, I won't feel snubbed,'' he
said. ``If it's the end of the road, it's the end of the road.''

 &HT;    Day trading phenomenon hangs on despite regulators' concerns
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Day trading has not gone away.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years after regulators began investigating the
industry, and one year after the killing of nine people at two
Atlanta firms heightened attention on the business, individuals
continue to try their hand at day trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in an era where people come in and try to learn,
and then move on to something else,'' said John Berner, a regular
at InstaTrade and Pro Trader Securities in Atlanta. Berner, a
former stockbroker, has been day trading for about two-and-a-half
years. He also trades, not necessarily on a day-trading basis, for
a hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how many other people are day trading. But
apparently there is enough interest to keep a half-dozen firms in
business in Atlanta. That's about the same number Georgia counted
last year following the killings by Mark Barton, a money-losing day
trader.
</P>
<P>
   If estimates are correct, day trading still occupies a small
niche, based on the number of people involved. A year ago, the
Electronic Traders Association, which represents day trading firms,
estimated 4,000 to 5,000 people were active. In February, the
Securities and Exchange Commission put the number at fewer than
7,000.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, there are estimates that almost 78 million
Americans were invested in stocks directly or through mutual funds
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The potential influence of day traders exceeds their numbers,
however, because of their heavy trading. The SEC estimated in
February that day traders may account for 15 percent of the
Nasdaq's daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   According to Momentum Securities, its 24 offices _ including one
in Atlanta _ produced an average of 93,203 trades a day in the
first quarter and total trading volume of nearly 1.8 billion shares
over the three months. Trading picked up with the market's
volatility in the second quarter, with Momentum Securities
reporting 112,149 trades on an average day and total volume of 2.08
billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Trading is not investing, as regulators point out. And as long
ago as November 1998, they were cautioning individuals about it.
``For the typical retail investor, day trading isn't investing,
it's gambling,'' said Philip Feigin, at the time executive director
of the North American Securities Administrators Association.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders buy and sell stocks quickly, sometimes holding onto
them only seconds, in hopes of profiting from small price changes.
They commonly operate on borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading firms offer customers access to real time stock
quotes, like professional traders on Wall Street see.
</P>
<P>
   What put securities regulators and the industry at odds were the
former's concerns that customers had not been adequately warned
about the risky nature of day trading. Regulators also felt some
advertising included exaggerated claims about the chances of making
money. The lending practices of some firms, as well as the
arranging of loans between customers, also became issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the SEC approved two rules aimed at the industry. One
would put the onus on firms to determine if day trading is
appropriate for potential customers. The other would mandate a
specific warning about the financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   Last week also brought additional publicity in the form of more
regulatory complaints. NASD Regulation, which oversees brokerages
and brokers, charged All-Tech Direct and some company officers with
violating National Association of Securities Dealers' rules.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, NASD Regulation charged that All-Tech
Direct, based in Montvale, N.J., and Chairman Harvey Houtkin ``made
misleading, exaggerated, and unsupported statements in a number of
print and radio'' ads.
</P>
<P>
   A complaint alleging different rule violations was filed against
Stock USA, based in San Diego. Both firms, which have offices in
Atlanta, said they would contest the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a bill was introduced in the Georgia Legislature that
contained language similar to that of the day trading rules
approved by the SEC. The bill did not become law, but the Georgia
Secretary of State's office expects it to be introduced again in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear is the state of Georgia's continuing investigation
into day trading. Robert Terry, the state's top securities
regulator, declined to comment. But the state is more likely to be
concentrating on scrutiny of day trading as it affects individual
trading accounts than focusing on a broad-brush investigation that
would duplicate the efforts of national regulators.

 &HT;    Music industry on the defensive
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Digital music is one of the Internet's final frontiers
_ but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry watchers say music lovers will be able to buy
music online or download digital music _ legally _ from online or
at the local music store before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   However, that can't happen until the music recording industry
embraces the Internet and agrees to distribute music via digital
download.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry is adamantly resisting that possibility,
filing lawsuits and mounting marketing campaigns to protect its
ownership of the music. Meanwhile, millions of young people are
happily, and illegally, using simple technology to download
practically any music they desire, free.
</P>
<P>
   That pending, but as yet unconsummated, shotgun marriage of
music and technology will be at the center of debate at Jupiter
Communications' annual Plug-In Conference in New York Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There, musicians' representives and recording industry insiders
will come face-to-face with the Internet mavens who have figured
out how to make their products widely available using the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two sides will be scores of new companies that have
grown up around products to help users more easily download music
using their computers and the Internet, as well as send the
appropriate nickels back to the recording companies and artists.
They are dying to do business with both sides but can't do anything
until the two sides agree to wed. Interestingly, no more than a
half dozen such companies exhibited at last year's digital download
conference. This year close to 100 companies will show their wares.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to market, or at least the desire by the Internet
industry to rush to market, is fueled by the amazing success of
Napster (www.napster.com), an extremely popular and completely
illegal _ according to the recording industry _ digital music
file-sharing system.
</P>
<P>
   Napster said last week its community of users now exceeds 20
million people _ and has doubled since the end of April. Not bad
for a site that launched just over a year ago and has done
virtually no marketing. That was about the time several
universities began banning Napster, saying the number of downloads
was clogging their computer networks. The Recording Industry
Association of America, the trade group that represents the major
recording companies, sued Napster, claiming the California-based
company is breaking the law by offering pirated music for free. A
federal judge will decide this week if Napster's technology is
illegal and could temporarily shut down the site.
</P>
<P>
   Despite additional negative publicity from the RIAA lawsuit and
bands like Metallica, and the fact that it violates nearly every
legal definition of ``fair use,'' Napster continues to grow and
increase in popularity and the number of downloads.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because people love it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are not going to stop using Napster because an
artist tells them to,'' says Adam Sinnreich, a music analyst at
Jupiter. ``They'll go through legitimate channels once they're more
fun, more convenient and offer more value than illegitimate
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hardie, a former analyst with Forrester Research who now
heads up his own music distribution company called MusicTeller
(www.musicteller.com), says the record companies are missing a huge
opportunity to distribute music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did I go to get a copy of Bruce Springsteen's `41
Shots?' I found it on Napster. That's a disgrace,'' he says. ``The
record companies should have been right there with the song. People
want it and are willing to pay for it. The longer the record
companies hold out, the more opportunities they miss to reach out
to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner President Richard Parsons _ one of the keynote
speakers at the Plug-In conference _ knows this is a critical time
for the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just about a bunch of kids stealing music,'' he
told the Los Angeles Times. ``It's about an assault on everything
that constitutes the cultural expression of our society. If we fail
to protect and preserve our intellectual property system, the
culture will atrophy. And corporations won't be the only ones hurt.
Artists will have no incentive to create. Worst-case scenario: The
country will end up in a sort of cultural Dark Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with Parsons' dire scenario, neither Time Warner nor
any of the major recording companies has been able to come up with
anything that will provide a compelling alternative to Napster's
easy and quick file-swapping technology.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they have continued to pursue legal avenues to force
Napster and MP3.com to cease and desist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Napster's popularity emphasizes the music industry's failure
thus far to satisfy online consumer demands,'' says Stacey Herron,
another Jupiter analyst. ``The controversy surrounding this type of
networked music-sharing community proves that artists and labels
continue to feel threatened by online music.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster has captured the hearts of millions and the wrath of the
music industry with a very simple file-sharing technology.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the illegitimate Napster is the best game in town.
</P>
<P>
   Type in the name of nearly any artist you can think of from Bob
Dylan to the Backstreet Boys, and hundreds of songs scroll down the
computer screen, all available for download _ every single one of
them free.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica has been the most vocal artist opponent of Napster and
has staged elaborate publicity stunts asking Napster to take their
songs off its site. Several other artists have also requested
payment from Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Herron says the popularity of Napster should be a clear
sign to the music industry that there is a large audience for
legitimate online music sales. ``Despite minimal marketing efforts
and an imperfect technology, Napster has amassed a large amount of
content and high traffic levels in just a short time,'' she said in
recent report. ``Paired with retail offerings, artist information,
tour dates, artist participation, community features such as
instant messaging, and other supplemental content, a networked
music-sharinto the users' online musicbank accounts, where they can
download the songs or just play them on their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday the company signed an agreement with Virgin
Megastores but won't launch the service until other music
retailers, including online retailers like Amazon.com and CDNow,
are on board and the major labels agree to let the music be
delivered digitally to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are never going to stop shopping,'' Hardie says. His
company, ETC Music, plans to introduce a product called MusicTeller
that will also use ATM-like kiosks to deliver music to the growing
number of portable digital music players.
</P>
<P>
   Hardie also says the sheer size of the $40 billion music
industry and its decades-old investment in music manufacturing and
distribution channels is part of the reason for its reluctance to
go digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody at the top executive levels of these companies
who are Net guys,'' he says. ``There are some pretty smart people
at most of the labels, but they don't understand what the Internet
can do for their businesses.''

ARMSTRONG NEARS SUPERSTARDOM ALONGSIDE JORDAN, WOODS AND GRETZKY 
</HEADLINE>
 (With CYC-TOUR-DE-FRANCE) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROYES, France _ The American Embassy in Paris phoned officials
of the U.S. Postal Service bicycle team a few days ago to ask when
it would be convenient on Sunday for Lance Armstrong to receive
another congratulatory call from President Clinton. The two last
spoke on the phone a year ago, hours after Armstrong won his first
Tour de France. A few months after that, the rider visited the
White House to give the president a bicycle and a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   That is the standard star treatment, as were Armstrong's
appearance on the David Letterman show and his visit to the New
York Stock Exchange, where he became the second athlete residing in
Austin, Texas, to ring the opening bell. (Ricky Williams, the
former University of Texas running back, was the first after he won
the Heisman Trophy in 1998.)
</P>
<P>
   So what awaits the Tour de France's leader and certain winner
when he visits New York again on a publicity blitz Tuesday? A
ticker-tape parade? A speech to a joint session of Congress later
in the day? The stakes have changed. Nearing a second consecutive
victory in the world's greatest bicycle race, Armstrong appears to
be rising from what his agent calls ``the clutter'' of mere stars
to superstardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``That level has less to do about money, annual endorsement
fees, than becoming a household name,'' the agent, Bill Stapleton,
said. ``That level is Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Wayne Gretzky.
Lance is joining them.''
</P>
<P>
   At least publicly, Armstrong himself scoffs at such talk.
Interviewed from an adjoining car as he rolled through the German
countryside Friday morning on a training ride before a long
individual time trial, he said with a laugh, ``I'm not a superstar,
I'm a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever, he was relaxed and friendly, bantering at 40
kilometers an hour (25 mph) as he worked up a sweat and readied his
legs for his 58.5-kilometer race (about 36 miles) against the clock
four hours later. ``A regular guy,'' he repeated, ``and I'll show
'em what a regular guy can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is the way Jordan, Woods and Gretzky talk the talk,
too. Discussing those superstars, Stapleton said that Armstrong has
been ``in the tier right below them'' with endorsements in the
range of $5 million to $7.5 million a year, a realm that he
explained was occupied by the top 20 to 25 athletes. To an agent,
especially a witty one with a hot property, that is ``relative
obscurity'' in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, however, Armstrong vaulted into superstardom with his
first victory, three years after he learned he had spreading
testicular cancer and had to undergo three months of chemotherapy.
Bicycle racing is a major sport here, usually second only to
soccer, and the winner of the Tour de France is widely honored.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Burgh, a vacationing Dutchman standing by the side of the
Tour's road in Switzerland this week to cheer the riders, summed up
the European reaction to Armstrong: ``He's a great hero. What he's
done touches the imagination. The cancer, that too, but really
because he won the Tour and now he's winning it again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, bicycle racing remains a niche sport and
the magnitude of Armstrong's comeback seems not to have taken hold
until this 87th Tour de France started July 1. The Texan captured
the overall leader's yellow jersey 10 days later and has held it
securely ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much bigger than last year,'' Jim Ochowicz, Armstrong's
close friend and his former coach with the defunct Motorola team,
said of Tour coverage in the states, ``and so is Lance. He's in the
Jordan-Gretzky class now.'' Ochowicz credited Armstrong's
autobiography, ``It's More Than the Bike,'' published this spring
and still high on the best-seller lists, with introducing him to a
large audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's become known as a great American hero, not just a great
American athlete,'' Stapleton said with an agent's hyperbole.
``It's a sport most Americans basically don't understand, so his
marketing focuses on the depth of what he's been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the Tour is its linear time element. A golf
tournament lasts four days. The Super Bowl, even with all the
hoopla, is six hours. The Tour goes on for three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen major companies have signed Armstrong to
endorsement contracts, including Nike, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Yahoo
and Visa. Many of their executives are part of the entourage at the
Tour, and more are arriving daily before the finish in Paris on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   John Kouten, associate director of public affairs for
Bristol-Myers Squibb, flew in this week with nine cancer survivors
from a handful of countries. They will meet with Armstrong, who
heads a cancer foundation in his name, and sign with him the
Charter of Paris Against Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance is going to reach a much broader audience,'' Kouten
said. ``Many more people in the United States are going to know his
name now with a second victory. Last year, some folks might have
thought that his victory was a fluke. Now he had a whole other year
to relapse from his cancer and he didn't. That's a very encouraging
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike has had Armstrong, 28, under contract for a half-dozen
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance is very important to our brand and I think he's becoming
more important,'' said Scott MacEachern, emerging sports marketing
director for Nike. ``He is already a big story. If Lance is
fortunate enough to win this Tour, I think he will be a very big
story going into the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is not overly enthusiastic about leaving his wife and
infant son to go to the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, in
September, noting that he has participated in the Games twice
before, in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992 as an amateur and Atlanta in
1996 as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Then why is he going? ``Go ask Bill Stapleton,'' he replied
jovially.
</P>
<P>
   For a superstar, it's always business before pleasure.

NADER TALKS, LABOR LISTENS AND MANY DEMOCRATS WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (Eds: Subs 2nd graf to add that event was on Friday.) 
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Ralph Nader was on a tear, railing against
chief executives' salaries, the corporate-dominated campaign
finance system and cuts in factory inspections. Several of the
steelworkers seated around him were nodding, and then nodding
again, in silent approval.
</P>
<P>
   For a few minutes at least on Friday, it seemed as if the
steelworkers' cynicism about politics and politicians had
evaporated, and they were receiving the truth, or at least a truth
they rarely hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the guys who work hard,'' said Nader, the Green Party
candidate for president. ``You're the guys who pay the taxes.
You're the guys who fight the wars, and then they say, `Tough.
We're closing the factory. It's globalization.' And then they use
factories overseas where dictators repress the wages to compete
against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader _ whose words, though not his speaking style, are laced
with emotion _ then laid into Vice President Al Gore and other
Democratic politicians, saying they have done little for labor
because they have been able to take labor's support for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're taken for granted, you're taken,'' he said. ``When
organized labor can say to these candidates, `You're not going to
take us for granted anymore, we have an alternative and the
alternative is Nader and the Green Party,' then they'll start
calling, then they'll start catering to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the 20 steelworkers who had squeezed into a small
Ohio State University classroom to hear Nader gave him rave
reviews, and many of them vowed to vote for him this November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say Nader is the best of anyone,'' said David Cole, an
electrician at AK Steel's mill in Mansfield, who drove 75 minutes
to hear Nader. ``I really like him. I haven't seen much from anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend and co-worker Larry Pugh was just as enthusiastic.
``I think he has the right answers,'' said Pugh, a crane operator
at the plant, where management locked out 620 workers last
September. ``He gives us a choice because the Democrats and
Republicans have sold us down the river.''
</P>
<P>
   This outpouring of enthusiasm for Nader worries many Democrats,
who fear that so many steelworkers, autoworkers, Teamsters and
other union members will vote for him this fall that it could cause
Gore to lose in Ohio and other large Midwestern swing states. For
the Democrats, an added concern is that two of the largest, most
powerful unions in the Midwest, the Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers, have flirted with Nader and have not endorsed Gore, even
though the AFL-CIO is backing the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Many steelworkers are still angry at Gore because he backed the
agreement to normalize trade relations with China, an accord that
many union members fear will accelerate the exodus of U.S.
factories to China. Although Nader is best known for his crusading
on consumer protection and the environment, he has grown closer to
labor unions in recent years, fighting alongside them against the
China trade deal, the World Trade Organization and the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although all the steelworkers at Columbus hailed Nader, several
said they would still vote for Gore, explaining that they feared
Gov. George W. Bush would win if Nader drained too many votes away
from the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank you for championing our issues,'' Skip Hall,
another steelworker who drove in from Mansfield, told Nader.
``You're terrifying the Democrats. You know this is going to be a
very close election. In 1980, I was dissatisfied with Jimmy Carter.
I backed Ted Kennedy, and we ended up with Ronald Reagan. He gave
us a bad Supreme Court. We're still living with that today. That's
the dilemma we face today. The same thing could happen with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The excitement generated by Nader also concerns some labor
leaders. John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, has repeatedly
urged union members to back Gore, saying it is important to prevent
Bush from winning because working with a Republican Congress, he
might push through legislation to weaken unions and job safety
laws.
</P>
<P>
   George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America,
was one of labor's most vociferous critics of the China trade deal,
but he now says it is time to line up behind Gore. He said in an
interview that labor's support for Nader was modest and would grow
smaller, and he predicted that many union members leaning toward
Nader would ultimately vote for Gore upon realizing that Nader
cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two viable candidates, Al Gore and George W. Bush,
and we're picking the one closest to the viewpoints of our members
and the issues of working people,'' Becker said. ``Nader's a fine
man. He takes a lot of positions that are near and dear to us. But
he is not a viable candidate. In that regard, anybody who would
support Ralph Nader we think would lessen Al Gore's chances of
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said that
the race between Gore and Bush was close in his state, but that he
did not think Nader would hurt the vice president. Recent polls
show Nader getting 4 percent of the vote in Ohio, compared with
more than 10 percent in California, but Leland said those were
high-water marks that were bound to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people know a vote for Ralph Nader is a wasted vote at
best and a vote for George Bush at worst,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said he hoped Gore would become more outspoken on
workers' issues to excite union members about his candidacy.
Indeed, on Monday, Gore is scheduled to hold a town hall meeting in
Cleveland with 75 steelworkers from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana and
Illinois. The Nader campaign sees this as a move to keep union
members from drifting toward their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said a central purpose of his candidacy was to move the
Democratic Party left on labor and other issues. To make it easier
for unions to organize, Nader called for making it legal for a
union to boycott not just the company it is striking against but
other companies that do business with it. (Such boycotts were
banned by the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947.) He also called for
requiring employers to pay triple damages when they illegally fire
workers for supporting a union.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that he should be included in any presidential
debates, Nader said he would seek to force Gore and Bush to address
work-related issues, like occupational safety, that have been
largely ignored during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore will tell you, `I'm for you. I'm going to fight for you.
I'm for a ban on using replacement workers in strikes,''' Nader
said. ``But what has he done in eight years? I don't care what
you're for. I want to know what you've done. Talk is cheap.''

GERMAN WINS 20TH STAGE, BUT ARMSTRONG'S LEAD IS SOLID 
</HEADLINE>
 (With CYC-ARMSTRONG) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROYES, France _ The star German sprinter Erik Zabel finally
crossed the finish line first in the Tour de France on Saturday,
ending three years without a victory (three years and nine days,
but who's counting besides him?). ``Whew,'' Zabel said with a broad
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Zabel, who races for the Telekom team, has registered many
successes since his last of seven Tour victories. Among them are
triumphs in the esteemed Milan-San Remo classic in March, which he
has won three times, and in the Amstel Gold Race classic in May, as
well as the overall lead this year in the World Cup series of
one-day races.
</P>
<P>
   Until this 20th of 21 stages Saturday, he had 15 victories this
year, a big number, but none of them in the Tour since July 13,
1997. After that he had 10 second places in the Tour, including two
this year, and five third places, including three this year.
</P>
<P>
   Zabel won with a fine display of teamwork, getting strong
leadouts from two teammates in the final few hundred meters and
then powering his way to victory by half a bicycle wheel over
Robbie McEwen, an Australian with Farm Frites, and Jeroen
Blijlevens, a Dutchman with Polti. Bumped by another rider in the
stretch, Blijlevens could only pound his handlebar once in
frustration as he finished.
</P>
<P>
   Zabel was timed in 6 hours 14 minutes 13 seconds for the
158-mile (254.5-kilometer) ride from Belfort in eastern France to
Troyes. Lance Armstrong maintained his unassailable overall lead of
6:02 over Zabel's teammate, Jan Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   The length of this stage, one day before the finale in Paris,
was denounced by many riders, who noted that this was the third
stage over 150 miles in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insane,'' Frankie Andreu said beforehand. He finished in 111th
place, 2:43 behind the winner, but was untroubled.
</P>
<P>
   Andreu did not ride for high placing Saturday nor in the final
individual time trial on Friday nor in the two breakaways he joined
as the race made its way to the Pyrenees and Alps. That's not his
job; he needs to save himself to work for Armstrong, the leader of
their U.S. Postal Service team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to help the team,'' Andreu, 33, explained before the
stage. ``We're here to get the yellow jersey, and I'm here to
protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andreu is widely known as one of the most selfless and most
durable team workers in the sport. When the race finishes on
Sunday, Andreu will have completed his ninth Tour de France in nine
appearances. Among the 128 riders left of the 177 who set out July
1, few can match his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit is determination and just suffering through the
hard parts,'' he said. ``A lot of it is luck, being able to stay
out of crashes. You can't always control where you are, and
sometimes things just happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When they do, he remounts and keeps going.
</P>
<P>
   As a team worker, Andreu gets few chances to ride for individual
victory because he must remain near Armstrong, who has no need to
contest a final sprint and no chance to jump into a mass breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Armstrong wore the leader's yellow jersey, Andreu
was occupied by his duties of riding ahead of Armstrong and
sheltering him from the wind or offering his wheel if the leader
had a flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first week, when Lance didn't have the jersey, our job
was to keep him in the front and to keep him as rested as
possible,'' Andreu said. Leaders try to stay at the front to avoid
sudden attacks and mass crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a hard Tour,'' Andreu said, ``partly because of
the weather. It was so windy the first week, and that meant a lot
of work to keep Lance in the front. And then, when he took the
jersey'' _ on the 10th day _ ``there's a lot of energy that you
don't realize you're expending trying to stay in the front and
battle the wind. You're paying the price the last week.''
</P>
<P>
   That price is weariness. ``It's not the wind now,'' Andreu said
Friday. ``Now it's the legs. Now it's plain fatigue. I'm tired.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked hard in the mountains, where he does not shine. At 6
foot 2 and 180 pounds, Andreu is too big to climb the Pyrenees and
Alps easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to work before the climbs,'' he said, ``and then the
first part of the climbs. I have to stay in the front for the first
part of the climb until I blow. Then I've just got to suffer like
mad to stay in the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a job and you've got to do what you've got to
do _ save the climbers as long as possible so they can do their
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of jobs, Andreu surprisingly reported that he has not
yet been signed for a fourth year with the Postal Service team and
a 13th year as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unemployed right now,'' he said. ``So I'm looking. I'm
still talking with Postal Service, and I've got to talk with some
other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he winds up, he agreed, if he returns to the Tour de
France next year, he expects to work hard for his leader and
attempt to stretch his own record of finishing the race. &QL;

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A widow kept old sheets on the bed because they
smelled like her husband.
</P>
<P>
   A former stock trader even fears going to the bank, worried that
someone will shoot him again.
</P>
<P>
   A grandfather can't bear to visit the graves of his
granddaughter and grandson, who flank his slain wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, they faced unimaginable violence; today, and
perhaps forever, unfathomable sadness.
</P>
<P>
   All because of Mark Barton.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, 1999, a year ago next Saturday, the 44-year-old day
trader tore through two stock brokerages in the Atlanta financial
district on the worst killing spree in Georgia's history. During
the previous two days, he had bludgeoned his wife and his two
children. Later, as police surrounded his green minivan, Barton
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, 13 people were dead. Another 13 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, most of the survivors' physical injuries have
healed. The day-trading offices _ Momentum Securities Inc. and
All-Tech Investment Group _ have reopened; fresh paint, wallpaper
and carpet cover the remnants of the carnage. Families of some
victims have moved into new homes, trying to escape the memories.
Lawsuits have been filed, relationships have frayed, counseling and
antidepressants have failed to eliminate the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I pray and read my Bible, Kevin's kind of talking
to me,'' Buddy Dial, a former All-Pro football player, said of his
slain son. ``It's been very difficult, losing Kevin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still do all the things we used to do together _ jogging and
playing tennis _ but now I do it without my partner,'' said Roy
Webb, whose son, Scott, was killed. ``I guess that feeling will
never go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who lived through the day's horror, directly or indirectly,
say they've accepted what happened, and even gotten over their
anger. Some won't talk about it at all, and others say they've
simply tried to put the event out of their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole stance is, it's still in the past,'' said Scott
Manspeaker, back to work as a manager at All-Tech after nearly
bleeding to death from two gunshot wounds. ``We're over it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't bring it up,'' said Ginger Lewis, a cousin of
Barton's slain wife, Leigh Ann. ``I can be driving down the road
and I get a little flash of it and I feel like I'm going to cry,
but I tuck it away. That's what I do with bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others have analyzed and reanalyzed everything that
happened. They've tried to reconstruct every moment of the tragedy,
endlessly seeking some truth that will help it all make sense. What
they find, though, are others asking the same question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week I or somebody I know runs into somebody who was
touched by that incident,'' said Nell Jones, who eluded a bullet
from Barton but witnessed his rampage at All-Tech. ``It's
absolutely mind-boggling that one person could create that much
sorrow. One person.''
</P>
<P>
   `GOD TOOK AN ANGEL'
</P>
<P>
   Marie Quinn wonders about Barton. Why didn't he just kill
himself that day in Atlanta? Why did he have to take so many with
him? And why her husband, Edward?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much anger in me, it's unbelievable,'' Quinn said
recently in the large brick house she and her husband built 14
years ago. ``Even though I go to counseling, I don't think I'll
ever be able to let it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nights are the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have trouble going to bed, because I know Eddie won't
be there,'' she said. ``After he was killed, I waited a long, long
time to change the sheets because they smelled like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Her salvation, she said, has been her first grandson, Bryce. He
was born three months before her husband was killed, and the family
treasures its photographs of grandfather and grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ``God took an angel,'' she said, ``and, at the same time, gave
us an angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others who became widows last July 29, Roya Havash has
suffered from depression.
</P>
<P>
   Medication has helped, she said, but it hasn't lessened her
feeling that her husband, Jamshid, wasn't supposed to be at
All-Tech that day.
</P>
<P>
   In her husband's personal effects she found a ticket from the
toll booth on Ga. 400 near the shooting scene. He had passed
through just 45 minutes before he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe in destiny,'' she said. ``We're Muslim. The Quran
said that when your time comes, you have to go. There's nothing you
can do about it. . . . In a way, I think it was his time. But it
was too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulshan Harjee thinks of what her husband, Dean Delawalla, has
missed the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, Faisal, turned 16 and learned to drive. Soon he'll
start visiting colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Shahla, turns 5 on Friday. Her birthday will
always fall the day before the anniversary of her father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing we'll live with every year,'' Harjee
said. ``We need to reclaim the sadness of that day . . . because
the children have to have their lives and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Tenenbaum's three children have given her strength to deal
with the loss of her husband, Allen.
</P>
<P>
   But as they grow, she said, she realizes how much time has
passed without her husband.
</P>
<P>
   One recent evening, her 4-year-old son, Scott, jumped up from
the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to look at a picture of Dad _ I almost forgot what
he looked like,'' he told his mother.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVORS
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Kathleen Van Camp ever saw was Barton's face.
</P>
<P>
   She was sitting in an office at All-Tech when Barton came in,
pulled out two handguns and began firing. He shot her twice _ once
in the chest, once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, her world went dark.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since, Van Camp said, she has undergone ``many
surgeries,'' and she expects more.
</P>
<P>
   But she does not expect to regain her sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm weary,'' she said. ``I guess I'm getting along.''
</P>
<P>
   She takes classes at the Center for the Visually Impaired. She
visits friends, dines out occasionally, follows the stock market,
goes to doctors' appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty much it,'' she said. ``I don't really want to go
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the shooting, Van Camp enjoyed her independence. Now she
relies on her husband of 13 years, Michael Sovereign, and others to
take her everywhere. That loss of freedom, she said, has been the
hardest adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a really self-reliant person,'' she said, ``and suddenly
I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence of former day trader Sang Yoon's wound is a
scar along his lower left forearm. But he, too, has lost his
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   When he takes deposits from his dry cleaning business to the
bank, he said, he fears someone will shoot him for his money. In a
crowd _ a restaurant, a ballgame _ he is afraid a shooting will
erupt.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent power outage at his business, when he heard
sounds from an electric pole, he thought they were shots. He took
the rest of the day off.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he said, his temper is short.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife says I've changed,'' he said. ``When my baby is
crying, I used to take care of that. But now I get angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he feels a tickling sensation along his scar.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to his heart, he said, ``I'm still uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   A BROKEN RELATIONSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Helen Brown counted on her son, Russell. When her husband and
oldest son had cancer, it was Russell who nursed them. And when
something needed repairing at her home in Florida, it was Russell
who took care of it.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russell was killed at Momentum, Brown has sold her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I looked, I saw Russ,'' said Brown, who now lives
near her daughter in Orlando. ``He was the project guy. He came
down every other month to fix things around here for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She never wants to visit Atlanta again, not even for a memorial
service July 30 for Barton's victims. Not even to see her son's
fiancee of eight years, Patti Balon.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown family has broken its ties with Balon after a
disagreement over how to disperse Russell's ashes. The family
insisted that she send them everything of Russell's _ his clothes,
furniture, ashes. Balon and the Brown family no longer speak to one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Balon described the estrangement as unfortunate. She said she's
still grieving, but is working 70-hour weeks as a diversion. ``I
put it on the back burner and don't think about it unless it hits
me right in the face,'' Balon said. ``I am so full of anger
still.''
</P>
<P>
   AN OFFICER ALSO GRIEVES
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day, Rene Swanson thinks about what she discovered
at Barton's apartment in Stockbridge. Still, her voice breaks when
she talks about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words to describe it,'' said Swanson, a detective
with Henry County police. ``When I went in there, it was the worst
thing I would ever want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the apartment were the bodies of Barton's children,
11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Michelle, and their stepmother,
Leigh Ann Barton. All three had been beaten to death with a hammer.
Barton admitted to the crimes in a suicide note he left in the
living room.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said she can't come to terms with the ritualistic way
Barton killed his children, then washed and combed their hair,
dressed them in pajamas, tucked them into bed and surrounded them
with their prized possessions. Beside Matthew he placed a Swiss
army knife, Boy Scout patches and Pokemon trading cards; beside
Michelle, a doll with a pink dress and blond hair in pigtails.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could smell shampoo in their hair,'' Swanson said. ``In
some sense, there had to be some kind of love there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorting through her emotions was made easier by a friendship
forged out of the case _ with Bill Spivey, the children's
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Spivey believes his wife, Eloise, and Debra, his daughter and
Barton's first wife, were murdered by Barton in 1993, a case which
remains unsolved. Spivey invited Swanson to lunch a few weeks after
last year's killings. This month, he asked Swanson, her husband and
their children to join his family for a Fourth of July party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heartbreaking,'' said Swanson, who normally doesn't
socialize with people she meets on her job. ``Michelle and Matthew
_ if things were different, it would have been them playing in the
pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Spivey doesn't like to talk about the killings. And he avoids
the cemetery where his grandchildren, their mother and his wife are
buried alongside one another. Visiting the grave sites, he said, is
too painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have lost our loved ones,'' Spivey said. ``If we can
put this behind us and go on and try to have a constructive life,
we would all be better off.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEKING PEACE
</P>
<P>
   Alyce Wenzel has tried to move on. But sometimes, just driving
the car on an errand, she bursts into tears, remembering her son,
Scott Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie never had a chance to get married or have children,
and he loved children,'' Wenzel said. ``I'll just have to learn to
take it day by day. God doesn't give you more than you can handle.
I believe that, or there isn't anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Nell Jones has tried to put the shootings behind her, too. She
returned to day trading for a while, but only as a form of therapy.
Being around others who had lived through the killings helped her
regain control of her emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, she mostly stays at home, close to her family,
seeking clarity about life _ trying, she said, to filter out the
``background noise.''
</P>
<P>
   She is haunted by visions of what she witnessed: ``These lovely,
innocent people . . . murdered in cold blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were there, and they were gone,'' she said. ``If I had
been killed, what would I have left behind? What would I have left
undone and unsaid? And can I look around and do them now?''
</P>
<P>
   One victim especially occupies her thoughts: Vadewattee
Muralidhara, over whose body she stepped when she emerged from a
closet where she hid during part of Barton's shooting spree.
</P>
<P>
   Muralidhara's husband is haunted, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not keen on day trading,'' Kesturkoppal Muralidhara
said. ``It was I who was interested. I forced her.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently moved to a new house, hoping to leave behind happy
memories that now seem so painful. But his wife's clothes hang in
his new closet.
</P>
<P>
   When he closes his eyes, he sees his wife in the dress she wore
when she died. He sees her gazing at him from the passenger side of
his car, undressing by the bed they shared for 22 years, cooking
the evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children come home and sit around,'' he said. `` `Daddy,
where is the food?' `Look,' I say, `I cannot cook. Let's go out and
eat.' They want to sit down at a table and all eat together. We
have not done that in almost a year now. Not one time. That
happiness, I don't think, will ever come back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the Muralidhara family traveled to their native
Trinidad for a Hindu ceremony. Thirty days before the anniversary
of a death, Hindus believe, the soul ascends to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   So 11 months after Barton killed her with a bullet to the head,
Vadewattee Muralidhara's ashes were scattered in the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, her husband said, this would bring ``peace to her
soul.''

 VINCENT M. MALLOZZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.J. _ I grew up on Pleasant Avenue, the wiseguy
capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   I was holding my father's hand on the summer morning when
Francis Ford Coppola and James Caan visited the old East Harlem
neighborhood to film a scene for the first ``Godfather'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   All the guys from the ``old man's club'' were out in their
skimpy T-shirts that morning, sipping cappuccino from plastic cups,
their diamond pinky rings glaring in a mean sun. Jimmy the Cat.
Vito the Bat. Patti Apples. Talk about filming on location.
</P>
<P>
   In the scene, Sonny Corleone, played by Caan, kicks the wise out
of his wiseguy brother-in-law. Casting agents on the set were
offering $50 to any kid who wanted to be an extra, asking them to
simply play in front of a fire hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are all my friends,'' I said. ``Dad, I wanna go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' my father said flatly.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, a gentleman who had earned the nickname Joey
Aggravation rushed over to my dad from the Pleasant Tavern and
shrieked, ``C'mon Frankie, let the kid go!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' my dad said again, squeezing my hand. ``You're not a
gangster.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the closest I ever got to being in a movie, especially
the kind of movie that romanticized the lifestyles of the kind of
people I grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years later, I got in line for another part. I was one
of thousands who showed up at Harrison High School today for a
much-publicized casting call for the hit HBO series ``The
Sopranos,'' which happens to be my favorite.
</P>
<P>
   With several relatives in tow, I arrived at the high school at 9
a.m. to find that thousands of young, cigar-chomping men in muscle
T-shirts and women with tall hairdos and spiked heels were already
there, the dizzying smells of perfume and hair spray filling the
hot air.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Lt. Charles Trucillo of the Harrison Police
Department estimated, 4,000 or 5,000 people were already in line.
</P>
<P>
   Trucillo said 400 to 500 people had slept in front of the school
overnight to improve their odds of successfully dropping off their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Using the power of my connections _ my ID card from The New York
Times, where I work as a news assistant _ I broke ranks to
negotiate a better deal somewhere up the line.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for the right place to jump in, I spotted a large man in
a silk suit. His name was Lou Roca. Other than the fact that he was
wearing handcuffs to the casting call, and handing out business
cards with the words ``You Lookin' at Me?'' written in bold letters
across the front, he seemed like a harmless guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a problem with me standing here, pal?'' I asked with a
sly smile. ``I'm with the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Roca, who had made the trip from New Castle, Del., replied,
``Make me an offer I can't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can stand here if you get a message to Tony Soprano for
me,'' Roca said, referring to the lead character in the series,
played by James Gandolfini. ``Tell him I can help him with his
family problems. I can be on the muscle end of the family, the
fixer. I can make things go away.''
</P>
<P>
   By 9:45 a.m., the lines behind me had snaked down and around six
city blocks. I thought about my sister Donna, who could play
Carmela Soprano's dark-haired sister, waiting way back in line for
a chance that might never come.
</P>
<P>
   I know that feeling, which is why I worked out a the deal with
``Lou Rocks,'' as Roca refers to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 10:30, when the doors were scheduled to open, I made
my first contact, bumping into Henry Brunchtein, a co-producer and
production manager for ``The Sopranos.'' He explained the enormous
turnout for the hugely popular show, which recently garnered 86
Emmy nominations, about Tony Soprano, who copes with the problems
of everyday family life while struggling to maintain his status as
a mob boss in the suburbs of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was, we were going to do a casting call and
announce it in a couple of small papers, expecting maybe a thousand
people, but then it got picked up by Regis and Howard Stern, and we
started to get a lot of phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were calling us, saying they were flying in from other
parts of the country, and many of them slept here overnight. We got
a call from a guy from New Mexico who wanted directions to Harrison
from Newark Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time my conversation had ended with Brunchtein, the
crowds had swelled to nearly 20,000 people, eclipsing by 5,000 the
population of Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:45, I arrived at the steps of the school's gymnasium, and
as I began to head toward the casting directors _ men were in one
line, women in another _ I tapped into a few conversations some of
my would-be gangster friends were engaging in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break a leg,'' Joe Oliveto of Roosevelt Island, N.Y., said to
another man on his way to meeting a casting director.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' asked the man, unsure about Oliveto's remark. ``You
talking to me?''
</P>
<P>
   As I got closer to my second chance at the big time, I heard a
young assistant casting director, Jarred Bryant, ask a bald man
with a big belly, 40-ish, ``Are you in the business?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said the man, ``I'm in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you acted in?'' asked Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, not that business,'' said the man, smiling wide. ``I'm in
 &UR; the  &LR; business.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was my turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any acting experience?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, no,'' I said shyly. ``But almost. Thirty years ago, I
...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, thanks, and maybe we'll give you a call,'' said Bryant,
dropping my 5 by 7 glossy and a brief information form into a large
pile.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping outside, I heard an HBO official shouting into a
bullhorn, telling all the men in silk suits, and all the women in
high heels and short skirts, that they were closing the doors, and
offering an address for those who had been unable to see a casting
agent to mail in their mini-bios.
</P>
<P>
   I worked my way back through the crowd, and went home.
</P>
<P>
   I told my wife that if Tony Soprano called, I had a message for
him.

IN WRITING CONVENTION SCRIPT, DEMOCRATS SEARCH FOR RIGHT ROLE FOR
CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Democrats unveiled details Saturday for their
August convention intended to gently disengage Vice President Al
Gore from President Clinton and establish him as an independent
leader while still celebrating the Clinton policies that have
helped create the longest economic boom in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Over four days, from Aug. 14 to 17, the convention will build
gradually from heralding Clinton's record and policies to the
highlights of Gore's biography to a climax on Thursday, when Gore
will be nominated as his party's standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing lessons from the 1988 Republican convention, the
Democrats will have Clinton and Gore make a joint appearance
somewhere outside the convention location in Los Angeles to show a
changing of the party's guard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, President Reagan symbolically passed the torch of
leadership to Vice President George Bush in a brief ceremony at an
Air Force Base near the Republican convention in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the 1988 event, the Democrats said Clinton's
appearance would be substantive and extensive. Though aides want to
use the convention to move Gore out of the president's shadow,
Clinton remains popular with the loyal Democrats and the Gore
campaign does not want to appear to be shunting him to the side.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would also address the convention in prime time on the
opening day, Monday, Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly our having the president speak on Monday and then
appear with the vice president shows how proud we are of the
success of this administration and how we will tout that success,''
said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore. ``This event won't be a
photo-op. It will be real substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention's overall themes, ``Progress and Prosperity'' and
``People, not the Powerful,'' have been drawn from the oratory of
Gore's recent campaign appearances, where he has attacked big oil
and drug companies, and his Republican opponent, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, saying Bush is beholden to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will open with a focus on the nation's
prosperity. Besides Clinton, the speakers will include Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New York, and
other prominent female candidates. The evening will also feature
testimonials from people talking about how they have benefited from
the administration's policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, under the theme ``You ain't seen nothing yet,'' a
favorite stump line of Gore's, some of the party's most prominent
leaders will talk about the important choices facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Prime time speakers will include the Rev. Jesse Jackson and
former Sen. Bill Bradley, who challenged Gore during the primaries.
There will also probably be a keynote address by a speaker yet to
be named.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to evoke images of President Kennedy, who was nominated
in Los Angeles in 1960, the Democrats will also have Carolyn
Kennedy Schlossberg, his daughter, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., his brother, speak on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, under the theme, ``The Principled Fighter,'' the
convention will begin focusing more heavily on Gore, using
testimonials and videos to highlight his biography, from his time
as an Army reporter in Vietnam to his work as a newspaper reporter
in Nashville to his years as a congressman and senator from
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is famous but still not well known,'' said
an adviser to Gore. ``We believe that the more people learn about
him, the more they like him. And I think a lot of the things we
present to people that night will be new.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's running mate will also be nominated that night. Karenna
Gore Schiff, Gore's eldest daughter and one of his closest
advisers, will give one of the nominating speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will spend the first three days of the convention
campaigning around the country. Because the television networks are
not planning to devote much prime time coverage to the convention,
the Gore campaign is planning to use the vice president's
off-convention events to try to pick up additional television
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president will arrive at the convention on Wednesday
night and receive the nomination on Thursday evening. He will be
introduced by his wife, Tipper; his aides said it was possible that
there would be other nominating speeches as well.
</P>
<P>
   After the convention, Gore and his running mate are scheduled to
make a four-day tour of states bordering the Great Lakes and the
Mississippi River, a region where the election seems particularly
close. One plan called for having Gore travel across the Great
Lakes states while his running mate traveled up the Mississippi,
having the two meet somewhere in the Upper Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Republicans, the Democrats are not planning to devote
one night of the convention to making partisan attacks on their
rivals, though they are leaving the door open to criticizing
specific elements of Bush's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said there may also be some cameo appearances by
Hollywood stars. Barbra Streisand, for one, is scheduled to sing at
a event near the convention center.

 &HT;    G8 SUMMIT FOCUSES ON THIRD WORLD DISEASE, TECHNOLOGY GAP
 &HT;    Moving in (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ With most of their economies in decent shape,
leaders of the Group of Eight countries focused their summit talks
Saturday on helping poor countries fight infectious diseases and
get into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The G8 members announced a Digital Opportunity Task Force,
dubbed the ``dot force,'' charged with finding ways to bridge the
global digital divide. The group is to report to next year's G8
summit in Italy on possible solutions for individual countries.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, officials said, is that technology will let poor
nations leapfrog obstacles to development, taking advantage of the
information age to improve education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   The G8 members _ the United States, Canada, Britain, Japan,
France, German, Italy and Russia _ also announced new programs and
funding to help prevent the spread of diseases such as AIDS,
tuberculosis and malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries made financial pledges, including $3 billion
by Japan over the next five years. Clinton has requested $4 billion
in the 2001 budget for a vaccine program, research on HIV/AIDS and
international aid for various infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Lael Brainard, Clinton's deputy national economic adviser, said
that while past G8 summits have been more centered on the economic
problems of the member nations, Okinawa ``is shaping up to be the
development summit, with a focus on creating opportunity for the
least-developed.''
</P>
<P>
   However, about 50 non-governmental organizations who came to
Okinawa to monitor the summit were not impressed by either
initiative. They accused the G8 leaders of failing to address the
fundamental problems that cause poverty and disease, and instead
offering only superficial solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quite angry,'' said Marlene Barrett, a spokesperson for
Jubilee 2000. ``This (digital divide effort) is an empty gesture
which will obviously benefit all of their industries. It's just to
distract attention away from the fact that they failed to cancel
the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Jubilee 2000 burned a laptop computer on a beach here
in Okinawa to show their disappointment with G8's failure to
fulfill last year's promise to cancel up to $100 billion in Third
World debt.
</P>
<P>
   So far, just nine countries have qualified for debt relief of up
to $15 billion. Jubilee 2000 says debt relief is the first step to
ending the cycle of poverty, since poor countries are spending more
money to pay back debt than on basic needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't eat a laptop,'' said Barrett. ``It's a crisis, it's
an emergency, and it's something that they've failed to deal with
this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicins Sans Frontieres criticized the G8 program on infectious
diseases, saying that merely spending money to treat diseases does
not solve the core problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If part of this money is going to be used to buy expensive
brand-name drugs when we know there are cheaper, generic brands
available, that's public money going to private interests in the
West,'' said spokesperson Ellen 'T Hoen(cq).
</P>
<P>
   She said she was disappointed the G8 leaders did not address
patent issues that would allow, for example, local companies to
produce cheaper versions of pricey AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just saying, 'this is a serious issue and we're making money
available to deal with it' without giving clear direction on how to
do that is really a missed opportunity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on the digital divide, President Clinton
acknowledged that technology is not the answer to all the problems
of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet if we fail to ensure that all nations have the opportunity
to participate fully in the network economy and society, we run the
risk that the divide between nations will grow,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, Clinton addressed U.S. troops and their
families on Okinawa. His speech was rescheduled from Sunday
afternoon to allow him to leave Japan several hours early and
return to the Mideast peace talks late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave an upbeat speech lasting less than 10 minutes that
did not directly address the issues that have led Okinawans to
protest the U.S. military presence on their island, which numbers
about 26,000.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents have complained about instances of misbehavior
and crime, including killings, rapes and thefts. The presence of
about 4,000 children fathered out of wedlock by U.S. military
personnel has further strained relations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton thanked the forces for their work and stated
the need to be good neighbors to their Okinawan hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of us has a personal obligation to do everything that
we can to strengthen our friendship and to do nothing to harm it,''
he said.

SPAIN OUSTS UNITED STATES IN DAVIS CUP SEMIFINAL
</HEADLINE>
  By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTANDER, Spain _ It wasn't meant to be, and if John McEnroe
needed more evidence that his dream of captaining the United States
to a Davis Cup on his first try was dying, he got it in the second
game of the fifth set here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was break point for Spain, already ahead by 1-0 in the set,
but there were Todd Martin and Chris Woodruff, in the middle of the
court, sending Alex Corretja deeper and deeper behind the ad court,
in the corner, almost to the runway leading off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Woodruff kept hitting overheads. Corretja kept
finding a way to flick them up in the air to get them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris hit a couple early in the point and I said, `Don't hit
it to Corretja,''' Martin said later. ``Then I got one, the easiest
one and I hit to Corretja.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the ball was back again, from almost an impossible
backhand angle. The Spaniards were back in a point that Juan
Balcells would win with a shanked backhand winner into the open
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of Alex's greatest qualities _ his defensive
skills,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would recoup that fifth-set break, but the
symbolism of Corretja's athletic returns and sheer refusal to give
up on a point was the story of this Davis Cup semifinal, settled
Saturday by Spain's makeshift doubles team of Corretja and
Balcells, 7-6 (6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Having never won the Davis Cup, and without an appearance in the
world group finals since 1976, Spain will play Australia in a
December final as the favorite on the clay court surface that suits
the players' dogged style so well.
</P>
<P>
   This was the match that McEnroe had contemplated playing
himself, and in hindsight it was probably a good idea he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe had considered Saturday to be the best U.S. chance to
win any match here, after Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi pulled out,
citing injury. Earlier in the week, before his players talked him
out of playing, McEnroe had asked: ``Who the hell is Juan
Balcells?''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he found out, calling Corretja's unheralded partner
``strong as an ox'' and saying he had the ``best 83-mile-an-hour''
serve in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   While neither Spaniard has ever been an accomplished doubles
player, their heavy topspin returns and lightness afoot would have
been even more overwhelming for a 41-year-old, as McEnroe is, than
it was for Martin and Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, as it turned out, played a game match but far
more than the fifth set would go home lamenting a first set that
Martin failed to serve out at 5-3, wasting two set points. In the
tiebreaker, they had set point twice more but could not convert.
Particularly frustrating was Martin's choosing not to volley a
Corretja backhand up the line, thinking it was long. The ball
dropped a foot inside the baseline in the doubles alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missed opportunities,'' McEnroe said, wearing a Yankees' cap
in his post-match news conference. ``The first set was ours. No way
in the world we should have lost that set.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff, the fifth-match hero of the first round in Zimbabwe,
took the blame, saying he played with a ``little too much fear,''
not going for volleys when Martin served for the set at 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   The United States forced a fifth set by winning a fourth-set
tiebreaker. It went down a break early in the fifth and rallied
back on serve, only to cough up serve and, in effect, the match in
the eighth game.
</P>
<P>
   Martin flubbed two forehand volleys to start the game. Then,
just to make sure he put one in play, he sent a third volley into
Corretja's wheelhouse for a forehand pass down the middle. On the
first break point against Woodruff, Corretja nailed a backhand up
the line, sending the crowd into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Corretja proceeded to serve out the match at love, with Balcells
reminding McEnroe of who he was again, kissing off the last three
volleys. A wild celebration ensued, with the Spanish players
dancing in a circle and later spraying champagne at the fans in the
front rows.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the result, McEnroe, for the record, had little to
complain about this weekend, with the exception of a hosing down of
the court between the fourth and fifth sets. He later said it had
been agreed to water the court (making it play slower, to the
Spaniards' favor) only after the second set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say we lost the match because they watered
the court,'' he decided.
</P>
<P>
   Or the semifinal, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   His best players didn't come. The draw was not good. His first
year as captain, which he called ``surprising and disappointing,''
was over. &QL;

HILLARY CLINTON GREETED WARMLY AT SYNAGOGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTHAMPTON, N.Y. _ In her first public appearance before a
Jewish audience since she was accused of making an anti-Semitic
slur, Hillary Rodham Clinton attended Saturday services at a
synagogue here and received a generally warm welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 9 a.m., as services at the Hampton Synagogue got
under way and the men separated from the women _ as is the custom
in Orthodox Jewish congregations _ Clinton strolled into the
synagogue, and a group of women burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the men said ``Ssssh!'' and went back to their prayers,
as Clinton took a seat up front. A few minutes later, Rabbi Marc
Schneier, the founder of the synagogue, addressed Clinton, saying,
``I know this has been a very difficult and very trying week for
you, and it's time for us to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   During her remarks to about 1,000 worshipers, Clinton did not
directly mention the accusation, which came out last week after a
former reporter for The National Enquirer published a book in which
a former campaign manager for President Clinton said Hillary
Clinton had used an anti-Semitic slur to refer to him in 1974. She
has vehemently denied the assertion. But she often referred during
her 30-minute talk Saturday to the importance of racial and ethnic
``understanding'' and ``bridging ethnic difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am worried today about the increasing and continuous level
of hatred and hate crimes, prejudice and bigotry in our
communities,'' she said. ``I think all of us know how important it
is to stand against it whenever it raises its ugly head.''
</P>
<P>
   She also spoke, in vague terms, about the Middle East peace
talks under way in Maryland, saying, ``I know on many of our minds
today is what's going on at Camp David.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``So much of the challenge the president and the
prime minister are facing is rooted in whether or not others will
give up their hatred and their sense of violence and their
commitment to destruction, in return for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton drew from the Torah, saying that the people of Israel
are asking for ``the inheritance that is their just due, a chance
to keep their children safe from violence and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not mention Jerusalem, however, and steered clear of
specifics on the peace talks, saying: ``These negotiations are very
difficult. Sometimes claiming and achieving one's inheritance is
very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worshippers said they were disappointed that Clinton
had not gone into more detail about the status of the Middle East
talks or about her position on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She took no stand, other than very surface stuff,'' said
Richard Haar, a New York City resident who spends summers in
Westhampton and regularly attends the synagogue. ``It seemed like a
lot of jargon. She really wasn't saying anything, and she had a
tremendous opportunity here.''
</P>
<P>
   But several others said they were impressed by her knowledge of
the Torah and believed she was committed to achieving stability in
Israel. Some also said they thought her appearance at an Orthodox
synagogue, so soon after the flap over the accusation that she had
made an anti-Semitic slur, was bold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very brave and classy thing to do,'' said Merna
Tarnower, a member of the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance was planned before the accusation surfaced,
and she was scheduled to attend some other fund-raising events in
the area later Saturday, campaign officials said.

SPORTS COLUMN: EXCUSE ME, BUT IS THIS TRIP NECESSARY? 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audience. That's the word Steve Phillips used for what he hoped
to be granted by Barry Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rather grand word, associated more with a pope or
perhaps the queen of England than the shortstop of the Cincinnati
Reds. But these are unusual times, and millionaire All-Stars have a
certain aura all their own.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Larkin has a rather more mobile status than either a
pontiff or a monarch. He could be talked out of his perch in
Cincinnati somewhat more easily than the others from their sites in
the Vatican or Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Larkin is so desirable that the Mets had a private
airplane all gassed up and ready to roll at an airport in New York,
just waiting for word that the regal eminence in the Queen City was
ready to grant that aforementioned audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets seem to think they need Larkin so badly that, according
to Phillips, the two very distant Mets' owners, Fred Wilpon and
Nelson Doubleday, would have been willing to put themselves in the
same pressurized cabin for hours at a time. Talk about pulling out
all the stops.
</P>
<P>
   The little bags of peanuts were already stocked on Wilpon's
plane. (That's a joke about little bags of peanuts; the players'
union specifies caviar for audience flights.) The pillows were
fluffed; the boarding passes assigned. (Mr. Wilpon, please, way
over here. Mr. Doubleday, please, way over there.)
</P>
<P>
   But then Larkin said it was far too soon in this little
courtship dance to encourage an entourage to fly from Atlanta to
Cincinnati Saturday night, so the Mets went out and beat the
Braves, 4-0, with no field trip afterward. The general manager and
cast still have two full days to try to persuade Larkin to come to
New York. The silly season continues.
</P>
<P>
   It is not to baseball's credit that teams divest themselves of
established stars toward the end of July. It is contemptuous of the
fans who purchased those extremely expensive tickets to have
management suddenly say, ``Ha-ha, but Barry Larkin (or Mark
McGwire, or David Cone, or Randy Johnson) doesn't play here anymore
because we're trying to save money and are giving up on this
season, but don't even think of asking for your money back.'' The
attendance got trimmed again, as Casey Stengel used to say.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance is really getting trimmed in tiny-market
Cincinnati, which fought its way into a one-game playoff last
season. A truly mean person would call this the Curse of Junior,
referring to the gloomy miasma of Ken Griffey Jr., who talked his
way out of Seattle. Now Edgar Martinez is having a superstar year
in Seattle, and the Reds can't discard their expensive stars fast
enough, but to dwell on that particular superstar migration would
be unkind.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have high respect for Larkin. John Franco, a former
Red, was willing to fly to Cincinnati Saturday night for an
audience _ Phillips' word again _ and so was Phillips, of course,
as well as Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   The manager's feelings were difficult to fathom. Valentine knows
Larkin from coaching there for most of the 1993 season, and had
only good things to say about Larkin, which makes sense,
considering he may be managing him in a day or three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looked good, spoke well, played well,'' was Valentine's memory
of Larkin trying to hold things together on ``a team in disarray at
best.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Larkin is now 36 and wants a three-year contract.
He did not appear in any rush to grant an audience to a contingent
trying to soft-soap him into three months of a pennant race in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not whether Larkin needs the Mets. The issue is
whether the Mets need Larkin. They have Rey Ordonez, a sensational
fielder but ghastly offensive player, out for the season with a
wrist injury and signed to $16 million over the next three years.
The Mets are clearly interested in Alex Rodriguez of Seattle, who
is clearly interested in them, if only for the titillation of
driving his price even higher.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets have Melvin Mora, who is not only a highly classy
individual but can also play an adequate shortstop for a contending
team.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said it is not a matter of ego that he thinks he can
win with this team; it is a matter of confidence in the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't, you should get another job,'' said Valentine,
who admitted he has heard some managers say, ``We are not getting
it done with this group.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who has had his differences with Todd Hundley, Rickey
Henderson and Bobby Bonilla, seems to like his current team,
adding: ``If somebody can come and make you a little better, that's
good. But it doesn't make you worse if he doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Balance is a funny thing. With three regular infielders
currently out of action, the Mets are getting things done with
appealing players like Mora, Lenny Harris and Joe McEwing. Nothing
against Barry Larkin, a mature professional, but a residual sense
of loyalty and curiosity and fun whispers that the Mets just might
be able to win with their current team _ without going through the
perhaps even degrading machinations of a charter flight for an
audience with a reluctant star.
</P>

COMMENTARY: WORLD'S DULLEST MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct spelling of Monte to Monty.)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The conventions are the only reality shows
nobody wants to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In television, drama is being pushed out by reality, but in
politics, reality is being pushed out because it lacks drama. Or
perhaps because it lacks reality.
</P>
<P>
   Politics has become so artificial, prewashed, prechewed and
preordained that there is no chance for bite and spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   Without bite and spontaneity, there is no chance for ratings.
Without ratings, there is no chance for rapt attention from the
networks. And without network prime time, how can a presidential
candidate persuade us he is the One?
</P>
<P>
   If red, white and blue confetti falls in an empty living room,
does it get in anybody's hair?
</P>
<P>
   Viewers' embrace of ``The West Wing'' puts the lie to the notion
that Americans won't watch substantive discussions of ideas. Ideas
just have to be presented with real human passion.
</P>
<P>
   But since the exit of John McCain, who managed to make campaign
finance reform seem romantic, it's been hard to find real human
passion anywhere but on a fictional TV drama. It's impossible to
tell what George W. Bush and Al Gore really care about, besides not
making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   There has been moaning about how awful it is that the networks
are cutting back coverage to practically nothing and shunting it
off to cable. But given what lousy TV the conventions are _ dull,
obsolete, self-serving _ the parties should feel lucky that they
haven't been relegated to Webcasts.
</P>
<P>
   As programmers here at the summer TV press tour scramble to put
reality on their schedules _ UPN is looking for shockumentaries
about Nasty Neighbors, Cheating Spouses and perhaps even World's
Meanest Ladies _ I asked television's leading reality impresario
how the conventions could be made more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davies, the British-born producer of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' thinks American politics has boxed itself in:
</P>
<P>
   ``The great Monty Hall once said great TV has one moment where
the protagonist either wins everything or loses everything. Quiz
shows, the best sporting events, our favorite sitcom episodes _
they all have that. Conventions have lost that. They need a new
hook, a moment of `Drumroll, please.' They have to engineer more
drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies wryly suggests the always-popular vote-out. ``Like
`Survivor,' you kick out one state every year, or vote somebody off
the Democratic National Committee every night.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventions need to get interactive. ``Vice-presidential
selection could be more like ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?' and people could vote from home,'' Davies says.
``Or like `Blind Date.' We follow the nominee as he goes out with
three vice-presidential prospects. Maybe we see pop-up thought
bubbles that tell us what he really feels about a possible mate _
how the guy droning on about ethanol is a snore.'' (Wouldn't we
have loved to see the pop-up bubbles over Dick Cheney's head as he
interviewed VP contenders: ``I'm better, I'm better, I'm better.'')
</P>
<P>
   The producer muses that the best way for a convention to win an
audience is to pay people to watch _ let viewers win money by
guessing how many times George W. Bush will use the word ``heart''
in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art of performance has been lost in American politics,''
he contends. ``You can find C-Span debates in Parliament that are
utterly absorbing. The pols are funny and liable to say stupid
things when there aren't 100 people writing and producing for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``America should import the British system for one convention
week. You have the two parties on opposite sides of a big
convention center, like Parliament, jeering, pointing across the
aisle, while Bush and Gore debate each other extemporaneously.
You'd have to have somebody in the role of the speaker, Betty
Boothroyd _ maybe Judge Judy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As TV producers say, the conventions need to relax and find
their voice. They've lost touch with the original idea. There's no
introduction of characters, no conflict, no second act, and the
resolution is predetermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``And on top of all that, the lighting is really bad.''

   PLEASANTVILLE, N.Y. _ West Nile II, the summer sequel, was
preparing to air. Television cameras recorded the trucks waiting to
roll from Westchester County's fire training center, and the
publicist for the mosquito-control company had orchestrated a
demonstration run of a pesticide truck well in time for the 11
o'clock news.
</P>
<P>
   Then, close to midnight Thursday, the driver of a beige pickup
stopped on a dark road and pushed a button. With that, the spraying
was under way. The pump on the back hummed, the truck's yellow
lights flashed and a plume of pesticides fell on Pleasantville.
</P>
<P>
   As a police car led the pesticide truck through sleepy streets,
people reacted like unwitting extras in a science fiction movie.
Drivers rolled up their windows and scooted away. A few residents
clicked on their outside lights as the fog machine rolled by.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Rodriguez, who was outside on Vanderbilt Avenue, was urged
into his truck by the police as the sprayer approached. He played
his part beautifully, sitting in his truck bug-eyed as the
sweet-scented haze melted away, muttering through a cracked window,
``It's a strange thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-year after navigating Y2K, we are in the grip of another
threat that combines the specter of disaster with what may
eventually be seen as overwrought drama. It's another group grope,
not for an exotic computer bug this time, but for a familiar insect
once kept in check with a spritz of Off! and a quick slap.
Uncertainty has bred an atmosphere of concern in some counties and
crisis in others, in response to much the same threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moving target in the night,'' said C. Scott Vanderhoef,
the Rockland County executive. He ordered pesticide spraying along
all 470 miles of roads in Clarkstown on the recommendation of state
and federal health officials, but he wonders how dangerous the
virus really is. ``There's been no one who's been able to tell this
county executive how big a threat this is to humans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got two calls this morning, both angry,'' Vanderhoef said.
``One lived in an area where there is spraying. She said `How dare
you do this?' The other one was asking: `Why aren't you spraying
us? Are you waiting for a child to die?'''
</P>
<P>
   Just across Rockland's border with Bergen County, N.J., the West
Nile scare feels vastly different.
</P>
<P>
   Birds infected with the virus have been found in both counties.
But Peter Pluchino, Bergen's 30-year-veteran mosquito-control
officer, plans no widespread spraying. ``We wouldn't want to spray
a residential area or spray into the air where there are no
mosquitoes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes have been such a scourge in New Jersey that not only
have they been called the state bird but a mosquito-control
apparatus has been in place since 1914. The focus is on killing
mosquito larvae year round _ a practice the rest of the New York
region adopted after last year's West Nile outbreak _ rather than
spraying adult mosquitoes, which New York City and surrounding
counties are now doing.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County has increased its surveillance for West Nile
virus, but Pluchino said, ``The majority of the population really
isn't at risk, as far as I know.'' Still, many people think that
they are. These days, he said, ``any flying insect is a mosquito to
most people.'' He added, ``People see a dragonfly on the screen and
trap it in Tupperware until we get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In Westchester, the state of readiness is palpable. Officials
there decided to spray along 1,500 miles of roads _ or half the
distance to California, if stretched end to end _ after finding the
virus in two dead birds and a cluster of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Lipsman, the county health commissioner, acknowledges that
the virus is not comparable to a public health threat like tobacco.
But like a crime wave, it is potentially deadly and looms large in
the public consciousness. He noted that last year there were seven
deaths, including one in New Rochelle, out of 62 known cases,
although a follow-up study estimated that hundreds more were
infected with the virus but showed little or no effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new,'' he said. ``It's foreign. It's particularly
unpredictable as to who could be hit next. And it's potentially
deadly.'' Therefore, he said, it made sense to spray the pesticide,
which he called ``fairly nontoxic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, attacking West Nile was a balancing act between
minimizing fear and minimizing disease. With the public wary of
pesticides, he said that spraying from trucks was preferable to the
spraying from airplanes that took place in other areas last year.
``People's image of aerial spraying is like radiation fallout.''
</P>
<P>
   With uncertainty everywhere, it is not always clear where public
health ends and public relations begins. When the Town Board of
Lewisboro, citing environmental concerns, informed Westchester
officials that they did not want to be sprayed, the town
supervisor, Thomas D. Herzog, said he was reminded that the county
was in a health emergency. ``I think the powers that be don't want
to have the accusations come back that they were negligent in
protecting the public health,'' he said.

IN WESTERN N.Y., FARMERS' FAITH IS TESTED BY ENDLESS RAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ They once prayed for rain here, looking
heavenward for lasting relief from the droughts that had cracked
the earth and withered their crops. But that was last summer, and
the two before that.
</P>
<P>
   Now these farmers can't pray enough for the rain to end.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, torrential downpours have washed away newly planted
seed, drowned sweet corn and peas before they could be plucked, and
transformed acre after acre of fertile soil into lifeless muck.
Rain-battered farmers throughout the stretch of western New York
from Syracuse to Buffalo say they expect to lose half their crops _
worth millions of dollars _ to the worst rainy season they can
remember in at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us feel there's almost nothing that can't be
overcome,'' said Nicholas Breslawski, 52, who prayed in church last
Sunday for cloudless blue skies. ``But this rain, it's been hurtful
down into your soul because it's one thing we've been unable to
control with our own hands. You can beat things with will, but you
can't beat constant rain.''
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a test of faith for many farmers,
unexpectedly heavy rain and hail have devastated crops all over the
state, from apple orchards to wheat fields, and pounded a state
agricultural industry already teetering from depressed food prices
and low profit margins. Gov. George Pataki has requested federal
disaster aid for farmers in more than 30 counties. None has been
granted yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a year when fuel prices are at their peak and commodity
prices are weak, the excessive rain that the state has been
experiencing could be the final straw for many farmers,'' Pataki
said in a written statement. ``It is critical that we help these
farmers withstand these disastrous weather conditions, as they
serve as the backbone for our rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The rains have fallen especially hard in outlying areas of
Monroe County surrounding Rochester, where thick corn stalks brush
up against neat subdivisions, and dairy cows graze along the
roadside.
</P>
<P>
   The county's 605 farms produced $41.9 million worth of crops in
1999, or roughly 4 percent of the state's $1 billion in crop sales,
according to the most recent estimates from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, storm systems have stalled here and poured down
more than a foot of rain _ twice as much as last spring. In June
alone, rain fell on 22 days and set a record for that month. ``I
don't expect it to turn dry anytime soon,'' said Jeff Warner, a
meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University who monitors weather
patterns in western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers had hoped for a bountiful harvest when the rains
came earlier this year. But then their fields flooded. And the rain
just kept falling. ``We went from one extreme to another,'' said
Bob King, an agricultural specialist for the Cornell Cooperative
Extension in Monroe County. ``There won't be any profit for most
farmers. They'll be lucky if they cover their costs. It's another
nail in the coffin, because we've been having tough times anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   With mounting anger and frustration, these farmers and their
families are forced to wait out the heavy rains. ``I have woken up
in the middle of the night hearing the rain, and lay there not
being able to get back to sleep because I'm thinking of them not
getting into the field,'' said Ann Breslawski, 48, who is married
to Nicholas Breslawski. ``I watch the lightning and I pray, `Please
God, don't let it rain.' It affects you. It's on your mind all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The surviving crops still carry scars. Corn stalks are a foot or
more shorter than they should be at this time of year. Wide swaths
of wheat fields lie flat on the ground and have begun to turn black
from mold. The soggy pea fields, which are being harvested by
hulking machines, have been pockmarked with tire tracks.
</P>
<P>
   And the farmers say they can no longer find joy in a rite of
spring here _ driving by a neighbor's fields to peek at the crops
in a bit of friendly competition. ``There are no good-looking crops
this year,'' said Breslawski as he pointed to his 1,000 acres of
cabbage and soybeans. ``I can take you to a field so bad that I
can't stand to look at it. Now I say, `My field is worse than
yours.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Stettner, 48, a farmer who lost 30 acres of peas out of
200 and all 400 acres of feed corn to the rain, said he would
probably have to borrow money to plant next year's crops. The
constant rain has darkened his mood and cast a gloom over his home
_ so much so that his wife, Patricia, says she often wants him to
stop farming.
</P>
<P>
   But as reliably as the frost comes every fall, Stettner and many
others say they will return to their fields again after the storms
and droughts have passed. ``There's a great sense of accomplishment
in growing a crop,'' Stettner said. ``There's a lot of pride in
what we do. That's the reason we stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church last Sunday, the 8:30 a.m.
Mass was unusually well attended by farmers who tend to disappear
into their fields at that hour, even on Sundays, during the growing
season. Breslawski and his family came. So did their friends and
neighbors in this rural community. It had rained again the night
before, making the ground too wet to work that morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paul Ryan prayed for the struggling farm families, as
he has done many times before. Then his members stood together in
the wood-and-stone church and sang an inspiring hymn: ``Jesus gave
to me, I'm going to let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, let
it shine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The prayers aren't magic,'' said Ryan as he looked outside at
gray skies. ``I think it would be fair to say God is challenging
us.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GOLF'S ROAD TO RUIN
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Nearly a century ago, Bernard Darwin,
who was to golf writing in Britain then what Dan Jenkins is to it
in America now, described the 17th hole at the Old Course at St.
Andrews, the dreaded Road Hole, as having been ``more praised and
more abused'' than any other golf hole in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The green,'' Darwin wrote, ``lies between a greedy little
bunker on one side and a brutally hard road on the other. Many like
it, most respect it and all fear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century nothing has changed. Over the last several
centuries for that matter, nothing has changed except for the
surface of the road behind the green.
</P>
<P>
   Once a dusty dirt path for horse-drawn carts taking farmers to
market in this gray medieval town on the North Sea, it is now a
crusty black tarmac. But the long angled green, the road behind it
and their stern sentry, that pot bunker shaped like a mine shaft,
are basically the same for Tiger Woods in this British Open as they
were over the years for Old Tom Morris, Harry Vardon, Bobby Jones,
Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   After a par 4 on this 455-yard outdoor torture chamber in each
of the first two rounds, Woods had a bogey 5 there Saturday when he
3-putted from 20 feet, but with a birdie 3 at the 18th he completed
a 67 for a six-stroke lead going into Sunday's finale.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the 17th has often been the pivotal hole here
in the British Open, but Woods has approached it with his usual
clinical perspective, beginning with the blind tee shot that must
be aimed over the Old Course Hotel Resort and Spa sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to step up there and choose a line, what letter in
the sign you want to hit it over,'' he said. ``The letter changes
every day, depending on the wind and how far you want to hit it
down there. Today I went for the emblem because the wind was coming
into me from the left, which means I can't drive it that far. The
further you want to drive it, the more right you have to go into
the lettering.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my 7-iron, I tried to hit a one-yard draw, and I was able
to do that, but it started about two yards left of where I wanted
it,'' Woods said. ``That's why I landed on the slope. It skipped
over the Road Hole bunker slope. I had an easy putt. It broke a
lot, I knew that. The speed was a little slow, so I gave it a
little extra trying to get it in there. I let the blade release and
coming back, I held on and yanked across it.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the Road Hole a bogey 5 is a virtual par for any of the
world's best golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a par 5 to me,'' Seve Ballesteros has said. ``It is the
hardest hole in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The ghouls in the grandstand wait like vultures for disasters to
occur. Going into Sunday's final round, the 17th had yielded only
13 birdies as opposed to 41 double-bogeys and 12 triple-bogeys or
worse. The average score there was 4.70, virtually half a stroke
more treacherous than the next most difficult hole, the 430-yard
13th.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's opening round, Notah Begay was the early leader at
7 under until he drove into the left rough on the 17th, couldn't
escape on his second, then squirted his third into the Swilken Burn
that usually comes into play only on the first hole. With a
triple-bogey 7, he disappeared from the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   Begay was in good company in the Swilken Burn. In other years,
Fred Couples and Ballesteros hit their tee shots into the burn,
what in America would be called a narrow creek. Japan's Tommy
Nakajima was on the leader board with his ball on the 17th green in
two in 1978, but his putt curled down the slope into the sand of
the deep pot bunker with the sod-packed steep wall. Slashing away
with his wedge, he finally extricated his ball on the fourth try,
then needed two putts for a 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you lose concentration'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied with a smile. ``I lost count.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the Japanese pro's adventure there has been known as
the Sands of Nakajima.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Road Hole's road.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 Tom Watson, in a final-round duel with Ballesteros, hit
a 2-iron that bounded across the green and across the road, hit the
short stone wall and stopped in the grass near it. He jabbed a chip
beyond the cup, then two-putted for a bogey as Ballesteros was
draining a birdie putt on the 18th for what would be a two-stroke
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In winning his third British Open, Ballesteros had only five
bogies in that British Open, but three were at the Road Hole where
Watson lost a chance for his sixth British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I've been asked if there was one shot in my career that I
would like to be able to hit over,' Watson has said, 'it would be
that 2-iron at the Road Hole. In 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   It's believed to be the only golf hole in the world that has had
a book written about it: Sidney L. Matthew's ``Wry Stories On the
Road Hole,'' (Sleeping Bear Press, $22). One of those stories
involves one David Ayton who was leading the 1885 British Open by
five strokes as he walked toward the 17th green.
</P>
<P>
   But his chip shot squirted into the bunker. He blasted out to
the road, left his fifth on the road, knocked his sixth into the
bunker again, left his ball in the bunker twice, finally got on the
green in nine, two-putted for an 11 and walked off the green
trailing by six strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty (and the beast) of the Old Course itself, is that
it's a public course. Anyone with an accredited handicap of 24 or
better can enter the daily tee-time lottery. If your name is drawn,
you pay roughly $130 for the privilege of challenging the Old
Course, especially the Road Hole where a visiting duffer once
turned to his local caddie after his ball disappeared into the pot
bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``What should I do now'' the visitor asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you,'' his caddie said, ``I'd take the 9:40 train
out of St. Andrews.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR VICTORIOUS SPANIARDS, THERE IS NO `I' IN TEAM
</HEADLINE>
  By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  SANTANDER, Spain _  Spain has been one big happy tennis family
here this week, including its latest addition, Joan Vehils, the
television journalist who married Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario on Friday
night in Barcelona, a wedding attended by 650 and featuring a cake
that was bigger than the bride.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Before I finish, I would like to congratulate Arantxa and we
hope everything will be great for her,'' Alex Corretja said Friday
evening, to the enthusiastic applause of the Spanish news media.
</P>
<P>
   United they stood, divided we fell.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. players had to talk Captain John McEnroe out of
putting himself in Saturday's doubles, the Spanish captain, Javier
Duarte, was extolling the virtues of his team's ``technical
committee'' that selected its lineup. While Pete Sampras and Andre
Agassi went to great and suspicious lengths to claim they were
injured, Spain's hottest young player, Juan Carlos Ferrero, happily
took a seat on the bench when the ``technical committee'' didn't
name him for singles.
</P>
<P>
   While Sampras and Agassi looked right past the Davis Cup
semifinals to the U.S. Open, the Spanish players blew off Wimbledon
to train even harder on their beloved clay courts for their best
shot at the 31-time champions from across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, everyone thinks the same way,'' Corretja said after
defeating Jan-Michael Gambill in four sets and giving Spain a 2-0
lead Friday in the best-of-five competition. ``We sacrifice many
things to play Davis Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in southern California, Sampras was yawning in the
morning sun and dipping his toes into a pool as the Spaniards
Corretja and Juan Balcells defeated Todd Martin and Chris Woodruff,
7-6 (6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, in Saturday's doubles to eliminate
the United States, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras had called Corretja and Albert Costa ``childish'' when
they stormed out of Wimbledon in supposed protest of the seeding
process. Corretja called Sampras ``lazy,'' for refusing to return
to Europe and play for his country a week after dropping another
Wimbledon title into his bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sacrifice an important title to win a Davis Cup for
the team, for our country,'' Corretja said. ``It would be bigger
than an individual prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is much easier to adopt this attitude when your
country has never won the Davis Cup and you are as likely to win
Wimbledon or even the U.S. Open next month as the Americans were to
survive here without their stars. Would any of these Spanish
players be so happy about interrupting their French Open training
to run off to Australia to play on grass?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, on clay, the Americans were in trouble, regardless
of which players returned the captain's call. Luck of the draw. The
other day, asked what the United States' chances here would have
been with Sampras and Agassi, McEnroe, who is big into percentages
these days, thought it over and said, ``About 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, Americans are not the only tennis
players who stiff their Davis Cup captains. Mark Philippoussis
always has an excuse for Australia. As a veteran, Boris Becker
feuded with the German authorities. Comfortable in Connecticut,
Ivan Lendl tuned out the Czechs.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States has won 31 times, somebody good has usually
been playing. It is not as if Sampras and especially Agassi, as
young players, never gave at the office. No one hailed the
Americans as national heroes when they played Davis Cup. They
aren't traitors when they don't. McEnroe was always up for playing,
but even that claim must be made with an asterisk. He didn't win
Grand Slam titles beyond his mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi turned 30 last April. Sampras will be 29 next month. With
the exception of Martina Navratilova, there hasn't been a player in
years who has played at the championship level into his or her 30s.
At this stage of their careers, Sampras and Agassi have delicate
decisions to make, considerations and preparations designed to
squeeze every last Grand Slam tournament out of their bodies before
they run dry.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi campaigned for McEnroe as captain, and signed on for a
maiden voyage that took him to Zimbabwe for the first round the
week after he had finished a brutal six-week road run that carried
him to the Australian Open title. Agassi was on top of his game
then, as fit as he has ever been. The last we saw of him in the
thin air of Harare, he was vomiting into a flowerpot. He hasn't
been the same since. His best surface has always been hard courts.
Should he have tired himself, delayed his Open training,
jeopardized his chances to win next month in New York, by coming
here?
</P>
<P>
   Even Corretja had to admit, finally, that the conditions for the
Americans could not have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, we didn't play Wimbledon and had time to
practice,'' he said. ``It is pretty difficult to play Wimbledon, go
home and come back to clay.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of this was good for Spain. The draw was better.
</P>
<P>
   If Davis Cup is about anything, it is soil and surface. The
Spaniards, who last reached the world group final in 1967, can now
win the whole thing this year without having to leave home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good working system and the players are happy,''
said Duarte, when asked to explain his team's success, a year after
a first-round loss to Brazil got the coach, Manuel Santana, fired.
``But of course, this year we are playing at home, so we are lucky.
It always helps to choose the surface, your own balls and
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The technical committee couldn't have planned it better.

MESS REMAINS FROM MILLENNIUM WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With 2 million people crammed into the Times Square
area last New Year's Eve and more than a billion watching the
cascade of fireworks, laser beams and confetti on television,
Renada McGriff should have been thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   Her Web site, TimesSquare2000.com, was the official site of the
``global celebration at the crossroads of the world.'' McGriff had
said it would become the portal to entertainment and culture in
Times Square, and to build it she had enlisted a Who's Who of the
Internet world: Oracle, USWeb, Proxicom, Iomedia and several
others. She had attracted entrepreneurs and bankers to invest or
lend about $6 million for a venture that they all hoped would make
a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But while sanitation workers swept up 35 tons of debris on New
Year's Day, the mess that McGriff left behind is still haunting
Times Square and the Internet industry. Although she said the Web
site had 20 million hits during the 26-hour New Year's celebration,
her critics contend that it was far from the grand, technologically
sophisticated site that McGriff had promised.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that worked on the project say they are owed millions
of dollars. Investors are demanding to know where the money went.
And more than 14 lawsuits have been filed in state and federal
courts against McGriff and her company, TimesSquareMedia. The
courts have handed down at least five default judgments against
McGriff, totaling over $1.3 million.

<P>
   Investors, analysts and executives said that the story of
TimesSquare2000.com provided a glimpse into the Wild West character
of the Internet, where untested entrepreneurs and get-rich-quick
schemes abound. Until April, when Internet stocks took a beating,
investors had been more than willing to gamble on many ventures in
the hope that just one might succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a classic Web story,'' said Jeffrey A. Strauss, president
of Countdown Entertainment. Countdown represents the owners of One
Times Square, home of the New Year ball drop, in marketing the
annual event, and it licensed TimesSquare2000.com as the event's
official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spun a wonderful story, got a lot of people excited, but
in the end couldn't deliver on her promises,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff, who declined to be interviewed, said in a statement
that she was trying to arrange a merger with another Web site or
sell her company, attributing her problems to investors who had
failed to provide promised financing.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Korian, the president of Iomedia, stated in an
affidavit filed in New York State Supreme Court that McGriff had
``stiffed'' his company and others, using ``systematic deceit'' to
get goods and services without paying.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even with the venture under legal siege, Internet
executives and people who poured their life savings into McGriff's
company still say she had a brilliant concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renada's a great salesperson, a very talented woman,'' said
Peter Dugan, vice chairman of DVCi Group, a marketing and
information technology company that won a $500,000 judgment against
her for unpaid bills. ``And it was a great concept. If done
properly, it would have been huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that they had been willing at first to
overlook McGriff's inexperience and increasingly grandiose plans.
But according to interviews with dozens of executives involved in
the project and claims made in numerous lawsuits, McGriff began
bouncing checks to one company after another for software, hardware
and consulting services, and then refusing to return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff said in her statement that venture capitalists she did
not identify had not provided the money they had agreed to invest,
and had ``incited'' her relationship with various vendors, using
them as ``pawns'' in an attempt to take control of her company.
</P>
<P>
   According to former executives at TimesSquareMedia, McGriff
battled with Sunrise Securities, an investment bank that worked
with her to raise financing, and Warburg Pincus Asset Management,
which invested about $2.9 million. Executives at the two companies
declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Renada Watson McGriff, 43, seems an unlikely
candidate to start an Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff, described even by her critics as bright, articulate and
persuasive, worked as a secretary or executive assistant for
several companies in the 1980s before becoming vice president of
sales in 1988 for Spectacolor Communications, a sign company in
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what she told her employers or stated in business
plans circulated to investors, school records show that McGriff did
not graduate from either City College of New York or Arizona State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Although McGriff has said in press material that she produced
Mickey Mouse's 60th-birthday party in Times Square for Disney in
1988, her client was actually Eastman Kodak. The film company
wanted to put Mickey's image on a huge Spectacolor sign in Times
Square, and McGriff played a key role in organizing a promotional
event there featuring Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, McGriff was again a secretary, in the communications
department at Sony. After six months, she moved to Disney, where
she worked for a senior lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff began her first Internet venture in 1998, when she
proposed creating a Web site to sell gift certificates from
expensive retailers to corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a time when everyone was trying to latch onto the next
big wave,'' said Stephen Galluccio, who wrote the business plan for
her company and is suing her for $70,000. ``It was a really good
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   She called it Citigroup, and challenged Travelers and Citicorp
when those merging companies adopted the same name. She settled
with the company for $300,000, according to a former business
adviser. At the same time, McGriff sought money for the project
from Flatiron Partners in New York and investors from California
with the help of an old boss, Larry Bridge, a former vice president
for investor relations at CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Flatiron was willing to invest $1 million, but only if someone
with more business experience than her would be chief executive of
what was then called Gift Certificate Network.
</P>
<P>
   McGriff rejected the deal, and as the project collapsed, she and
her daughter took a trip to Greece. Since then, she has been sued
for a total of $110,000 by the travel agency, Galluccio and a
printer. The agency won a default judgment in state Supreme Court,
and the other two cases are pending.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, in December 1998, McGriff talked to Strauss
of Countdown Entertainment about TimesSquare2000.com. She described
a site that would broadcast the New Year's Eve celebration from New
York and other cities worldwide, and have virtual concerts,
electronic postcards, chat rooms, ticket sales and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came to us with a wonderful idea,'' Strauss said. ``She
set up meetings with major players at Excite, AOL, USWeb and
Oracle. At the time it was the dot-com craze.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss signed a four-year licensing agreement with Countdown in
March 1999 in return for 10 percent of profits from advertising and
merchandise sales. McGriff's company, in turn, would provide
information about Times Square festivities and programming for the
five huge video screens in Times Square.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   McGriff started the venture with her own money, but soon she was
signing contracts with Internet companies and raising over $1
million from investors, including $750,000 from a group in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, on June 15, McGriff convened a remarkable
meeting at a hotel in Times Square. More than 50 top executives
from USWeb, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, EarthCam and DVCi, as well as
her corporate lawyers and investors, crowded into the room to
discuss how the Web site was taking shape. For each executive, the
presence of so much talent in one room seemed to confirm the wisdom
of their decision to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed by the meeting,'' said Tom Hyland, who heads the
new media group at the PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm and
worked briefly with McGriff. ``She's a very articulate, convincing
marketing woman who appeared to be well connected. There's a
momentum when you get certain names together.''
</P>
<P>
   A person who was there said that ``in a matter of minutes'' some
investors pushed their revenue projections from $10 million a year
to $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   But there were tremors below the surface. McGriff's publicists,
Middleberg &AMP; Associates, quit. They were replaced by Urge Public
Relations, and then, after a dispute over payment, by Ruder Finn,
which has filed suit for more than $123,000 in unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   By Thanksgiving, USWeb, which is now known as MarchFirst, and
Oracle had also quit the project over unpaid bills. Jennifer Glass,
a spokeswoman for Oracle, said that her company was owed more than
$1 million and was considering legal action. DVCi followed USWeb
and was later replaced by Proxicom, which won a $540,000 default
judgment in U.S. District Court this year against McGriff and her
company.
</P>
<P>
   A rudimentary version of TimesSquare2000.com went up in
September, and McGriff announced her greatest coup: Her site would
be the global sponsor for America Online's ``Party of the
Millennium.'' But the alliance broke up over concerns that the site
would not be able to handle the enormous Web traffic it was
expected to generate.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Thanksgiving, Warburg Pincus invested $2.2 million
and promised more. A month later, a Japanese businessman, Yuji
Suzuki, gave McGriff the first of two installments on a $1 million
loan, in return for stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But more work had to be done on the Web site in the frantic
weeks leading up to New Year, and while McGriff sought new
investors to provide $20 million, that big infusion never came.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the celebration, McGriff called a news
conference at a restaurant in Times Square. But she did not show
up, and among the 50 people who did were creditors demanding to be
paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sent me there, but didn't tell me there'd be these irate
people,'' one executive said. ``People were literally lined up in
front of the press.''
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve in Times Square was a huge success. McGriff's Web
site displayed information about Times Square and New Year's Eve
events and views of the ball drop, but was unable to offer hotel
and restaurant reservations and other features she had once
described.
</P>
<P>
   ``She cast the only dark cloud over an otherwise spectacular
event,'' said Brian Cury, chief executive of EarthCam, an Internet
company with cameras throughout Times Square. ``We wanted to
participate in a substantial event that would enhance the Times
Square celebration. She threw out some insane amount of money that
made people think, even if I get a third of it, it'd be great. We
had a $2.7 million deal, and she stuck me.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, McGriff turned to Barr Financial Group in Tampa,
Fla., to revive the venture. At that time, the company's founder,
Alfred Barr, said that only $5,000 remained of the $6 million
invested in the venture.
</P>
<P>
   As he waded through piles of bills, promissory notes and stock
options, Barr said that McGriff told him that a lawyer for Suzuki
had shown up at her penthouse in Manhattan, saying that she had
pledged company stock and personal assets as security for his $1
million loan, which had come due in February. Warburg Pincus made
similar claims, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he had already raised $40 million from two groups of
investors, but McGriff refused to agree to their terms.
</P>
<P>
   In April, McGriff announced that she was reviving
TimesSquare2000.com as GothamLive.com, an entree to New York
restaurants, entertainment and culture. A company called On2.com
was to be the host of the site, but the partnership did not last.
``We're in a dispute with her over her payment under the contract
for our services,'' said Douglas McIntyre, chief executive of
On2.com.
</P>
<P>
   But McGriff is still at it. The Web site TimesSquare2000.com is
still up. McGriff said she was trying to sell TimesSquareMedia or
merge with a larger company.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's actively trying to do it as a way to realize the full
value of the company,'' said her company's current lawyer,
Christopher Boies, ``and to satisfy her potential investors.''
</P>
<P>
   McGriff met recently with executives of Cablevision Systems and
Primedia, a publisher of magazines, but an executive at Cablevision
said that nothing would come of it.

TREES, IF TOUGH ENOUGH, STILL GROW IN BROOKLYN 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is not easy being a tree in New York City, the
tour guide said Saturday, as he walked a group of nearly a dozen
guests through Fulton Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
</P>
<P>
   The guide, Orville Edwards, 26, said the biggest threats to
trees in New York were pollution and cars knocking them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most commonly planted tree in the city,'' Edwards
said, pointing to the thick trunk of what was a cross between an
American sycamore and an Oriental sycamore, in Fulton Park. ``They
are very resistant to most disease and pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   When most outsiders think of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Edwards said,
images of fires, crime scenes and dilapidated buildings of a
so-called asphalt jungle fill their heads, based on things they
have seen on television.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, Edwards, a native of Jamaica and a resident of
Bedford-Stuyvesant, took a group on a nature tour through the
neighborhood. The tour is one of several dozen offered each summer
by the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment, which is based in
Park Slope.
</P>
<P>
   The tour of Bedford-Stuyvesant is somewhat unusual, organizers
said, in that it brings people _ many of whom have never been to
the neighborhood they associate with urban blight _ face-to-face
with a place where nature merges with the urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much have more brownstones than anywhere in New York
City,'' Edwards told the tour group, as he pointed out magnolias
and gardens along tree-lined Stuyvesant Avenue in the historic
district.
</P>
<P>
   He talked not only about the squirrels and yellow-bellied
sapsucker woodpeckers that frequent backyards and parks, but also
about where the limestone and brownstone on the buildings came
from.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see much limestone in the neighborhood,'' said
Edwards, an environmental coordinator with the Magnolia Tree
Environmental Center. ``The brownstone is the most popular
facade.''
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the history of the neighborhood: the Woolworth
family once had a mansion there; many of the more wealthy white
residents moved out as blacks moved in from the Lower East Side in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   As the group strolled down Bedford-Stuyvesant's avenues and side
streets, they at times seemed out of place. Most residents and
business owners waved, while others offered only questioning
stares. Rodrique Morara, 59, a retired truck driver who lives
across from the Boys and Girls school where the group stopped to
look at an American birch tree, gently needled the group as he
smoked a cigarette nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is trying to tell them about the tree?'' Morara volunteered
to no one in particular. ``That's poison ivy, of course, that is
elementary.''
</P>
<P>
   Stella Jouranis, 64, a retired secretary from Bayside, N.Y., in
Queens County, said she had never been to Bedford-Stuyvesant and
was surprised by its charm.
</P>
<P>
   Jouranis said it was surprising that ``the neighborhood is so
beautiful and it has a lot to offer, and how clean they keep the
streets, and how kind all the people are. They all say hello.''

SMALL-TOWN WAYS ENDURE ON TINY BRONX ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By N.R. KLEINFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jacqueline Kyle Kall was doing what she does best,
talking. Here she was coming into Artie's restaurant for lunch.
Everyone seemed tickled to see her. She ate here a lot. The
waitress plunked down her usual drink _ known as Jackie's Martini _
a double martini.
</P>
<P>
   She lived and sold real estate here on City Island in the Bronx,
a place that seems endowed with confirmed stasis. She was 75, with
a doctorate in conversation, able to pontificate at length on the
mannerisms of the snug island or most anything else. She could do
an hour on Artie's menu alone.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of how City Islanders stayed put, how houses did not
turn over much. Some were passed from generation to generation. A
few dozen hit the market in any given year. She picked up the
thought: ``On my street, nothing has sold in 35 years. I sold a
house on Horton Street that had not been sold in 80 years. When I
see the pallbearers go by my office, I know I have a house. Or like
Lil Hansen. She had a stroke and went into the nursing home. I got
a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods in New York are forever changing, refuting one
image and embracing a fresh one, but there are pockets of
immutability, places that seem to insist on staying as they are.
City Island in the Bronx is one of those places. People come and
go, new housing sprouts up, businesses change hands, but the tenor
and intonation of the place have persisted for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it a cross between Mayberry and Cape Cod,'' said Robert
Carmody, 43, who has a real estate business and actually would like
to see more development than many others would.
</P>
<P>
   It is just a wisp of an island _ one and a quarter miles long
and about a quarter of a mile wide, encircled by Long Island Sound
and Eastchester Bay. Around 5,000 people live on it, mostly in
modest clapboard houses hunched close together. There is one main
strip, City Island Avenue, clotted with seafood restaurant after
seafood restaurant. The only place to stay overnight is a bed and
breakfast called Le Refuge. There are no public beaches. There is
no movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   Talk occasionally circulates about how City Island could become
a grand tourist destination, with hotels and resorts, more condos,
the whole bit. Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, is
among those who hanker for some augmentation, while keeping the
island's flavor. But the prospect of further development sends
prickles down many spines. Last year, when the parks department
proposed a water park for nearby Orchard Beach, the residents said
think again. The park went away. Some people are a bit miffed at
Peter La Scala, who sold a plot of land opposite his yacht
brokerage business not long ago because taxes got too high, he
said, and now 20 houses are going up on it. Residents relish
inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   City Islanders have their own idiom to classify people. Anyone
born on the island is known as a clam digger. Residents born
elsewhere are mussel suckers. Even the obituaries published in the
island's monthly paper, The Island Current, will sometimes identify
people as clam diggers, thus bestowing on them a stature that
extends beyond their other mortal achievements. People neither born
on the island nor living there are known as off-islanders, as in,
``I'm having an off-islander over for cocktails next Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Sadler is a classic clam digger. He was born 84 years ago
in the same upstairs bedroom he now sleeps in. His grandfather
built the house, passed it on to his parents, who passed it on to
him. He is a small, bent man, his face runnelled with lines. A
retired fireboat pilot, he keeps busy adjusting compasses on boats.
``I do the big yachts and the Coast Guard vessels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Viewed across its lengthy history, City Island has actually
witnessed a good deal of change. Originally the home of the Siwanoy
Indians, it became an English settlement in 1685. Norwegians and
Germans settled there, and the place evolved into a prominent
shipbuilding and yachting center. During the world wars, PT boats,
submarine chasers and other battle craft were built in its
boatyards. The sloops that competed in the America's Cup were
constructed on the island. As Fiberglas replaced wood as
boatbuilding material starting in the 1960s, the boatyards got out
of building boats. What remain today are marinas, yacht clubs,
sailmakers and marine supply and repair shops.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, the island was emphatically rural. Herb Hild, a
71-year-old clam digger who owns a business that makes canvas
covers and cushions for boats and now lives on an island in nearby
Rye, remembers how empty the place was when he was a child. The
grocery store shut down for lunch. He marched to school to the
distinctive ring of the caulking hammers at the boatyards.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, mainly working-class people have occupied the
island, with a lot of police officers and firefighters. But houses
have been turning over at enlarging prices, and the island has
gotten more diverse (except racially; it is almost entirely white).
A good many doctors and other medical personnel from the Bronx
hospitals now live there.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Campbell, 40, the publisher of Spin magazine, arrived
from Manhattan with his family five years ago. He rambled off his
neighbors: a detective, an accountant, a carpet salesman, an
installer for a phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Whitcombe, an artist, was painting a sailboat in his small
cottage on Ditmars Street that he shares with his wife, Elizabeth.
He has lived on the island for 45 of his 57 years. The couple do
not own a car. They ride bicycles. A coal stove heats the house. In
recent years, several artists have moved to the island, pleasing
Whitcombe.
</P>
<P>
   Like any small town, the island boasts its share of Gothic
tales, Whitcombe said. A man named Beau Barton used to live down
the block. So the story goes, he had his hopes pinned on receiving
a French honor in eighth grade. When he did not get it, he was
shattered. He rebuffed society. He lived with his sister, who ran a
bookstore, and he rarely showed himself outside.
</P>
<P>
   His sister died, and he made do on his own. He was known to take
the bus at 4 in the morning to stores off the island to fetch
groceries, the better to stay invisible. He had no heat in his
house. One cold winter day about 10 years ago, he was found frozen
to death.
</P>
<P>
   Residents moan when they hear about new condos going up, and
they get worked up over traffic congestion. On the weekends, City
Island Avenue shudders with cars of off-islanders heading for the
restaurants. Residents avoid leaving the island for fear of how
long it would take to return.
</P>
<P>
   Even things on-islanders dislike don't seem to change. Across
the bay in Pelham Bay Park is Rodman's Neck, a police firing range
as well as where the bomb squad detonates confiscated bombs and
fireworks. Pretty much every day, residents and businesses facing
the range hear the irritating rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire as officers
get in their practice. Less frequently, but more noticeably, the
bomb squad sets off a bomb. The island shakes.
</P>
<P>
   A noise-deadening barrier is soon to be built on the range, but
La Scala, like other residents, is dubious it will solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Boat Livery is on Bridge Street, on the water. It's a dark,
scruffy place. In the late afternoon, nearly a dozen people were
grouped around the bar, getting their $1 beers. It was hot and
humid, and they were telling fish stories and otherwise gossiping.
</P>
<P>
   Trader John, as he is known, runs the place. His full name is
John Persteins. He's 58, and he moved to the island with his
parents when he was 2 months old, missing the honor of being a clam
digger by those 60 days. He also has a used boat equipment shop.
The Boat Livery is strictly a beer and wine bar. As Trader John put
it, ``There's enough problems with beer and wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen rent skiffs from Trader John, buy bait from him and
fish. Then they return, quaff some drinks and tell about what got
away.
</P>
<P>
   A buffalo head hangs behind the bar. When a newcomer stops in
for a drink, one of the regulars will say, ``Go outside to see the
other end.'' When the duped rookie steps outside, everyone has a
good laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole bear standing over there,'' Trader John
pointed out. ``People sometimes dance with it. But when you start
to talk to the buffalo, that's when you're turned off. You've had
enough.''

THE LITTLE THINGS COUNT AT POCONO 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE CALDWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ Jimmy Makar suddenly noticed something wrong
with Bobby Labonte's bright green race car Friday afternoon. Makar
strode purposefully over to the front fender, fished in his pocket,
pulled out a pocketknife, and meticulously whittled away a loose
sliver of fluorescent red tape no more than a \-inch wide.
</P>
<P>
   Makar, laughing, would say later that such minor surgery would
probably not make a bit of difference when the Pennsylvania 500 was
run Sunday. But you never know. The crew chief of the top car on
the Nascar Winston Cup circuit cannot afford to take chances,
especially not with Labonte in the middle of a bristling points
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't let the little things slide as much as we used to,''
Makar said.
</P>
<P>
   With only 18 of 34 races complete, the race for the Winston Cup
championship is far from decided. Labonte, the quiet 36-year-old
driver from Corpus Christi, Texas, holds only a 45-point lead over
Dale Earnhardt and a 68-point lead over Dale Jarrett. Labonte's
momentum has been slipping, if only slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has not won since the second race of the year. He has
finished in the top five in only one of his last four races. He is
not even the hottest driver in his owner Joe Gibbs' formidable
racing garage. That would be Tony Stewart, 29, who has gained four
places in the points standing in the last six races and smashed the
track qualifying record here Friday with a lap at 172.391 mph.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Labonte's approach to driving comes into play. His
approach to life, actually.
</P>
<P>
   He does not seem to be too upset about being locked in a battle
with two former champions for his first Winston Cup championship.
He just spent eight days on vacation with his family, far away from
the team's garage.
</P>
<P>
   After he posted the 13th-fastest qualifying time for Sunday's
race, Labonte climbed the steps to the roof of his team's trailer
to calmly review the run with Makar, and stayed there for a long
time. Most drivers disappear quickly after qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't worry about it,'' Labonte said of the points race.
``We let other people worry about it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was just a hint of a grin. Labonte, who finished
second a year ago to Jarrett, is pretty much where he wants to be.
The team has not radically changed its approach from last year,
when Labonte won five races and led a substantially higher
percentage of laps.
</P>
<P>
   The team simply has been more consistent. Labonte has finished
every race. He has finished lower than 13th only twice. The idea is
still to win, not just to run near the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you end up being consistent if you run for wins,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   You also apparently end up having more fun, which, in turn,
leads to more success.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at that `18' bunch, and they're all excited about
being there,'' Earnhardt said recently, referring to Labonte's team
by his car number.
</P>
<P>
   Now Labonte has another valuable ally in Stewart. As soon as
Stewart set the track record Friday, Makar hustled over to
Stewart's garage for some inside information from the crew chief
Greg Zipadelli on how Stewart did it. ``We share everything but
households and credit cards,'' Stewart said.

WOODS-DUVAL DUEL IS SET FOR BRITISH OPEN FINALE
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ As Tiger Woods stood on the precipice of
golf history, David Duval hoped to stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens during Sunday's final round of the
British Open, it will be memorable. Woods, 24, who ended Saturday's
third round holding a six-stroke lead, could become the youngest
player to win the career Grand Slam. But Duval, the world's No.
2-ranked player, will be paired with Woods in the final group _ a
showdown between No. 1 and No. 2 that will be their first pairing
together in a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras will click. Fans will roar. Emotions will run high. But
only one player will hoist the precious claret jug, symbolic of
winning the game's oldest major championship, on the Old Course at
St. Andrews, recognized worldwide as the home of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Who could ask for more? Heading into the final round, Woods will
not need to ask for strokes. Shooting a third-round 67, his third
consecutive round in the 60s, Woods was 16 under for the tournament
(67-66-67 _ 200) six strokes ahead of both Duval (10 under,
70-70-66) and Thomas Bjorn of Denmark (69-69-68). Darren Clarke,
Loren Roberts and David Toms were tied for fourth place at 9-under,
but anyone further behind could probably kiss their chances of
winning goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, even Duval and Bjorn are long shots to catch
Woods, who has won 18 of 20 professional tournaments that he has
led after three rounds. And if Woods wins, he will complete the
career Grand Slam, adding the British Open to his three other major
championships _ the Masters (1997), the PGA Championship (1999) and
this year's U.S. Open, which Woods won by a record 15 strokes. Only
four other players have won all four modern majors _ Gene Sarazen,
Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player.
</P>
<P>
   Woods also has a chance to break the British Open record to par,
18 under, set by Nick Faldo at St. Andrews in 1990. Will Woods feel
pressure Sunday? You bet. But does he think he can handle it?
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger the lead, the more pressure you feel,'' said Woods,
who had a 10-stroke lead after three rounds of this year's U.S.
Open, and who held a nine-stroke lead after three rounds of the
1997 Masters. ``I know the public has wanted to see No. 1 and No. 2
against each other in the final round of a major championship, and
now they will see it. If you don't end up winning, you're not going
to feel too good about yourself. But I've had big leads before, and
I've been able to succeed. We will see tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what Duval hoped to do, and he put himself in contention
despite playing the entire tournament with a sore back. And Duval
did not hide his excitement about teeing off against Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the advantage of being in the last twosome against Woods,
Duval said: ``You get to look him in the eye. If I can swing the
golf club like I have the last few days and putt like I have, I can
show him I've got a little game going right now, too. Absolutely,
it would mean more to beat him. I want you to know that when you're
at your best, I can beat you. That may sound cocky, but it's simply
wanting to compete at the highest level. I'm going to be trying to
win my first major championship, and he's going to be going for the
career Grand Slam. So there's going to be some pressure on both
parties. But yes, I'm excited. How could I not be?''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his news conference, Duval stood to relieve the pain
in his back, which he injured shortly after the U.S. Open. Duval is
not sure how he sustained the injury, but he was in less pain
Saturday than at any time during the tournament. And it showed in
his game, as Duval birdied four of his first nine holes to roar
into contention, then secured his spot in the last group with a
birdie at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's tee shot at the par-4 18th was well right and nearly
sailed out of bounds. But it kicked left after hitting the ground
and it stayed in play, allowing him to hit a nice pitch shot from
75 feet that set up an 8-foot putt that he converted for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Woods never relinquished the lead, and he doubled the
three-stroke lead he began the day with. A crucial stretch came
when Woods reached No. 8 at 11 under, holding just a one-stroke
lead over Steve Flesch, and a two-stroke lead over Duval, Ernie Els
and Toms.
</P>
<P>
   Like a motorist stepping on the accelerator, Woods pulled away,
making five birdies on his next seven holes. At the par-3, 175-yard
No. 8, Woods hit a gorgeous 6-iron tee shot that landed 18 inches
from the cup, then he tapped in for birdie. At the par-4 No. 9,
Woods birdied again, hitting a 9-iron approach shot to 15 feet,
then making the putt.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-4, 314-yard No. 12, Woods drove just short of the
green, hit a splendid chip to 3 feet, then made the putt. At No.
13, he made a 20-foot putt for birdie, then at the par-5, 581-yard
No. 14, he reached the green in two shots, then two-putted from 40
feet for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' streak of bogey-free holes at major championships ended
at 63, when he three-putted for bogey at No. 2, and he also
three-putted for bogey at No. 17. But Woods regained his six-stroke
lead on the final hole, when he made a 10-foot putt for birdie and
pumped his fist, knowing he had put himself in excellent position
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Els most likely lost his chance to win with a crucial
double-bogey at No. 12, hitting his tee shot into the gorse. Els
ended the day tied at 8 under with Flesch, who double-bogeyed No.
13, Tom Lehman, and Dennis Paulson.
</P>
<P>
   But all the pursuers would need help from Woods to win. Even if
Woods shot par on Sunday, Duval and Bjorn would need 66s just to
tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not invincible, but he's playing great,'' Clarke said of
Woods. ``He is going to be very, very difficult to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   So Woods had a six-stroke lead to sleep on, a showdown with
Duval to look forward to, and perhaps a victory speech to deliver.
Woods hoped to seize the moment. And after three rounds of superb
and strategic golf, he appeared on the verge of seizing a special
victory.

POTENTIAL, POWER AND PRIDE KEEP DISPUTED GROUND A PRECARIOUS
PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLAN HEIGHTS _ The rocky, deeply carved landscape of this
volcanic upland is raked by a dry wind and parched almost
unrelievedly brown under a beating summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   On such a day, it is hard to imagine why anyone could think so
inhospitable a piece of land _ less than 40 miles long and 15
across at its widest _ would be worth spending so many lives to
own.
</P>
<P>
   But that first impression, of a desolate wasteland, is very
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the year the climate is beneficent. Spring rainfall
is plentiful, and during that season, it's said _ though I've never
seen it _ the hillsides are awash with green and the colors of
wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   The June 1967 Six-Day War saw Syria driven from the Golan and
the establishment here barely a month afterward of the first
Israeli civilian foothold.
</P>
<P>
   When I traveled the region on assignment in 1970, everywhere you
could see the ruins of abandoned Syrian villages. And Jewish
settlement was salted only thinly across the heights in a dozen
farming outposts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, Arab armies
launched a surprise attack whose declared objective, in the words
of Syria's President Hafez Assad, was to destroy Israel and drive
its people into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   He must have suspected that was a fatuous hope, but at a
minimum, Assad hoped to regain his lost territory. Instead, he
ended up losing more.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing 27 years, the number of Israeli settlers on the
Golan has more than doubled, to some 17,000. They coexist
peacefully, if not always easily, with about an equal number of
Druze people who stayed on the Golan when the Syrian villagers
fled.
</P>
<P>
   And in fields cleared of the rubble of black basaltic stone,
their grain crops, pastures, orchards and vineyards prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its agricultural potential, the area supplies another
and more precious resource. Everywhere in the arid Middle East,
water defines the possibilities of habitation and development.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of Israel's growing annual need is supplied
from the Jordan River and Sea of Galilee, fed by rivers with
sources in the occupied Golan and by spring runoff and snowmelt
feeding down through steeply eroded canyons from the flanks of
Syria's Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
   So water and productive land both are important. But there is a
third factor, still more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   If you stand on the brow of the Golan escarpment, at the bunkers
from which Syrian gunners rained shells on vulnerable Israeli
/{kibbutzim/} in the Galilee below, the military advantage gained
by control of this commanding terrain is immediately obvious.
</P>
<P>
   It is this combination of strategic and practical concerns on
Israel's side, and wounded pride on Syria's side, that has made the
Golan Heights one of the major sticking points in the search for a
comprehensive settlement that would bring an end to the Middle
East's interminable agony.
</P>
<P>
   That was the topic of conversation with an Israeli traveling
companion during a refreshment stop on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, long reported to be in precarious and failing health _
leukemia, diabetes and inoperable heart disease _ had vowed
repeatedly that peace with Israel could be possible only if every
inch of Syrian territory is returned. Thus, the chance of a
breakthrough has seemed slim.
</P>
<P>
   How long, we wondered aloud, would Assad cling to life and
power? If the deadlock were prolonged, was it not likely that any
slight momentum toward a final regional accord would be lost?
</P>
<P>
   And what might his passing mean? A measure of flexibility by his
successor, or an eruption of instability in Syria, perhaps followed
by renewed fanaticism and recklessness?
</P>
<P>
   But those, we agreed, were questions for the future. By some
estimates, Assad should have been dead months ago, and he keeps
proving them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS)Later the same day:(END ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   Descending from the Golan in the waning afternoon, we drive a
short way west, then north to the uppermost town in Israel _ to the
one-time resort village of Metulla, on a narrow finger of land
extending into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   I remember standing 30 years ago with the town's mayor at the
chain-link fence separating the two countries. On the near side
were Metulla's apple orchards. On the Lebanese side were
Palestinian terrorists who regularly lobbed rocket shells over the
fence at the village.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors no longer came to Metulla on holiday. The hotels were
empty. But the villagers stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the mosquitoes are not good, or if the flies are not good _
or if the shooting is not good _ it is the same,'' the mayor said.
``We build fences, we put out our guards, we dig foxholes, and we
continue to live. It is our land.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, we cannot get to the fence even if we cared to.
</P>
<P>
   A detachment of Israeli soldiers blocks the road a mile or more
from the frontier. Through binoculars, two flags can be seen flying
at the border. On the near side is the blue and white flag of the
Jewish state. On the other is the yellow banner of the de facto
rulers of southern Lebanon, the Shiite guerrilla organization
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in gathering dusk, we take the road south to our
night's lodging in the historic mountain town of Safed, a center of
ultraorthodox Judaisim and, in more recent times, a magnet for
artists.
</P>
<P>
   In the hotel lobby the television is playing and replaying the
top story in the news, with pictures of emotional crowds thronging
the streets of Damascus and Syrian officials, faces buried in their
hands, shaken by demonstrative grief.
</P>
<P>
   A familiar visage flashes repeatedly on the screen, followed by
images of that man's son.
</P>
<P>
   The future has arrived, it seems, and no one can know the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   This day _ June 10 _ Hafez Assad, Syria's ruler since 1970, is
dead.

 &HT;    Internet pushing the envelope
 &HT;    By Peralte C. Paul
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to paying his bills, Kip Montgomery says
he's got a system that has the traditional ``check's in the mail''
system licked.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old college professor hasn't bought postage stamps
in three years, and he tosses the return envelopes that come with
his bills.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Montgomery pays all his bills electronically
through a PC-based account with Alpharetta, Ga.-based NetBank.com.
Roughly 47 percent of NetBank's 105,000 customers _ 49,350 account
holders _ use the online bill-paying service.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 3-year-old bank is weaning itself from traditional
mailings. By 2003, it wants to reduce its outgoing mail volume by
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the fastest-growing Internet bank, but we're not going
to have the fastest-growing postal expense rate,'' said Mike
Fitzgerald, NetBank president. ``We're going to see the application
flow become much more electronic.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words aren't welcome news to the $3.19 billion U.S.
envelope manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of plain, letter-size and return bill-pay envelopes
accounted for about 8 percent of total sales last year, according
to the Envelope Manufacturers Association. The industry expects
that figure to begin declining in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, e-commerce will drive the growth of the
direct-mail and niche market packaging to a projected $500 million
this year, said Maynard Benjamin, president of the Envelope
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   That's up from about $12 million 10 years ago, he said. The
direct-mail and niche market accounts for about 69 percent of the
industry's total sales.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new economy'' also is forcing manufacturers to experiment
with ways to make envelopes and packaging more tech-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The envelope of the future is going to have more information
on the outside than on the inside,'' Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   The EMA will test market an envelope and package system this
fall designed to make it easier for customers to return or exchange
merchandise ordered online.
</P>
<P>
   Customers will be able to use a scanner to ``read'' a bar code
imprinted on the outside package, Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   The scanner, connected to a home computer, will call up the
customer's order online so if the customer wants to return it or
exchange it, he or she can immediately input that information onto
a retailer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   It also will allow folks returning merchandise to print a return
mailing address label, Benjamin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything becomes functional in the future,'' he said. ``The
envelope industry is right in the middle of that world.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Envelope Co. of Atlanta is developing a system to embed
computer chips into an envelope or package.
</P>
<P>
   Using a radio-frequency system, companies could track the
location of mass mailings, down to the exact time and delivery of
each piece of mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that (the Internet) trend is having an
effect,'' said Randy Zook, Atlantic Envelope's president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The larger envelope manufacturers say they're prepared for the
Internet's impact because the bulk of their business isn't in
business-size, white envelopes. They're making more, larger
shipping envelopes and packages, which account for more sales. And
those sales are coming from the business-to-business segment, which
still wants a paper trail when conducting transactions with
consumers, manufacturers said.
</P>
<P>
   But even that may be changing. Last month, the American Bankers
Association released a survey that showed financial institutions
decreased their outgoing mail from 9.6 billion pieces in 1996 to
7.9 billion last year _ a 17.7 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that drop is attributable to banks' cutting costs, the
ABA says, but it's also because of changing federal regulations
that no longer require paper transactions in some cases and the
growth of e-mail and faxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're finding better ways to reach customers,'' said John
Hall, an ABA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp. has been accepting online bill
payments since 1997. By 2003, the company expects 3 million of its
22 million customers to receive and pay their bills online.
</P>
<P>
   The company eventually hopes that 50 percent of its customers
will switch to e-billing and e-payments, said Brad Hahn, senior
manager of online billing and payment for BellSouth's e-business
group.
</P>
<P>
   Just meeting that 3 million benchmark would save the company
about $1.05 million in postage and envelope costs, _ roughly 35
cents a customer _ BellSouth said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service, processor of most of the mail sent to
the nation's 130 million households, is watching these envelope
trends carefully. The agency had revenue of about $63 billion last
year, of which $17 billion, or 27 percent, came from consumers
paying their bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service could see that $17 billion evaporate during
the next 10 years, according to a General Accounting Office study.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the agency is integrating Internet services into
its offerings, such as an electronic bill-paying service for
customers it launched in April with Norcross-based CheckFree Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But some envelope manufacturers say that not everyone is jumping
on the e-bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still going to be a segment of the population that
still needs to be reached somehow,'' said Rick Gould, president of
Ohio Envelope Manufacturing Co. in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the Internet will undoubtedly change the
industry. ``I can't imagine we're going to be here 25 years from
now the way we are now.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: REAL ELECTIONS CAN BE DANGEROUS TO DICTATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From communist general secretaries to Latin American
generalissimos, dictators have long confirmed their rule with what
they called ``elections.'' Occasionally, however, autocrats hold
somewhat free elections _ and to their great embarrassment, they
sometimes lose. Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Ferdinand Marcos in the
Philippines, the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the communists in
Poland in 1989 were all voted out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Now another undemocratic group, Mexico's Institutional
Revolutionary Party, has lost an election.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, this unexpected respect for the people's will
came from those within ruling parties _ like President Ernesto
Zedillo in Mexico _ who sincerely wanted to modernize and
democratize their nations.
</P>
<P>
   But others, including many in Mexico's PRI, had no intention of
relinquishing power. They wanted the internal legitimacy,
diplomatic recognition, foreign aid or increased trade that comes
with winning elections, and they were certain they would win,
because the very habits of authoritarianism allowed them to delude
themselves about their own popularity. They forced people to march
in their rallies and shout their slogans, and then they believed
what they saw and heard.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, for example, the PRI pressured newspaper and
television news editors not to report on pre-election polls that
showed the party's candidate, Francisco Labastida, trailing Vicente
Fox. Perhaps that is one reason Labastida told a television
interviewer after the election that he never dreamed he would lose
until he saw the exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   The election of the first noncommunist government in the East
bloc in 1989 illustrates how dictators imprison themselves with
their own repression. The Polish communists convinced themselves
they could beat Solidarity in a real election.
</P>
<P>
   Poland was in economic collapse. Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
decided to legalize the banned Solidarity movement, give it a share
of power and use it to rally support for price hikes and plant
closures.
</P>
<P>
   He thought the party could contain Solidarity in part because
regional party officials, who were his main source of information,
dutifully reported that the average Pole rejected Solidarity.
Jaruzelski was sure he could persuade Poles not to blame the party
for their poverty. He fervently believed that more and better
speeches produced more and better communists. The head of the
communist labor unions was sure he could win a televised debate
with an uneducated electrician named Lech Walesa.
</P>
<P>
   They erred. In elections the next year, Solidarity won 99 of 100
seats in the Senate, and all the 161 seats it was allowed to
contest in the lower house _ familiar numbers in East bloc
elections, now with a new twist.
</P>
<P>
   Autocratic systems isolate the men at the top. When Pinochet
held a plebiscite in 1988, he and his acolytes could not conceive
of losing. They lived in luxury apartments or bucolic estates. But
they could not see that the boom they enjoyed was not shared. The
poor, whose consumption levels had dropped steadily, were invisible
_ in part because bus fares were so high people could not leave the
slums to beg.
</P>
<P>
   Hijacking a vote count _ or worse, annulling an election gone
awry _ is costly for dictators interested in legitimacy. It is very
visible, and by the time a dictatorship is defeated, democratic
forces have usually acquired a momentum that is hard to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Autocrats prefer subtler forms of manipulation _ bribing voters,
intimidating the opposition, blocking voter registration and
monopolizing television. They design rules to allow them to keep
power even if they lose. Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe controls the
appointment of 30 members of Parliament. In Cambodia, Hun Sen's
electoral rules in 1998 allowed him to convert minority popular
support into a parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
   Until the world can organize a conspiracy of pollsters who will
assure autocrats that they are so beloved that they can afford to
call off the thugs and give the opposition equal television time,
it must take manipulation of the campaign climate and election
rules as seriously as election-day fraud. No election with these
flaws should be declared ``free and fair,'' as a U.N.-sponsored
group termed Hun Sen's 1998 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, monitors from the Organization of American States
pulled out of Peru before the electoral runoff because the campaign
had been so orchestrated. Nevertheless, the OAS accepted Alberto
Fujimori's re-election. A spotlight on campaign abuses will help
only if outsiders are serious about defending democracy.

METS MAKE DEAL FOR, NOT WITH, LARKIN
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The New York Mets are prepared to go to great lengths
to get Barry Larkin to agree to join them for the stretch run. But
the one thing they seem unwilling to do is the one thing Larkin may
want most from them. Unless the Mets give him a contract extension,
Larkin, the 36-year-old Cincinnati Reds shortstop, seems likely to
stay put.
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips, who reached an agreement on
a deal for Larkin on Thursday, received permission from the
commissioner's office to speak with him starting 10 a.m. Saturday.
The Mets have until 10 a.m. Tuesday to persuade Larkin to accept
the deal. As a 10-year veteran who has spent the last five years
with one team, Larkin has veto power over trades.
</P>
<P>
   Before Phillips spoke Saturday with Larkin and his agent, Eric
Goldschmidt, he told Reds general manager Jim Bowden of his
intentions regarding Larkin. Phillips told Bowden he intended to
retain Larkin for the rest of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said ``it depended on if the Mets were willing to sign
him to a multiyear contract,'' Bowden told The Cincinnati Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said our understanding at this time was that they're not
interested in doing that,'' Bowden continued. ``He didn't answer me
right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said Bowden's characterization of his position was
accurate. While the Mets could offer Larkin a bonus for agreeing to
a deal, the 11-time All-Star seems to be insisting on an extension.
The Reds turned down Larkin's request for a three-year, $27.9
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets played an afternoon game in Atlanta Saturday and have a
night game on Sunday. But when Phillips spoke with Larkin and
Goldschmidt Saturday morning, he offered to bring a contingent of
Mets to meet with Larkin in Cincinnati Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said manager Bobby Valentine, the former Larkin
teammates John Franco and Lenny Harris of the Mets, plus one or
both of the Mets owners, Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon _ and any
other interested Mets personnel _ were prepared to take Wilpon's
private jet to meet Larkin. But Goldschmidt told Phillips he wanted
to ``talk through the issues'' before agreeing to a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are off on Monday, and Phillips said such a meeting is
more likely to take place then. But the general manager is eager to
get together, even though Wilpon's plane was still in the New York
area Saturday morning. ``They're revving the engines on the
runway,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who called Larkin on Friday night but had not heard back
from him before Saturday's game, said that he had no plans to fly
to Cincinnati and that he doubted Larkin would be influenced by a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think so,'' said Harris, who considers Larkin
one of his best friends. ``Barry just wants to get paid. If they're
going to take care of his contract, he'll be here playing. Simple
as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are resisting signing Larkin to a long-term deal
because they have committed $16 million over the next three years
to the injured Rey Ordonez, and because they covet Seattle
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who, like Larkin, can be a free agent
this winter. Larkin's skills have not declined markedly despite his
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he still has years ahead of him,'' Phillips said. ``He
still is moving well and has his agility, his acceleration in his
stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin continues to play for the Reds even during the 72-hour
negotiating window, and Phillips said the Mets will not hold out of
action the players they have agreed to trade to the Reds, wherever
they are in the organization. A baseball official said the former
No. 1 overall draft pick Paul Wilson, who has not pitched in the
majors since 1996 but is doing well at Triple-A Norfolk, may be
part of the package.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips also said the Larkin trade is not holding up other
deals. The Mets continue to explore other deals, with pitching
their first priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing that we're talking about hinges on this,'' he said.

the U.S. is stepping into a Vietnam-style quagmire by sending
military advisors and sleek new helicopters to help battle
Colombia's drug lords, who along with Marxist guerrillas control
vast areas in the countryside. Meanwhile, Colombian President
Andres Pastrana is battling plummeting public support, a deep

Affairs and divorces have been on the upswing for years in China,
but men in Guangdong have taken marital infidelity to a new level _
they are known to take a mistress _ or even two or three _ set them
up in a house, even have children with them. For wives who want a
divorce, laws are so inadequate, it could mean years of poverty for
them. The problem has become so serious, the province issued anew

County, meandering past tracts of dusty farmland, boarded-up gas
stations and sacred civil rights-era ground. A racially mixed group
of developers and county officials, including some who hold office
thanks to the voting rights crusade, feel the 670-acre landfill is
just the thing to jump-start the economy of one of the state's
poorest counties. But landfill opponents, also a mix of blacks and
whites, say a dump near U.S. 80 would be an affront to the memory
of the marchers and hurt both the environment and a fledgling
tourist industry. Last week, the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management granted a permit for a landfill. We take a

without them,'' said the College of Charleston English instructor
and self-appointed guardian of the historic district's exterior
window dressings. Though few, if any, are so fretful, Wilkinson
said the shutters are disappearing as well-heeled out of towners
snap up historic houses and, during renovation, are not aware, or

28-year-old secretary, was upset over mistreatment she says she and
other blacks received at the hands of police during a July 4th
altercation. That holiday weekend confrontation, which eventually
turned violent, led to a subsequent protest march on Monday (July
17) with others planned. It has also revealed a wider set of
grievances. A loose coalition of residents and ministers is now
calling for sensitivity training for police, a community-wide forum
to discuss racial differences and better economic opportunities for
the city's black population. We examine the continuing evolution of
a city in transition. (Chapman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

ears, this familiar pattern identifies a World Wide Web site on the
Internet. The system seems simple and settled, but a global battle
is being waged this summer over how addresses will be assigned to
keep pace with rapid Internet growth. The stakes are enormous. If
plans to establish private control over the Internet's address
system founders on technical details and political disputes, the
global expansion of the online community could become gridlocked.

that would reelect President Clinton or give Republican Bob Dole a
fighting chance. In a close presidential race in 2000 between Al
Gore and George W. Bush, the women's vote is all-important, but
more difficult to define and to attract. So far, polls are showing
that more men are strong supporters of their choice, where women
tend to be more flexible _undecideds or soft supporters of Gore or
Bush. In addition to the gender gap, there is a particularly large
``marriage'' gap. Clinton led Dole among married women 53% to 43%

This odd kinship of outcasts dawned on me as I was sitting at a

heart of the city like a jade pendant. Ferry boats were churning
through the whitecaps of crisscrossing wakes. On one side of the
cove, the Opera House roof loomed like the upturned prows of a
dozen giant rowboats. On the other side, blue Australian flags
streamed in the breeze atop the long steel arch of the Harbour
Bridge. It's hard to imagine now, but this postcard spot was where
the First Fleet landed in 1788 with a thousand convicts and
sailors. Ten thousand miles from home, they struggled and almost
starved yet somehow managed to transform their bitter exile into a
city and nation that will soon command the world's attention.

REED IS SHARP;   LARKIN TRADE   NOT COMPLETED
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This was the game Rick Reed wanted to pitch nine
months ago. Reed was the New York Mets' scheduled starter for the
seventh game of the National League Championship Series last
October, and twice in the late innings of the sixth game, the Mets
took the lead and seemed poised to give Reed his chance.
</P>
<P>
   That never happened, of course, as the Atlanta Braves came back
to beat the Mets and capture another World Series berth. The Mets
went home and had months to dwell on what could have been.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will bolster their chances for advancing further this
season if the Cincinnati Reds' shortstop, Barry Larkin, agrees to
be traded to New York by Tuesday. But Larkin is not with the team _
though the Mets' courtship has formally begun _ and as manager
Bobby Valentine said, ``I believe it's not the best team that wins,
but the team that plays the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets played the best Saturday, and Reed had much to do with
it. The right-hander has said he never thought much about his
missed opportunity last fall; this is a new season. But it takes a
while to break a spell, and the Braves have one on the Mets,
especially at Turner Field. Reed did his best to overcome the hex,
and his seven shutout innings led the Mets to a 4-0 victory. They
won for just the second time in their last 17 games here.
</P>
<P>
   At his best, Reed pitches like Greg Maddux, the Braves' ace, who
opposed him. His stuff is not overwhelming, but he can throw it
with uncanny precision and is very tough when he does.
</P>
<P>
   The two were nearly identical Saturday _ Maddux threw 88
pitches, including 60 strikes, in eight innings; Reed threw 87
pitches, including 57 strikes, in seven innings. Maddux permitted
five hits, Reed just four. Both pitchers issued one walk.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed (5-2) won because he kept the Braves from hurting him
when it mattered. The Braves batted seven times with a runner on
base, and had no hits in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets battered Maddux at Shea Stadium on July 1, scoring
seven runs in two innings in Maddux's shortest start in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, the four-time Cy Young award winner, was better
Saturday, making the Mets put the ball in play and his only walk,
to Melvin Mora in the fifth inning, was intentional.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile had opened the fifth with a double, and Jay Payton
singled him to third. After a ground out advanced Payton to second
and Mora walked, Reed came up and lofted a fly ball to center, deep
enough to score Zeile and give the Mets a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The lead could have been wider had Payton been called safe
trying to advance to second on a single in the second inning. His
hit scored Mike Piazza, and when Payton was called out advancing,
Valentine bolted to the field to argue the call.
</P>
<P>
   He continued the argument after the inning, jawing with the home
plate umpire, Andrew Fletcher, before another umpire got between
them and Valentine retreated to the dugout. He spoke with the
umpires some more after Armando Benitez recorded the game's final
out.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell, who had a .175 career average off Maddux in 57
at-bats, homered to lead off the sixth inning to increase the Mets'
lead to 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, meanwhile, could do almost nothing with Reed,
although their Nos. 2 through 6 hitters came into the game with a
combined average of .329 off him. Only one Brave advanced to second
base against him.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who was shaky in the early innings of his last start but
finished it strong, opened this game with perfection. He set down
the first eight hitters, gave up a single to Maddux, then got a
strikeout to end the third inning and double plays to help him out
of the fourth, fifth and seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh inning was typical. Reed stayed ahead in the count
on Chipper Jones, who finally bounced a ball up the middle and beat
out an off-balance throw by second baseman Joe McEwing. Brian
Jordan promptly grounded into his second double play of the day,
and after Reed allowed a single to Andres Galarraga, he patted his
chest as he looked at Piazza, his catcher: My fault, and no
problem. Bobby Bonilla flied out softly. &QL;

 &HT;    Everyone's chatting on who will fill vacancy
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes made an unexpected flying visit
Wednesday to Blairsville, which happens to be near Young Harris,
which happens to be the home of former Gov. Zell Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the level of intrigue following the death last week
of Sen. Paul Coverdell that Barnes's aides refused to say whether
the two Democrats met, much less whether they discussed Miller's
willingness to take Coverdell's place in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Georgia's congressional Republicans met twice
last week in an effort to figure out who among them would run for
Coverdell's seat. Those discussions were inconclusive, but at least
five of the eight Republicans have some level of interest, said two
House members who attended the meetings, but would not be quoted by
name.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans are even talking about getting Coverdell's
widow, Nancy Coverdell, to run for the seat. Asking her ``would be
a correct protocol,'' said Georgia GOP chairman Charles ``Chuck''
Clay.
</P>
<P>
   But Clay said he is unaware whether the issue has been broached.
Nancy Coverdell had little involvement in politics during her
husband's long career in elected office.
</P>
<P>
   The public silence surrounding the issue of succession is, in
part, a show of respect in the immediate aftermath of Coverdell's
death. No politician wants to seem too opportunistic at a moment
better reserved for mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who also met with former Sen. Sam Nunn for more than a
half hour Friday, declined to discuss the appointment issue before
Coverdell's memorial service Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about it. I think it's inappropriate and
I think it's disrespectful,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   But the political reality is that the identity of the next
senator is all anyone in Georgia politics is talking about.
Coverdell's death has transformed a sleepy political year in
Georgia and created an opening the likes of which was last seen in
1971, after the death of Sen. Richard Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes presumably will announce Coverdell's interim successor in
the coming days. But that person will have to win the seat again in
a special non-partisan election in November.
</P>
<P>
   The opening has implications for the presidential campaign in
Georgia. The selection of an African-American, for instance, could
produce a record turnout among heavily Democratic black Georgians
and boost Vice President Al Gore's chances in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of vice presidential running mates also could affect
the Senate contest, especially if Republicans select a minority,
said Merle Black, an Emory University political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Miller is the first and last name among Democrats.
``He'd be as formidable as anybody I know,'' said Rep. Larry Walker
(D-Perry), the Democratic leader in the state House.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Miller will accept is anyone's guess. He declined to
run against Coverdell two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If he should decide to remain in political retirement, Barnes
faces a potential headache. ``He'd have all of the factions
lobbying hard,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Other names that have surfaced in the event Miller is not
interested include: Secretary of State Cathy Cox, a rising
Democratic star; former Rep. George ``Buddy'' Darden, an old friend
of the governor; Rep. John Lewis, who has openly indicated his
availability; former Secretary of State Lewis Massey; Rep. Cynthia
McKinney and state Sen. Charles Walker of Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   All but Lewis are little known statewide, an obstacle in so
short a campaign. Lewis, McKinney and Walker are black, and no
black candidate has won a high-profile statewide election in
Georgia, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans agree that Miller is the only Democrat who is likely
to cause some Republicans to stay out of the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's candidacy might not scare off Republicans who hope
to raise their profile for the next round of statewide elections in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Kingston has made a reputation for himself in
Washington as a bright, articulate Republican whose youthful
appearance and sense of humor takes the edge off his conservative
politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Kingston is virtually unknown outside the Savannah area, and
even in what could be a losing effort against Miller, Kingston
could win favorable reviews that would make him the choice of
Republicans two years from now, when Sen. Max Cleland is up for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that he would be interested in building name
recognition for the next time,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberations of Georgia's congressional Republicans are
complicated by the strong possibility that some of their seats
would fall to Democrats if no incumbent is running.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston, Bob Barr, Saxby Chambliss, Johnny Isakson and John
Linder are exploring to different degrees whether to run for the
Senate, said the two Georgia House members.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's and Chambliss's seats in particular would be vulnerable
if they were to run. And with Republican control of the House
hanging by a thread, the GOP can ill afford to lose two seats they
are now favored to hold.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson might at first blush appear to be the GOP's strongest
candidate, with his previous experience in statewide campaigns and
his suburban Atlanta base.
</P>
<P>
   But conservative groups are unlikely to allow Isakson to have
the field to himself because of his moderate politics, especially
on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson indelibly etched his support of abortion rights in
television commercials for his 1996 Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Isakson's colleagues are unenthusiastic about his
candidacy and will not stand aside for him, the two congressmen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The group agreed that no one would declare his candidacy before
the delegation's next meeting, which may take place as early as
Monday.

WHEN AGENCY DOESN'T HELP, GRANDPARENTS GO TO COURT FOR CUSTODY OF

</P>
<P>
   SEDALIA, Mo. _ The digital clock read 2:36 a.m. when a phone
call jolted Len and Carol Hall awake.
</P>
<P>
   Len snatched the receiver and handed it to his wife. He scurried
to another phone and clicked on a tape recorder. It was their son,
John.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have your grandparents' rights pulled,'' John
snarled. ``You're dead to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do,'' Len said, ``is protect our
granddaughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You,'' John answered, ``are not going to see your
granddaughter again.''
</P>
<P>
   Len filled with anger. Tears streamed down his wife's face.
</P>
<P>
   For months, they had argued with their son and daughter-in-law
about feeding, hygiene and other issues involving their infant
granddaughter, Becky. They fretted when she threw up after being
fed sour and weak formula. They photographed a diaper rash that
oozed. They kept a log that eventually grew more than an inch
thick.
</P>
<P>
   State child-welfare workers intervened, then withdrew, saying
that there wasn't enough neglect for them to act and that the
agency's involvement had worsened relations between the families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us our standards were too high,'' said Carol Hall,
52.
</P>
<P>
   To the elder Halls, this was a clear case of a child needing
protection. They thought the Missouri Division of Family Services,
which once had named Carol Hall its volunteer of the year, had let
them down.
</P>
<P>
   But Family Services doesn't require perfect parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that we are not doing what they would like to see
happen and they could do a better job,'' said Anna Stone, who
oversees Family Services' child-welfare programs. ``But that's not
where we start. We start by looking at the family itself to see
what services we can offer to keep the children in their own
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by Family Services' failure to do more, Len and Carol
Hall ultimately hired a lawyer to help them prove their son and his
wife were unfit parents. The middle-of-the-night phone call from
John had come after he had received the court papers. In coming
months, the grandparents would spend $6,000 to win guardianship of
Becky.
</P>
<P>
   The postal worker and his wife said it never should have come to
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could come up with enough for a judge, Family Services
could have done more,'' said Len Hall, 52. ``How many more kids are
out there who don't have family who will go through hell like we
did?''
</P>
<P>
   The threshold for removing children from their families is
loosely defined, varies between communities and evolves over time.
</P>
<P>
   Family Services doesn't provide workers a list of situations to
consult. There's not even a hard rule on when a child can be left
home alone. Unless abuse is severe, responses aren't black and
white. The situation is similar in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   A national agency once sent photographs showing welt marks on a
boy's back to jurisdictions around the country and asked: Does this
constitute abuse?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who said yes were appalled by those who said no,''
said David Kierst Jr., a Jackson County Family Court official.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the Child Welfare League of America asked state
agencies whether the abuse threshold had changed. Nearly half said
they turned away cases they had handled five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In neglect cases, it's difficult for courts to remove children
unless the neglect is flagrant, said Linda Spears, the Child
Welfare League's director of child protection.
</P>
<P>
   Many neglected children aren't in imminent danger but may be at
risk for long-term harm, she said, and the child welfare system is
poorly structured to measure that harm.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies and courts usually take their cues from community
standards. Yet in Jackson County, Family Court's standards
sometimes disagree with Family Services' standards, said Kierst,
who wants a committee to develop uniform guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life would be simpler if there were real black and white
rules,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Len and Carol Hall would agree.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-month romance, John and Coby Hall married in October
1996.
</P>
<P>
   He was 21 and rebellious. He said he saw the marriage as a way
to jab his parents, who disapproved of Coby.
</P>
<P>
   She was 19, divorced and six months pregnant with her fourth
child. Each had a different father.
</P>
<P>
   None of her three other children lived with her. After
abandonment allegations, her two oldest went to Family Services.
Her ex-husband had the third. When the fourth arrived three months
after her marriage to John, Coby gave it up for adoption. John was
not the father. Coby said she was unsure who was.
</P>
<P>
   The Halls' granddaughter, Jadelynn Rebecca Hall, arrived April
27, 1998. The next month, medical records show, Becky was diagnosed
with her first of six infected diaper rashes.
</P>
<P>
   Blame poor hygiene, the grandparents say. They complain that
Coby routinely left soiled and wet diapers on Becky too long.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Coby said. Becky was allergic to certain diapers, that's
all.
</P>
<P>
   The families argued often over formula, inappropriate foods,
constipation remedies and living conditions. The grandparents
worried about Becky's small size, a possible sign of inadequate
nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the spreading diaper rash blistered and oozed,
reminding Carol of raw hamburger. After a pediatrician refused to
call Family Services, the Halls agonizingly chose to tattle on
their own son.
</P>
<P>
   State law prohibits child-welfare workers from discussing
specific cases. But, statewide, most neglect allegations wind up
unsubstantiated. In this case, Family Services left Becky with her
parents in Sedalia. The agency even recommended that the courts
return Coby's two oldest children to her care.
</P>
<P>
   Len caught Family Services' decision to withdraw on a tape
recorder hidden in his pocket during a meeting also attended by
Carol and Coby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not finding the level of neglect that would remove the
children from the home,'' a Family Services worker said. ``We
continue to get reports through the hot line and are unable to
substantiate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Becky, a blond baby with dark chocolate eyes, was 4 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, Len Hall photographed conditions inside his son's
home. One picture shows mold on food-encrusted dishes. Another
shows bare mattresses on the floor in the children's rooms. A third
shows a door lock on the outside of a bedroom door, allowing
parents to lock the children inside.
</P>
<P>
   The Halls returned to Family Services with their new evidence
and more pleas for help. Again they were rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them: If this is what Family Services considers
acceptable,'' Len recalled in a wavering voice, ``then I don't care
for them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Let down by an agency they had supported for years, including
shopping for foster children at Christmas, the Halls searched for
other options.
</P>
<P>
   They found help in a place they thought handled only wills and
estates.
</P>
<P>
   Probate court?
</P>
<P>
   The Halls were surprised. Their lawyer said they could seek
guardianship of Becky in Pettis County probate court.
</P>
<P>
   There were no guarantees. Plus, guardianship carried a risk.
Unlike the finality of terminating parental rights in family court,
guardianship could be overturned if John and Coby changed their
ways.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ... changed their ways.
</P>
<P>
   John and Coby had just moved to Kirksville when they were served
with the court papers. Becky was about 7 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Her age would double before the case reached Judge Robert
Koffman's Sedalia courtroom in the summer of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first witnesses, a psychologist who had examined John
and Coby, doubted their ability to be good parents. He said John
had a personality disorder, though not a monumental one. He said
Coby lacked nurturing ability, got no gratification from mothering,
felt no compassion for others' pain, lacked the ability to bond and
could not learn from mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Would she cook for her kids? Not unless she was hungry, the
psychologist said. Would she be able to change diapers regularly?
That would be beyond her capacity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former baby sitter testified that she left Becky's diaper bag
on her porch because roaches crawled from it. She described diaper
rashes that bled and recounted bathing Becky three times a week
because she arrived dirty. She said she wouldn't let her dog live
in John and Coby's home.
</P>
<P>
   An acquaintance of John and Coby's recounted watching Coby throw
pieces of pizza on the floor for Becky to eat _ an allegation Coby
later denied.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the testimony from Coby's ex-husband, who
fathered her third child. He told how, at one point after they
divorced, Coby gave him their infant daughter to keep Family
Services from taking her.
</P>
<P>
   The baby appeared sick, so he took her to a hospital. She had
pneumonia, E. coli bacteria in her bloodstream and a severe urinary
tract infection. She had gained only 3 ounces since her birth six
months earlier. Doctors hospitalized her for 10 days. Coby later
said she hadn't realized the infant was ill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After several others testified, including Becky's grandparents,
it was John and Coby's turn. They denied most accusations. They
pleaded to keep Becky.
</P>
<P>
   Said John: ``I love that little girl with all my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Coby: ``I try to be a good parent. Children don't come with
a manual. I was 15 years old when I got pregnant and had my first
kid. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but I try my damndest _ my
darndest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sorry about what you've done?'' Coby's attorney asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' she replied, sniffling. ``I've never been proud of
what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, the grandparents' attorney raised
questions about John and Coby's character.
</P>
<P>
   Though John had stolen money from an employer to buy a mobile
home, he said, he later paid it back. Yes, he had worked more than
15 jobs in two years. Yes, he once gave his parents written
permission to care for Becky after Coby ran out on him. But Coby
returned.
</P>
<P>
   How many times had Coby been hot lined? At least 20, she
answered. Yes, she had smoked marijuana, but only as a child. She
had been partying too much to know who had fathered her fourth
child.
</P>
<P>
   After closing arguments, Koffman took a recess. He would
announce his decision in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Len and Carol Hall's attorney flashed them a thumbs-up sign. He
felt confident.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Halls had knots in their stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's probate courts routinely handle guardianship cases
involving minors. The number of cases has increased through the
1990s. The latest statistics, from June 1999, showed 10,356 open
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents, other relatives and foster parents are among those
who seek guardianship for various reasons, often because of
parental deaths or imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Koffman handles two or three cases a month in Sedalia and
expects the number to increase.
</P>
<P>
   In Clay County, Judge Larry D. Harman estimated that
grandparents were involved in a third to a half of the 251 cases
his court had as of May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Family Services is not involved. When a former Division
of Family Services case ends up in probate court, that doesn't mean
Family Services has failed, judges say.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the Hall case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see DFS doing anything bad here,'' Koffman said months
after issuing his ruling in the Hall case. ``If this were an abuse
case, yes. But there were no physical injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times Family Services directs family members to
probate court, which might do something when juvenile or family
courts cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Stangler, Missouri's social services director, pointed that
out in a letter to Len and Carol Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Removing a child from a parent is something that juvenile
court judges take extremely seriously, and do so only when all
other reasonable efforts to protect the child have failed,'' the
letter said. ``In situations like that, we may recommend to family
members who are concerned that they seek advice from a private
attorney regarding possible legal courses of action. In your case,
you did so.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter didn't placate the Halls, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's costing us out the wazoo,'' Len said. ``Not everyone can
afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   During Becky's hearing, Koffman warned the parties that a
cluttered house showed nothing and that he couldn't remove a child
just because parents were poor.
</P>
<P>
   As he summarized key testimony, his tone and words conveyed the
direction in which he was heading.
</P>
<P>
   Len and Carol Hall began to cry softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt this child is at risk if allowed to remain
with the parents at this time,'' Koffman said that July day a year
ago. ``The court finds by full and convincing evidence the parents
are unfit and unable to perform duties of natural guardians.''
</P>
<P>
   He named Len and Carol Hall as Becky's guardians, announced a
visitation schedule and then looked at Coby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, Coby,'' he began, ``if I had jurisdiction over
your other kids, I'd have taken them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Coby broke into sobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't. So that's the way it is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now more than 2 years old, Becky Hall has a corner bedroom
decorated in a Precious Moments motif. It's where MaMaw, as Becky
calls her grandmother, rocks and sings her to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Becky's weight has more than doubled in the past year. She now
falls in the middle of growth charts instead of in the bottom
quarter. Her diaper rash is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Even her dad, John, thinks she looks better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my daughter is in the best place for her right now,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   John and Coby separated six weeks after losing Becky. They now
have visitation on separate weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Were his parents' standards too high, as Family Services said?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' said John, who is living in Sedalia again.
He realizes now that his parents only wanted Becky to have the same
care he had growing up.
</P>
<P>
   John eventually would like to regain custody of Becky. So would
Coby.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know that will be a while,'' Coby said.
</P>
<P>
   After winning guardianship of Becky, the grandparents continued
their child protection crusade.
</P>
<P>
   They filed a complaint with the Missouri Board of Healing Arts
against the pediatrician who refused to call the child-abuse hot
line. They testified in Jefferson City for a bill that would have
relaxed child-abuse confidentiality laws, which might have helped
them obtain previous hot line reports involving Coby. They won
revised visitation so neither Coby nor John could keep Becky
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   They remain upset that Family Services didn't do more. They fret
about possibly losing Becky to John or Coby some day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they're glad they found a way to rescue Becky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God,'' Carol said, ``for Judge Koffman.''

HOT LINES AVAILABLE TO REPORT CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT

</P>
<P>
   Missouri and Kansas operate toll-free hot lines for people to
report suspected child abuse and neglect. Those hot lines are the
first step toward getting children removed from dangerous
situations.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators look for physical injuries, sexual abuse or
the failure to provide nutritional, medical or other care.
</P>
<P>
   In most Kansas and Missouri cases, allegations are not
substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   When abuse or neglect has occurred or is suspected, workers
often offer services to help parents correct problems. State
agencies want to preserve families whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   If agencies fear for children's safety, they seek court
permission to have the children removed into foster care or a
relative's home. This is done through juvenile or family court.
</P>
<P>
   Judges usually appoint a lawyer to represent the child as the
case progresses. Sometimes, judges terminate parental rights and
remove the child from its parents.
</P>
<P>
   If relatives feel child-welfare agencies or juvenile courts have
not done enough, they can challenge the parents in court, judges
and lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, relatives have the right to file a
child-in-need-of-care case, which is handled in juvenile court. If
the case is proven, the judge may name the relative as guardian or
may choose to send the child to foster care or somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, relatives can seek guardianship in probate court,
where they must prove the parents unfit. The judge usually appoints
a lawyer to represent the child. Parents being sued have to obtain
their own attorney or represent themselves. &QL;

 &HT;    Olympic dreams
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After winning the final Tour time trial on Friday in near
record-breaking fashion, Lance Armstrong has set his sights on a
gold medal at the Olympics in Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a gold medal would be one of the special highlights of
my career,'' said Armstrong, who is guaranteed a spot on his third
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong finished sixth at the 1996 time trial. Two months
later, he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer.
</P>
<P>
   His main competition in the Olympics should be Jan Ullrich, who
finished 25 seconds behind Armstrong in Friday's 34.5-mile time
trial. Armstrong has won four of the last five individual time
trials the Tour has held, with his only loss coming in the 10-mile
prologue on July 1. David Millar beat Armstrong by two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   CATCHING UP ON JERSEYS
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong will wear the yellow jersey today, barring a
monumental crash.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tour also awards other jerseys. Here's a rundown on
who's wearing what:
</P>
<P>
   Green jersey for best sprinter: Eric Zabel. Polka dot jersey for
top climber: Santiago Botero. White jersey for best young rider:
Francisco Mancebo.
</P>
<P>
   An award with no jersey is the most combative rider. Erik Dekker
will earn this distinction. The top team is Kelme-Costa Blanca,
with Armstrong's U.S. Postal team in fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVELOGUE
</P>
<P>
   The Tour stopped in champagne country Saturday when the riders
traveled to Troyes. The city is on the River Seine, and it was
founded sometime in the third century under the Gallo-Romans. It
came of age in the Middle Ages thanks to the leadership of the
Comte de Champagne, who started the champagne fairs. The fairs were
an important exchange for merchants throughout Europe and the
Orient.
</P>
<P>
   The city, about a two-hour drive from Paris, doesn't just make
sparkling wine. It's also famous for its textiles and hosiery.

 &HT;    Alabama dumping on history?
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWNDESBORO, Ala. _ The four-lane rural highway between Selma
and Montgomery winds past endless acres of pines, abandoned gas
stations, remote barbecue joints, parched rows of corn and 54 miles
of civil rights history.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in March 1965,
thousands of marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma and
reached Montgomery four days later, demanding the right of black
people to vote. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting
Rights Act that August.
</P>
<P>
   Activists revere the path as holy ground in the civil rights
movement. President Clinton has declared the highway a national
historic trail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of the ground is about to be trashed.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of community debate, the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management (ADEM) has approved a landfill permit on
the same highway where two demonstrators were killed, one a month
before the historic march, one a day after.
</P>
<P>
   On telephone poles along U.S. 80, modern protesters have posted
white placards with black letters: ``Don't trash our treasure!''
One is staked near a historic marker on Frederick Douglass Road,
named for the famous black man who escaped slavery and spoke
eloquently for abolition.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have gathered nearly 1,500 signatures on petitions.
They've gotten support from Ed Martin, a black Birmingham
politician running as a Republican for the state's 7th
Congressional District seat.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Race, Poverty and the Environment has filed a
complaint against ADEM with the federal Environmental Protection
Agency. In a county of 12,000 residents, blacks outnumber whites
about 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco civil rights group alleges ADEM has allowed a
string of landfills to be built in mostly black communities, which
it contends violates the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, local black leaders _ including some who
marched in 1965 _ support the landfill as a jump-start for the
county's lagging economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to affect the historical trail
because it's far enough off the road,'' said Lowndes County
Commission Chairman Joe Frank Brown, a black who marched from Selma
in 1965. The commission approved the landfill two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the economy is kind of slow,'' Brown said. ``We're
trying to attract industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Just west of Montgomery, Lowndes County is among the poorest
places in Alabama. What's not covered by grazing land is covered by
pine trees. A GE plastics plant is the county's biggest industry,
but there's not much beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Landfill owner Lanny Young estimates his business could generate
$300,000 to $500,000 a year for Lowndes County, which operates on
an annual budget of about $1 million. Young will pay the county
$1.50 for every ton of garbage hauled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else that could come into Lowndes County and
produce that kind of revenue,'' said Young, a Montgomery
businessman, who purchased the property expressly to build a
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   To ease local concerns, Young said he's worked with Brown and
county probate court Judge John Hulett, another black political
pioneer. Young's company, Alabama Disposals Solutions, will
construct the landfill at least 1,000 feet south of the trail.
Young said the $4 million facility could be completed within four
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't even be able to see it from the trail,'' Young said.
``I'm sure we're OK with the people in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Moody is not one of them. Moody runs the Marengo
Plantation, a 165-year-old antebellum house in Lowndesboro that's
used for private dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   A mostly white town in mostly black Lowndes County, Lowndesboro
boasts several antebellum homes with white columns soaring to
second-floor balconies. The doctor who owned the Marengo Plantation
during the Civil War found a young man with acne, showed him to
would-be Union raiders on their way to meet General Sherman and
convinced them his ``patient'' was suffering from smallpox, Moody
said. The raiders went around Lowndesboro.
</P>
<P>
   Moody, a white developer, said future tourism generated by the
trail will be an economic boon that makes the landfill unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we used another national treasure _ say, Arlington National
Cemetery, Mount Rushmore, the Washington Monument _ and any entity
proposed a solid waste landfill next to that, it would never get
out of the box,'' Moody said. ``It would be completely shut down.
There would be no consideration given to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In approving the permit Thursday, the state environmental
department said there were few technical problems with the proposed
landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received comments opposing the landfill, but the
overwhelming majority of them involved issues outside the agency's
authority,'' said Jim Warr, ADEM director. ``We felt that, under
our regulations, an additional public hearing was not warranted
because these issues have already been addressed by the Lowndes
County Commission.''

 &HT;    Police battle with blacks spawns plans for change

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ It was a festive gathering of families marching
hand-in-hand, of children on bikes, of laughter and song.
</P>
<P>
   But when the 200 protesters reached Gloucester Street last
Monday and mounted the concrete steps to the Old City Hall, the
camaraderie disappeared. Preachers and citizens railed against the
``injustice'' and the ``disrespect'' shown by the police, the mayor
and other community leaders in their reactions to the July 4th and
5th violence which ended in injury and arson.
</P>
<P>
   One called Mayor Brad Brown a liar. Another demanded the mayor
apologize _ or resign. Yet another disparaged Brown ``and his
compadre Negro woman Venus Holmes'' _ the head of the local NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Minister Odis Muhammad of the Nation of Islam summed up the ugly
events and warned the troubles may not be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been a lot worse, and if we don't deal with it,''
Muhammad prophesied, ``it's going to get a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody _ black or white, citizen or elected official, low-income
or high-roller _ wants more violence. It was bad enough, all say,
when the combustive mix of fireworks, alcohol and police exploded
in Brunswick and nearby St. Simons Island.
</P>
<P>
   But the episodes highlighted long-simmering resentment and
disrespect between many blacks and police in this coastal
community. It fueled the anger and animosity of those left behind
the Golden Isles economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   It also showed the deep chasm between young blacks and
Brunswick's old-guard black leadership, particularly the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Long the
country's pre-eminent civil rights group, the NAACP struggles to
recruit its next generation of members.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some good may come from the bad in Brunswick. The newfound
spirit _ an awakening of civil rights _ is engendering calls for
social and economic changes. The city manager responds with a slew
of cultural awareness and economic-development proposals.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps the next generation of Brunswick's
up-from-the-streets leadership is coming of age. Kendra McCrae, a
28-year-old single mother and secretary, personifies the new
activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm put here for exactly yet, but whatever I
can do for my people _ for anybody _ I will do,'' McCrae said the
morning after the march on Old City Hall. ``It's time. I want to be
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrae grew up in and around the McIntyre Court public housing
complex where the partying run amok led to the minor injuries of
five police officers and the incineration of two cop cars.
</P>
<P>
   She witnessed the July 4th disturbance at Massengale Beach, when
police tried to arrest the father of her child for riding a
four-wheeler illegally on the beach. Under a hail of fireworks and
bottles, the police fled, only to soon return and order McCrae and
the other black beachgoers to leave.
</P>
<P>
   McCrae returned to her New Town neighborhood and watched the
party get crazy with fireworks and gunshots aimed skyward and
hundreds of people milling about. She witnessed the police arrest a
man _ her cousin _ for firing a gun into the air. She saw dozens of
men and women encircle the cops who tried to restore order. But
then the police fled, fearing for their lives, leaving behind two
patrol cars which were torched.
</P>
<P>
   McCrae doesn't condone the violence by the predominantly black,
youthful crowd. But she understands its genesis: years of being
ordered by police to move along, quit loitering, empty your
pockets, get out of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're caging us up. They treat us like animals,'' she said.
``We might as well walk around with a bull's eye on our backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the melees from official Brunswick was swift. The
mayor, council members, the NAACP, and assorted preachers condemned
the violence and those who perpetrated it. Yet it was the mayor's
comments denigrating those involved in the disturbance _ ``all
hoodlums, drug dealers pimps for prostitutes'' _ which further
inflamed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad Brown is not my mayor,'' said McCrae, a high school
graduate who has lived in Hawaii and California. ``But I don't hate
him. I dislike what he said. You've just got to pray for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown backed off a bit from his incendiary comments. But he
dismissed calls that he apologize or resign. Brown blamed the media
for stirring things up and said the hullabaloo over the violent
events of July 4th and 5th was ``dying down and the community is
getting back to a normal scene.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was another, larger march Thursday evening with
protestors again demanding Brown apologize.
</P>
<P>
   For Monday's march, McCrae passed out hundreds of fliers and
begged, cajoled, and pressured folks to participate. (Her
grandmother showed up.) Once the windy preachers finished, McCrae
meekly read her speech from the steps of the colonial-styled Old
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   McCrae comes by her newfound activist streak naturally. She's
known along I Street as a woman to turn to for a meal, for help
with a light bill, for a shoulder to cry on when a boyfriend or
husband does wrong. So it only seemed natural, she said, to call up
Brunswick's city manager, Roosevelt Harris Jr., and request a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found her to be a well-spoken lady who seemed to understand
the needs of the young people of that particular area,'' said
Harris, who's black. ``It takes people like her, committed to the
community, to really get involved and help make some changes.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrae suggested after-school programs in her New Town
neighborhood, perhaps with adults as tutors. She mentioned creating
a jobs program for under-employed residents. McCrae, who also
complained to police about their actions July 4th and 5th, asked
that officers undergo greater cultural sensitivity training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a lot into this,'' said McCrae, wearing an ``I'm A
Georgia Voter'' sticker on Election Day. ``I don't know why. My
heart says to do it. And I want is to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said he'll bring his department heads together, including
the police chief, to determine what needs be done for one of
Brunswick's poorest neighborhoods. Harris talked of a nonprofit,
economic-development group and, perhaps, the purchase of a building
to house start-up businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is also considering ``sensitivity sessions'' between
neighborhood residents and city and county officials to discuss
what transpired earlier this month and how to keep it from
happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Holmes, for one, was ``outraged'' by the disturbances
which she found ``disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The black folk that did all that rioting _ they just put us in
a bad spotlight,'' said the president of the Brunswick branch of
the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those comments angered and alienated many blacks, young and
old, who disagreed that the melees could be characterized as riots.
They claimed Holmes was out of touch and didn't speak for the
majority of black Brunswick. Holmes didn't attend Monday's rally,
but the mention of her name was met derisively by marchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP is not for us,'' McCrae later said. ``I can't
believe she made comments like that, that it disgusted her. She
shouldn't be down on us. Our own people got to quit talking
negative about us.''
</P>
<P>
   The discontinuity between Holmes and McCrae highlights the
divide between Brunswick's traditional black leadership and younger
blacks. It's also representative of the difficulty NAACP chapters
have in recruiting the new members.
</P>
<P>
   Inez Bouncer is the Brunswick Youth Council adviser. (She's 83.)
Her membership rolls have dropped precipitously. Two years ago,
there were 688 members younger than 21, Bouncer said. Today, there
are a ``little better than 300'' members.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes, an NAACP member for 37 years, defends her organization's
so-far tepid response to the July 4th and 5th troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP can not jump into everything,'' said Holmes, who
plans to meet with the mayor this week to discuss his comments.
``We have to weigh things and find out what's going on. ... We want
to be part of what is good for the community. We're hoping that
these young kids, after all that has happened, realize that things
don't have to be the way they were.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrae vows that they won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be changes,'' she said. ``We will start
getting everybody involved. This is just a first step. Now, we're
ready. We are ready.''

 &HT;    TV's Downplaying of Conventions Raises Questions about Their
Role
 &HT;    By Martin Gottlieb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The political parties are upset that ABC, NBC and CBS don't
</P>
<P>
   plan to cover the national political conventions much. Ohio
Republican Party Chairman Robert Bennett, for example, whose party
is not known for antipathy to the make-a-buck ethic, wants the
networks to ``forgo their cash-cow entertainment shows to engage in
a little force-feeding of Democracy 101.''
</P>
<P>
   He charges that the networks foster low voter turnout when to
make their best pitches, make them repetitively, and make them to
the biggest possible audiences. That, typically, is the process
that resolves election. After that, the American people don't hear
much they haven't heard before. If they don't change their minds,
we shouldn't be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that what happens at conventions determines
who
</P>
<P>
   wins. Circumstances in the country (and the success of the
incumbent party in dealing with the problems of the country)
determine who wins. It's just that by the time the conventions are
over, the public has focused as much as it ever will upon those
circumstances. This focusing happens partly because both
presidential candidates look pretty impressive as individuals at
the conventions. So people stop thinking about personality so much.
</P>
<P>
   What about the future? Will the conventions stop being so
important if the networks downplay the conventions?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. After all, 2000 will not be the first year the
networks
</P>
<P>
   have cut back on convention coverage. The gavel-to-gavel
principle died long ago, and still we have seen no campaigns in
which the conventions didn't pretty much resolve things.
</P>
<P>
   The conventions still get enormous coverage. Besides whatever
prime-time coverage they get, they are featured in the regular news
shows.
</P>
<P>
   They dominate newspapers (which may still matter a little bit).
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance speech of a presidential nominee is an event of
</P>
<P>
   interest even to people who normally have little interest in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who don't hang on every word hear an awful lot about
it.
</P>
<P>
   If television in general were to stop paying any attention to
the
</P>
<P>
   conventions at all, that might reduce the importance of
conventions in speeding the public toward a final judgment on the
candidates. But that probably would require a series of decisions
by more than ABC, CBS and NBC about more than prime time. It
doesn't seem to be in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, whether ``Who Wants to be A Millionaire?'' gets
pre-empted (fat chance) probably doesn't matter much.
</P>

Daily News. His book, ``Campaigns Don't Count: How the Media Get
American Politics All Wrong'' is available, free, online at

 &HT;    A once in a lifetime tribute
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ This is the day Tony Perez and Sparky
Anderson never thought about while Perez was driving in runs in big
bundles and Anderson was leading The Big Red Machine to victories
in equally impressive big bundles.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's Hall of Fame is for Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb and Ted
Williams and Joe DiMaggio and Cy Young, baseball's icons.
</P>
<P>
   And this afternoon, in the gentle undulating hills outside of
Cooperstown, the Hall of Fame embraces Perez and Anderson, along
with catcher Carlton Fisk, Cincinnati outfielder Bid McPhee and
Negro League star Turkey Stearnes. Longtime Reds radio play-by-play
announcer Marty Brennaman also will be honored with the Ford C.
Frick Award for broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   It is a terrific twist of irony that Anderson, Perez and Fisk go
into the Hall of Fame at the same time because their lives are
intertwined back to Game 6 of the 1975 World Series and the
12th-inning game-winning home run hit by Fisk, a towering drive
right down the left field line on which Fisk stood at home plate
waving at the baseball to stay fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Fisk) was pulling it fair and I was pulling it foul,''
said Perez, who stood at first base and watched the pitch hit off
Pat Darcy clear the wall and stay fair for a 7-6 Boston Red Sox
victory. ``People ask me if Fisk said anything when he ran past me.
No way. I felt a breeze stir up after the ball landed for the home
run and it was Fisk sprinting past me as fast as he could go, blew
by me like a jet.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Anderson, ``Fisk made me sick. I didn't sleep and that
helped my team win the next day because I wasn't involved. Too
sleepy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Anderson's modus operandi, always deflecting credit and
praise the other way.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds won Game 7 in 1975, then swept four straight from the
New York Yankees in 1976. After that season, Perez was traded to
Montreal and the Reds were never the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already told Tony this and I've done it publicly from a
microphone. . .he deserved to hear an apology from me,'' Anderson
said. ``Tony Perez should have never, ever left Cincinnati. Bob
Howsam (the general manager who traded Perez) will tell you that
and I will stand up and take 50 percent of the blame because I
agreed to it. It was a terrible mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say he was good with our Latins? I'll tell you what? He
was good with every living human being on that club and, when he
left, and I started realizing right away, 'Something is wrong
here,' and it wasn't me,'' Anderson said. ``They could have kept
Perez and sent me to the Bahamas and they could have won again,
believe me. You can't undo it, but you have to stand up and be
counted about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson played only one year in the majors, a full season with
the Philadelphia Phillies, then disappeared back to the minors
forever as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never came close again,'' Anderson said. ``I realized that
the major-league level was not me. I was a star in Triple-A, but I
couldn't hit. (Phillies Manager) Eddie Sawyer let me play every
day, but he pinch-hit for me more than Casey Stengel pinch-hit for
Willie Miranda.''
</P>
<P>
   So Anderson turned to managing and became the only manager to
win the World Series in both leagues _ 1975-76 with Cincinnati and
1984 with Detroit and is on the brink of baseball enshrinement into
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all dream, and every morning when I go for my walk I think,
'How did a boy from South Dakota leave a little town of 600 people
(Bridgewater) when he was 9 and get to this?''' Anderson said.
``And I'm very serious when I say it will take me, after coming
here this year, four or five more trips before in my heart I
believe I belong in this house. It is overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cincinnati made me very smart,'' Anderson added. ``And that
was hard because I'm a dummy and they had to work hard at it, but
that baseball team got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, of course, swung the spotlight toward Atanasio Rigal
Perez, who waited nine years after he was eligible to win the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is such a beautiful game and you see somebody like
Tony Perez and you realize what the beauty of the game is,'' he
said. ``Here is a young man who came from Cuba and to know what
kind of a person he is. It is a wonderful to be a great player, but
it is not wonderful if you are a great player and cannot back it up
by being a great person. If you can't do that, you are just a
phony, God gave you great ability and you just took it and took it
to the Hall of Fame. But you don't really belong there because you
didn't back it up by being a great person. Tony Perez is a real
person, a great person.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson admitted he'll have jangling and tingling nerves when
he steps to the podium. Perez said he won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be nervous,'' Anderson said. ``Tony won't because he is
never nervous, which is what made him the outstanding clutch player
he was. I'm going to be wondering, 'What in the hell did I get into
and how in the hell did I get here?' The fear of God will be with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Perez, whose wife has worked hard on his speech with him
and made him practice, ``I feel great, although I was a little
disappointed in my golf game today. I've waited nine years, so I'm
not worried about my speech. I feel great to just be here, I'm
going to feel great and enjoy it because it's once in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Perez paid tribute to all eight regulars of The Big Red Machine
_ not just the Hall of Famers like Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan and the
Hall of Fame-should be, Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those guys _ George Foster, Ken Griffey, Dave Concepcion,
Cesar Geronimo _ those guys were as important for us as Bench or
Pete or Morgan or myself and if I was voting, all those eight guys
would be in the Hall of Fame,'' Perez said. ``I never played with
with a group of players like that where every one of them knew
exactly what to do every day to help the team win a ball game. For
Pete Rose not to be here in the Hall of Fame yet is something I
don't understand.''

 &HT;    Larkin takes a wait and see approach
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEREA, Ohio _ A few of the Reds were having trouble figuring out
the dress code Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``See what Barry says,'' one said to another.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have come to rely on shortstop and captain Barry Larkin
for so much. On the field. In the clubhouse. In the offseason,
luring superstars to town. It's a stretch to say they can't get
dressed without him, but sometimes it seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Reds beat the Arizona Diamondbacks, 7-3, on
Saturday while wearing black undershirts and black caps with red
bills. Maybe it was Larkin's last day in a Reds uniform. If it was,
he will remember it for the standing ovation that lasted several
minutes when he came to bat in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional at-bat,'' Larkin said later, his immediate
baseball fate nine innings closer to realization.
</P>
<P>
   Rooting for the captain to remain a Red has become pastime No. 1
for those who share his clubhouse. They know all about baseball's
economics and how some teams can afford big payrolls and others
can't. But they also wonder about loyalty _ not to marginal or
fringe players, but to such icons as Larkin, who grew up here,
became famous here and, to the best anyone could figure it, twice
took less money to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure don't want it to happen,'' winning pitcher Ron Villone
(8-6) said of the trade with the New York Mets that is awaiting
only Larkin's approval. ``He's a mainstay, a leader and a great
player. He knows how to handle things. He doesn't get shaken _
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves what he wants. The guy is a class act. I guess
loyalty doesn't always mean you're going to be rewarded, but
sometimes you have to give it to someone who deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 42,568 obviously shared this opinion, showering
Larkin with cheers even after his third-inning strikeout. He went
1-for-5, hit into a double play and was caught stealing. Afterward,
he dressed quickly, paused to field a few questions and then went
to find his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to consider everything,'' Larkin said. ``You have to
see what happens. I thought I might not be here today, but I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Villone tortured the Reds for six innings. Starting in place of
Larry Luebbers, who had complained of forearm soreness, he threw 40
pitches in the second inning alone on his way to 123. But big hits
eluded the Diamondbacks and Villone, helped by what Arizona manager
Buck Showalter said were ``about 30'' missed pitches by home plate
umpire Darryl Cousins, somehow muddled through.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a good job getting through six innings,'' Reds manager
Jack McKeon said. ``He gets you (ticked) at him, but he battles
out. We were lucky to get six out of him the way he was going.''
</P>
<P>
   Helpful to Villone's cause was his own two-run single in the
second inning as the Reds seized a 3-1 lead. They never trailed
again, adding two in the third, two in the seventh. Juan Castro and
Dmitri Young had three hits apiece as the Reds abused three Arizona
pitchers, including the previously sensational rookie Geraldo
Guzman, a 27-year-old former carpenter who had been 2-0 with a 0.56
ERA in two starts.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin responded to his first ovation with a single. He made it
to second on a wild pitch, but tried to steal third and was gunned
down by Damian Miller. The crowd cheered anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of possibilities,'' Larkin said. ``I know
everyone is not in a situation where they can do exactly what I
want. We'll just have to wait and see.''

MISSOURI'S UNDECIDED VOTERS COULD HELP DECIDE THE PRESIDENTIAL
RACE

<P>
   MOBERLY, Mo. _ For Al Gore and George Bush, the road to the
White House is likely to pass through places such as the Family
Tradition Restaurant in Moberly, where Bill Staggs is a regular for
morning coffee.
</P>
<P>
   History says the fall election will be decided by people such as
Staggs _ undecided voters in a state such as Missouri, which has
gone with the winning candidate all but once, 1956, in the past
century.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Gore and Bush would be wise to listen to Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore, he's pretty wishy-washy, and Bush, I just don't know the
man,'' said Staggs, retired from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. ``I may not vote, but that doesn't solve anything,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with two dozen persons across Missouri during Gov.
Mel Carnahan's whistle-stop tour of the state last week indicated
that Gore and Bush had failed to define themselves, and neither was
seen as inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   On sunny railroad platforms and under cool shade trees, people
who came out to cheer Carnahan or simply listen were asked how they
felt about Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Gore has the steeper hill to climb with voters, bearing
out a poll two weeks ago showing that he trailed Bush by 11 points
in Missouri while running nearly neck and neck with Bush
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apathy at the polling place will be his problem,'' said
retired farmer Ray Dunwoody of Moberly, a Democrat backing Gore.
``This is pretty much a Democratic stronghold here, and if he can
harness that vote, it will help.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has tried to exude more energy and passion on the stump,
but to some Missouri voters he still comes across as stiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of like a mechanical man,'' said Bush supporter
Jesse Kruse on the front lawn of a house in Salisbury, next to the
Carnahan train. ``He looks like a robot, not like a real person.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has had a hard political act to follow in Clinton, some
supporters said. Indeed, Gore's years under Clinton seem to be a
mixed blessing in Missouri. The Monica Lewinsky scandal hasn't been
forgotten, but neither has the economic prosperity of the Clinton
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he can disassociate himself from Clinton,'' said
Bill Burke, a Louisiana, Mo., YMCA director who backed John McCain
but now supports Bush. ``History will recall the eight years of
Clinton and Gore as lacking values, and (a time) of dishonesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Brumbaugh, a restaurant manager in Hannibal, agreed that
a lot of people mentioned Gore and Clinton in the same breath.
Brumbaugh kept his distance from the Carnahan rally, leaning
against a shady picnic table with arms folded as he listened to the
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I'm a true Democrat or true Republican,''
Brumbaugh said. ``I've got to feel Bush is our next president, with
all the stuff that went on with Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal may do the most damage with conservative or
religious Democrats in places such as Moberly that might otherwise
lean to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of religion in this area, so that may have a
little bearing,'' said Ted Thornburg, a Moberly Democrat running
for General Assembly. He said a good economy would offset some of
the Lewinsky scandal for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But even Clinton's strengths as president work against Gore with
some voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big Clinton fan, but he's pretty good at finding
middle ground, and I don't know if Gore has that capacity,'' said
Jim Grotewiel, a cattle farmer and implement dealer from Clifton
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs to set out his own agenda, but his chances still
hinge on what credit he gets for the nation's economic boom,
several people said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic administration expanded the American Dream,''
said Maxwell Boafo, a Gore backer in Moberly. Bush, with no
experience on the national stage, would be less effective, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, appears to be doing a better job holding
Republicans in Missouri than Gore is holding Democrats, based on
interviews. Everyone who said they normally voted Republican said
they would back Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's honest,'' said Jeffrey Lloyd, a Lutheran minister from
Independence. ``I listen to Gore, and I don't think he's any more
honest than Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Bush backers based support for him partly on a disdain for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very bland and not that bright,'' said Sydne Tustison, a
Moberly engineer.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats think Gore will intellectually outshine Bush,
whose intelligence has been the target of jokes by comics and
skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lightweight,'' said Mary Abbott, a Kansas City area
real estate agent who was at the Independence rally for Carnahan.
``He bores me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Personality and experience appear to be playing a key role in
Missouri voters' decisions on the candidates, but their stands on
the issues are also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Tustison said that she liked Bush's views on abortion, taxes,
the death penalty and education and that Gore was hypocritical when
he criticized big oil companies while his family trust had a large
financial stake in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Several people said they preferred Gore because they thought he
was more pro-environment than Bush. But Gore's support for strong
emission standards handicapped some industries, said undecided
voter Grotewiel.
</P>
<P>
   The race in Missouri probably will be up in the air until
Election Day if everyone is like college-bound Robert Murphy, 18,
of Moberly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got pretty good candidates,'' Murphy said. ``It will be
a decision I will have to make right when I get there.''

ANALYSIS: BUSH LOOKS TO SAFE AND SOLID IN PICKING HIS RUNNING MATE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., N.Y., Mo., Pa., Ky., Wyo., Neb., Ohio, Tenn.) (ADDS ``foreign policy skills'' to 2nd graf of 2nd take)  
 (Eds.: 2nd take could be used as a separate story on pros and cons
of the possible choices.)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Walter Mondale tapped Geraldine Ferraro as his
running mate in 1984, he was so far behind that he felt, as he put
it the other day, he had to ``reshuffle the deck because the
economy was good and Reagan was popular.''
</P>
<P>
   When George Bush turned to Dan Quayle in 1988, his media
adviser, Roger Ailes, hoped that the young senator would have such
sex appeal that women might try to tear at his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   And when Bob Dole settled on an old foe, Jack Kemp, four years
ago, a crucial consideration was that it would be a surprise. Scott
Reed, the Dole campaign manager, said his boss had not worried
about how they would get along in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all about winning the election,'' Reed said. ``I had
confidence that the compatibility issue could be worked out
later.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas seems to be steering
clear of the glamour and gloss _ and more toward the safe and
solid.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush secludes himself at his Texas ranch this weekend to make
up his mind on his single most important campaign decision so far,
a leading choice, his advisers say, is Richard Cheney. Cheney is a
respected but hardly electrifying former defense secretary and
former congressman who is running Bush's search for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have apparently survived to the homestretch include
two governors who are known more for their steadiness than star
quality: Frank Keating of Oklahoma and George Pataki of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheney is the CPA choice,'' one prominent Republican
strategist said. ``Competent. Quiet. And dull.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be by design. Bush's advisers say the governor is so
confident he will win the election that he is focused less on bald
electoral calculations for November 7 _ like whether his running
mate would make a state more competitive _ and more on who he wants
beside him on January 20, when he expects to be sworn in as the
next president.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Bush appears to be less concerned about a No. 2
with pizazz is his recognition that, thanks to Bill Clinton, the
role of the vice president has broadened markedly. In picking Al
Gore, Clinton made the vice presidency more than an understudy's
job. It is now one that voters expect to be filled with a person of
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be thought that vice presidential nominations were
decided on the basis of a hunch or right off the top of the head,''
said former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, who apparently also
sits high on Bush's list _ and is known for his rectitude, not his
personality. ``Nowadays, it's a much more serious thing. The role
of the vice presidency has changed. It's not just the cipher job
that it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney would make ``a terrific choice,'' Danforth said, because
he has the credentials and temperament to function well in the
White House. Asked about another possibility, Sen. John McCain,
Danforth alluded to lingering strains between Bush and McCain from
the hotly contested primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president has to pick somebody he likes and is very, very
comfortable with,'' Danforth said. ``Or else, the vice president is
going to be stashed in a closet somewhere. It would be a reversion
to the previous idea of what a vice president is.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' Bush himself said:
``There's been the time in the past where people, competent people,
said, `Well, let's just pick the vice president. Don't worry, we'll
dump him once we get elected.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words,'' he added, ``use the person just for the
election vehicle. I'm not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a choice that does not appear to be baldly political _
unlike picking Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania so he could deliver
his state's 23 electoral votes _ may have more appeal among voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may be moving toward a less flashy choice because there are
only so many flashy possibilities. Several of his advisers agreed
that there was only one true marquee candidate who would bring
added value to the ticket _ Colin Powell _ and that Bush would snap
him up if he thought Powell was interested.
</P>
<P>
   Many advisers said McCain would also enliven the ticket, but
that Bush questioned how well he would tolerate McCain in the White
House. Some Bush advisers also said the governor would cringe at
the perception that he was forced to turn to McCain to assure him a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain would add the most oomph to the ticket,'' said Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, a Republican pollster, agreed, saying
McCain accomplished something few other Republicans have: ``He is
such an incredible choice that he's even had people in Hollywood
give him money.'' But she said ``an unexciting choice'' like
Keating or Cheney would be safe because ``we know in the end people
decide whom to vote for based on the top of the ticket rather than
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be, of course, that Bush is using the speculation over
Cheney as a distraction while he readies his true decision, and has
a colossal surprise in mind. Maybe (with help from his father) he
can persuade Powell after all. Maybe there is even a mystery
selection.
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Kemp suggested that even Powell might not be so
perfect. ``The fact that he doesn't want it,'' he said, ``makes
them want him even more.''
 &UR;  &LR; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Powell aside, for every prospect, the upsides seem to cancel out
the downsides.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush picked Cheney, he would win plaudits from Republicans
who think Cheney would bring dignity, weight and foreign policy
skills to the ticket. And while he has a solidly conservative
voting record in Congress, Cheney has always worked well with
moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big leaguer,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who
has pressed for Cheney for weeks. ``No one would say, `I can't see
this guy as president.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others warned that Cheney, 59, is from a small state, Wyoming,
that is already safe bet for Bush to win. And, they said, he is
risky because of his health: He has had three heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   If he picks Keating, Bush would win raves from Republicans who
admire Keating's handling of the Oklahoma City bombing and his
credentials as a former prosecutor. Another plus is that he is
Roman Catholic, and Bush has been trying to reassure Catholics
after opponents suggested he was anti-Catholic. Others warn that he
is from a small state that is already solidly Republican and that
his conservative background would not broaden the ticket's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of McCain would energize moderates and
independents. But many conservatives warn that they would not abide
such a selection _ and would openly denounce McCain when the
Republican convention opens in Philadelphia in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of problems,'' said David Keene, chairman of
the American Conservative Union. ``A lot of conservatives would be
very upset. It's hard to see him as a loyal team player who would
not be trying to upstage everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There are pros and cons to the other prospects. Ridge, for one,
has a riveting rags-to-respectability biography and comes from a
battleground state. But some conservatives would deride his
abortion rights stand. Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska has a
compelling military history and he has the foreign policy expertise
that Bush lacks. But he is relatively green in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki hails from a big state, but not even his own advisers
predict that he could deliver it to the Republicans. Another
factor, seemingly trivial, is that Pataki is about a half-foot
taller than Bush, and nominees never like being overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, who would bring
vitality and a knowledge of Congress. But he has what some Bush
advisers say is the Quayle problem: he exudes youthfulness _ and
seems to lack gravitas.
</P>
<P>
   One who has star quality is Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He
was a movie actor, after all. But some Bush advisers express
concern that as a single man, Thompson would not project the
appropriate family image.
</P>
<P>
   The new imperatives for a running mate have made the selection
process complicated, if not confounding. Bush, and Gore, face often
conflicting pressures: They want running mates who can be both be
effective on the stump and in governing. They want someone who can
excite party loyalists but also attract independents.
</P>
<P>
   They want drama. But they have to be mindful that reaching for
the spectacular can be like a blind date with history. The result
can be fresh and intoxicating _ like Gore eight years ago _ or
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   When Mondale picked Ferraro, he thought she would be an instant
draw for women. He was wrong. Four years later, the elder Bush
thought voters would find Quayle fresh and exciting. They did not,
but the ticket won anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Quayle did carry shock value. He was so little
known, even by Bush's own aides, that in New Orleans, the site of
the convention, they busily photocopied his biography in the
Almanac of American Politics so they could find out just who he
was.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides said their candidate has learned from his father's
experience that he need not be fixated on springing a surprise
(though he does like surprises) and that, more important, the
campaign has to be well prepared before announcing the choice. Bush
also learned a lesson from watching his father serve as Ronald
Reagan's No. 2 for eight years: He wants someone who is as loyal to
him as his father was to Reagan, but who also offers sound advice _
and does not stir the pot.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be so much simpler _ and swifter. In 1976, President
Gerald Ford began his deliberations in earnest only hours before
his No. 2 was announced. ``The meeting to decide on the nominee
didn't begin until 3:15 a.m.,'' Ford wrote in his memoirs, ``A Time
to Heal.'' Among those in the room was his chief of staff who would
resurface decades later in vice presidential politics: Dick Cheney.

FOR DUVAL, 2ND PLACE IS A PAIN
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ One of golf's oldest sayings is,
``Beware the ailing golfer.'' And through the years, ailing golfers
have won championships: Ken Venturi staggering with heat
prostration in the 1964 U.S. Open, and Ben Hogan wobbling on weary
legs in the 1950 U.S. Open after recuperating from injuries in a
highway crash.
</P>
<P>
   But if David Duval, six strokes behind Tiger Woods going into
Sunday's final round of the 129th British Open, were to somehow win
on the Old Course, he would justify the saying.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's ailing back was painful enough for him to stand instead
of sit throughout his news conference in the media center following
his 6-under 66 in Saturday's third round. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the best I've felt all week,'' he said. ``For the
most part I played pretty much pain free, but I just tried to do
what I was instructed to do, which is not sit very much, and go lay
down when I'm done and give myself the best chance to be pain free
tomorrow.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a birdie 3 on the 18th hole, Duval finished at 10 under,
which means he will be playing with Woods in Sunday's final
pairing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I most definitely wanted to get there,'' he said, referring to
the final pairing. ``It will be a circus. It will be exciting. It
will be a slugfest, whatever you want to call it. You get to look
him in the eye. To get in the last group with undoubtedly the best
player in the world right now is an experience you want to have.
You're going to need to be there for this week and the PGA
Championship and for the next time it comes about.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duval did not sound intimidated by Woods' six-shot lead with 18
holes remaining. ``Even if I'm as much as seven behind, I have a
chance because I've won from that far behind before,'' Duval said.
``I'm going to be trying to win my first major championship. He's
going to be going for the career Grand Slam. So there is going to
be some pressure on both parties.' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Duval was seven strokes
behind going into the final round but won with a 59 that tied the
PGA Tour record. In the 1998 Shell Houston Open, he was six strokes
behind and won with a 64. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine I would need to shoot 66 again, if not a few
better,'' Duval said. ``I feel like I got a lot out of my round
today. It's one of the first times in a while where I walked off
thinking that's the highest score I could have shot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Needing a birdie on the 18th, Duval watched his tee shot drift
toward the white cement out-of-bounds stakes along the street named
The Links. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I walked off the tee and saw it land and saw it did
not kick hard right like you would expect and it just fell left,''
Duval said, ``I felt I was getting the breaks I hadn't been getting
lately. It was nice to see that again. When I made the birdie putt,
I thought, `I just turned a 6 into a 3.' That's what you need.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, with the way Woods is playing, Duval knows he
will need a super round, like another 66 or even a 63, and that
still might not be enough. That kind of round would be asking a
lot, even for an ailing golfer.

 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Sen. Paul Coverdell was eulogized Saturday as
a humble public servant who became a political giant through
selfless dedication and quiet civility.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who died Tuesday of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 61,
was memorialized at Peachtree Road United Methodist Church before
being interred at an undisclosed location. His remains were
cremated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 people attended the public service, which attracted
a diverse array of national and local political figures. Scores of
current and former staffers of Coverdell's Washington and Georgia
offices also attended, wearing blue ribbons on their lapels.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, who will name a successor to Coverdell,
delivered one of the four eulogies. Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) spoke
on behalf of the Senate. Clyde Rodbell, a longtime personal friend,
spoke about Coverdell's code of personal integrity and his warmth,
and expressed sorrow over the senator's sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul, your visit was just too damn short,'' said Rodbell, his
voice quivering with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime friend and political associate Fred Cooper concluded
with a eulogy to Coverdell, written by former President Bush, that
will appear in the upcoming issue of Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one good example of politics' being a noble calling,''
said Cooper, quoting the elder Bush. ``We Bushes loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, attended the
service and sat just behind Coverdell's widow, Nancy. He was the
only current or former elected official who sat with Coverdell's
family _ his sister, mother and scores of cousins, aunts and
uncles.
</P>
<P>
   For the length of the 67-minute service, politicians of every
persuasion and party sat together silently, laying aside their
differences to pay tribute to a man regarded as the Senate's
leading mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who disagreed with
Coverdell sharply over policy, sat between Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).
</P>
<P>
   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the conservative firebrand,
sat next to former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, a Democrat. Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who fought Coverdell vigorously over federal
education policy, also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole was there, along with
nearly 100 current and former members of Congress and their
spouses, most of whom flew in Saturday from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Zell Miller, mentioned as a successor to Coverdell,
attended with his wife, Shirley, along with former Gov. Lester
Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   Because Coverdell was cremated, there was no casket inside the
sanctuary. A large portrait, showing a smiling Coverdell standing
next to an American flag, stood in front of the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a lifelong Democrat, said Coverdell became his teacher
in the state Senate when Barnes was first elected in 1974, even
though Coverdell was from the other party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the strongest Republican I ever met, but he never let
politics get in the way . . . of friendships,'' said Barnes, who
lost his composure several times during his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   What separated Coverdell from the partisan politics of the day,
Barnes said, was that ``you could trust Paul Coverdell.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the two breakfasted regularly and told each other
the most intimate political secrets. Barnes said he even discussed
his gubernatorial bid with Coverdell, and never feared Coverdell
would betray his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's legacy, Barnes said, was one of actions and deeds,
not words and glory; friendship and trust, not cynicism and
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodbye, old friend,'' said Barnes, crying softly. ``See you
in a little while.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who spoke before Barnes, praised Coverdell's humility,
iron will and unblemished character.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just knew Paul Coverdell, he was one of your best
friends,'' said Gramm. ``He was the kind of man your mama wanted
you to grow up to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lighter moment, Gramm also recalled Coverdell's ``squeaky
voice,'' disheveled brown hair and flailing arms as he raced around
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rodbell, who spoke first, said he nicknamed his longtime friend
``Senator Careful'' because of his scrupulous integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Rodbell said Coverdell once refused his offer to install two new
air conditioning units in his home at cost. Rodbell then offered to
sell them to Coverdell at dealer's cost and donate the profit to
charity. Coverdell agreed.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Rodbell said, the two were out to dinner
and an unknown patron sent over a bottle of wine. Coverdell found
the waiter and sent it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul, he didn't send it to you,'' Rodbell said he told
Coverdell. ``He sent it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Peering over his glasses, Coverdell looked at him and said,
``Oh.''
</P>
<P>
   During the service, Nancy Coverdell, who gazed for long moments
at her husband's portrait, did not speak. Rodbell praised her quiet
inner strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are the epitome of grace under fire,'' Rodbell said to the
stoic widow, embracing her after his eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Coverdell selected the choral music for the service, which
opened with ``Song of Peace'' by Vincent Perischetti and concluded
with an a cappella version of ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic,''
sung by Navy Cmdr. Robert Baird.

 &HT;    'He gave politics a good name.'

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shaded from the midday Saturday sun by her red
umbrella, Louise Kemp of Atlanta waited patiently on the sidewalk
outside Peachtree United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   It was 91 degrees in the Atlanta neighborhood of Buckhead, and
90 minutes before the funeral services for Sen. Paul Coverdell were
to begin. But Kemp, 83, and her friend, Geraldine Sudderth, 71, of
Atlanta, were determined to get two of the few dozen seats
available to the public in the church that would soon be
overflowing with national, state and local politicians and business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp and Sudderth said they decided to brave the traffic
congestion on Peachtree Road, the heat and the crush of dignitaries
to pay their last respects to the state's senior senator because of
the type man he was. Neither admitted being active in politics, and
Kemp said she met Coverdell only once, a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admired his thinking,'' said Kemp. ``He was his own man.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudderth nodded in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was a very fine person,'' she said. ``I liked the
way he handled himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Those a few dozen average citizens who came to the services said
they did so to honor Coverdell the man, not Coverdell the senator
or Coverdell the politician. They remembered a man who dealt with
them sincerely, honestly and with little of the overblown sense of
importance that professional politicians often have of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very well-mannered man. He was always kind to me and
took care of me,'' said Albert ``Smitty'' Smith, of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he served Coverdell room service meals at the old
Marriott Hotel in downtown Atlanta when the then-state senator
stayed there during his days in the General Assembly. Now sports
ambassador for the Marriott Marquis, Smith said he remembered
Coverdell as a kindly, courtly man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here today is just my way of remembering him,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Millie Rogers dealt with Coverdell on a more political level,
but she fondly recalled many of the same qualities in him that
others did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very gentle man,'' said Rogers, a vice chairwoman of
the Cobb County Republican Party and assistant to Cobb Commission
Chairman Bill Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was also very courteous, which you don't often see in
public life,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   That courtesy, she said, enabled people to feel comfortable with
him and open up to him about issues which concerned them. ``He
always seemed to be close to the pulse of the public,'' Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that was a result of his staff, she said, which extended
that same sense of courtesy to the senator's constituents and made
his office ``all about customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Pollack of Atlanta said she first met Coverdell at a
Christmas party a few years ago, shortly after moving to Georgia
from Pennsylvania, where she had become a Republican ``because I
felt the Democratic Party had deserted me.'' She said she thrust a
banana nut chocolate chip cake into Coverdell's hands and he
thanked her profusely. She immediately became a supporter of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a courageous man,'' she said. ``When he voted
he voted for the right things, not for something somebody wanted
him to vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day of eulogies and remembrances for Coverdell by leaders
of every political stripe and stature, perhaps one of the most
telling came from Pollack. In an era in which there is little to
like about most politicians, she said, ``He gave politics a good
name.''

 &HT;    Grief and ambition, in equal measure, filled some church pews
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Newt Gingrich got there a good 45 minutes early, and
was led to the third row of the sectioned-off front half of
Peachtree Road United Methodist Church. Sam Nunn and his wife
joined him a little later, and for a long time they sat alone in
the large empty space, waiting to say goodbye to Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the three figures, poignant reminders of the influence
Georgia had in Washington only a short time ago, was a study in the
loneliness of power.
</P>
<P>
   But when the side doors were opened and the rest of the invitees
_ the most powerful figures in Congress, governors, the Republican
presidential nominee _ came bustling in, the late senator's
memorial service suddenly also became a lesson in how crowded
politics can be.
</P>
<P>
   When all the seats had been filled and the carefully planned
service begun, that church seemed in a nearly perfect state of
equipoise between sincere grief and frank ambition.
</P>
<P>
   On the front aisles sat nearly every one of those who have been
mentioned as a possible successor to Coverdell, alongside at least
a couple of those still thought to be possible vice presidential
running mates for Gov. George W. Bush, who sat with his wife behind
Nancy Coverdell during the service.
</P>
<P>
   Moving one's gaze farther down the aisles, it was possible also
to spot any number whose political plans might be changing, as
speculation about one race raises the possibility of openings in a
dozen others.
</P>
<P>
   In those same aisles were also family members, who knew the part
of Coverdell that he kept shyly hidden in his public life;
volunteers from his past campaigns, for whom he became an unlikely
hero; and congressional colleagues, Republican and Democratic, who
had come to count him as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the strongest Republican I ever met, yet he never let
party get in the way of personal relationships that transformed
party,'' Gov. Roy Barnes, holding back tears, said. More of that,
he said, would ``take away the nastiness and the acrimony that we
have now in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The four eulogies seemed intended to reflect the different
theaters of Coverdell's life: the first from a family friend, Clyde
Rodbell; words from Sen. Phil Gramm, who learned about Coverdell's
loyalty during rocky days of Gramm's presidential campaign, Barnes'
unexpectedly emotional words, and finally, longtime Republican
activist Fred Cooper, reading words from former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's death has been the occasion for the first meeting of
the entire Georgia congressional delegation in years, so we can't
be entirely certain his untimely passing won't shake some
politicians into emulating his civility.
</P>
<P>
   But his death also precipitates a defining moment in Georgia
politics.
</P>
<P>
   It will be shaped not only by what Barnes decides to do but by
what kind of consensus, if any, the Republicans can work out, and
ultimately on what the voters think.
</P>
<P>
   As all the people affected by this unexpected turn of events
filed out of the church after paying their last respects to
Coverdell, there was a palpable sense that that defining moment
will not be long in coming.

 &HT;    Atlanta sprinter runs fastest 400 hurdles of the year
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Edwin Moses nodded his head approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no doubt,'' Moses laughed.
</P>
<P>
   It proved a perfect afternoon for the intermediate hurdling
tradition that has taken root in Atlanta. Wanting to follow in the
footsteps of Moses, Derrick Adkins &AMP; Co., former Georgia Tech
sprinter Angelo Taylor set himself up for a run at Olympic gold,
blazing to a world-leading this year 47.62 second clocking in the
400-meter hurdles Saturday at the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down from his perch atop a VIP suite, Moses found that
he could speak with confidence that the newcomers to his craft
hadn't passed him by _ witness his trials record from 1988 (47.37),
left to stand another four years.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor caught his eye, though. Like the Moses of old, the
21-year-old charged to the lead early and called on his strength to
frustrate any late challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real, real good race after three days (of
prelims),'' said Moses, impressed. ``That's excellent running.''
</P>
<P>
   What Taylor lacks in hurdling technique, Moses said he makes up
for in flat-400 speed. The kid has enough to land himself a spot on
the 1,600-meter relay in Sydney. No matter how many times Moses
asked for a 1,600 slot, he got the cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Intermediate hurdlers were outsiders, a fraternity all their
own. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches always treated us like we were stepchildren,'' Moses
said of relay selections. ``Even in my peak, they had a negative
attitude towards us. They didn't think hurdlers had the power to
run the 400.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 400 hurdles final, U.S. relay coach Bubba Thornton
said the staff would be ``negligent'' if Taylor wasn't in the relay
group for Sydney. U.S. head coach John Chaplin added: ``I like the
fact that he runs like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor intends to pick up the torch for Moses, and one of the
reasons he came to the hurdles is the Morehouse College grad.
Taylor sat in front of his TV watching Moses at the 1984 Los
Angeles Olympics. He grew to appreciate his unmatched dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw Edwin, I liked his style,'' Taylor said.
``He went out strong and didn't look back.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest successor to Moses put down the seventh-fastest time
in U.S. history. Just two weeks ago, Taylor was bedridden with food
poisoning, 10 pounds shed from his 180-pound frame, and wondering
if he'd regain his strength come the trials.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor can laugh about it now.
</P>
<P>
   What'll he do differently for Sydney? ``No more seafood.''
</P>
<P>
   It all worked out so perfectly. His fiancee, Florida State
400-meter runner Tangela Wobbleton, by his side after the race.
Subrena Everett cheering as he raced towards home, ``Angelo's Mom''
written across the back of her shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Here he is 21, not yet in his prime, using the Olympic trials as
a stage to send a message to the Llewellyn Herberts and Samuel
Matetes of the hurdling world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran the fastest time in the world _ that should say
something,'' Taylor said, peaking ahead to Sydney.

 &HT;    Johnson burns up the track in the 200 meters preliminary heat By
John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Shortly after Maurice Greene won his
preliminary heat in the 200 meters, he looked back across the field
and motioned with his hand, as if to say, bring it on, bring it on.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson brought it.
</P>
<P>
   Superman smoked a 19.89-second 200, compared to Greene's rather
pedestrian 20.29. Greene tried to shut it down after about 120
meters only to have to kick it into gear again to eke out his win
in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Advantage, Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long. Shortly after his heat, Johnson, who
obliterated the 200 record with a 19.32 clocking at the 1996
Olympics, motioned for a trainer to massage his right quadriceps
and quickly had a cold pack placed on the suddenly worrisome area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it in the curve,'' Johnson said. ``I was able to finish
the race, so that's encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will have to run a semifinal and the much-anticipated
final today. He was asked if the injury was going to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not. There's no way of knowing,'' he said before
hurrying off.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a twinge or an injury, it just adds to the hype for
today's showdown with Greene. Rival sprinter Ato Boldon, from
Trinidad and Tobago, likes Johnson, but thinks Greene has enjoyed
one edge this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Maurice has won the war of words,'' Boldon said.
``Maurice is doing what he does, which is talk. That's what he does
to me or anyone else in the 100 meters. Michael doesn't usually
have anything to say. The really, really, really good Michael
Johnson would not have things to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people will enjoy the matchup more than Boldon. He said both
Johnson and Greene seem to think the other will break down after
the curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may not happen,'' said Boldon, who would love to see them
still neck and neck after 195 meters. ``I get to watch two of my
greatest competitors kill each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Others advancing to the semifinals included Rohsaan Griffin and
Floyd Heard. Heard, a former Texas A&AMP;M star, was ranked No.1 in the
world at the distance way back in 1987. He won his heat in 20.14
seconds and said, ``I'd love to be the spoiler . . . I'm not one of
the guys moving their mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk among the women sprinters even got to Marion Jones, who
tries to stay above it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of all the talking. If you're going to talk, put up.
Come out to the track and run,'' Jones said. She coasted to the
day's fastest time of 22.62 seconds in the women's 200 meters in
spite of being rushed to the start line when the heats were
redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't ready for it,'' said former Texas Longhorn Nanceen
Perry, who qualified by finishing second to Jones in her heat.
Another Texas ex, Carlette Guidry finished third in the loaded heat
and also advanced, as did former Texas high school star Chryste
Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the finals contested Saturday, 21-year-old Angelo
Taylor negotiated the 400-meter hurdles in 47.62 seconds, while
Eric Thomas and James finished second and third. Former Reagan High
runner William Porter finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor overcame a case of food poisoning, caused by some bad
crab legs, a few weeks ago that caused him to lose weight and miss
a week of training.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more seafood,'' Taylor said. ``I ran the fastest time in
the world, so that says a little something.''
</P>
<P>
   In another final, Nicole Gamble, American record-holder Sheila
Hudson and Tiombe' Hurd went 1-2-3 in the triple jump, although
none of them have yet met the ``A'' Olympic qualifying standard.
</P>
<P>
   Former Elgin High and Texas A&AMP;M star Larry Wade had his own
standard here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I made it over 10 hurdles,'' Wade said. It was his
first race since April, when he totaled his 1999 Mustang in a car
accident. Wade later suffered complications from the accident and
checked with a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said if I hadn't come in that day I would have died,'' Wade
said. Instead he was alive and running a 13.48-second 110 hurdles
that was the fifth-fastest effort of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 100 hurdles preliminaries, Gail Devers was the
class of the field, running 12.57. Texas ex Angie Vaughn advanced
by finishing second in her heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's okay. I was a little nervous,'' Vaughn said. ``The first
race is to get some of that nervousness out. I feel I've got
nothing to lose here. I haven't been running a whole lot. I'm not
injured; I just haven't been able to get many races.''
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's late events, Regina Jacobs shattered an American
record in the 5,000 meters by seven seconds with a 14:45.35
clocking. Deena Drossin and Elva Dryer took second and third.
Jacobs also won the 1,500 earlier in the competition and that left
her with a dilemma: which to run in Sydney. Even though her effort
Friday was the world's best time to date in the 5,000, she's
leaning toward the 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, in a battle of the running wounded, Adam
Goucher won in 13:27.06 and Stanford's Brad Hauser took second.
Nick Rogers was third but just missed the Olympic qualifying
standard of 13:29.00 by less than a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is amazing,'' Goucher gasped. ``The race was pure guts.''
</P>
<P>
   This year Goucher overcame an Achilles' tendon injury suffered
in February and at the trials was nursing a strained back he got
while doing some landscaping work at his new house. Hauser also had
a bad back, but an acupuncture treatment worked for him.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fortunate was Bob Kennedy, the best of America's distance
runners. Kennedy, 29, could never make up for lost training time
after a May auto accident in which he suffered a bruised vertebra.
He scratched from the 10,000 meters earlier in the competition and
after struggling in the prelims of the 5,000 meters tried to take
the kick out of the competition by setting the pace Friday. Fans
cheered his efforts, even clanging cowbells to urge him on, but
after leading for six laps Kennedy faded to sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accident set me back four weeks and you can't make that
up,'' Kennedy said after having his Olympic hopes extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   But today, after all the fanning of flames, Johnson or Greene
should establish himself as the gold medal favorite for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be the most memorable race on U.S. soil in the
sprints in a very long time,'' Boldon said without a trace of hype.

KANSAS BOARD OF EDUCATION RACE SURGES TO THE ELECTION FOREFRONT

</P>
<P>
   SHAWNEE, Kan. _ Most years, Kansas Board of Education races get
pushed into the election background.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd District GOP primary contest between incumbent Linda
Holloway and challenger Sue Gamble is being cast as a battle
between conservatives and moderates for control of the state's
education system. Some even see it as a referendum on evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, a conservative, was chairwoman of the state board in
August 1999 when it approved science standards that downplay
evolution and don't mention the age of Earth or the big-bang
theory. Gamble, a moderate, says the new standards could keep
Kansas students from learning important scientific concepts.
</P>
<P>
   What happens in their Aug. 1 primary and in other contests
across Kansas could change the philosophical makeup of the state
board. Five of the board's 10 seats are up for election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway and Gamble say they both want what's best for the
state's schoolchildren. They just don't agree on what that is.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway says the best comes from the tried and true, the
educational concepts and priorities that have been in place for
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In educational trends, so many people want to be out on the
cutting edge,'' she said. ``Sometimes it's better to let someone
else be out on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble is more likely than Holloway to allow those who run the
Kansas Department of Education to set a course for the state's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state board provides competitive, rigorous standards,''
Gamble said. ``The local boards use that to improve their
curriculum.''

EXPERIENCE ON BOARD HAS MADE LINDA HOLLOWAY STRONGER, SOME SAY

</P>
<P>
   SHAWNEE, Kan. _ Linda Holloway never counted, but she figures
the e-mails in her home computer last August numbered more than
1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The messages came from all over the country in response to the
Kansas Board of Education's vote to delete some references to the
theory of evolution from state science standards.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who was board chairwoman and a supporter of the
revised standards, at first intended to read them all, but soon
left the job to a few friends and associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some were terribly vicious, terribly evil,'' said Holloway,
50, a conservative Republican and evangelical Christian. ``One of
them said, `Your God needs you. Commit suicide.' And that was one
of the milder ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway's husband, Jerry, said he would have been concerned for
his wife's safety if not for their faith in God. However, he still
wanted to make sure someone read all the e-mails to ensure that no
serious threats were made.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later, Holloway, a former teacher, is seeking
re-election in the 2nd District in the Aug. 1 Republican primary.
She has her husband's full support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `Yeah, I think you need to. If you don't, it will
reverse what you've done and you don't want that to happen,' ''
said Jerry Holloway, a retired engineer. ``It's not time to turn
tail and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Holloway and work closely with her agree that her
three-plus years on the board, particularly the year as chairwoman,
have made her a stronger person and a more confident board member.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to exclude from the science standards any mention of
macroevolution, or major evolutionary change of species, received
worldwide media attention _ much of it critical. Holloway's
leadership position on the board made her its designated
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anybody could have handled it differently or
better,'' said Harold Voth of Haven, this year's board chairman and
a moderate who joined the five conservatives and cast the decisive
vote on the standards. ``Talk about pressure. When you have 10 TV
microphones around you, that's not an easy job.''
</P>
<P>
   Another moderate board member wasn't as complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got real testy,'' said Val De Fever of Independence, Kan.
``But when you're under attack, that could happen to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her term as chairwoman, Holloway, an only child, was
making monthly trips to the Atlanta area to look after her father,
who was in failing health. He died in March.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1999 she had lost more than 10 pounds, which she
attributes to her hectic schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Being tagged with a label has long been part of politics, and
for Holloway the labels are often ``conservative Republican'' and
``evangelical Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't back away from either, but one label Holloway is
concerned that people might look past is ``former teacher.'' She
taught for 20 years, mostly in the Kansas City School District. And
for most of her career she was in special education, teaching
students with severe physical and mental impairments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an educator herself is one of her outstanding
strengths,'' said board member Janet Waugh, a moderate who is
friendly with Holloway but is supporting Holloway's primary
opponent, Sue Gamble. ``I think we probably consider Linda the
expert person on special ed. We don't rubber-stamp her, but we
listen to what she says on special ed.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Highland of Overland Park met Holloway through a women's
organization before her first campaign for the state board. One
thing that impressed Highland and made her a supporter was
Holloway's teaching background and master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real-life experiences are the best teacher,'' said Highland,
who has become a friend of Holloway's.
</P>
<P>
   Highland thinks the poise Holloway developed teaching special
education, coupled with her faith in God, prepared her for the
difficult times she has faced on the state board.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, whose grandchildren will be entering kindergarten and
third grade in Kansas public schools, has those personal reasons
for wanting to improve education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's real committed to kids,'' De Fever said. ``I
think she has the best intentions in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But De Fever said she thinks Holloway and other conservatives
are guided too much by a religious agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Comments like that upset Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I ran before, they threw a stereotype on me _ even when I
was teaching special ed in the inner city _ and it was religious
bigotry,'' she said. ``It goes back to the `Inherit the Wind'
stereotype, that people of faith have no intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cashill, a conservative activist and friend of Holloway's,
is quick to come to her defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been called every which thing you could possibly
imagine, and for doing the right thing,'' he said. ``And that right
thing will not be recognized by everyone immediately, but in time
it will.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway knows the evolution vote is still the main issue for
many people, and she doesn't duck questions about it. However, she
also hopes voters know there are other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway points to the board's progress in changing the way
Kansas teachers are certified, its approval of new curriculum
standards for social studies and math, and a requirement that
second-graders take a reading diagnostic test.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway also has a goal of streamlining Quality Performance
Accreditation, the state's school improvement program that
accredits schools based on how well students perform.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about evolution's place in the big picture of what the
board does, she said, ``It's about this big,'' holding her thumb
and index finger slightly apart. ``It's a really small part.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway has received endorsements from U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback,
a conservative Republican; and Kansans for Life, a statewide
organization that campaigns for abortion restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow board members say that she is approachable and will
listen to different opinions but that she is unlikely to change her
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have grown to appreciate her more because of her
steadfastness,'' conservative board member Steve Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   As much time as she spends on board business and studying
issues, Holloway still tries to make time for her family and
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Every day she takes a 40-minute walk, covering a mile or two,
depending on her pace.
</P>
<P>
   Friday nights are set aside to spend with her husband. They go
out to eat and spend time talking. They also attend their
grandchildren's baseball games and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Few who know Holloway but disagree with her on issues will take
shots at her character or integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not enemies,'' Waugh said. ``I personally like her.
She's a nice person.''

STANDING UP FOR EDUCATION ISSUES KEEPS SUE GAMBLE IN SPOTLIGHT

</P>
<P>
   SHAWNEE, Kan. _ It's not apparent from her record _ more than 20
years on elected boards and a hard bargainer at the negotiating
table _ but Shawnee Mission school board member Sue Gamble is a shy
person.
</P>
<P>
   Talking in front of large groups makes her anxious. She almost
backed out of a recent radio debate because of nerves.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one thing that can push Gamble out of her shell and
into the public arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to stand up for what's right,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the Shawnee woman left a comfortable existence as
a stay-at-home mom to take part in battles over gifted education
and boundary changes within the Shawnee Mission School District.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gamble, 58, a real estate agent, is challenging incumbent
Linda Holloway for a seat on the Kansas Board of Education, which
oversees the state's 304 school districts. The two will face off in
the Republican primary Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Gamble said, the stakes are the highest she has
encountered in 20 years as an elected official: the chance to
determine whether Kansas education focuses on the
back-to-the-basics approach favored by many social conservatives or
on the ideas championed by national education groups.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, 50, a conservative Republican from Shawnee, led the
state board in August 1999 when it approved new science standards
that don't include references to the age of Earth, the big-bang
theory and some aspects of evolutionary theory. The standards are
important because they help determine what Kansas students will
learn and are tested on.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing national and international flap over the science
standards, Gamble held fast to her feeling that the state board had
overstepped its bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of developing broad educational policies for local
districts to follow, the state board has begun micromanaging
curriculum, said Gamble, a 13-year veteran of the Shawnee Mission
board and a past president of the state school boards association.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, our standards are being weakened, and the
education of our children is being weakened over time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gamble prefers to discuss issues other than evolution,
it's the first thing most voters ask about, she's learned in more
than a month of neighborhood canvassing. Like other moderate
candidates, Gamble thinks students should be taught evolution
because it's the theory accepted by a consensus of the science
community.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives counter that the vote on science standards was
more about academic freedom than evolution, the theory that living
things share common ancestors but have changed over time. The
board's actions don't ban evolution but allow local districts to
decide whether to teach that theory or another in science classes,
Holloway has said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Kris Van Meteren is concerned, the candidacy of Gamble
and the other moderate Republicans running against board members is
motivated by animosity left over from 1998, the year moderates
wrested control of the state party away from conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using this evolution issue as a vehicle to stamp out
as many other conservative Republicans as they possibly can,'' said
Van Meteren, executive director of the conservative Kansas
Republican Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gamble does carry the hopes of moderates in Johnson
County and across the state. With her years of board experience and
statewide ties through the Kansas Association of School Boards,
Gamble is seen as a good counter to Holloway, who spent 20 years as
a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   That's what motivated people such as Gene Troehler of Leawood to
walk door to door with Gamble one steamy night in mid-July. And
that's what brought Martha Lewis to the Indian Hills Country Club
and a Gamble fund-raiser earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need someone very strong in there to lead the board,'' said
Lewis, clutching several green and white Sue Gamble yard signs.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble has garnered endorsements from the political action
committees of the Kansas National Education Association and the
Mainstream Coalition, a moderate watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody more passionate about kids and school
than Sue,'' said Mike Gamble, her husband of 38 years. ``There's a
phrase in my head from when she was on the KASB board and the
Shawnee Mission board: `It's my job.' She leaves her paying job to
go take care of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought the timid young girl who attended 18
schools in a dozen years would end up on the board of one of the
largest school districts in Kansas, let alone running for the state
school board?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Gamble, who spent much of her time in school as
the new kid, in the background, listening. Her father's wanderlust
moved the family during the 1940s and 1950s back and forth between
the West Coast and the Midwest, with a few stops in between.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble graduated with the Turner High School class of 1959.
There, she was fast friends with someone she'd bump into again
later in life: Janet Waugh, now the 1st District state board
member.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble sang at Waugh's wedding. They even worked for the same
company after high school before losing touch as their lives got
busier. They rejuvenated their friendship after both were elected
to local school boards, Waugh to Turner and Gamble to Shawnee
Mission.
</P>
<P>
   The qualities Waugh most remembers about Gamble from high school
are the ones that serve her the best in her school board work,
Waugh said: her ability to ask probing questions and her honesty.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble definitely has opinions, said Nancy Gebhart of Lenexa,
who served 12 years on the Shawnee Mission board, most with Gamble.
The two weren't close and didn't always agree, but Gebhart said she
respected Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sue is not afraid to stand alone on an issue and to speak for
that issue,'' Gebhart said. ``She will move past it once the vote's
done, but she will vote on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamble's ability to stick with the issues but avoid holding
grudges resonated with Janet Agron of Leawood, who has known Gamble
for 22 years. The two met when Gamble was on the Shawnee Mission
Northwest Advisory Board and Agron was president of the Mill Creek
Elementary School PTA.
</P>
<P>
   It was the late 1970s, and the school district was closing
schools in its older areas, where the student population was
shrinking. But in Shawnee and Lenexa, a building boom was
contributing to crowded schools and cries for new buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Agron remembers having several arguments with Gamble over
boundary changes for Mill Creek, but Gamble was always willing to
listen to Agron's side. Gamble will gracefully acquiesce if the
facts don't support her view, Agron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her mind is not closed,'' Agron said. ``You can't ask for more
than that. You can't vote for someone just because they always
agree with you.''

CANDIDATES HAVE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT EDUCATION, BUT THEIR VIEWS
DIFFER

</P>
<P>
   SHAWNEE, Kan. _ Take evolution out of their Kansas Board of
Education race and you have to dig a little deeper to find
differences between incumbent Linda Holloway and challenger Sue
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   They are both Shawnee Republicans. Both are unassuming and good
listeners. They ask questions. And they agree that Kansas education
faces large obstacles, from a shaky school finance picture to
dwindling populations in some of the state's 304 school districts.
</P>
<P>
   But at the core of both women's campaigns for the board's 2nd
District seat is a conviction about what's good and bad about
Kansas education. That's where their true differences lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe she (Gamble) cares about kids and education, but we
have different ideas,'' Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who spent more than 20 years as a teacher, thinks
education has turned away from ideas that work, such as phonics and
other emphases on basic skills. Gamble rose from PTA member to the
Shawnee Mission school board and thinks Kansas students need the
basics and more to keep up in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at their views on issues the state board faces in
the next four years:
</P>
<P>
   QUALITY PERFORMANCE ACCREDITATION
</P>
<P>
   Holloway and Gamble agree that some aspects of Quality
Performance Accreditation work.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide school improvement plan, tied to 1992 changes in
the state's school finance law, brings educational accountability
to how schools are accredited. Instead of counting books and
buildings, districts receiving state accreditation must prove that
students are learning what they're being taught.
</P>
<P>
   But Holloway sees teachers drowning in a sea of paperwork, being
dragged away from the business of teaching to fill out forms for
the state. She has carried in her platform since 1996 the goal of
streamlining the accreditation process so teachers don't lose
classroom time.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble says Quality Performance Accreditation has forced
teachers and school administrators to take responsibility for
whether students are achieving. The resultant paperwork can be
unwieldy _ and should perhaps be streamlined _ but it's basically a
system that works, Gamble said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer and fewer teachers and administrators are blaming the
student for failure,'' Gamble said.
</P>
<P>
   ACHIEVEMENT GAP
</P>
<P>
   State officials in 1998 identified a growing gap in the test
scores of white upper- and middle-class Kansas students and those
of minority and poor white students. It's a gap that has continued
to grow under Quality Performance Accreditation, Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, along with the rest of the nation, are doing a lousy job
of closing the gap between the haves and have-nots,'' Holloway
said.
</P>
<P>
   She praises a statewide reading diagnostic test, given to
second-graders, that was unanimously approved in 1998 by the
philosophically divided state board. Those test results will help
teachers determine early on the students who need help.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway also favors studying programs from other states that
have successfully raised test scores of less-advantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble agrees that it's important to study those programs, but
she says raising expectations might be just as important. Thirty
years ago, students who didn't perform well in school had job
opportunities in the service sector. That's not true anymore, as
the economy has become more dependent on technology.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional education hasn't always worked for the neediest
students, Gamble said.
</P>
<P>
   Educators have to believe all students are able to learn, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what school improvement is all about _ raising
expectations to meet the needs of a service//technology-driven
society,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ROLE OF THE STATE BOARD AND LOCAL CONTROL
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates agree on this: Despite recent moves to
abolish the state board or curb its powers, the board should remain
an elected one. That provides an element of accountability when
members come up for re-election every four years.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway said the state board should maintain its general
oversight of the public schools and those private schools, such as
most Catholic schools, that opt for state accreditation. The board
also oversees teacher certification, a process recently overhauled,
Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't think it's the state board's place to send
mandates to local boards of education. Along those lines, Holloway
holds up her vote for science standards that don't include
macroevolution, or change from one species to another, as
preserving local districts' control over what their students learn.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new science standards, approved on a contentious 6-4
vote in August 1999, districts are free to expose students to more
than just evolution, Holloway said. She calls that academic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards prohibit teachers from censoring evidence that
contradicts a current theory, Holloway said. Districts still are
free, then, to teach evolution, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never an intent to ban evolution ever by anybody on
the board,'' Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble says the local-control argument is a red herring.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas school districts always have had local control, or the
ability to determine their own courses. The changes wrought by the
1992 school finance law and Quality Performance Accreditation have
imposed requirements that districts prove students are learning,
but they say nothing about what they learn.
</P>
<P>
   Quality Performance Accreditation did require the state to set
curricular standards for local districts to use as guidelines, but
they're not mandates. And Gamble thinks the state board should
champion standards that are rigorous and world-class.
</P>
<P>
   The new science standards don't fit that definition because they
omit theories accepted by a consensus of the world's scientists,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble said that if she's elected, she will vote to throw out
the new science standards and adopt a version that was written by
27 Kansas science teachers. That version, rejected by the current
board, listed evolution as a cornerstone of science education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's responsibility is to provide the highest, most
challenging and competitive standards from which local districts
can draw their local curriculum,'' Gamble said. ``This is
legitimate local control.''

 &HT;    Armstrong leads by 6 minutes, 2 seconds over Jan Ullrich
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROYES, France _ He has maintained a substantial lead in the
Tour de France since that first day he strode to the podium and
donned the yellow jersey, after his monumental effort up the
Hautacam almost two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Lance Armstrong, publicly, would never let his comments
stray too far from the next Tour stage.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, about an hour after Armstrong completed stage 20, a
157.8-mile trip between Belfort and Troyes, the Tour peloton got to
within 120 miles of the finish line on the cobble-stoned Champs
Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   So it was time to talk about Paris. It seemed appropriate that
the Tour made a stop in champagne country Saturday, because barring
some catastrophic event, the Armstrong family will soon be popping
corks to celebrate his imminent repeat victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.K., we'll be in Paris tomorrow,'' Armstrong said Saturday.
``But I still have to be careful. The stage still counts. It's
still an official stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still won't be convinced about my victory until I get there.
I'll stay around the team and stay out of trouble until then.''
</P>
<P>
   This morning, the 128 riders who remain for the final stage of
this three-week event will board the legendary Orient Express and
travel to Paris. They will start at the Eiffel Tower at 2 p.m.
local time. Just after 4:30 p.m. in Paris, Armstrong should be
standing on the podium ready to celebrate what he termed was a more
physically exhausting championship than last year's.
</P>
<P>
   He owns a lead of 6 minutes, 2 seconds over Jan Ullrich.
Typically, little if any time is made up in the last day of the
Tour, with a smattering of sprinters trying to win the stage and
the rest of the peloton riding casually to celebrate getting to the
end after more than 2,200 miles of riding.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the imminency of the Tour's final day, Saturday was a
legitimate stage, one that went through relatively flat terrain in
the eastern stretches of France. It was the sprinters who dominated
the penultimate stage, with Eric Zabel, the most consistent of them
all, taking the win over Robbie McEwen.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from awarding the yellow jersey each day, Tour sponsors
also present a green one to the best sprinter of the bunch, with
points awarded daily. Today, Zabel will earn his fifth green jersey
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But the 30-year-old German, despite his overall excellence in
the sprints, hadn't won a stage since 1997. He had most of his
Deutsche Telekom team working for him late in the stage Saturday,
with two different riders taking turns at the front of the peloton,
wildly churning toward the finish while allowing Zabel to draft
behind them and preserve energy.
</P>
<P>
   With less than 500 meters to go, the last Telekom protector
peeled away from the pack, allowing Zabel to take over. With George
Hincapie of U.S. Postal and U.S. Pro champion Fred Rodriguez giving
chase, Zabel leaned forward and threw out his arms, nosing past
McEwen and Jeroen Blijlevens for the victory. A photo finish showed
a difference of about two inches between the three riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give a big thanks to my team,'' Zabel said. ``They did good
work. Three years is too long to wait. It's hard to imagine that I
won.''
</P>
<P>
   One hundred and one of the riders, including Armstrong, finished
with the same winning time as Zabel _ 6 hours, 14 minutes and 13
seconds. Armstrong, whose team rode at the front of the peloton to
protect their leader for much of the afternoon, finished 27th.
Ullrich was 24th.
</P>
<P>
   Hincapie was ninth and Rodriguez was 15th.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Bruynee, the U.S. Postal director sportif, had given
orders to protect Armstrong at all cost. That was an easy
assignment, given that Team Postal was the only squad with its full
allotment of nine riders still in the Tour.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore courts union vote
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to shore up his support from labor, Democratic
presidential hopeful Vice President Al Gore on Friday pledged to
union members that if he is elected he will raise the minimum wage
by $1 an hour. Speaking to the AFL-CIO convention in Washington,
Bush charged that if his Republican rival Gov. George W. Bush were
elected, he would gut the federal minimum wage law and drain
working people's retirement safety net while giving huge tax cuts
to the wealthy. Gore pointed out what he said were budget overruns
in Texas and again accused Bush of wanting ``to bring those same
budget busting tax policies to the nation as a whole.'' Gore, who
secured the labor federation's endorsement months ago, has met with
resistance from the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, who have
withheld their support and may be considering backing Green Party
candidate Ralph Nader. Both groups were angered this year by the
Clinton administration's support of free trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Nader told steelworkers in Columbus, Ohio: ``When
organized labor can say to these candidates, `You're not going to
take us for granted anymore, we have an alternative and the
alternative is Nader and the Green Party.' ''
</P>
<P>
   GORE SOAKING UP TAXPAYER FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   In a year of record-breaking fund-raising, Vice President Al
Gore has made his own mark: He has received $14.6 million in
taxpayer funds for his campaign, more than any other presidential
candidate ever. Gore, who agreed to limit his spending to $40.5
million in exchange for the taxpayer subsidies, broke the old mark
of $13.5 million by 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole.
Campaign aides expect Gore to eventually receive $15 million in
taxpayer funds. And as the Republican National Convention to be
held in Philadelphia next month nears, Gore's use of taxpayer funds
will become more evident as his rival Bush is expected to become
the first candidate since 1976 to receive a major party's
nomination without agreeing to limit his spending. Bush has smashed
all fund-raising records by taking in $96 million and spending $88
million. He has not taken any matching taxpayer funds.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL PARTIES FUNNEL MONEY THROUGH STATES
</P>
<P>
   Seizing another loophole, Democrats and Republicans are
funneling money through state parties to buy their television ads
in a tactic that preserves the limited dollars they can spend
directly on candidates in the fall. If the national parties had
bought the ads themselves, they would have been required by federal
regulations to use mostly ``hard money'' _ the limited
contributions that can be spent directly in support of candidates.
But by routing dollars first to state affiliates, the parties can
use a greater portion of ``soft money.'' This summer, the DNC has
spent nearly $20 million on TV ads in 17 states promoting Gore. The
RNC has spent more than $17 million on ads touting Bush. Virtually
all of it has been channeled through state parties.
</P>
<P>
   DNC CHAIR WORRIES ABOUT GORE'S IMAGE
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Gov. Paul E. Patton, who will preside over the
Democratic National Convention next month in Los Angeles has had
some recent advise for Gore to improve his personality in order to
attract more voters. ``The problem with the whole campaign,''
Patton told The Courier-Journal of Louisville recently, ``is that
people know Gore and he evidently doesn't have that personality
that is causing people to come to him.'' Patton suggested that Gore
should continue to criticize rival Bush's track record as governor
of Texas. ``We're exactly where we were in 1988, with a sitting
vice president and an attractive governor who can make a good
speech _ and you know who won that one,'' Patton said referring to
1988 when then-Vice President George Bush, Gov. Bush's father,
defeated rival Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, who had led
in the polls.

ORTIZ FINDING THE GROOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the first half.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Russ Ortiz is trying to do, and, so far, he's been
successful.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants right-hander enters today's start
against the Dodgers with a 5-8 record and 6.29 ERA, but learning to
be more aggressive and get ahead in counts early is helping Ortiz
return to the type of pitcher who earned a team-high 18 wins last
year in his first full major-league season.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz is undefeated in three July appearances. He entered the
month having given up 22 home runs, but hasn't allowed one since.
He has one walk in each of his past two games and his ERA is
steadily declining as his team has climbed into second place in the
National League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three or four outings, it's been real positive,''
said Ortiz, who graduated from Montclair Prep of Van Nuys. ``After
the first half was over, I put it behind me. The second half is
where we're gonna continue to gain ground, so I'm trying to put the
past behind me and trying to keep moving forward. So far, I've been
throwing the ball a lot better and I've been real happy with the
way I've thrown the last few times out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz's biggest improvement is getting ahead in counts. Even
though he said his control is much better than a year ago - he led
the league with 125 walks and tied for third with 13 wild pitches
last season - he believes fewer borderline pitches are being called
in his favor, which left him behind early, throwing a steady dose
of fastballs and trying to be too perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking more chances the first couple pitches and getting
those over for strikes,'' said Ortiz, who finds an effective
combination with his overhand curve and a fastball in the low 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making quality pitches early in the count and getting
ahead, so now I'm able to do what I want and go by the plan the
catcher and I have mapped out. It's a lot easier to stay with that
plan when you're ahead. When you're behind, you've gotta think of
another way to get guys out. Right now, I've just been getting
ahead and that's just been a big, huge difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Another big difference is his performance in clutch situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was wild and I got into trouble, but I made the
big pitches when I needed to,'' Ortiz said. ``This year, the first
half, I just didn't make the pitches. For what reason, it's hard to
say. I'm not thinking about that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in pressure situations was nothing new for Ortiz, 26,
who thrived as a reliever until a few years ago. After recording 48
saves with a 1.39 ERA in his first 90 professional appearances,
Ortiz was converted to a starter in 1997. It was then he said he
realized how to be a true pitcher instead of ``just throwing it up
there saying, Here, hit it.'''
</P>
<P>
   He made his major-league debut a year later and emerged as the
staff ace last season. Ortiz is just the ninth right-hander and
18th Giant overall to win 18 games since the club moved to San
Francisco in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting back to being the pitcher we counted on last
year,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``He's done well his last
few games.''

MacPHAIL'S PURGING OF CUBS BEGINS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Chicago Cubs general manager Ed Lynch traded for Eric Young
and Ismael Valdes in December, it was viewed largely throughout the
industry as a move to save his job.
</P>
<P>
   Silly Lynch. What was he thinking?
</P>
<P>
   While Young's had a very good year, Valdes, the key to the move
considering the Cubs' need for starting pitching, had worn out his
welcome by May. And he went a large way toward costing Lynch his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Cubs president Andy MacPhail is also the general manager,
which he's scheduled to be until his contract runs out after the
2001 season. And the purging has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it became evident that we were going to make a change,
and (the responsibility) was going to be mine, I looked at it like
it's Ahab and the white whale,'' MacPhail said. ``Either I'm going
to get this done or I'm not. We're not going to have any confusion
about who's responsible. From here on out, it's on me.''
</P>
<P>
   MacPhail already traded Glenallen Hill to the Yankees, but
that's only a small piece of what he wants to accomplish by the
July 31 trading deadline. He also wants to trade Valdes, Henry
Rodriguez, Jeff Reed and Felix Heredia for prospects. Baseball
officials also said right-handers Kevin Tapani and Rick Aguilera
could be had. They both have no-trade clauses, but they would be
waived in the right situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a little activity is a good thing for the sake of a
little activity,'' MacPhail said. ``This is one of those times.''
</P>
<P>
   MacPhail also must deal with the Sammy Sosa situation. Sosa had
a nine-game stretch when he hit eight homers, and he's hoping the
Cubs present him with a serious offer to a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting game: Dodgers right-hander Mike Fetters and
shortstop Kevin Elster, both of whom signed one-year non-guaranteed
contracts in the offseason, are interested in contract extensions.
However, it'll have to wait until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone said he won't talk about contract
extensions during the final two months with any player. It's the
same stance the organization took at the end of last season. During
the offseason, they inked Eric Karros, Mark Grudzielanek, Antonio
Osuna and Dave Hansen to deals.
</P>
<P>
   Trade winds: Cincinnati's Pete Harnisch has become a coveted
pitcher, and while the Chicago White Sox are the lead team in the
sweepstakes, Arizona is searching doggedly for a No. 2 starter that
could complement Randy Johnson and make it possible for the
Diamondbacks to pull away from the rest of the National League
West.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch is 3-5 with a 5.27 ERA, but he's pitched two
complete-game four-hitters at Enron Field and Coors Field, and he's
3-1 with a 1.45 ERA since coming off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk and joke a lot about (the trade rumors),'' Harnisch
said. ``The guys are (ticked) with me because they think I'm
pitching my way out of here. But we feel like there may be some
people trying to give up on us a little bit. We don't feel that
way. If we can keep a couple of guys here - every day we lose
somebody else - we feel we have a shot (at contending for the
postseason).''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Curt Schilling fodder continues in Philadelphia.
Schilling brought up his please-trade-me speech last week, then
backed off it when it angered teammates and fans. He then went on a
Phillies pregame show and said how much he loved Philadelphia and
wanted to stay.
</P>
<P>
   But it just so happened that at the same time Denny Neagle was
telling reporters he saw Schilling at the movies, the right-hander
was talking about how jealous he was that he wasn't the one traded
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling's value has increased because he's pitching well
again. In his past seven starts, he pitched at least seven innings
and is 4-2 with a 2.17 ERA. However, the Phillies are asking for
the world in return for Schilling, who has a no-trade clause, and
it's unlikely he'll be moved by the July 31 trade deadline.

SPARKY ANDERSON HAS HAD QUITE A CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. -- While Sparky Anderson was pacing the
visitor's dugout that famous night in Fenway Park 25 years ago, Tim
Belcher was back in Ohio matching him step for step.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of 13-year-old Cincinnati Reds fans allowed to
stay up past midnight, listening to broadcaster Marty Brennaman
call the game they hoped would bring them a World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   When Boston's Carlton Fisk hit a dramatic 11th-inning home run
that forced a Game 7 in what many think is the greatest series of
all time, Belcher and Sparky were stunned - a thousand miles apart
but together in their misery. The Big Red Machine was sputtering on
the cliffs of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone lived and died with those Reds teams, mostly died
that night,'' said Belcher of the Angels, who is winding up a
distinguished 13-year major-league career. ``But we knew Sparky
would get those guys through.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, of course. Tony Perez hit a two-run homer in Game 7, Joe
Morgan won it with a base hit in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   And today, in this sleepy village in upstate New York, more than
40,000 fans are expected to come here and remember it all.
Anderson, who managed the Reds to titles in 1975-76 and the Detroit
Tigers to a championship in 1984, will be inducted into baseball's
Hall of Fame along with Perez, Brennaman, Fisk and old-timers
Turkey Stearns and Bid McPhee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give anything to be there,'' Belcher said. ``For
anyone who grew up with the Reds, it is a dream come true. Sparky
and Marty and Tony Perez all going into the Hall of Fame on the
same day. Even Carlton Fisk.''
</P>
<P>
   The day is even more special for Belcher because he later got a
chance to play for Anderson in Detroit during the 1994 season and
finally brush up against the most successful manager of the modern
baseball era.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher already knew the numbers, third place behind Connie Mack
and John McGraw in career victories (2,194), the only manager to
win World Series in both leagues, the winningest manager in the
history of the Reds and Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was during that disastrous, strike-shortened 1994 that
Belcher, who started 0-9, learned what made Sparky tick. Instead of
giving up on his pitcher, Anderson became Belcher's biggest fan,
admiring his grit and work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same quality that spirited George Lee Anderson, 66,
through Dorsey High School in West Central Los Angeles, Cincinnati,
Detroit and the same home of 35 years in Thousand Oaks, to the top
of the baseball world.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, he cared about people.
</P>
<P>
   His career also included his firing from the Reds in 1978. Free
agency had arrived and Cincinnati traded Perez to Montreal rather
than sign him to a long-term deal. The same was true with Tigers
catcher and leader Lance Parrish, who left after Detroit won the
Series in 1984. But Anderson embraced the new players the way he
had the stars. There was no other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only one of the greatest managers of all time, but
he's also one of the greatest human beings of all time,'' said Reds
new general manager Jim Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very giving man who cares about people, always put the
people before his job and was very successful with the ability to
motivate players and know when to kick them in the rear and when to
pat them on the back. A man who always speaks with honesty,
integrity and character.''
</P>
<P>
   It was those qualities that impressed former USC coach Rod
Dedeaux, who first met young George at a college game in the early
1940s and made him a Trojans batboy for six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The same virtues caught the eye of Reds general manager Bob
Howsam, who offered Anderson, a prematurely gray, 35-year-old coach
with the San Diego Padres, the manager's job in 1970. In honor of
Howsam, Anderson's plaque bears a Cincinnati cap.
</P>
<P>
   Other influences were Lefty Phillips, the Brooklyn Dodgers scout
who signed Anderson out of high school after Dorsey won a record 42
consecutive games. Anderson credits Phillips with teaching him more
about baseball than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Another was George Scherger, Anderson's first professional
manager at Class D Santa Barbara. When Sparky became manager of the
Reds in 1970, he brought back Scherger as one of his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   All left a message. As great as the game is, it is the people
who make it special.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I feel best about,'' said Anderson, who earned the
nickname Captain Hook for his quick use of his bullpen. ``I might
not make everybody happy. You pinch-hit a guy, take him out of a
game. But I've never had a situation where I run into a player
later and he was upset with the way he was treated. It's good to
hear a guy say, `One thing about you, you always told the truth.'''
</P>
<P>
   It never has been more true than the past month, when Anderson
has been on a treadmill of public appearances and celebrity golf
tournaments. Last week he flew to Detroit to do charity work for
former University of Michigan football coach Bo Schembechler, came
back to California for one day, then returned to Michigan for his
own golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never says no,'' said Irv Kaze, former Yankees and Raiders
publicist who has a sports talk show on KIEV radio in Glendale.
``He says he'll be on and he's on. I think that's because he never
forgot when he wasn't on top. To George, a head of state is no more
important than a clubhouse guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson remembers what it was like to be a career
minor-leaguer. He played just one season in the majors, batting
.218 in 1959 with the Philadelphia Phillies. Managers became his
heroes. His idol is John McGraw, the former New York Giants manager
who died Feb. 25, 1934 three days after Anderson was born in
Bridgewater, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson remembered his first opening day at Cincinnati's
Riverfront Stadium. Bands were playing and there were wreaths at
home plate for him and Montreal manager Gene Mauch.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this stuff is going on and I feel a tug on my pants,''
Anderson said. ``It was Gene. He said, `Remember today, because
you'll never get this memory again.' I never forgot that. It will
stay there for the rest of my years.''
</P>
<P>
   Also among the dignitaries today will be Hall of Famer and
former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda, who in his first year ended
Anderson's reign of World Series titles in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the Reds and the Dodgers in the 1970s was the greatest
rivalry in baseball history,'' Anderson said. ``The Giants and
Dodgers weren't even close. It was so intense, every game, and the
cities were 2,000 miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Tommy's first year, we played the Dodgers 18 times, nine in
Cincinnati, nine here. Each game was a sellout. I never heard a
ballpark so loud. More than a million fans saw us play the Dodgers
that year.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson never was as boisterous as Lasorda, but he is a vivid
storyteller who was an Angels TV broadcaster after retiring from
the Tigers in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But his voice gets soft when he talks about the most important
face in the crowd - Carol, his wife of 47 years.
</P>
<P>
   The two have known each other since grade school, married and
reared three children in the same Thousand Oaks house they built
with an $8,000 loan from her father.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Anderson is never interviewed, rarely photographed and
prefers to remain outside of the trappings of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the boss,'' he said. ``Her thing was always the
children, she just did the whole raising. I couldn't even take 5
percent of the credit. I'm not proud of that. I never was there. I
was so involved with baseball. I wish I had chosen the other path.
They forgave me for that and now we are so close. She did all of
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason I was successful was the fact she allowed me
to be free. She was not one trying to gain the limelight with all
the fancy clothes and cars. I'm so proud being married to her.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sons Lee and Albert and daughter Shirlee, there
are 14 grandchildren. All are expected here today.
</P>
<P>
   So are many of his players, including Hall of Famers Morgan and
Johnny Bench.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the gate will be Pete Rose, the all-time hits leader who
was banished form the game a decade ago for allegedly gambling on
baseball. Although Rose is not officially allowed to participate in
major-league functions, he has come to Cooperstown that past few
years to sign autographs and remain visible to his many fans.
</P>
<P>
   With such a strong contingent from Cincinnati, there has been
speculation that either Perez or Brennaman will make pleas during
their acceptance speeches to reinstate Rose. Anderson has been
outspoken in his support of Rose but says he will not debate the
issue at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony might say something,'' Anderson said. ``I always say if
you feel you should, then you should. But to me, this is not the
playing field to embarrass anyone, not the commissioner on this
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do that. I'm not there for that. I'm there because
this game is so beautiful. And always will be.''

   WASHINGTON _ As a vice presidential candidate, Dick Cheney would
give George W. Bush an instant shot of gravitas and energize the
Republican Party, while reassuring the public that Bush has a
battle-tested No. 2 to deal with foreign and domestic problems,
party activists and political analysts said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very thorough, very fair, always prepared, very stable. I
think that's what people saw during the Persian Gulf War,'' said
Becky Constantino, the Wyoming Republican Party chairwoman,
referring to Cheney's time as defense secretary. ``There's just
such a sense of security around Dick Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   But selecting Cheney, who also served six terms in the US House
and was chief of staff for President Ford, could undercut Bush's
appeal as a Washington outsider and reinforce speculation that his
administration would recycle figures from the administration of his
father, President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It also could raise questions of whether a 59-year-old running
mate with a history of heart trouble enables the Texas governor to
fulfill his chief criterion for a vice president: the ability to
become president in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cheney was touched by the House banking scandal and
criticized in 1991 for giving Pentagon briefings to GOP donors.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has been heading Bush's search for a running mate, but he
was identified as a leading candidate Friday, when he switched his
voter registration from Texas, where he has been running an oil and
engineering firm, to Wyoming, his longtime home. The move would
keep Electoral College voters in Texas from violating a prohibition
against supporting presidential and vice presidential candidates
from the same state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides cautioned that picking Cheney is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is spending the weekend contemplating his choice at
his ranch in Crawford, Texas. He and his wife, Laura, left the
ranch Saturday to attend the funeral of Senator Paul Coverdell of
Georgia, a Bush family friend who died Tuesday from a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cheney, speculation centers on Governor Frank Keating of
Oklahoma; Senators Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, George Voinovich of
Ohio, Fred Thompson and Bill Frist of Tennessee, and John McCain of
Arizona; former Missouri senator John C. Danforth; as well as
Governors George Pataki of New York and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania
and former Cabinet member Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Bush often hails governors for their executive experience, while
the senators would offer him experience in the ways of Washington.
Dole could improve Bush's appeal to women, a traditionally
Democratic bloc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor will decide shortly, and when he does, the plan
is for he himself to make and announce the news. . . . It could
come as soon as Monday,'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and longtime Cheney friends said any negatives are far
outweighed by the positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a wide variety of experience both in the executive
branch of government and he's got a wide variety of experience in
the legislative branch as well,'' said Tom Sansonetti, a Republican
National Committee member from Cheyenne, Wyo., who has known Cheney
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, a Washington political analyst, added: ``The
conservatives see him as conservative, the moderates see him as
moderate. He's clearly distinguished and he'd generate excitement
among the Republicans at their convention. The overall reaction
from the media would be one that he could definitely be president
if needed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the stump, Bush has said repeatedly that America needs a
fresh start from the moral and fund-raising problems that have
plagued President Clinton and, by extension, the Democratic
candidate, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is said to be focusing his search for a No. 2 on Senator
John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, as well as Senators Bob Graham of
Florida and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, and former Senate
majority leader George Mitchell of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   While only five years older than Bush, Cheney is a political
graybeard who would help the two-term governor on two fronts:
experience in dealing with Congress, and reassurance for the public
that Bush's lack of foreign affairs experience would not put the
nation at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., but raised in Wyoming, the son
of a US soil-conservation official. He worked in the Nixon
administration in the Office of Economic Opportunity and on the
Cost of Living Council before becoming deputy assistant to
President Ford. At 34, he became Ford's White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was first elected to Congress in 1978. He was reelected
five times and became House minority whip in 1988. While
maintaining a conservative record _ Cheney, like Bush, opposes
abortion _ he nonetheless appealed to moderates even as he strongly
supported a conservative icon, President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, President Bush appointed Cheney defense secretary after
the Senate rejected his first choice, former Texas senator John G.
Tower. It was in that post that Cheney gained his greatest fame,
offering a cerebral image as the United States sent a half-million
troops to fight Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was embarrassed in March 1992 when he was named among a
number of former and current House members in the House banking
scandal. He acknowledged overdrawing 21 checks in 1989-90 for
amounts ranging from $12 to $1,945, but said the deficits were
covered in no more than five days after his paycheck was deposited.
</P>
<P>
   While defense secretary, Cheney was also criticized for giving
Pentagon briefings to supporters who had donated $5,000 to the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's health has been questioned because he suffered mild
heart attacks in 1978, 1984, and 1988. He underwent quadruple
coronary bypass surgery in August 1988. During Cheney's
confirmation hearings for defense secretary in 1989, his doctor
called his recovery ``excellent'' and said there were no
restrictions on his work or recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Cheney has been chairman and chief executive officer
of Halliburton Corp., a $9 billion engineering and construction
conglomerate.

SPREAD OF TECHNOLOGY TO POOR NATIONS TOPS GROUP OF EIGHT AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ There were no smashed Nike stores, no black ski
masks. But the specter of forces who oppose globalization hovered
Saturday as the leaders of the world's richest countries pledged to
take steps to bring the world's poorest into the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   Information technology and the ``digital divide'' topped the
agenda at the summit this weekend of eight industrialized nations.
The topic was a clear attempt to assure globalization's naysayers
that the wired economy is not for the wealthy alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should be able to enjoy access to information and
communications networks,'' the group said in a charter signed by
all leaders. They also urged governments to avoid regulating
information technology tightly, and vowed to protect intellectual
property rights on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Eight also set up a ``DOT Force,'' or digital
opportunity task force, which will work toward providing computers
and Internet access to the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Some people applauded the drive as altruistic; others argued
that poor nations need electricity and clean water, not modems and
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't eat computers,'' said Kewese Owusu, coordinator for
Jubilee 2000, a group that campaigns for debt relief. ``People are
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the point, members of the group set fire to a
laptop on an Okinawan beach.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the G-8 countries enjoying prosperity, it is
politically astute to turn attention to the developing world. But
the agenda also reflects a growing sense, especially from the
United States, that there is an obvious advantage to getting
technology into as many hands as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``With us leading in cutting-edge technology, America has an
interest in having more people use it,'' said Jake Siewart, White
House deputy press spokesman, who said President Clinton had played
a big role in pushing information technology onto the G-8 agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton issued what the administration is calling a ``global
call to action'' to promote information technologies. The
statement, supported by 50 major US foundations and companies,
including America Online and IBM, promises to help developing
countries with everything from regulatory policy to e-commerce to
wiring remote places.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton resisted a notion that the United States is trying to
bully the rest of the world into technology, or that globalization
means to sweep away local identities. The United States recognizes
``that the diverse conditions and needs of developing nations
should be taken into account, and that local cultures be preserved
and promoted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers applauded the G-8 initiative, arguing that
governments are needed to spur private business to wire the
developing world. ``The problem won't simply be solved by market
forces in globalization,'' said Denis Gilhooly, an aide at the
United Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   But many remain skeptical about how much the G-8 nations can
accomplish. They point to the G-8's inability, highlighted again at
this year's summit, to make inroads into debt relief for poor
nations.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's G-8 summit in Cologne, Germany, the rich nations
promised debt relief for 40 of the world's poorest nations. But few
nations have qualified for the stringent requirements, and
according to Jubilee 2000, only $15 billion of the $100 billion
promised at the Cologne meeting has been forgiven. The US Congress
has held up the $600 billion that Clinton had promised.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed dissatisfaction with
the pace of debt relief. ``For four years we have had too many
promises and too little action,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much money the G-8 governments will spend to
bring the Web to the world. Only Japan, whose prime minister,
Yoshiro Mori, is just learning to use a computer mouse, agreed to
pony up a specific amount _ $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Replying to questions about what the other countries would pay,
a US deputy national economic adviser, Lael Brainard, said: ``There
is a general expectation that everybody will participate by
mobilizing government resources, by helping to mobilize focus and
energy at the multilateral organizations, by energizing the private
sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides say Clinton has been taken with the effect that technology
might have on poor regions of Africa and India. Clinton often
speaks of how impressed he was when he saw a mother in India's
Rajasthan state getting data on caring for her baby off the
Internet at a community center.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 5 percent of computers with Internet access are in
developing countries. And most people in poorer countries don't
have a telephone connection. If that doesn't improve and the
developed world keeps moving ahead at the same pace, the richer
will get richer and the poor poorer, many worry.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the world's leaders in touch with technology, the
Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, suggested that they stay in
touch via e-mail. ``The suggestion was accepted unanimously,''
German spokesman Uwe-Carsten Heye told journalists.

   HARRISON, N.J. _ I grew up on Pleasant Avenue, the wiseguy
capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   I was holding my father's hand on the summer morning when
Francis Ford Coppola and James Caan visited the old East Harlem
neighborhood to film a scene for the first ``Godfather'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   All the guys from the ``old man's club'' were out in their
skimpy T-shirts that morning, sipping cappuccino from plastic cups,
their diamond pinky rings glaring in a mean sun. Jimmy the Cat.
Vito the Bat. Patti Apples. Talk about filming on location.
</P>
<P>
   In the scene, Sonny Corleone, played by Caan, kicks the wise out
of his wiseguy brother-in-law. Casting agents on the set were
offering $50 to any kid who wanted to be an extra, asking them to
simply play in front of a fire hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are all my friends,'' I said. ``Dad, I wanna go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' my father said flatly.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, a gentleman who had earned the nickname Joey
Aggravation rushed over to my dad from the Pleasant Tavern and
shrieked, ``C'mon Frankie, let the kid go!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' my dad said again, squeezing my hand. ``You're not a
gangster.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the closest I ever got to being in a movie, especially
the kind of movie that romanticized the lifestyles of the kind of
people I grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years later, I got in line for another part. I was one
of thousands who showed up at Harrison High School on Saturday for
a much-publicized casting call for the hit HBO series ``The
Sopranos,'' which happens to be my favorite.
</P>
<P>
   With several relatives in tow, I arrived at the high school at 9
a.m. to find that thousands of young, cigar-chomping men in muscle
T-shirts and women with tall hairdos and spiked heels were already
there, the dizzying smells of perfume and hair spray filling the
hot air.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Lt. Charles Trucillo of the Harrison Police
Department estimated, 4,000 or 5,000 people were already in line.
</P>
<P>
   Trucillo said 400 to 500 people had slept in front of the school
overnight to improve their odds of successfully dropping off their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Using the power of my connections _ my ID card from The New York
Times, where I work as a news assistant _ I broke ranks to
negotiate a better deal somewhere up the line.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for the right place to jump in, I spotted a large man in
a silk suit. His name was Lou Roca. Other than the fact that he was
wearing handcuffs to the casting call, and handing out business
cards with the words ``You Lookin' at Me?'' written in bold letters
across the front, he seemed like a harmless guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a problem with me standing here, pal?'' I asked with a
sly smile. ``I'm with the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Roca, who had made the trip from New Castle, Del., replied,
``Make me an offer I can't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can stand here if you get a message to Tony Soprano for
me,'' Roca said, referring to the lead character in the series,
played by James Gandolfini. ``Tell him I can help him with his
family problems. I can be on the muscle end of the family, the
fixer. I can make things go away.''
</P>
<P>
   By 9:45 a.m., the lines behind me had snaked down and around six
city blocks. I thought about my sister Donna, who could play
Carmela Soprano's dark-haired sister, waiting way back in line for
a chance that might never come.
</P>
<P>
   I know that feeling, which is why I worked out a the deal with
``Lou Rocks,'' as Roca refers to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 10:30, when the doors were scheduled to open, I made
my first contact, bumping into Henry Brunchtein, a co-producer and
production manager for ``The Sopranos.'' He explained the enormous
turnout for the hugely popular show, which recently garnered 18
Emmy nominations, about Tony Soprano, who copes with the problems
of everyday family life while struggling to maintain his status as
a mob boss in the suburbs of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was, we were going to do a casting call and
announce it in a couple of small papers, expecting maybe a thousand
people, but then it got picked up by Regis and Howard Stern, and we
started to get a lot of phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were calling us, saying they were flying in from other
parts of the country, and many of them slept here overnight. We got
a call from a guy from New Mexico who wanted directions to Harrison
from Newark Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time my conversation had ended with Brunchtein, the
crowds had swelled to nearly 20,000 people, eclipsing by 5,000 the
population of Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:45, I arrived at the steps of the school's gymnasium, and
as I began to head toward the casting directors _ men were in one
line, women in another _ I tapped into a few conversations some of
my would-be gangster friends were engaging in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break a leg,'' Joe Oliveto of Roosevelt Island, N.Y., said to
another man on his way to meeting a casting director.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' asked the man, unsure about Oliveto's remark. ``You
talking to me?''
</P>
<P>
   As I got closer to my second chance at the big time, I heard a
young assistant casting director, Jarred Bryant, ask a bald man
with a big belly, 40-ish, ``Are you in the business?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said the man, ``I'm in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you acted in?'' asked Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, not that business,'' said the man, smiling wide. ``I'm in
 &UR; the  &LR; business.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was my turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any acting experience?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, no,'' I said shyly. ``But almost. Thirty years ago, I
...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, thanks, and maybe we'll give you a call,'' said Bryant,
dropping my 5 by 7 glossy and a brief information form into a large
pile.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping outside, I heard an HBO official shouting into a
bullhorn, telling all the men in silk suits, and all the women in
high heels and short skirts, that they were closing the doors, and
offering an address for those who had been unable to see a casting
agent to mail in their mini-bios.
</P>
<P>
   I worked my way back through the crowd, and went home.
</P>
<P>
   I told my wife that if Tony Soprano called, I had a message for
him.

SPARKS TO FACE CONTENDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ After one day's rest, the Los Angeles Sparks
return to the Forum at 5 p.m. today when they meet another likely
playoff contender in the Sacramento Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Center Lisa Leslie had a solid game with 30 points and 16
rebounds, plus two key free throws, to help the Sparks pull off a
74-68 victory Friday at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (20-3) clinched their second consecutive playoff
berth with the victory, their fourth straight and 16th in 17 games.
Three-time defending WNBA champion Houston is the only other team
to have clinched a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento and Phoenix, which played late Saturday night, are in
a battle for the third playoff spot in the Western Conference. Four
teams advance from each conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks are 1-1 against the Monarchs, who caught the Sparks
on the second day of back-to-back games. The Sparks had defeated
the Mercury the night before and less than 24 hours later were in
Sacramento, where they suffered their first loss five games into
the season, 75-68.
</P>
<P>
   Forward-guard Mwadi Mabika scored 23 points to help the Sparks
avenge that loss with a 76-61 victory this month.
</P>
<P>
   This is the final regular-season meeting between these teams.
But it's possible they can meet again in the playoffs. Last season,
they met in a one-game playoff format with the Sparks winning,
82-80. But the Monarchs (14-9 before Saturday's game against
Phoenix) were without star center Yolanda Griffith, who suffered a
season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks are a much more experienced team than a year ago, and
Griffith, the league's MVP, Defensive Player of the Year and
Newcomer of the Year, has overcome her injury. Her average for
points (16.0 from 18.8) and rebounds (9.5 from 11.3) are down
slightly from last season, but the former Long Beach StingRay's
determination is as high as ever. She played on the Western
Conference All-Star team with Leslie, Mwadi and DeLisha Milton.
</P>
<P>
   Monarchs point guard Ticha Penicheiro is questionable for today.
She has a sore right foot, which prevented her from playing
Thursday against Minnesota.

WEBB'S 68 SEPARATES HER FROM THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL FIELDS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GURNEE, Ill. _ The golf was terrific, and the comparisons were
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Tiger Woods forged a large lead in the third round
of the British Open Saturday, Karrie Webb _ who has dominated her
peers in the last 18 months on the LPGA Tour the way Woods has on
the PGA Tour _ followed suit at the United States Women's Open,
shooting a four-under-par 68 for a seven-under 209 total at the
Merit Club to take a four-stroke advantage over Meg Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty uncanny that it has been so similar,'' said Webb,
who will have enough points to qualify for the LPGA Hall of Fame if
she is able to win her first United States Women's Open on Sunday.
``I'm out there trying to do my best. He's out there trying to do
his best.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has won 13 times since January 1999, while Webb has
captured 10 titles. Each has won two major championships in that
period, including one apiece _ Woods by 15 strokes at the 2000
United States Open and Webb by 10 at the 2000 Nabisco Championship
_ by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   Each golfer is able to separate from the field. After Mallon,
the closest pursuers to Webb are four golfers _ Mi Hyun Kim, Rosie
Jones, Laura Davies and Dorothy Delasin _ at even-par 216.
</P>
<P>
   It was a frustrating and painful day for the 44-year-old Hall of
Famer Betsy King. She began the round tied with Webb at three
under, one stroke behind Mallon, but injured a muscle in her lower
back while hitting her tee shot on the 172-yard second hole.
</P>
<P>
   After aggravating the injury while hitting a shot out of the
rough on No.3, King requested medical treatment. A trainer massaged
her back, applied a therapeutic balm and gave her pain relievers,
but King was in obvious discomfort. She managed a birdie on the
fourth hole but quickly went into a tailspin and did not make
another par until the 11th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to get through the round, King shot an 82 to tumble
from contention at 223, seven over par, but she got admiration from
Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the greatest rounds I've ever seen anybody
play,'' Mallon said. ``I'm not sure how she stayed out there. She
told me it felt like a knife was going through her back every time
she swung. I felt terrible for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury was particularly bad luck for the two-time Open
champion because as a former longtime student of Ed Oldfield, the
Merit Club's president, King had played the course 20 to 30 times
and was more familiar with it than any player in the field. In
fact, she is an honorary member of the club.
</P>
<P>
   Webb found little trouble on the Merit Club's course. Going out
on a partly cloudy day with light wind, she started fast. Accurate
approaches set up birdie putts within 15 feet on four of the first
seven holes. Webb took the lead with a seven-foot birdie putt on
the fourth hole and was not caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did feel pretty good about things today even though I was
pretty nervous,'' Webb said. ``When I birdied the second hole that
really calmed me down a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb has not been as uncatchable as Woods when holding the lead
in a tournament with one round to play, but her record is
formidable. Leading 19 events since 1995 with one round left, Webb
has won 11, finished second seven times and tied for seventh once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I've had some success on Sundays,'' she said. ``I
can always feed off that. But every Sunday is different. I've got
to stick to my game plan, don't do anything silly and try to make
some birdies.''

   Mallon, who had an up-and-down round that included playing up
the wrong fairway on the 14th hole, looked ahead to the final round
with some realism.

   ``I've seen some funny things happen on Sunday,'' she said,
``but I don't expect it out of Karrie. She has one of the strongest
heads out here. But I'm going to play my heart out and try to get
close to her or catch her.''

same way about a certain leading man. &QL;

BACK PAINS PUT KING OUT OF TITLE CONTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBERTYVILLE, Ill. _ Superior course knowledge could not
outweigh the impact of intense back pain yesterday for Betsy King,
who dropped off the leader board at the U.S. Women's Open with a
third-round 82.
</P>
<P>
   King, 44, had been bidding to become the oldest winner in the
tournament's 55-year history. A long-time student of Ed Oldfield,
the Merit Club president, King is an honorary member of the course
and had played it more than 30 times _ tops among the Open
competitors _ before emerging as a front-runner heading into the
weekend rounds.
</P>
<P>
   King's status changed radically after she pulled a muscle in her
lower back while hitting her tee shot on the second hole. King, who
began the third round at 3-under par and finished it at 7-over,
said she ``felt something pop'' in her lower back while hitting the
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every swing after that, it felt like a was knife going through
my back,'' said King, who indicated it is probable that she will
withdraw before today's 10:05 a.m. tee time, unless recurring
muscle spasms can be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the injury, King played on yesterday. When the situation
worsened after hitting out of the rough en route to a bogey at the
third hole, King received permission to have LPGA Tour trainer
Keith Kennedy visit her on the course.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.S. Golf Association's rules committee permitted
King a five-minute break after completion of her fifth hole to
confer with Kennedy. By that point, the damage to the scorecard had
begun in earnest with a double-bogey at No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Before King headed to the sixth tee box, Kennedy massaged her
back, applied therapeutic balm and administered some pain
relievers. King, a two-time Open champ, took bogeys on the next
five holes after Kennedy's visit. For the day, King posted five
pars, two birdies, 10 bogeys and a double-bogey. She fell from
second to 28th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt sick for Betsy,'' said Meg Mallon, her playing partner.
``She was in a lot of pain. That was one of the gutsiest rounds
I've ever seen anyone play.''
</P>
<P>
   King said she continued playing in hope that muscle relaxers
might make the pain subside. That never happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been any other tournament, I might have withdrawn on
the spot,'' King said. ``I couldn't make one swing without hurting.
It's the first time in 23 years on tour that something like this
has happened to me. I'm disappointed, but I've had more than my
fair share of good health and chances to win tournaments.'' nn

ESPN EXTENDS ITS COMPETITIVE SPIRIT TO THE GREAT OUTDOORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB HOOD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The network that brought you the X Games has done it again.
</P>
<P>
   You might have seen the ESPN commericals. You know, the funny
ones. This time, it's not baseball or football or hockey or even
basketball. It's log rolling and tree chopping that makes us laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign promotes the inaugural ESPN Great Outdoor Games,
held this weekend in Lake Placid, N.Y. ESPN has planned 171/2 hours
of programming that involves more than 200 athletes, both humans
and dogs, whose four days of competition for a total purse of
$288,850 concludes today. The network plans to televise the events
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Games are the latest in a run of ``alternative'' sports
made-for-TV shows that seem to be entering the mainstream. The
recent revival and increased popularity of professional wrestling
has opened the door for more alternative programming. Since ESPN
debuted the X Games in 1995, the network has followed with more
than a dozen other programs, including the Winter X Games, the X
trials, the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, the Great 8 Basketball Festival
and D3: Bikes, Boards and Blades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proprietary programming like the X Games and the ESPY Awards
is definitely a trend and development in the '90s,'' ESPN spokesman
Dave Nagle said. ``And for good reason. They are events that we
own. We can run them to our own specifications, which helps
broadcasting. There are no rights fees, and no one can take it away
from you.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's goal is to reach out to a bigger audience by providing
alternative sports, and to ``open people's eyes as to what is
sports and what can be televised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as with the X Games, we feel we can make these sports
entertainment whether you participate or not,'' Nagle said. ``But
millions of people participate in these sports. Tons of people own
fishing and hunting licenses. Tons of people own dogs. Not many
people participate in the timber sports, but lots of people have
saws in their back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception 21 years ago, ESPN has changed the
definition of sports broadcasting, and Nagle said it has always
been looking for ways to improve its product and to increase its
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the beginning, people have always asked, `How can you
fill 24 hours a day with sports programming?' This is how. Now we
have ESPN2 and we fill 48, not to mention ESPNEWS and ESPN
Classic,'' Nagle said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Games include 21 events in four categories _
fishing, target shooting, timber sports and shooting dogs
competition.
</P>
<P>
   After this week's coverage, ESPN2 will air one-hour segments of
the Games at 10 a.m. from July 31 through Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   In filming each event, ESPN officials said they not only used
some of the most sophisticated equipment available but also
invented new ones especially for some contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at every event with a fresh and creative eye,
willing to rewrite whatever rules existed in covering these
sports,'' said Dave Miller, ESPN senior coordinating producer.
``Our mission is to present programming that is entertaining and
informative, whether you have ever cast a rod, chopped a log or
called a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the high-tech equipment used to film the events is a
DogCam, which is worn on the collar by freelance ``stunt dogs'' as
they perform runs on an agility-testing course. A PoleCam was used
to film underwater shots during the fishing coverage, and an
accelerometer, which is similar to a seismograph used in measuring
earthquakes, will be used for timing and scoring many of the timber
events.
</P>
<P>
   The accelerometer was created by ESPN and is said to be more
accurate for measuring the exact moment chopping begins and ends
and feeds the results into the scoring and production computers.
</P>
<P>
   Other special effects were accomplished by placing cameras
beneath the archery targets to show incoming arrows, in a
low-flying plane where announcer Jerry McKinnis interviews bass
fishermen over a cell phone, and one mounted atop the 120-meter ski
jump tower at Lake Placid for scenic shots.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-person team of announcers will provide insight for the
Games. The team includes Mark Malone, a former NFL quarterback who
has worked with ESPN since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors were chosen from accomplishments in their
categories, and a few earned berths through special try-out
sessions, said Robert Massey of Fort Worth, who was invited to
compete in the rifle competition but was forced to cancel due to
business obligations. Texas is represented by 12 competitors,
including Laura Yarbrough of Dallas, who has entered her dog in the
sporting dogs event, the Top Dog Racers team of Dallas, and Scott
Robertson of Flower Mound in the shotgun shooting event.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers will have two types of competition, fly fishing and bass
fishing. Twelve fly fishermen will earn a berth to a one-fish
tournament through fly casting competition on the Ausable River.
Likewise, 10 bass anglers fishing on Oseetah Lake will compete to
capture a spot in the five-angler finals field to see who can catch
the largest bass.
</P>
<P>
   The bass-fishing event carries the largest purse at $21,000,
with $5,000 going to the winner. Other first-place prizes average
between $2,000 and $3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pro bass anglers will be Keith Green, top money winner
of the Wal-Mart FLW Tour, and Randy Howell, runner-up for the 1999
FLW Angler of the Year. Terry and Windy Gunn, fishing guides on the
Colorado River at the head of the Grand Canyon, will be among the
fly anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting dogs will have five events where the canines will run,
jump, slide and retrieve. Eight contests will test men and women
for endurance, wood chopping and climbing, plus target competition
for archers, rifle shooters and shotgunners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be creative and keep presenting things that
capture people's attention, because people's attention spans have
gotten so short and the remote is always in their hand,'' Nagle
said. ``So the idea is to create something they haven't seen
before, and people haven't seen the Great Outdoor Games before.''

RAP-CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 OF SLAIN RAPPER SPEAKS AT KANSAS CITY CONFERENCE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The mother of slain rapper Notorious B.I.G.
defended graphic rap lyrics during a speech Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Voletta Wallace _ whose son Christopher Wallace was killed in a
1997 drive-by shooting in Los Angeles _ addressed an audience of
about 30 mostly young persons at Christ Temple Pentecostal Church
in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The graphic violence and profanity found in some rap lyrics, she
said, simply mirrors the harsh life some rappers have escaped.
Focusing attention on this violent world, she said, is one way to
recognize that a problem exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rapper has nothing to do with this,'' Wallace said. ``He's
just telling you what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's speech was one of several events that took place
during a two-day conference that began Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The conference brought together local rap artists, community
activists and politicians to discuss strategies for giving young
people alternatives to drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who received a proclamation from Mayor Kay Barnes
before her speech, said that rap lyrics can provide a launching pad
for exploring some of those alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``(These artists) are asking us to change,'' she said. ``They're
saying, `Help me, help my street corner. Because if you don't, I'm
going to talk about it.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Wallace's son did. Notorious B.I.G., who also went
by the moniker Biggie Smalls, used his music to depict a life of
drugs and crime, of dodging bullets and of living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Those lyrics, though, fueled the controversy about whether rap
music like his actually promoted violence and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace doesn't think it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not put down the art,'' she said. ``Let's not put down
the person. Let's stop the problem.''

Spellman amazed by altered image 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ Mention defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman's name
to anyone on the Cowboys, and you'll likely get a smile followed by
a lengthy narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has a feel-good story about Spellman, who seemingly
has gone from outcast to savior in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the Cowboys took a wait-and-see approach when he
joined the team during the 1999 training camp, Spellman is being
hailed as a team leader, a role model and a key to any success the
Cowboys hope to have on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is certainly not lost on the deeply religious
Spellman. However, just thinking about his altered image can render
him speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss for words ... I've changed a great deal in the
last year,'' he said softly.
</P>
<P>
   Raising his head after a practice recently at Midwestern State
University, Spellman, 28, continued: ``I do see a difference and
feel a difference of the perception of myself to other people. I
don't get that scared look anymore. I get a smile, and that's a
good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another good thing is that the mountainous Spellman is finally
smiling back.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 292-pounder says he was in control of his problems
when he joined the Cowboys a week into training camp last year. A
six-year stint with the Chicago Bears ended in the spring of 1998
after a string of emotional incidents relating to what was
diagnosed as bipolar disorder. Spellman sat out the 1998 season,
and says he even contemplated suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A religious rebirth and confidence in the support programs laid
out by the Cowboys' behavioral department paved the way for his
return to football.
</P>
<P>
   However, Spellman said he also was somewhat skeptical about the
future when he took the field for the first time last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was smiling when I got here,'' Spellman said. ``It was
just under a whole lot of problems. So I had kind of a half-smile
last year. This year, I'm grinning like a Cheshire cat. It's a
great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow defensive tackle Chad Hennings says Spellman's new
outlook is evident in his play and how he interacts with teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alonzo is a much different person this year,'' Henning said.
``He is totally at ease. He's come out of his shell and bonded with
the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman's personal redemption, however, is only part of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the former defensive end is ready to build on a
successful transition to tackle. He supplanted former Pro Bowl
standout Leon Lett in the starting lineup last year and is billed
by the Cowboys as an All-Pro candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman also is using his experiences as a learning tool for
others, an even greater part of his story. Second-year defensive
end Dimitrius Underwood, whose troubled rookie season included
being released by two teams and a suicide attempt, joined the
Cowboys largely because of Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk almost every day,'' said Underwood, who also has
bipolar disorder. ``A lot of his past is similar to what I went
through and what I'm going through. He tells me how to deal with
it. He's been a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Spellman's leadership, however,
is not limited to helping Underwood. He said Spellman's work ethic
and play on the field is worthy of emulation by all of the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it warms his heart every time he thinks about how far
Spellman has come in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were unbelievable early days this time last year in camp
for Alonzo,'' Jones said. ``It was quite a struggle for him, coming
off a huge layoff, plus dealing with the challenges he was having,
plus being around new people, the skepticism, the whole nine yards.
But he's stepped up here and gained the respect of everybody. He
ought to be a leader. I'm proud of how far he's come.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jones said it all with a smile. nn

MEMORIAL FOR COVERDELL: SAYING GOODBYE TO A QUIET MAN WHO GOT
THINGS DONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The political elite of Washington and Georgia paid
tribute here on Saturday to Sen. Paul Coverdell as an ordinary man
with extraordinary people skills and political talents who got
things done.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, who died Tuesday at age 61, was a quietly influential
member of the Republican leadership. An ally and friend of
President George Bush, Coverdell was the chief liaison in the
Senate to the presidential campaign of Bush's son, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Governor Bush and more than 50 senators and
representatives from both parties _ including Sens. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the majority leader, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat
of Massachusetts _ joined 900 other mourners in an emotional
memorial to a man who defied the bitter political partisanship that
grips the Capitol today. President Bush did not attend, but his
tribute was read by a family friend of the Coverdells in the packed
Peachtree United Methodist Church in the fashionable Buckhead
section of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved politics and was a clear example of politics being a
noble calling,'' President Bush wrote. ``He leaves behind a legacy
that quiet is good, caring about the other guy matters.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day of celebrating Coverdell's life, even the fevered pitch
of the presidential campaign was temporarily laid aside. Before and
after the service, Governor Bush declined to comment on reports
that Dick Cheney, the former secretary of defense, had risen to the
top of his list of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers attending the service, including other Republican vice
presidential candidates like Fred Thompson of Tennessee and John
McCain of Arizona, were whisked to waiting cars or buses. But one
Senate Republican, Mike DeWine of Ohio, said a Bush-Cheney ticket
this fall would be a winning combination. ``Dick Cheney has got
what it takes,'' DeWine said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the legislators and other family members and friends of
Coverdell here Saturday declined to talk politics, focusing instead
on the unpretentious former backbencher in the Georgia State Senate
who rose to the fourth-ranking position in the Senate Republican
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Rodbell, an Atlanta businessman and longtime friend of
Coverdell, recalled that the senator hated anyone making a fuss
over him, and took umbrage that his job might earn him favors from
constituents or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Inside and outside the church, former colleagues remembered a
self-effacing man and tireless worker who pushed for issues he
believed in, from education vouchers to aid to help Colombia fight
drug traffickers, without caring who received the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sweet, selfless, loyal, caring, courageous, and _
incredibly for a United States senator _ humble,'' Sen. Phil Gramm,
a Texas Republican, said in his eulogy. Coverdell's efforts to help
and get things done crossed partisan lines. Gov. Roy Barnes of
Georgia, a Democrat, said that when he joined the Georgia state
Senate as a 26-year-old legislator, Coverdell took him under his
political wing, even though he was the leader of the chamber's
Republicans. It was a friendship that lasted more than a
quarter-century, with the two men having breakfast regularly,
Barnes said. ``He showed that people of different parties could
discuss their personal strengths and weaknesses,'' Barnes said, his
voice catching while giving his eulogy. ``I never worried that Paul
would disclose anything I said.'' Under Georgia law, Barnes has the
authority to appoint an interim successor to Coverdell's Senate
seat until a special election is held on Nov. 7. He is expected to
announce his choice in the next few days.

MOKESKI DENIES ALLEGATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The lawyer for former NBA player and Crespi High
basketball player Paul Mokeski denied reports that Mokeski was a
regular drug user following his arrest for misdemeanor possession
of cocaine Thursday in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Mokeski vehemently denies the inflammatory reports
concerning the allegations regarding drug use,'' said his attorney,
Douglas Horn, in a prepared statement. ``While it has become
popular to convict professional athletes before all the facts and
evidence are known, to do so is irresponsible prior to the
conclusion of the legal process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Mokeski is confident that the legal process in Wisconsin
will be quickly resolved in a fair and just manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Mokeski could face a year in jail and a $5,000 fine if
convicted. Last year, he moved back to Southern California and was
an assistant coach at USC. He resigned in May to become head coach
of the Kansas City Knights of the new American Basketball
Association.

   HARRISON, N.J. _ I grew up on Pleasant Avenue, the wiseguy
capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   I was holding my father's hand on the summer morning when
Francis Ford Coppola and James Caan visited the old East Harlem
neighborhood to film a scene for the first ``Godfather'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   All the guys from the ``old man's club'' were out in their
skimpy T-shirts that morning, sipping cappuccino from plastic cups,
their diamond pinky rings glaring in a mean sun. Jimmy the Cat.
Vito the Bat. Patti Apples. Talk about filming on location.
</P>
<P>
   In the scene, Sonny Corleone, played by Caan, kicks the wise out
of his wiseguy brother-in-law. Casting agents on the set were
offering $50 to any kid who wanted to be an extra, asking them to
simply play in front of a fire hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are all my friends,'' I said. ``Dad, I wanna go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' my father said flatly.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, a gentleman who had earned the nickname Joey
Aggravation rushed over to my dad from the Pleasant Tavern and
shrieked, ``C'mon Frankie, let the kid go!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' my dad said again, squeezing my hand. ``You're not a
gangster.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the closest I ever got to being in a movie, especially
the kind of movie that romanticized the lifestyles of the kind of
people I grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 years later, I got in line for another part. I was one
of thousands who showed up at Harrison High School on Saturday for
a much-publicized casting call for the hit HBO series ``The
Sopranos,'' which happens to be my favorite.
</P>
<P>
   With several relatives in tow, I arrived at the high school at 9
a.m. to find that thousands of young, cigar-chomping men in muscle
T-shirts and women with tall hairdos and spiked heels were already
there, the dizzying smells of perfume and hair spray filling the
hot air.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Lt. Charles Trucillo of the Harrison Police
Department estimated, 4,000 or 5,000 people were already in line.
</P>
<P>
   Trucillo said 400 to 500 people had slept in front of the school
overnight to improve their odds of successfully dropping off their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Using the power of my connections _ my ID card from The New York
Times, where I work as a news assistant _ I broke ranks to
negotiate a better deal somewhere up the line.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for the right place to jump in, I spotted a large man in
a silk suit. His name was Lou Roca. Other than the fact that he was
wearing handcuffs to the casting call, and handing out business
cards with the words ``You Lookin' at Me?'' written in bold letters
across the front, he seemed like a harmless guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a problem with me standing here, pal?'' I asked with a
sly smile. ``I'm with the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Roca, who had made the trip from New Castle, Del., replied,
``Make me an offer I can't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can stand here if you get a message to Tony Soprano for
me,'' Roca said, referring to the lead character in the series,
played by James Gandolfini. ``Tell him I can help him with his
family problems. I can be on the muscle end of the family, the
fixer. I can make things go away.''
</P>
<P>
   By 9:45 a.m., the lines behind me had snaked down and around six
city blocks. I thought about my sister Donna, who could play
Carmela Soprano's dark-haired sister, waiting way back in line for
a chance that might never come.
</P>
<P>
   I know that feeling, which is why I worked out a the deal with
``Lou Rocks,'' as Roca refers to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 10:30, when the doors were scheduled to open, I made
my first contact, bumping into Henry Brunchtein, a co-producer and
production manager for ``The Sopranos.'' He explained the enormous
turnout for the hugely popular show, which recently garnered 18
Emmy nominations, about Tony Soprano, who copes with the problems
of everyday family life while struggling to maintain his status as
a mob boss in the suburbs of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was, we were going to do a casting call and
announce it in a couple of small papers, expecting maybe a thousand
people, but then it got picked up by Regis and Howard Stern, and we
started to get a lot of phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were calling us, saying they were flying in from other
parts of the country, and many of them slept here overnight. We got
a call from a guy from New Mexico who wanted directions to Harrison
from Newark Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time my conversation had ended with Brunchtein, the
crowds had swelled to nearly 20,000 people, eclipsing by 5,000 the
population of Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:45, I arrived at the steps of the school's gymnasium, and
as I began to head toward the casting directors _ men were in one
line, women in another _ I tapped into a few conversations some of
my would-be gangster friends were engaging in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break a leg,'' Joe Oliveto of Roosevelt Island, N.Y., said to
another man on his way to meeting a casting director.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' asked the man, unsure about Oliveto's remark. ``You
talking to me?''
</P>
<P>
   As I got closer to my second chance at the big time, I heard a
young assistant casting director, Jarred Bryant, ask a bald man
with a big belly, 40-ish, ``Are you in the business?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said the man, ``I'm in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What have you acted in?'' asked Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, not that business,'' said the man, smiling wide. ``I'm in
 &UR; the  &LR; business.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it was my turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any acting experience?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, no,'' I said shyly. ``But almost. Thirty years ago, I
...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, thanks, and maybe we'll give you a call,'' said Bryant,
dropping my 5 by 7 glossy and a brief information form into a large
pile.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping outside, I heard an HBO official shouting into a
bullhorn, telling all the men in silk suits, and all the women in
high heels and short skirts, that they were closing the doors, and
offering an address for those who had been unable to see a casting
agent to mail in their mini-bios.
</P>
<P>
   I worked my way back through the crowd, and went home.
</P>
<P>
   I told my wife that if Tony Soprano called, I had a message for
him.

<P>
   TRES ESQUINAS, Colombia _ The flood-swollen Orteguaza River
slices through the Colombian lowlands, its dirty brown water
straining at banks that give way to swampy clumps of thick forest
and patches of cleared land.
</P>
<P>
   Bright green coca plants and poppy fields dot many of the
clearings, verdant cash crops in a land of hunger and war.
</P>
<P>
   This remote territory in Colombia's far south has become ground
zero in the escalating conflict against narcotics traffickers, and
Marxist rebels who have tapped the drug trade as a major source of
revenue to fuel their 36-year-old insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the cocaine and heroine grown here is destined for the
United States, which recently approved a $1.3 billion aid package
to help Colombia fight its drug war. Colombian pilots will fly a
fleet of 60 U.S.-supplied helicopters, providing security and
transporting forces that will wipe out remote drug laboratories and
fumigate illicit crops from low-flying crop dusters.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the high-tech U.S. technology, the Amazonian
headwaters of southern Colombia are a primitive, hostile region.
There are few towns, fewer roads and thousands of square miles of
dense green growth perfect for hiding illegal operations _ and
enemies. The muddy brown streams are ideal for transporting
contraband.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rivers are the super highways here,'' said General Mario
Montoya, head of a new Colombian anti-narcotics task force. ``They
carry everything they need for the production of cocaine on those
rivers. Ten years ago, there was very little coca here, but today
this area has the highest concentration of coca production in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear the jungle _ and Colombia's tortured landscape of
leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitary groups, drug barons, a
questionable military and rancorous domestic politics _ may swallow
up the American aid, drawing the U.S. further into a quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made a profound and dramatic shift in focus from
supporting a police force in a friendly country to supporting an
army engaged in a civil war,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
shortly after Congress approved the aid package. ``I wonder how
long it will be until we read the first news story of some of this
equipment showing up in the hands of rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the dangers, Colombia's largest guerrilla
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, has
launched a coordinated series of attacks against rural towns and
villages since the U.S. aid package was approved.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla leaders warn that the stepped-up U.S. aid may threaten
the precarious peace process and trigger an intensified war.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insist the aid is strictly for fighting drugs,
not to help Colombia fight its civil war. But Montoya admits that
in the remote wilds, the two are often intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FARC, with all its guns and all its evil, is involved in
the drug trade,'' he said, referring to the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, the nation's largest and oldest guerrilla
group. ``If the guerrillas are involved in drug trafficking, as we
know they are, we're going to attack them.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, a nation of 39 million, supplies an estimated 80
percent of the world's cocaine. It is also a growing source of
heroin. Both drugs are worth billions on the streets of America and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There are no accurate figures on how much the country's
guerrillas gain by taking a cut from the poor farmers who grow the
crops and the traffickers who process and smuggle it, but some
Colombian newspapers have cited figures in the hundreds of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   With the guerrillas and drug lords so powerful, Colombian
President Andres Pastrana stunned the nation 18 months ago by
starting peace talks with the FARC. To show his goodwill, he
ordered Colombian troops out of a Switzerland-sized chunk of the
nation that has become de facto FARC territory.
</P>
<P>
   But the peace talks have since stumbled without much real
progress, and Pastrana's popularity has plummeted. Many Colombians
fear he has given the guerrillas too much without getting anything
in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guerrillas are terribly strong because they have so much
money from drug trafficking,'' said Eduardo Gomez, who retired from
the Colombian military and now works in Bogota, the capital. ``We
have no confidence in our institutions. The money from the U.S.
will be wasted, because our army, our police and our government are
corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimates on FARC strength range from 17,000 to 22,000 soldiers
in the field, but they are only one of the warring forces in
Colombia. Another guerrilla group, the Army of National Liberation
or ELN, has some 5,000 soldiers, while right-wing paramilitary
groups, which also take tribute from drug traffickers, have an
estimated 7,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's military _ the army, air force and navy _ has about
120,000 personnel. It also has a reputation for corruption and
human-rights abuses, with many observers citing close ties between
army officers and the paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has named his bold new strategy for saving the country,
``Plan Colombia.'' The U.S. aid - which will mostly fund military
equipment, but also provides money for crop substitution and other
social programs _ will be supplemented by more than $600 million
for social programs that Pastrana recently obtained from European
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his four-year term in office, however, Pastrana
has been hamstrung by a corruption scandal and bitter relations
with the national congress. He recently appealed to Colombians to
be more positive, saying, ``I'm tired of the bad news that does not
let us see and construct a better country for all.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will take more than a positive attitude to vanquish
Colombia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that Plan Colombia will escalate the war on both
sides,'' said Marco Alberto Romero, a political scientist at
Colombia's National University. ``If the guerrillas resist this
first campaign, the logic will be that the U.S. will increase its
aid and become more committed to the Colombian conflict. It's a
very complicated problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero believes the focus should be on providing more
opportunity for the rural peasants who grow the coca and poppy. The
peasants now have no alternatives, and wiping out their only cash
crop by fumigation could foul the environment, sicken the poor
farmers and create a new wave of internal displacement within
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have regional consequences,'' he said. ``The drug
trafficking affects the whole Andean region. This could lead to the
breakdown of the peace talks in Colombia, but also could trigger an
arms race. Already both (the FARC and the government) are building
up their forces even as they are participating in the peace
talks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the front lines, Gen. Montoya downplays the criticism and
confidently predicts victory.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent briefing for reporters complete with slides,
tapes of radio conversations among drug traffickers and maps laying
out the alignment of forces, Montoya said the new U.S. aid _
especially a fleet of about 30 sophisticated Blackhawk helicopters
_ will tip the balance in favor of his 3,000-man force in the
southern region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get the helicopters, we can really go to work,'' he
said. ``They will give us the element of surprise and mobility. We
will move in and immediately neutralize the crops.''
</P>
<P>
   Boats patrolling the rivers to intercept cocaine shipments, as
well as the supplies of gasoline, cement and chemicals needed to
convert the coca leaves into cocaine will augment the force.
</P>
<P>
   The only role for U.S. troops _ no more than a few hundred at
the time _ will be to train the Colombian pilots and soldiers, and
help operate sophisticated surveillance equipment the U.S. will
send, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   There are reports that the guerrillas may have _ or will soon
obtain _ surface-to-air missiles or other advanced weapons to shoot
down the helicopters. Critics also warn that the drug farmers and
traffickers will simply move elsewhere once the Colombian offensive
picks up steam.
</P>
<P>
   But Montoya remains upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``These groups will try to defend their operations because there
is lots and lots of money involved in narco-trafficking,'' he said.
``But we're prepared militarily for this fight. We're in this for
the long haul.''

FALLING UNDER SCOTLAND'S SPELL

<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Tom Weiskopf returned to the home of
golf last week to take part in a past champions dinner and
four-hole tournament as a prelude to the 129th British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more accurately, Weiskopf was pulled back, a hopeless
romantic when it comes to the charm of golf in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   What was the appeal? Weiskopf had a long list of factors, from
the architecture that you see on strolls downtown, to the aura of
links golf, to the signs of rich history that are everywhere. But
most of all, said Weiskopf, he loves the people. He had noticed on
his first visit, in 1970, that they loved their golf and respected
its heritage, ``but they were pretty guarded with their applause.
Unless it's a really good shot, there's not a lot of applause.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove what he meant, he related the story he told at the
dinner Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a practice round at Carnoustie before the 1975 British
Open, which would be won by Tom Watson in a playoff against Jack
Newton. Late in the afternoon, Weiskopf was playing with Jack
Nicklaus, John O'Leary, and Newton when they came to the par-3
eighth. There weren't many spectators on the course, but as they
prepared to tee off, Weiskopf did notice two men sitting near the
green.
</P>
<P>
   Weiskopf tells the story:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a medium-length par-3, wind blowing real hard left to
right. Jack (Nicklaus) hit a very good shot, kind of turned it
right against the wind. The wind caught it and moved it sideways 15
feet. Beautiful shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I aimed at those two old gentlemen on the left side of the
green. I just said I'd start my ball right at them, try to turn it,
and see what happens. I did just that, the wind got it, knocked it
right down near the hole. Then I got there, and nothing. Just two
guys just sitting there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Where's my ball?' I looked in the bunker, my
ball's not in there. I walked over the green, but my ball's not
over the trees. I look around and Jack says, `Can you believe it?
Your ball's in the hole.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm standing by these two gentlemen, and I said, `Excuse
me, but did you see my shot?'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Yes, Laddie, we saw your shot.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `It was a hole-in-one. There was no response. You didn't even
clap.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Aye, Laddie, but it's only practice, isn't it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Weiskopf rocks with laughter. ``I'll never forget that as long
as I live,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On his fourth try at a British Open, in 1973, Weiskopf triumphed
at Royal Troon. It remains his most treasured memory. That victory
puts him in a special category over here, for former champions are
always beloved figures. Still, Weiskopf couldn't help notice that
as he did some Christmas shopping in the tented village the other
day, the spectators pretty much left him alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they respected that I was shopping,'' said Weiskopf.
``They're great people.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another Scotland story that tickles Weiskopf, arising
from a few casual holes of golf at St. Andrews one evening years
ago. Weiskopf, Nicklaus, and others were commuting from St. Andrews
to the Open venue, so after dinner they decided to go out and play.
Weiskopf told the others he would join them after a phone call, and
in his rush to catch up, he went to the only set of tees from which
he had ever hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laddie, excuse me,'' came a voice from the side of the first
tee. ``That is reserved for championship play only.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiskopf was dumbfounded. ``You're telling me that Jack Nicklaus
hit from there?'' said Weiskopf, pointing to the other set of tees.
The man nodded his head, so Weiskopf relented and moved to those
tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laddie, your ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My ticket?'' said Weiskopf, again dumbfounded. ``I'm a former
British Open champion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Weiskopf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any proof?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It says so right there on my bag,'' said Weiskopf, by now
exasperated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had that one pulled on me before,'' said the starter, by
now a winner in the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Weiskopf paid his green fees and went on his way, forgetting
about the starter until the next year when he was out hitting balls
at Royal Birkdale on a cold, raw night in preparation for the Open.
Out of the corner of his eye he noticed the starter he had
encountered at St. Andrews. The man explained he had taken vacation
time just to come watch Weiskopf.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think about that,'' Weiskopf reflected. ``Here's a guy just
doing his job. Can't hit from that tee. Gotta need a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exhibition of greatness
</P>
<P>
   The past champions four-hole exhibition Wednesday proved a huge
hit, with fans and players alike genuinely getting a kick out of
it. Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   --Sam Snead, at 88 the oldest living winner, said he can't see
his golf ball once it goes more than 50 yards, so he definitely
didn't see his drive as it traveled dead-straight some 200 yards
down the first fairway. Coming over the Swilken Bridge at the 18th,
Snead did a little soft-shoe. Why? ``Oh, I've always loved music,''
said Snead.
</P>
<P>
   --Roberto de Vicenzo, remembered for his 1968 Masters gaffe and
not for his major triumph over Nicklaus in 1967, drove it pin-high
at the 357-yard closing hole. ``He turned it loose,'' said Watson,
smiling. Watson and Nicklaus _ eight British Open titles between
them _ were paired with de Vicenzo, which thrilled the proud
77-year-old Argentine. ``It would be nice today, tomorrow, any
day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   --Ian Baker-Finch, one of the true gems in the game, finished
with birdies at the par-4 17th and par-4 18th, no small feat for a
guy who walked away from the game after a mysterious loss of skill.
``I hung on to the drive at the first a little bit and it went a
little right,'' said Baker-Finch, who now works for ABC. He won the
British Open in 1991, but a few years later he couldn't even keep
his opening drive in-bounds at St. Andrews's first hole, which has
a fairway wide enough for a pair of 747s. His story was sad, but
there was a smile on his face as he took part in the exhibition.
``I felt a lot more comfortable than I did in, say, 1996-97,'' said
Baker-Finch, who would like to come back and play a few PGA Tour
events next year. Is that possible? He did birdie 17 and 18
Wednesday, so more improbable things have happened. ``I am an
announcer now, but coming and playing occasionally and getting my
fix of tournament golf _ yeah, I would like to go do that.''
</P>
<P>
   --But a lowlight Wednesday was the story in a local tabloid
(which right away tells you about its validity) that said Arnold
Palmer had rejected an invitation to play in the exhibition because
he had not been extended the same rights for the regular
tournament. Former champions (Palmer won in 1961, '62) are exempt
until age 65, which for Palmer came in 1995, when he played right
here at St. Andrews. It made for an emotional farewell, the walk
over the Swilken Bridge leaving a most memorable photograph, no
doubt an experience that could never be duplicated. Palmer is
playing in this week's Senior PGA Tour event, and Hugh Campbell,
chairman of the British Open championship committee, denied that
Palmer had asked for (and been denied) entry into the British. ``He
never put it to us like that,'' said Campbell. ``He did (tell me
his reasons), but I think some of that was a little private for me
to want to comment on.''

   Butch Harmon was at a book signing recently when he noticed a
man selling golf memorabilia, among them an old gutta-percha ball.
``Actually, a replica,'' said Harmon, who was intrigued by the
hard, rubber-coated ball. Harmon bought the ball and for a few
laughs tossed it to Tiger Woods during a practice round Tuesday.
``He hit it a few times,'' said Harmon, ``but then played it for
the entire ninth hole,'' a par 4 of 352 yards. ``He hit his drive
(with his regular ball) to the edge of the green, then hit the
gutta-percha well behind it. I stepped it off _ 113 yards
shorter.'' Woods played a 5-iron into the pin, 125 yards away,
``but he had too much club,'' said Harmon, laughing. ``He probably
should have hit 7.'' Still, Woods got the gutta-percha up-and-down
from behind the green to save par . . . Jean Van de Velde on his
Ryder Cup experience last fall: ``I really enjoyed the atmosphere
and the battle of it, but I didn't enjoy the fact that I didn't get
to play, knowing I had qualified as one of 10 players. The players
who qualify should be assured that they are going to play and not
just in singles because they have to. What's the point in having a
qualifying system?'' . . . Weiskopf on the emotions he felt at the
past champions dinner: ``I think you would be hard-pressed to find
a group of people in sports with the compassion and respect that
golfers have for each other. And you could see that at that dinner,
you really could.'' . . . Brought to the St. Andrews interview
area, Snead looked at the crowd of reporters on the other side of
the barrier and asked: ``Won't they let you in?''

BURKHART TOOK LONG, TOUGH ROAD TO MAJORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was lost in the wilderness, a discarded soul clinging to the
last strand of a tattered dream. Anyone who bothered to look deemed
Morgan Burkhart too short, too slow, too old, too second-rate to be
all he hoped: a big-league baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   With no fork left in his road to glory, Burkhart landed in the
early-morning swelter of a construction job in a Kansas City
warehouse. The kid who would have welcomed much less from baseball
than a Hall of Fame plaque was lugging steel. ``The worst thing,''
he said, ``was thinking I was all done, that I'd never take the
field again.''
</P>
<P>
   Think again. In a storybook tale of promise and perseverance as
remarkable as any, the castaway spent the next seven years
thrashing his way out of the darkness. He survived an attack of
killer bees on a baseball diamond in Colombia, endured two winters
of langourous bus rides in the Mexican outback, and labored four
long summers in the aptly named Frontier League, all in a quixotic
apprenticeship that delivered the promising slugger to the Red Sox
last month in their hour of need.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely in the 98 years since Piano Legs Hickman donned the Red
Sox colors has a player so obscure _ and with such a roundabout
resume _ achieved such a milestone. Burkhart all but fell out of
the sky to help rescue the Sox from a disastrous June slump and
keep them in playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   And to this day, his new boss, Sox manager Jimy Williams, eyes
his potential folk hero and wonders aloud, ``Who is that masked
man?''
</P>
<P>
   The hitter from nowhere is a child of Missouri's storied
Mississippi River valley, a 5-foot-10-inch Paul Bunyan, with a
lumberjack's arms and farm boy's grit. Until last month, when he
wheeled his aging Camaro into the players' parking lot at Fenway,
an area that glittered with custom-made Mercedeses and luxury SUVs,
Burkhart, 28, had never seen the bright lights of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He climbs into his uniform in the clubhouse an arm's length from
millionaires whose ascents to the big show were almost never in
doubt. And he is a world apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I was going to be here, especially when I
started getting older, 26, 27,'' he said last week in the dugout as
a soft rain fell before a game with the Montreal Expos. ``I said,
`No way, no one's going to want you.' That's not easy when all you
ever wanted to do was play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkhart seized a chance to trade his work boots for baseball
cleats in 1995 when someone suggested he try out for the Frontier
League, which he had never heard of. He said he did it for love of
the game. And no one who has watched him since then has doubted
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time he hit the field, you could see in everything he
did how much he loves and respects baseball,'' said Duke Ward, part
owner of the Richmond (Ind.) Roosters, where Burkhart toiled from
1995-98. ``If there is a soul on the planet who deserves this kind
of break, he's the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkhart worked for weeks to earn as much as he made his first
day in a Sox uniform (he is currently paid the Major League minimum
of $200,000). He rode in vans to play the Canton (Ohio) Crocodiles
and London (Ontario) Werewolves when the Roosters couldn't afford a
bus. And he scraped by on the league's top pay of $275 a week by
living with a ``host'' family and working as a substitute teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, he was making less than the paperboy,'' Ward
said. ``Now, he's reaffirming the dream for everyone else who is
still here.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Burkhart shunned warnings against playing winter
ball in Colombia because of the country's crime rate. ``It turned
out to be rough,'' he said, ``but the baseball was great.''
</P>
<P>
   His worst scare came on the field, when a swarm of killer bees
swooped in. Amid the frenzy, Burkhart escaped injury by heeding
cries from Colombians to dive to the ground because the bees
apparently don't attack that low. ``It was crazy,'' he said matter
of factly, as if all big-leaguers paid such dues.
</P>
<P>
   At every stop on his odyssey, Burkhart proved himself to his
peers, winning Most Valuable Player honors three straight years in
the Frontier League and last winter in the Mexican League. Indeed,
the Frontier League recently voted to rename its top prize The
Morgan Burkhart MVP Award.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, unlike the overwhelming majority of big-league players who
are drafted and nurtured through minor-league systems, Burkhart
went undrafted and never spoke to a scout until the Sox picked him
up in 1998 as an amateur free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the Sox never invited him to their big-league spring
training camp, despite his 35 home runs last year in their Single A
and Double A affiliates in Sarasota, Fla., and Trenton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But he kept thrashing. ``I just wanted to keep playing, hoping I
could make a living playing somewhere,'' he said. ``Luckily, I got
the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   His break came in February when the Red Sox, temporarily short
of players during spring training, summoned him from their minor
league camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first I heard of him, someone told me he was tearing up
the Mexican League,'' Williams said. ``But he came up that day in
Florida and hit a home run into the wind that just kept going and
going. I said to myself, `My goodness.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Trot Nixon, Boston's starting right fielder, injured his
hamstring last month, the Sox sent for Burkhart from Triple A
Pawtucket. Since then, despite his shortcomings as a fielder and
baserunner, Burkhart has won over many of his teammates with his
enthusiasm and respect for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so rare to see in a young player, that they appreciate
life in the major leagues,'' said Mike Stanley, who has more than
12 years of major league experience. ``So many kids come into the
league thinking they were destined to be here anyway, that it was
just a matter of when they got their shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all the wars he's gone through . . . This is all gravy
to him. This is the ultimate reward we shoot for, and he never
thought he'd get here.''
</P>
<P>
   He endured his worst outing in the majors last Thursday, when he
went hitless and struck out five times in a day-night doubleheader
against the Baltimore Orioles. Still, in 19 games with the Sox
going into Saturday, he has knocked in 15 runs, hit two homers, and
posted a .444 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even now, he remains a mystery to many in baseball. In
Baltimore, the giant scoreboard identified him as ``Morgan'' rather
than ``Burkhart.''
</P>
<P>
   But anonymity means little to a man whose lost years could
define obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   He still lives in the shadows of the Sox luminaries, listening
to Metallica as he drives home after a game to a cut-rate hotel in
Boston, while his teammates motor home to their gated suburban
enclaves and pricy downtown condos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he counts his blessings. ``The hard times were good for
me,'' Burkhart said. ``It makes me appreciate everything I have.
Every day I get to play baseball is another day I'm not (working
construction).''
</P>
<P>
   In the mercurial world of baseball, Burkhart's job may always be
in jeopardy. His first scare could come as early as this week when
Nixon returns. But Williams, in a game where business almost always
trumps emotion, seems to have a place in his heart for his rookie
from the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be fine,'' Williams said. ``He's done a great job for
us. I may not know where he came from, but I'm sure glad he's
wearing a Red Sox uniform.''

ARMSTRONG WILL BE CYCLING FOR OLYMPICS

   TROYES, France _ It's obvious Lance Armstrong is becoming
attached to the color yellow. He's expected to win the winner's
yellow jersey in the Tour de France when the race ends in Paris
Sunday, and hopes to keep the color theme going this fall in the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Amstrong is looking forward to that return. He went in 1992 as
an amateur and didn't medal, and again to Atlanta in 1996, when he
finished 12th in the road race and sixth in the time trial;
surprisingly disappointing results after a successful summer of
racing. But what was more surprising is that three months later
Armstrong was diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   So now, after chemotherapy, an eventual clean bill of health,
and an expected two Tour victories, Armstrong is ready to go back
to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it just goes to show that what your mind doesn't know
really doesn't affect you so much,'' Armstrong said of his naivete
in Atlanta. But he said he's eager to ride the time trial in
Sydney, ``because it's a race I think I can be competitive in.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States can send a team of five to compete on the
road, two of whom will ride the time trial.
</P>
<P>
   The track team has been announced, but the road team will be
finalized Aug. 1. Three of the five definites are Armstrong, who is
the top-ranked American in international racing points; George
Hincapie, the highest-ranked American in World Cup points; and
Antonio Cruz, who won the road time trials last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Other hopefuls at the Tour include Tyler Hamilton (from
Marblehead, Mass.), who was an alternate for the 1996 team; Fred
Roridguez, who won the US Pro Championship last June has taken
third and fourth place in two Tour stages, and Frankie Andreu, who
finished fourth in the '96 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong will ride in the road race: ``I told George (Hincapie)
that I'll do everything for him, but will concentrate on the time
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think focusing on the time trial is going to be the smartest
thing I can do,'' he said, noting that the training regime involves
shorter workouts. ``It won't be seven-hour days, but four-hour
days.''
</P>
<P>
   US coach Jim Ochowicz, who is here watching the Tour, wouldn't
say who the favorites are to fill the last two spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one overwhelming person,'' said Ochowicz. ``We're
lucky it's a hard decision, though, and I think we're going to have
a strong team no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Ochowicz said that Armstrong's presence should give the US an
automatic gold in the time-trial race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real no-brainer,'' said Ochowicz after watching the
American blow past everyone in Friday's time trial.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Armstrong said he has mixed feelings about Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a gold medal would be very special, one of the
highlights of my career,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, after the summer he has spent on the
podium, with more racing to go next month, he's being cautiously
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to speak about it right now because I'm so caught up
in the Tour, and afterward I'll be caught up in trying to recover
from this Tour physically and mentally,'' he said. ``So it's going
to be tricky to finish here, to try and recover, go back down, then
go back up for a race six or seven weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tour drains you so much, physically and mentally, that
it's going to be hard to rally, but it is a big goal. I've been
twice, and the last two times were disappointments. I'd prefer it
was in August, but I'm not going to sit at home.''
</P>
<P>
   But why go to Sydney if the Tour is so draining?
</P>
<P>
   The rider in the yellow jersery just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I think I can win.''

   GURNEE, Ill. _ Their birthdays are nine days apart, and if they
both win Sunday, they'll have each won three of their last four
major tournaments for their gender. But Karrie Webb and Tiger Woods
have been in the same group only once and, as Webb put it, ``that's
about all the contact I've ever had with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is dangerous to compare genders, it must be noted how
long Webb hits the ball off the tee, how she was over the 522-yard,
par-5 eighth hole here at Merit Club in two shots Friday, and how
resolute her approach is to winning golf. Similarities abound.
</P>
<P>
   But more important to Webb as she heads into the final round of
the 55th US Women's Open with a four-shot lead is that this would
be her first Open win after four failed and frustrating attempts.
And . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win, you know,'' said the 25-year-old Australian, ``I
have enough points to be in the LPGA's Hall of Fame. And that is,
you know, my ultimate career goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Already.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's 4-under 68 Saturday, putting her at 209 and 7 under for
the first three rounds of the Open, left only her and Meg Mallon
(213, 3 under) with below-par scores for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But all that was overshadowed by the pain in Betsy King's back.
</P>
<P>
   King threw out her back on her tee shot on the second hole. The
courage the 44-year-old displayed from then on was remarkable. She
completed her round despite every shot from then on feeling, she
said, ``like a knife going through my back.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain for King was both physical and emotional.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA even took mercy, allowing her to take a five-minute
break between the fifth and sixth holes to enable the LPGA's
doctor, Dr. Keith Kennedy, to apply therapeutic balm, give her a
massage, and dispense painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the USGA abandoned its usual strictness on slow play and
allowed King and playing partner Mallon to fall farther and farther
behind the group in front of them, as King had difficulty merely
walking from green to tee.
</P>
<P>
   On the 14th tee, for instance, after a short walk from the 13th
green, she collapsed to the grass and writhed in agony before
rising to hit her tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know about it until the third green,'' said Mallon, a
close friend of King's. ``She came up and said, `My back went out.'
I hadn't heard anything. All I knew was that it took an awful long
time for her to walk to the third tee. Then she said it was like a
knife going through her back every time she was going through her
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, on the sixth tee, ``she was taking Advil and her father,
who's a doctor, was walking with her, and he was giving her
Tylenol,'' recalled Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called me by another name. I said, `Betsy, you'd better
stop taking those drugs.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The pain was emotional, too. King fired a brilliant 70 Friday,
putting her only one stroke behind Mallon, the leader. This may
have been her last chance to win a major. ``Hopefully, there'll be
other chances,'' a resolute King said through clenched teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll be able to play (the next round) or not,
but if I can, I will be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, said Mallon, ``that was the bravest performance
I've ever seen on a golf course.'' King parred the first two holes
Saturday but, after her back went out, she could only wince through
a 10-over round of 82.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, meanwhile, seems close to stamping herself as the world's
best women's golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to talk to myself every now and then, try to calm
myself down so I don't get too far ahead of myself,'' she said. ``I
just have to think of the shot at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with her brilliant round, Webb's lead over Mallon had
dropped to two strokes over the Natick, Mass., native when Webb
bogeyed the 17th hole and Mallon, in the group behind but three
holes in arrears, birdied the 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, though, chose the wrong time to hit what she called ``my
only bad drive of the day.'' The ball landed in the rough. ``When I
got to it, it looked like somebody stepped on it twice and then
threw some grass on it,'' she said. Mallon went rough-to-rough with
her shots, ending up with a double bogey. ``Now I have to come out
and be aggressive since I'm down four and not just down two,'' she
said of Sunday's play.
</P>
<P>
   No other golfers are within seven strokes of Webb. It's possible
Webb just may step away from this field as Woods has stepped away
from some men's fields. But, cautioned Webb, nobody should get
carried away with any comparisons to Woods, even if their birthdays
are nine days apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 25,'' she said with a laugh. ``I'm actually a year older
than Tiger. So, you know, I'm getting over the hill.''

   TROYES, France _ One day to go. After 20 races in 22 days, and
more than 3,500 miles around the country, the Tour de France is
almost over.
</P>
<P>
   And when the 128 remaining riders roll in Paris Sunday
afternoon, Lance Armstrong of Texas should take home the yellow
jersey for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to be careful,'' he said Saturday. ``It's still
a stage, it still counts, it's still official, and I'll still not
be convinced of victory until I finish the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even though Armstrong wouldn't jinx the win by assuming
it's all over, only a disaster on the ride around Paris Sunday
would cause him to stop pedaling and affect his six-minute lead
over German Jan Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   As the riders made their way on the 158-mile, rolling course
that finished here in the Champagne region, none seemed inclined to
exert themselves more than necessary. It was the longest stage in
this year's Tour.
</P>
<P>
   French rider Francois Simon, who lives near the finish, went out
in front two-thirds of the way into the race and gained a
one-minute lead on the pack. But he was soon joined by two others,
and all three eventually were caught by the pack.
</P>
<P>
   With less than 2 miles to go, the cyclists came swarming into
town and jockeyed for position. Germany's Erik Zabel edged
Australian Robbie McEwen in the sprint finish with the rest of the
pack just behind them. It was only fitting for Zabel, who wears the
green jersey (worn by the rider with the most sprint points earned)
for the fifth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Americans George Hincapie and Fred Rodriguez (who wears the
stars-and-stripes jersey as national champion) were in the final
sprint, but they and the first 100 riders were given ``same time''
as Zabel, and the overall standings didn't change.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong could only smile and shake his head when asked about
having one more day to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel really good, but I think everybody is relieved that
the race is almost over,'' he said. ``Three weeks is a long time to
race a sports event, whether you finish in first place or 101st
place. But it's nice to finish, and it's nice to finish hopefully
in yellow.''

   Few could understand why the team was so infatuated with
Croshere _ more than one individual pointed to chairman of the
board Paul Gaston as the prime mover _ and fewer still could fathom
how the Celtics could pull it off, assuming it was even possible.
</P>
<P>
   You want Croshere? The same Croshere who averaged 10.3 points a
game in his ``breakout'' season after appearing in 53 games his
first two years? The same Croshere who has trouble defending
forwards? Then be prepared to say goodbye to Antoine Walker or Paul
Pierce. There's no other way he comes to Boston unless he pulls a
financial nutty and accepts the $2.25 million exception.
</P>
<P>
   The only other option is a sign-and-trade deal. Indiana is on
record as not wanting to do that, but, if it comes to that, who are
they going to take? Walter McCarty? Calbert Cheaney? Donnie Walsh's
mother didn't raise a stupid son.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers and Walsh have long held a fascination with Walker,
evidenced by last summer's discussion about a deal for Dale Davis.
One league executive said that if Walker is involved, the deal will
likely be expanded to include the likes of Davis or Travis Best,
names we've heard in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you're Croshere, why would you want to go to a worse
situation made even more so by the departure of the team's best (or
second-best) player? Why would you leave a situation where you are
coming off a conference championship with some intriguing young
talent to add to the mix? Unless you detest new coach Isiah Thomas,
there's no logic in the move.
</P>
<P>
   It's all well and good that the Celtics have an interest in
Croshere. But you have to wonder what they're thinking considering
they have to know what it would take. Rick Pitino is on record as
not wanting to trade Walker, not wanting to break up the nucleus
and trying to win with what he has.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of Croshere tells us that he may have something very
different in mind. In this case, different might be better. But it
also may be worse. Not one executive I talked to would trade Walker
for Croshere and I wouldn't either. Others would have to be
included to make any such deal work, but those two would be the
keys.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are in desperate need of tough defenders and no one
would classify Croshere in that category. Tariq Abdul-Wahad? Fine.
Bobby Jackson? Fine. Haywoode Workman? Fine. Throw a couple of
those guys into the existing mix and maybe you have a playoff
contender. Blow it all up _ again _ and, well, good luck.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The future looks bright
</P>
<P>
   Orlando has been The Place for free agents so far and it will
definitely be The Place for future NBA stars for the next 10 days.
What's being called ``The Super Showcase'' is underway, featuring
32 elite AAU teams from across the land. Starting Tuesday, there
will be a six-day, Olympic-style tournament for national AAU teams
that have qualified (Leo Papile's BABC is one of them). What does
this mean? It means that every NBA team will have at least one
scout there and many, many eyes will be on three lads: Eddy Curry,
Tyson Chandler, and Kwame Brown. Curry is a flat-out monster from
Illinois who is being projected as a possible No. 1 pick in next
year's draft. Chandler, from California, has drawn comparisons to
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, although one scout likened him more to Richard
Washington, still not too shabby. Brown, who is from Georgia, is
another beast (6-10) who has committed verbally to the University
of Florida. ``This is probably going to be the last time these guys
will be seen in a challenging environment,'' said Papile. ``Once
high school starts, most of these guys are men against boys. The
games are blowouts and they're not challenged. This will be
different.'' Another high schooler to watch is Ousmane Cisse, a
Senegalese power forward/center who is playing for perennial
powerhouse Oak Hill in Virginia this season. Throw in some college
freshmen who could turn pro next year (Eddie Griffin, Gerald
Wallace, Alton Ford) and you could have a very young class next
season. One interesting tidbit: John Calipari has brought along
former Louisville/NBA player Milt Wagner to be his administrative
assistant at Memphis. Also coming to Memphis is Dajuan Wagner,
Milt's son, who is one of the most sought-after prep players in the
country. NBA people think the younger Wagner will spend, at most,
one season at Memphis . . . The Timberwolves think they have
assurances from Chauncey Billups that the ex-Celtics/Nuggets/Magic
guard will be in the Twin Cities next season. They see Billups as
more of a shooting guard than a point guard, although he should get
time at both positions. He's also hungry for a shot at the playoffs
after having had no luck in his first three years, the third one
lasting only a handful of games before shoulder surgery. Also,
impressive rookie Wally Szczerbiak had surgery on his right knee
last Wednesday to help secure his kneecap . . . Seattle is hoping
to retain Rashard Lewis, who is getting some serious attention from
Toronto. The capped-out Sonics are limited as to what they can pay,
but Lewis has said he would like to remain in Seattle. Coach Paul
Westphal seconds that emotion. ``He gets it,'' Westphal said of
Lewis. ``He's sensational as far as listening to coaches and being
respectful of the veterans. But he's also good enough to play. He
works on his game all the time. People say he came out of high
school. So what? He works on his game all the time.'' . . .
Speaking of Seattle, the Sonics may field the All-United Nations
team this season. In addition to holdovers Lazaro Borrell (Cuba)
and Vladimir Stepania (Georgia SSR), they've added two more
intriguing possibilities in Nigerian Olumide Oyedeji and
Argentinian Ruben Wolkowyski. Oyedeji was worked out extensively by
many teams before the draft, including Boston, and eventually went
to Seattle in the second round. Based on what we saw at
UMass-Boston, the kid can rebound and, well, not a lot else.
Wolkowyski is an interesting story. He speaks no English and,
according to Seattle general manager Wally Walker, has a chance to
make the squad. ``We plan to bring him in for our regular, veterans
camp,'' Walker said of the 6-10, 275-pound brute. Wolkowyski has
been a regular of Argentina's national teams for several years and
played this past season for A League champ Estudiantes de
Olivarria. Wolkowyski, 26, would be the first Argentinian to play
in the NBA . . . If you feel you're in need of some work on your
shooting, Celtics assistant coach Andy Enfield is holding a
one-week camp next month at Milton Academy. The camp is for boys
and girls, from grades 4-12, and is being held Aug. 7-11 from 8:30
a.m. to noon. For information, call 703-536-9026.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too long a courtship
</P>
<P>
   The official courtship period for free agents still has eight
days to run. Most GMs polled last week think the league should cut
back the time to two weeks. ``It makes the summer long for
everyone,'' said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. Added Nets general
manager John Nash, ``They could probably cut it back, although the
way they have it now, it eliminates all the talk about teams
contacting agents before the deadline.'' Celtics GM Chris Wallace
is wondering what's going to come of his summer. ``From the end of
the season until the end of June, you're consumed with the draft,''
he said. ``Then the month of July is for going after free agents
and having summer camps. And then you have August where you still
have to go after free agents and sign them.'' A period ending July
15 would make sense, provided, of course, that the league can go
through the books to get a salary cap figure for the upcoming
season . . . Agent Bill Duffy was on hand during the summer league
to witness a few of his clients, but one of them, Speedy Claxton,
was a no-show due to a hamstring injury. Duffy also represents free
agent point guard Anthony Carter and says he feels Carter will stay
with the Heat for the $1.2 million exception . . . The Celtics and
any other team with a rookie entering his third season have until
Oct. 31 to trigger a clause in the contract that will keep the
player signed through Year 4. In Pierce's case, he will
automatically get a 27.5 percent bump over his Year 3 salary ($1.6
million) that would put him at a still-underpaid $2.05 million in
2001-02. The same scenario holds true for Vince Carter, although he
gets a 26.5 percent raise. If a team does not exercise that right,
the player becomes a free agent . . . Here's a free agent guard no
one is talking about: J.R. Rider. And for good reason. ``This
summer, he could have made $50 million and I know because I would
have been the one who gave it to him,'' said Atlanta president Stan
Kasten. ``He was a borderline All-Star when he wanted to be and
when he was, we were a pretty good team.'' But that wasn't nearly
enough and, after umpteen transgressions, the Hawks finally
released him. ``Lenny Wilkens gave him more rope than anyone else
and he still managed to hang himself,'' Kasten said of Rider. ``It
says something that (Rider) couldn't get it done despite playing
for Lenny and (GM) Pete Babcock, the two most decent people to hold
their respective positions in the league.'' . . . Danny Fortson got
a nice reception in Golden State when he worked out there Thursday.
The Warriors are interested in him at the $2.25 million exception
and, not wanting to buck the trend, had a uniform and a locker
nameplate with Fortson's name on it. Fortson said he liked all the
attention, but with Antawn Jamison scheduled to go back to power
forward, the issue of minutes is bound to arise . . . The $2.25
million exception that so many teams have this summer will increase
next summer to around $4 million, or, ahem, 108 percent of the
average player's salary . . . New Washington coach Leonard Hamilton
was on the sidelines for the Wizards games at UMass-Boston. Most
coaches let assistants do the dirty work in summer league, but
Hamilton (and Lon Kruger of Atlanta) were on their respective
benches. Longtime coach Johnny Bach (as in 50 years of coaching) is
on Hamilton's staff and, in the space of a few weeks, sees some
similarities to Doug Collins in terms of intensity and energy.
``Everyone around this man sees that aura of drive, impatience,
seeking perfection after one day,'' Bach said. ``That can overcome
a lot of things that have been obstacles in the past. But the
reality side of the NBA is that it doesn't happen that fast. You
have to attack the citadels to reach the summit, but it takes time.
You can't wear your heart on your sleeve or it will get torn off.
You can teach, encourage, and motivate, but you also have to have
an understanding that in this job, you can exhaust yourself.''

WOODS ROARS INTO SIX-SHOT LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Having shot a tidy 6-under-par 66 in
Saturday's third round of the 129th British Open at St. Andrews,
David Duval said he welcomed the opportunity to play Sunday in the
final pairing with Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to look him in the eye,'' said Duval, who should have
added that it also affords him a front-row seat to witness golf
history.
</P>
<P>
   That is the drama Woods has added to the festivities here,
because he posted his third straight scorching round _ a 67_200 _
that pushed him to 16 under and into a six-shot lead over Duval and
Thomas Bjorn (68). If he holds on _ and we're discussing a player
who has won 17 of 19 times he has enjoyed a 54-hole lead and who
last month won the US Open by a record-shattering 15 shots _ Woods
would become the youngest (24) of five players who have won the
career grand slam (the Masters, the US Open, the British Open, and
the PGA Championship).
</P>
<P>
   Pretty daunting stuff set on a stage that sits in the long, cold
shadows cast by stone buildings that have stood for centuries, but
Woods rarely gets caught up in such hype. Nor does he get rattled
when the leaderboard starts to shake, which is what happened on yet
another brilliantly bright, but windless Scottish day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that's going to happen. That's part of playing this
golf course, especially under these conditions,'' said Woods, who
watched Duval and Bjorn lead the charge into deeper red numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But after sending the gallery into a state of shock with a
three-putt at the par-4 second _ his first bogey in major
championship action since the third round of last month's US Open,
an unprecedented stretch of 63 holes _ Woods promptly birdied the
third to prove that all was well.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, all was well with others, too, as birdies were
going up at a dizzying rate. First move went to David Toms, Woods's
playing partner who birdied the second to get to 9 under, just one
off the lead. But he bogeyed the fourth, fell three back, and would
never get any closer, closing with a 71_207 to tumble seven behind,
tied for fourth with Loren Roberts (70) and Darren Clarke (68).
</P>
<P>
   Heading downwind at ``the loop'' of Old Tom Morris's old
playground, birdies were available.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, six behind to start, ripped two shots off par going out.
Bjorn went out in 34. Ernie Els, spotting five shots to Woods,
birdied Nos. 3, 5, 6, and when he made another at the par-4 ninth
he was out in 33. Steve Flesch, who trailed by just four shots
through 36 holes, birdied Nos. 5, 6, and 8 to entertain thoughts of
a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Good for them, said Woods, who patiently waited his turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get home in two on No. 5. You can drive (the par-4)
No. 10. You can drive (the par-4) No. 12, and get home (in two) on
14,'' said Woods. ``You're going to have to make some birdies.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did. At the 175-yard, par-3 eighth he stuffed a 6-iron to
inside of 2 feet, then nonchalantly hit his 9-iron approach to 15
feet at the par-4 ninth. Back-to-back birdies allowed him to turn
in 34, get to 13-under, and send a message to those ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the message shook them, because the charge quickly
stopped. Els, for instance, reached 10 under, very much in the
hunt, then slammed his drive into the gorse at the 312-yard par-4
12th. He took a drop, chipped poorly, three-putted, and came home
with nothing but pars to finish 70_208, tied for seventh with
Dennis Paulson (69), Tom Lehman (70), and Flesch, the lefthander
who got it to 10 under, only to fall back with a double bogey at
the par-4 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Of the pursuers, only Duval and Bjorn stayed steady. Duval, who
has not stepped into the winner's circle since March of 1999,
birdied the 18th to complete a backside 34 and arrive first at 10
under. Bjorn was next, his birdie at the 18th completing his third
straight sub-70 trip around this cherished layout. It's an
accomplishment that likely will go unrewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second is the first guy that loses,'' said the Dane, ``and it
certainly looks like somebody out there is playing golf on a
different planet from the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Woods. He cast a casual eye on the leaderboard as
he went around the loop, saw that the pursuit had cooled, and felt
like adding some breathing room. He did so by nearly driving the
12th, pitching to 2 feet, and making his third straight birdie on
that hole. He also birdied the par-5 14th for the third consecutive
day, and in between made his first birdie of the week on the par-4
13th.
</P>
<P>
   It added up to 16 under and total command. Right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite, because at the par-4 17th Woods made a serious
gaffe. ``I tried to hit about a 1-yard draw,'' he said of his
approach, ``and I was able to do that, but it started about 2 yards
left of where I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Horrors, particularly when he three-putted for his second bogey
of the tournament. But again he answered a bogey with a birdie,
converting a 10-footer at the 18th to push his lead back to six.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can swing the golf club like I have the last few days and
putt like I have,'' said Duval, whose back has been sore all week,
``I can show him I've got a little game going right now, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no disputing that. It's just that the game Woods
possesses is near-flawless and on target with history.

ON WATSON'S TO-DO LIST: WIN NO. 6 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Tom Watson took part in the past
champions exhibition Wednesday, but there was nothing ceremonial
about his spot in the main event. He knows it's a longshot, but he
still thinks he has what it takes to win a sixth British Open,
which would tie Harry Vardon's record.
</P>
<P>
   He really thinks, at 50, he can be competitive with the young
crowd?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``I just do.''
</P>
<P>
   His fifth British Open title came 17 years ago but Watson has
returned every July since in search of No. 6. It won't come this
year because Watson made too many mistakes Saturday on a course he
should play better. On a day when he said the course played
``easy,'' Watson spoiled a five-birdie effort by making bogey at
both par-5s, landing in bunkers that are essential to avoid, and
stumbling home in 38 to shoot 72. He's at level par 216 through 54
holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not good, is it?'' he said. ``It was fun for a while, but it
got ugly real quickly. I made quite a few errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson is the last player to win the US Open and British Open
back-to-back, a feat that could be matched Sunday by Tiger Woods.
No, said Watson, there was no letdown in 1982 coming off the
stirring Pebble Beach dramatics over Jack Nicklaus in the US Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't difficult at all,'' he said. ``All you are doing is
playing each week like it's a new week. That's the way you play the
game. You obviously play with confidence when you are playing well,
and after winning the US Open I was playing with enough confidence
to see me through.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in 1982, I was given the tournament. I didn't win the
tournament, Nick (Price) lost it.''

XFL SUITS THIS GRIZZLED BEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you think of football in Chicago, you think of lunch pails,
blue-collar players, blood and guts. It all fits. Dick Butkus _
tough-guy linebacker, and later actor, comedian, Miller Lite
pitchman _ is back in football, but not as a broadcaster or owner.
He's the head coach of Chicago's XFL franchise, which will make its
debut at Soldier Field in the dead of winter.
</P>
<P>
   If this is a sign of things to come for the XFL, league
mastermind Vince McMahon might have another empire on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have come back to any other city,'' said Butkus, a
wealthy man with a long resume of movie and TV roles. ``There's a
team in LA and I live in Malibu so that would have been great,
except I wouldn't have coached anywhere but Chicago. To me, that's
football.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what McMahon thought, too. The World Wrestling
Federation's head honcho is trying to mold a new brand of football
out of the old brand, and who personifies that more than Butkus,
not only one of the best linebackers of all time, but also one of
the most entertaining?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the things in this league are similar to when I
played,'' said Butkus, who retired after only nine seasons because
of a bad knee but still made it to the Hall of Fame in Canton,
Ohio. ``They don't call `in the grasp,' so you can hit the
quarterback. You can clothesline a receiver over the middle like I
used to do. No fair catches. These are things that I'm familiar
with. This is the football that I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Butkus has never been a head coach. He did have a clause in his
Bears contract that said he would be a player-coach, but that never
materialized. He also was up for the head job at his alma mater,
the University of Illinois, but the alumni backed off, he said,
because he lacked experience. Some might say that at 57 he's too
old to be starting out.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the Bears in 1973, Butkus spent 10 years as
color commentator for the team's radio broadcasts. Then came the
national exposure of his Miller Lite ``Tastes Great-Less Filling''
TV commercials. Soon people in the entertainment business began
calling and he was so busy doing TV and movies he couldn't breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Now football is his focus again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I've just dropped down from Mars,'' said Butkus.
``I've followed football. I have friends in the game still. People
ask me how I can be a head coach and I tell them, `It's not that
hard.' I had a chance to get into coaching in the late '60s. I knew
Marty Schottenheimer, who was in Detroit, and he wanted to bring me
in. But then I heard he'd moved six or seven times in eight years,
and I didn't want that. I didn't want to move my family around. I
just did the games on radio and would come back to Chicago. Then,
after the Miller Lite stuff, I started going in a different
direction and my life took me away from (football).''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's back in the game he played so hard, the question
is, how will he coach? Can any of his players live up to Butkus's
desire for intensity and hard work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are kids out there who still work hard,'' he
said. ``We do live in a society where people try to work the least
and make the most, but there are still players out there who work
hard. That's all I'll ever ask of them.''
</P>
<P>
   How about all the film work and 18-hour days coaches put in?
``What are you doing in 18 hours? Come on. I think some of these
guys say it just to justify what they do. No, I won't have people
sleeping overnight at the stadium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he will assemble his staff. XFL teams are allowed six
coaches, including two coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a set philosophy on offense and defense,'' Butkus
said. ``When I pick the guys, we'll work together toward putting
that together. We'll have fun and we'll be serious. I've always
thought football was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing about his sideline demeanor: Butkus and the other XFL
coaches will wear microphones, so ``I'll have to learn how to clean
up my language.''
</P>
<P>
   Butkus enters the profession without what he calls ``coaching
baggage.'' In other words, he doesn't have cronies or people he's
promised jobs to. He said the league will give him a pool of
coaches to choose from and he'll go from there. But there are a lot
of things he'll have to get used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sang the national anthem during the seventh-inning (stretch)
at Wrigley the other day and it brought back a lot of memories of
when (George) Halas would bring us out near the lake to practice
and it was so cold you couldn't feel your body parts,'' said
Butkus. ``I remember near the Chicago Armory and stepping in horse
(excrement) from where they used to hold different events.
Nowadays, there are these elaborate practice complexes. It doesn't
mean you can't still work hard and have an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   When he visits Chicago, he stays with a lifelong friend who
recently informed him of a Sun-Times poll in which 96 percent
favored his return to football. ``That's why Chicago would be the
only place I'd come back to. The fans here are real football
fans,'' he said. ``I'll bet you that in the middle of February
there'll be 5,000 fans with their shirts off rooting for us. That's
if I win. If I don't, the honeymoon will be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot to do in a short time, but I'm doing it
because I love the game. Football is football. I'll make sure we
play it right.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Raven-ous reconstruction
</P>
<P>
   You have to hand it to Ozzie Newsome, the Baltimore Ravens' vice
president of player personnel, for not believing the negative press
on former Patriot Ben Coates and finding out for himself that
Coates's conditioning was top flight and he's not the monster he's
been portrayed to be. Coach Brian Billick and his staff, including
East Coast supervisor Terry McDonough, have drafted and signed
excellent talent the past few years. They will go only as far as
quarterback Tony Banks takes them, but the addition of tight ends
Coates and Shannon Sharpe, the return of Pro Bowl linebacker Ray
Lewis (the best in the game before his murder trial), and the
drafting of running back Jamal Lewis and receiver Travis Taylor may
help the vastly improved Ravens steal a little thunder from the
Redskins in the Beltway . . . Patriots Football Weekly has
tabulated the results of its All-Patriots Team of the Century.
According to editor Bryan Mory, more than 25,000 votes were cast on
a newspaper ballot and on the team's Web site. The results: QB Drew
Bledsoe; RBs Sam Cunningham and Curtis Martin; WRs Gino Cappelletti
and Stanley Morgan; TE Ben Coates; OGs John Hannah and Sam Adams;
OTs Bruce Armstrong and Leon Gray; C Pete Brock; DEs Willie
McGinest and Julius Adams; DTs Houston Antwine and Jim Lee Hunt;
LBs Vincent Brown, Steve Nelson, Ted Johnson, and Andre Tippett;
DBs Mike Haynes, Ty Law, Lawyer Milloy, and Fred Marion; K
Cappelletti; P Rich Camarillo; coach Bill Parcells. Player of the
century: Hannah. Top-vote getter: Armstrong (23,518). Closest
races: Cappelletti nipped Irving Fryar at WR, and Martin edged Jim
Nance at RB . . . Pretty decent story developing in Chicago, where
former Boston College quarterback Mark Hartsell is making a
comeback after sitting out the past two years. Hartsell always had
the arm strength, but now he's more physically mature and it
appears he has a chance to stick under Gary Crowton, the Bears'
offensive coordinator who coached him at BC . . . Anyone who wishes
to use a golf cart at Patriots training camp at Bryant College in
Smithfield, R.I., must seek permission from coach Bill Belichick.
This long has been a subject of great debate among Patriot coaches.
The team even had to settle a lawsuit recently involving a teenage
girl struck by a cart last season. The Falcons also have had their
share of golf cart incidents at their Furman University site. Coach
Dan Reeves has forbid his players from tinkering with the carts to
speed them up after some Falcons engaged in races in years past . .
. Next Thursday's trek to the University of Massachusetts is now
being called a ``joint practice'' between the Patriots and New York
Giants, rather than a scrimmage. UMass is charging $5 for parking.
The practice runs from approximately noon to 2 p.m. The Patriots
will get a look at Giants quarterback Kerry Collins, who feels like
a new man and last week spoke of the Giants being a possible
championship team. ``I think I'm at a point in my career where I
can take it to a high level,'' said Collins, who had several
transgressions that squashed his star potential while with
Carolina. ``I've done it before as a young guy. I think I can be as
good as I've been in this league.'' . . . Former Patriots tight end
Russ Francis is making a congressional bid in Hawaii.

   Adding an old touch
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shanahan is at it again, bringing in another grizzled
veteran to help the Broncos get back to the Super Bowl. Former
Bills receiver Andre Reed, a future Hall of Famer, joined Denver in
a move Shanahan hopes will provide a spark similar to what Fryar
did for the Redskins last season. Speaking of Fryar, his agent,
Michael George, is experiencing deja vu regarding another client,
Coates. George pointed out that Fryar left the Patriots at 32 and
went on to four Pro Bowls. Coates left at 30, and George predicts
similar future success. Coates can earn up to $2.3 million if he
catches 70 passes. Coates will start the season as Sharpe's backup,
but he wouldn't have signed if he didn't expect to get the ball . .
. Sean Dawkins won't be going to Tennessee because the Titans don't
throw it downfield. Dawkins may return to Seattle, and recently
released Bengal Carl Pickens could hook on with the Titans or the
Jets, who are still looking for a No. 1 receiver . . . Carolina's
signing of Reggie White to a five-year deal Friday shows you the
state of defensive line play in the league. The Titans and Seahawks
(with his former coach, Mike Holmgren) were hoping to land the
38-year-old retiree. But the Panthers reportedly offered White $3
million-$4 million per year . . . The Jaguars are trying to scare
Tony Brackens back by flirting with free agent Eric Swann.
Brackens, however, isn't budging from his hopes of getting about $7
million per year . . . While teams are either in or getting ready
for training camp, expansion Houston is trying to position itself
for the 2002 season. Saints owner Tom Benson would like to see
Houston in an NFC Southern Division that also would include the
Saints, Falcons, and Buccaneers. Houston owner Bob McNair prefers
Houston stay where the old Houston Oilers were (AFC Central) to
take advantage of old city rivalries and a new one with Tennessee .
. . Geoff Hobson, formerly of the Portland (Maine) Press-Herald and
the Cincinnati Enquirer, is revolutionizing team Web sites. Hobson
is allowed to be critical of his employer, the Bengals. All team
president Mike Brown asks in return is for Hobson to be fair and
write both sides of the story. This is unique, because some teams
don't make their front-office personnel, executives, and owners
available to their own media outlets for comments on major issues .
. . Despite charging $10 for admission and $10 for parking at their
new practice facility, the Redskins don't believe they will turn a
profit since they estimate it will cost about $2 million to run the
camp. Their first day of camp produced 3,000 fans for one two-hour
practice. On Thursday, the Patriots drew a combined 4,000 fans for
their morning and afternoon sessions, and admission was free.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Future is in sight
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the best thing about having the Patriots work
out at Foxboro Stadium was the opportunity to watch the erection of
the new stadium beyond the practice fields. Big Dig take note:
Those working on the stadium seemed to be making a lot of progress
during the course of the week. It appears a 2002 christening is
well within reach . . . Once signed, the Redskins plan to use LaVar
Arrington as a third-down pass rusher from outside linebacker,
according to coach Norv Turner, and once he grasps that role, the
Redskins will gradually make him a full-time player . . . An odd
story involving a draft pick is developing in Philadelphia, where
sixth-round selection John Frank, a defensive end from Utah, has
been missing from camp. Apparently Frank's parents know of his
whereabouts and say he's not in danger. Frank is evidently trying
to decide if football is what he wants to devote himself to . . .
Kurt Warner didn't have a contract when he reported to camp
Thursday, but he signed a one-year deal worth $358,000 Friday, the
league minimum for third-year players. Not wanting to hold out,
Warner agreed to the short-term solution so his representatives
could continue to work on a long-term deal with the Rams. ``My love
for the game and my responsibility to this team and my teammates
and coaches outweigh everything else. I definitely want to take
care of my family and do those types of things, but I realize why
I'm here and I felt it was something I had to do,'' Warner told the
St. Louis media . . . One of Kansas City coach Gunther Cunningham's
toughest tasks in camp is dealing with the death of Derrick Thomas.
Cunningham was very close to the linebacker, as the two often
conversed on the phone late at night. Other friends of Thomas, like
quarterback Elvis Grbac, also miss Thomas's presence. ``I give it
thought every day,'' said Cunningham. ``How are we going to handle
this? It's a delicate thing to handle.'' The Chiefs plan to pay
tribute to Thomas prior to their Sept. 3 opener against
Indianapolis, but getting there is the problem. ``There's a time
and place to talk about Derrick. There's a time and place to handle
his memory. I hope to do the right thing,'' said Cunningham . . .
Vincent Brisby has been taking snaps with the Patriots starters,
and the veteran receiver is not ready to give that up. ``I'll do
what I'm asked to do, but I want to start,'' he said. ``I think I
can help this team as a primary guy.'' The Patriots need a big
target over the middle with Coates gone, and it appears Brisby, who
isn't afraid of running routes in traffic, could be that guy.
Brisby would definitely be the winner of the Patriots'
``Survivor.'' He's escaped more salary-cap issues and had his
contract restructured more than any other player. If Brisby does
start and Bledsoe uses him as a main target, the receiver could
earn as much as $2.6 million this year. Brisby's deal was
restructured for a $750,000 salary and $650,000 signing bonus,
which cut the Patriots' salary cap hit from $2.15 million to about
$1.4 million. Brisby, one of the hardest workers in the offseason,
also will earn $50,000 for meeting his contractual workout demands
. . . Dimitrius Underwood is finally handling life in the NFL with
the Dallas Cowboys, but now he's got a few pounds to shed. Chosen
29th overall by Minnesota in the 1999 draft, Underwood hasn't
played in two years (he missed the '98 season at Michigan State
with an ankle injury) and reportedly weighs more than 300 pounds.
Last season he was released by the Vikings, signed by the Dolphins,
and tried to commit suicide after dislocating his shoulder during
an exhibition game. ``I believe I can play,'' Underwood told the
Dallas Morning News. ``I've got to do something. I can't sit around
and twiddle my thumbs all day. I want to play football.'' . . .
Interesting story in Chicago, where Bears public relations
executive Bryan Harlan resigned just days before it was reported he
was under investigation for placing bets on NFL games, including
his own team's. Former Bears executive Ken Valdiserri acknowledged
to the Sun-Times that he was subpoenaed two years ago in a federal
gambling probe regarding calls that were made to a bookmaker from
his phone. Valdiserri, now general manager of Chicago's XFL
franchise, denied he made the calls. ``Our phone was passed around
like it was a bottle of Coca-Cola,'' he said, adding that it was
impossible to determine who had called the bookie. If it was a
player or coach, that could lead to more serious ramifications.

GLENN IN FINE FORM FOR NEW SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ There are NFL players _ all of them great athletes
_ who can play a punishing, grueling sport with grace and agility.
And then there are a few who take it one step higher.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Patriots have one special, cut-above-the-rest
guy: Terry Glenn. He's the same guy the Patriots sometimes can't
live with, but know beyond a doubt they can't live without.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's amazing to watch sometimes,'' said former Brown star and
second-year Patriots receiver Sean Morey. ``I learn so much from
just watching the things he does and then try and go out there and
do them. He works so hard at being the best. That's what people
don't understand about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn understands how the mixed perception of him developed.
There was the ``she'' reference by Bill Parcells in his rookie
year. There were a few off-field problems, a one-game suspension by
then-coach Pete Carroll. Lots of injuries. Lost in the criticism is
the fact that few can match his level of athleticism. The extra
gear he shifts into when he needs to leaves defenders in the dust.
His great hands enable him to catch balls when he's double-covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's things that happened in the past and things that are said
about me,'' said Glenn. ``I'd like to prove all of those people
wrong, but I know I won't be able to do that unless the world comes
down to see the things I do. I work very hard when I'm out on that
field. I think the coaches and the players see that and they're the
ones that know it. I can't make everybody happy. I know what I'm
capable of and I know that when I'm practicing and playing, I give
everything I have.''
</P>
<P>
   At a March 15 team meeting called by coach Bill Belichick, Glenn
was pardoned for the fine Carroll levied last season when Glenn
broke a procedural rule when he was ill with a virus. When
Belichick heard Glenn's side and did his own research, he rescinded
the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn asked for a new contract and was told he had to wait and
play out the season. Glenn never has balked at being rejected even
though Keyshawn Johnson and Marvin Harrison have received huge
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn wanted to work out near his home in Columbus, Ohio, in the
offseason, but when Belichick asked him to be with the team, Glenn
left behind his 4-year-old son, Terry Jr., and his new house to
stay in Foxborough. He did not complete the full number of workouts
to earn a $50,000 bonus, and it appeared he rankled Belichick when
he left for Columbus three-quarters of the way through the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Bill didn't agree with it at first,'' said Glenn, ``but
when I told him what I was going to do, he put it in my hands. I'm
up here all alone and I have a son I need to be with in the
offseason. I went home and worked with my personal trainer and I
stayed in great shape. I think the bottom line is I came back here
in top shape. I didn't give anyone any reason to get on me about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson out of the division, Glenn, who made the Pro Bowl
last season for the first time with 69 catches, has a chance to be
the top receiver in the AFC East. Glenn has had a little battle
with Harrison, Johnson, and Eric Moulds, all taken in the first
round of the '96 draft. When Glenn caught 90 balls as a rookie, he
was clearly the best of the crop. Injuries have since played havoc,
though last year Glenn thought he was on his way to catching 120
balls. He and Drew Bledsoe were clicking as never before. Glenn was
the focal point of the Ernie Zampese offense, as he will be of
Charlie Weis's schemes.
</P>
<P>
   But soon the Zampese system stopped working. Glenn was seeing
double coverage all the time. Teams like Belichick's Jets designed
defenses to keep Glenn contained. He went from catching 43 passes
at midseason to 26 in the second half. He was shut out against
Miami. He missed the last two games, one with the flu and the other
because of his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   He caught 13 passes for 214 yards in a 19-7 win over Cleveland
early in the season. He had 32 catches after four games, leading
the league, and then didn't have another big splash until he had
nine receptions against Indianapolis Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Since he landed in New England from Ohio State, the Patriots
have won 62.3 percent of the games in which Glenn has played
(30-18). They are 8-8 when he doesn't. They are 3-2 in the
postseason when he plays, 0-1 when he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth all-time leading receiver in Patriots history says his
success is linked to his health. He says he's careful about his
legs and his body because he knows his breaking point. If he backs
off workouts, it's because he doesn't think his body can take much
more.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Glenn feels great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling so good right now,'' he said. ``It usually doesn't
feel this good at this stage of training camp. I don't have any
bumps and bruises and I think the atmosphere Bill has created has
helped quite a bit. I love this setup we had here in Foxborough. As
a veteran player you can go home and sleep in your own bed and
relax and then come ready to practice the next day. I know we can't
stay here, but I think to start camp here was a good idea so now we
can go to Smithfield and work even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the losses of players he liked and respected, Shawn
Jefferson and Ben Coates, Glenn thinks the Patriots will be fine
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said that Weis's offense resembles the offense the
Patriots had in '96, but added, ``there's more to it. It's been
expanded. Every year you have to add new things and Charlie has
added to what he had in place. I think Drew is comfortable. I think
we're all comfortable that we can get some things done and put some
points up.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn never has played a full season in the NFL because of
injuries, sickness, and the suspension. He achieved a lifelong
dream of being a Pro Bowler and he volunteered to return kicks in
that game. Although he would like to play all 16 games and then the
postseason, Glenn said his focus is not on personal goals anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about the team,'' said Glenn, who was involved in one
of the lighter moments of training camp when a police dog ran on
the field and stole the ball out of his hands. ``I think everybody
wants to win. We have a new coach and a new outlook. Everyone's
pretty excited. I know that some people don't think we'll be that
good, but when we get some of our offensive linemen back healthy
we'll be fine. It's best to be the underdog, anyway. I think it's
the best position to be in. It's nice to be able to prove people
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   That's something he's always had to do.

BRUINS QUIET ABOUT SAMSONOV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could you picture Sergei Samsonov in a uniform other than the
Bruins' next season? It's not as far-fetched as you might think.
Samsonov is a Group 2 free agent, and there's a perception that
because of the restrictive nature of that status, nobody in the
category changes teams. Well, truth be told, Samsonov and his
Boston-based attorney, Neil Abbott, are actively shopping the
market and even if clubs are reluctant to tender him an offer
sheet, there is the option of trading for him.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov, like practically every one of his teammates, is coming
off a subpar season; for the last two seasons, in fact, he hasn't
exactly flourished. When asked if Samsonov is a good fit in Boston,
Abbott paused, then said, ``I have some questions. There are some
issues. If you look at the way it's all come down the last year or
so, you wonder. They have their opinion and I have mine, but you
certainly have to take a long look and see what's out there and see
where you do fit or you don't fit. I don't have any conclusions,
but certainly it's an issue we're looking at because you're looking
at a commitment for the next two, three, or four years of your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott declined to say what those ``issues'' might be, but one
perception that has persisted is that coach Pat Burns isn't a big
fan of Samsonov's. Burns has denied it repeatedly, but the player's
east-west tendencies rather than skating north-south would cause
any coach to tear out his hair at times. There was a flap a couple
of years ago when Mike O'Connell questioned Burns's use of
Samsonov. Both the coach and assistant general manager felt the
issue was overblown, but the subject remains a sensitive one.
However, it's clear that if a team as offensively challenged as the
Bruins was to deal Samsonov, it would have to get back some
offensive talent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Bruins sign or deal Samsonov remains to be seen. But
at this point, Abbott said, there is no dialogue _ zero, zilch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing going on,'' said Abbott. ``We're not in any
kind of active negotiating stage with the Bruins in any form and
we're not actively seeking that at this point. I've explained to
Sergei and every other Group 2 over the years that you only get to
the market two or three times in your career if you're lucky and
when you do, you owe it to yourself to take a look around and see
what might be out there. There's a perception sometimes that Group
2s never move, but if you look at the reality, they do move, most
often by trade _ but there have been some significant offers over
the years. Sometimes you fit better somewhere else and sometimes
somebody has a greater need for your services than the team that
has you. In the process of talking, you'll find all that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Anson Carter, also a restricted free agent, recently said
there's a giant gulf between how he views his worth and how the
Bruins view it. Abbott said he has no idea how the Bruins view
Samsonov's worth because it's never been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a qualifying offer, we rejected it, and that's where
we're at,'' he said. ``There are no discussions going on
whatsoever. That may develop, but there are a lot of issues to be
talked about before we even get that far, if and when we get there.
We have not had any discussion on his worth. They did their
obligatory CBA thing to qualify him, and that's normal. That's
where we're at. They know we won't sign that, and that's that. We
haven't had any discussions, and we haven't been seeking them.
Historically, not a lot of people get signed early in Boston. I'm
not expecting a lot of discussion in the short period here, and I'm
not looking for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Abbott said, he and his client are keeping an open mind
and fielding whatever offers may come down. ``Group 2s do move
through trades, free agency, or offers, it does happen,'' said
Abbott. ``It's not easy, it's not common, but it does occur. There
are a lot of players who started out in one place and ended up
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had a gut feeling on whether Samsonov would be
in Boston next season, Abbott said he didn't. ``It's too early to
say one way or the other,'' he said. ``We're going to take a look
around and talk to some people and see what's out there. We just
want to keep the field wide open.''
</P>

<P>
   Cheering with a twang
</P>
<P>
   Former NHL coach Terry Crisp says he's having the time of his
life in his current job as TV color commentator for the Nashville
Predators. Crisp is a passionate country music fan, and he said
many country singers have become hockey fans. ``Garth Brooks,
Barbara Mandrell, Amy Grant, Vince Gill, the Dixie Chicks _ you
name it, and they all come to our games,'' said Crisp. ``We've got
a thing called the Music Box, a private area where all the
celebrities can come at any time. But a lot of them have bought
season tickets and sit with the rest of the fans.'' Crisp said
Brooks, when he's touring, will sometimes call Predators coach
Barry Trotz for help booking ice time for pickup games . . .
Canadiens goalie Jeff Hackett, who is playing in his second
Original Six city (Chicago was the other), said feelings run high
in Montreal with the club being put up for sale and the loss of
Rocket Richard. ``Obviously, a lot of the past has been let go
recently what with the Forum (closing) and Mr. Richard,'' said
Hackett. ``It's a very emotional time for these people right now,
in some instances volatile. To any person growing up in Montreal,
there's so much passion involved with following the team. It's a
part of life there.'' There has been speculation the team could
move depending on who buys the franchise, a development that would
be unfathomable. ``It could be worrisome, especially when you see
what's going on in other cities,'' Hackett said. ``But maybe it's a
warning signal (about rising costs) more than anything else.'' . .
. Former Boston University and Catholic Memorial standout Chris
O'Sullivan has signed with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. The
26-year-old defenseman, the Flames' second-round draft pick (No. 30
overall) in 1992, played most of his first three pro seasons in the
Calgary organization before being traded to the Rangers in March of
last year. He spent last season in the Vancouver organization,
appearing in 11 games with the Canucks and 59 with the AHL's
Syracuse Crunch, for whom he was the second-leading scorer with 65
points (18 goals).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A heady decision
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to say what is going to happen with Philadelphia
center Eric Lindros. He has until Aug. 1 to decide whether to sign
the Flyers' qualifying offer of $8.5 million. Lindros, who suffered
four concussions in a little more than four months last season, is
scheduled to be checked by Chicago-based concussion expert Dr.
James Kelly just prior to the deadline . . . For a time, it
appeared Rob Ray would be looking for work outside of Buffalo. When
the Sabres declined to pick up the option on his deal, Ray figured
he would be playing elsewhere next season. But in a series of
meetings with management, Ray worked out a new deal and has been
assured by general manager Darcy Regier that he will have more
support than in the past. Ray, who averaged about four minutes a
game last season, will likely be used quite a bit more as the
Sabres try to increase their toughness. ``Part of our
responsibility to Rob is to make sure he's not isolated,'' said
Regier. ``Those are things we discussed as well. It's a two-way
street. (The responsibility) is not just Rob to the organization,
it's the organization to Rob as well.'' The Sabres felt as if they
were pushed around last season (sound familiar?) and want to
improve the club's physical presence. ``The fighting side, yes,
I've got to do it,'' said Ray. ``As a team on the whole, if you can
go out and play a physical game, it does just as much good as going
out and fighting. It's nice to have help, but you have to
understand that I'm the guy that has to do it. I've got to assume
that role.'' . . . Former Bruin Adam Oates of the Washington
Capitals has been in attendance at the British Open, where he is
offering some moral support to his friend, Mike Weir . . . Speaking
of golf (also known as hockey's offseason), Cummaquid, which is the
home club of Bruin forward Eric Nickulas, has a 7-point lead over
Thorny Lea after the first round of the Giardino Cup challenge. The
second and final round is Aug. 17. The Brockton group will have to
pick it up if they want to prevent the trophy, which has resided at
Thorny Lea the past two years, from heading back down Route 3 . . .
Forty-six days to training camp.

LEGACY OF PIONEER ALSO HIS STRENGTH

<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ No one has seen his plaque yet, but you can
bet it will talk about catching more games and hitting more home
runs as a catcher than any player in baseball history. One might
reasonably assume it will also mention a certain home run in the
1975 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But if Carlton Fisk's Hall of Fame plaque is really
comprehensive, it might contain the following notation:
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionized baseball conditioning with an unprecedented
year-round regimen built around weightlifting, without which he
could never have caught as many games as he did. First player to
get through catching nine innings in a night game and then head
directly to the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   No one else has caught 2,000 games. Fisk caught 2,226 games. And
he caught them because he was capable. He caught them because his
managers believed he would do a good job, even at ages 40, 41, and
beyond. He caught them long past the age when most every other
quality catcher was either a) retired or b) playing another
position because he was no longer capable of both catching and
swinging an effective bat.
</P>
<P>
   More than any position player, a catcher can have a major
positive effect on his team, even while going 0 for 4. Batting is,
in fact, almost incidental to a catcher's primary task, as Fisk
himself made clear on the eve of his induction into the Baseball
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took great pride in what I did on the field, with my
contributions behind the plate,'' Fisk declared in response to a
query about ``special moments'' he had in the game. ``The
relationships with my pitching staffs were very special to me.
Catching guys like Luis Tiant, Tom Seaver, LaMarr Hoyt, Richard
Dotson, Jack McDowell, and Bobby Thigpen, that's where I had my
value to the team. Those were all special moments.''
</P>
<P>
   No other catcher in baseball history would have had a chance of
catching both Sonny Siebert and Thigpen. Carlton Fisk's longevity
at a position that is more physically demanding than, say, all
three outfield spots put together, is beyond comparison.
</P>
<P>
   It came about because in what would have been the November of
just about any other catcher's career he undertook a punishing
physical program. It's just that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel I am somewhat of a pioneer,'' he said. ``I suppose
it all began when I had my knee destroyed in 1974 (a gruesome home
plate collision with Cleveland's Leron Lee). I know how hard I
worked to rehabilitate, and a year later I was playing in the World
Series when I was never supposed to squat again. So right there I
knew how important it was to keep your legs in shape, especially at
my position.''
</P>
<P>
   Move the clock forward nine years. Pudge Fisk has been injured
again, and this time he gets it in his head that there is no reason
why he must think about a rocking chair (or a first baseman's mitt)
just because he's 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``In baseball, the thinking was that you didn't lift weights
because they made you too tight and muscle-bound. They thought
you'd wind up looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger. But weight
lifting has redefined strength and conditioning in baseball. It's
so obvious, so commonsensical, that the stronger,
better-conditioned the athlete is, the better he will perform. That
year (1985), I went out and had one of my best years, with 37
homers, 107 runs batted in. And I caught 150-something games.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 1980s drifted into the '90s, Pudge Fisk became
increasingly buoyed by an intriguing phenomenon. ``There were a lot
of sons coming into baseball whose fathers I had played against,''
he said. ``I can't tell you how good a feeling it was to go onto
the field and play against people who were the same age as my own
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all because his pioneering dedication to baseball
conditioning had permitted him to catch longer than any man in
history. ``I would not have played the last eight years of my
career without that strength and conditioning program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than The Man Who Came To Dinner, he had become The Man
Who Came To Catch, as frustrated White Sox backup Ron Karkovice
knew better than anyone. By the time Fisk finally retired,
Karkovice was already 31. His career never really took off, and if
some day in the future you run into a stocky guy in a bar who tells
you that Pudge Fisk ruined his career, you won't even have to ask
his name. It will be Karkovice.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk has raised the bar ridiculously high. In order to
understand what 2,226 games caught means, consider the games-caught
totals of some other Hall of Fame catchers: Johnny Bench, 1,744;
Ray Schalk 1,726; Bill Dickey, 1,712; Yogi Berra, 1,696, and
Mickey Cochrane, 1,451. The only catcher within shouting distance
is Al Lopez with 1,918, and Al didn't bring one-10th the offense to
the table Pudge did.
</P>
<P>
   Was Fisk's best The Best? No. In our time Bench was surely
better, as was Gary Carter, at least in my opinion. Cochrane was
the consensus All-Time catcher before Bench came along, and I
suspect most people who watched Berra would prefer him to Fisk. But
Carlton Fisk is clearly among the great catchers of all time, and
absolutely no one else was able to maintain his excellence anywhere
as long as he did. If you want to put this in further perspective,
they're already talking about moving the great Ivan (Pudge)
Rodriguez to second base, a la Craig Biggio. And we all know that
Mike Piazza will not end his career as a catcher.
</P>
<P>
   The clear truth is that no catcher in history positively
affected more games than Carlton Fisk. The very real possibility is
that none ever will. How's that for your legacy?

<P>
   NAGO, Japan _ With most of their economies in decent shape,
leaders of the Group of Eight countries neared the end of their
annual summit Sunday focusing on helping poor countries wipe out
illiteracy, fight infectious diseases and get into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   They announced a global initiative Sunday morning that includes
$300 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide
school meals for 9 million children a year in the poorest
countries, and another $1 billion in World Bank loans for basic
education.
</P>
<P>
   Serving breakfast and lunch at schools has been proven to entice
parents to send their children to school in developing countries,
said Gene Sperling, President Clinton's chief economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a hopeless problem,'' he told reporters. ``This is
something that can be dealt with.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the G8 members announced a Digital Opportunity Task
Force, dubbed the ``dot force,'' charged with finding ways to
bridge the global digital divide. The group is to report to next
year's G8 summit in Italy on possible solutions for individual
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, officials said, is that technology will let poor
nations leapfrog obstacles to development, taking advantage of the
information age to improve education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   The G8 members _ the United States, Canada, Britain, Japan,
France, Germany, Italy and Russia _ also announced new programs and
funding to help prevent the spread of diseases such as AIDS,
tuberculosis and malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries made financial pledges, including $3 billion
by Japan over the next five years. Clinton has requested $4 billion
in the 2001 budget for a vaccine program, research on HIV/AIDS and
international aid for various infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Lael Brainard, Clinton's deputy national economic adviser, said
that while past G8 summits have been more centered on the economic
problems of the member nations, Okinawa ``is shaping up to be the
development summit, with a focus on creating opportunity for the
least-developed.''
</P>
<P>
   However, about 50 non-governmental organizations who came to
Okinawa to monitor the summit were not impressed by either
initiative. They accused the G8 leaders of failing to address the
fundamental problems that cause poverty and disease, and instead
offering only superficial solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quite angry,'' said Marlene Barrett, a spokesperson for
Jubilee 2000. ``This (digital divide effort) is an empty gesture
which will obviously benefit all of their industries. It's just to
distract attention away from the fact that they failed to cancel
the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Jubilee 2000 burned a laptop computer on a beach here
in Okinawa to show their disappointment with G8's failure to
fulfill last year's promise to cancel up to $100 billion in Third
World debt.
</P>
<P>
   So far, just nine countries have qualified for debt relief of up
to $15 billion. Jubilee 2000 says debt relief is the first step to
ending the cycle of poverty, since poor countries are spending more
money to pay back debt than on basic needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't eat a laptop,'' said Barrett. ``It's a crisis, it's
an emergency, and it's something that they've failed to deal with
this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicins Sans Frontieres criticized the G8 program on infectious
diseases, saying that merely spending money to treat diseases does
not solve the core problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If part of this money is going to be used to buy expensive
brand-name drugs when we know there are cheaper, generic brands
available, that's public money going to private interests in the
West,'' said spokesperson Ellen 'T Hoen(cq).
</P>
<P>
   She said she was disappointed the G8 leaders did not address
patent issues that would allow, for example, local companies to
produce cheaper versions of pricey AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just saying, 'this is a serious issue and we're making money
available to deal with it' without giving clear direction on how to
do that is really a missed opportunity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on the digital divide, Clinton acknowledged that
technology is not the answer to all the problems of the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet if we fail to ensure that all nations have the opportunity
to participate fully in the network economy and society, we run the
risk that the divide between nations will grow,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, Clinton addressed U.S. troops and their
families on Okinawa. His speech was rescheduled from Sunday
afternoon to allow him to leave Japan several hours early in order
to return to the Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   He will arrive in Washington Sunday afternoon and head directly
to Camp David. In remarks to reporters Sunday morning, Clinton said
the talks continue to make progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I left ... there has been a lot more sort of systematic
effort in the groups on a lot of the issues,'' he said. ``So
whatever happens, I think they continue to make headway.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gave an upbeat speech to troops lasting less than 10
minutes that did not
</P>
<P>
   directly address the issues that have led Okinawans to protest
the U.S. military
</P>
<P>
   presence on their island, which numbers about 26,000.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents have complained about instances of misbehavior
and crime, including killings, rapes and thefts. The presence of
about 4,000 children fathered out of wedlock by U.S. military
personnel has further strained relations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton thanked the forces for their work and stated
the need to be good neighbors to their Okinawan hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one of us has a personal obligation to do everything that
we can to strengthen our friendship and to do nothing to harm it,''
he said.

IT'S BEEN A `STORYBOOK' FOR GIAMBI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ The July 17 edition of Sports Illustrated features
Oakland A's first baseman Jason Giambi on the cover. He's holding a
bat in his hands and is wearing: A) a scowl; B) long greasy hair;
C) a T-shirt with the sleeves cut off, and D) a large tattoo of a
skull and flames on his left shoulder and upper arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new face of baseball,'' the magazine proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   For Giambi, who went to South Hills High in West Covina and Long
Beach State, the cover of SI simply added to what already has been
an incredible year for him.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday's game, Giambi was hitting .334 with 23
homers and 85 RBI. But it's more than the numbers he's produced on
the field.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Jeremy was traded from the Royals to the A's and has
a locker next to Jason's in the A's clubhouse. The A's are in a
pennant race for the first time since Giambi has been with the
club.
</P>
<P>
   He not only was voted the starting first baseman for the
American League in the All-Star Game, but he was named by manager
Joe Torre as the A.L.'s cleanup hitter for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole year has been storybook,'' Giambi said Saturday.
``My brother's here, how well the team's doing. It's been
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Giambi said he hasn't had too much time to reflect on all that's
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of those things that when I'm done with the
year it'll sink in,'' he said. ``It's blowing up. The cover of
Sports Illustrated, the All-Star Game, ... every time I turn around
it's something else. It's been unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Backin' Black: The Angels' young starters - Jarrod Washburn,
Scott Schoeneweis, Ramon Ortiz, Brian Cooper and Seth Etherton -
were drafted and developed by the previous management headed by
general manager Bill Bavasi and scouting director Bob Fontaine.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the new Angels regime has taken the baton and kept
it going. The five have combined to go 23-14, and a lot of credit
is going to new Angels pitching coach Bud Black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody here doesn't know what Buddy Black's meant to this
team,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``Not only his insight
but his ability to communicate with them. Buddy has the ability to
break down and analyze each pitcher's strengths, and he doesn't try
to mold anyone to a particular path.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Black was a special assistant to Indians general
manager John Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Flirting with .400: Nomar Garciaparra was hitting .403 through
the Red Sox's game July 20. Since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941,
the player who has gone the deepest into the season and still was
at .400 or better was John Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Olerud was hitting .400 through Aug. 2 with the Blue
Jays. He finished the season as the American League batting
champion with a .363 average.
</P>
<P>
   Interleague tally: Interleague play is over for 2000, and here
are the numbers - American League teams won 136 games to the
National League's 115. The Indians had the best record at 13-5, the
Padres had the worst at 5-10.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, Garciaparra had the highest batting average at
.468, Darin Erstad had the most hits with 37, Frank Thomas and
Sammy Sosa had the most homers with nine each, and Thomas had the
most RBI with 26.
</P>
<P>
   In the four seasons of interleague play, the A.L. leads the
series, 477-463.
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: The Indians want to re-sign free-agent-to-be Manny
Ramirez, but it doesn't look good because Ramirez wants as much as
$15 million a season. ``There's no question the Cleveland Indians
will make an offer,'' Indians GM John Hart told the Cleveland Plain
Dealer. ``I'm not optimistic. I don't think they're ready to sign
here. That's been my experience. I've been through quite a few of
these.'' ... In the ninth inning of Friday's 12-3 game in which the
home team A's were trailing the Angels, a chant of ``Let's go
A's!'' turned into ``Let's go home!''

ROOKIE ZITO SILENCES ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Anaheim Angels pitcher Brian Cooper gave it the old
college try Saturday afternoon, given the chance to show a fellow
ex-Trojan how it's done in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper, a veteran of all of 15 major-league starts, was
upstaged by Barry Zito, who made his big-league debut a memorable
one in the A's 10-3 victory before 20,111 at the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and Zito both attended USC but they were never teammates.
Cooper pitched for the Trojans in 1995, Zito in 1999. But Zito
looked more like the veteran, giving up only one run and two hits
in five innings. Cooper was gone after giving up seven runs and 10
hits in 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the shortest outing by an Angels starter since Ken Hill
lasted 1 innings on July 3. And it was the first time an Angels
starter failed to go at least six innings since Hill went 5 innings
on July 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he's a Trojan, I wanted him to lose bad,'' Cooper
said of Zito. ``It's great for him to go out and keep this lineup
down. He did an excellent job by keeping the hitters off balance.
But even though he's a fellow Trojan, I didn't really feel for him.
I wanted to see us put up a 10-spot in the first inning.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was decided in the span of one inning - the bottom of
the fourth and the top of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fourth, the A's unloaded on Cooper for five
hits and a walk, including a grand slam by Ben Grieve and a two-run
single by Terrence Long. The grand slam was the ninth by the A's
this season, setting a franchise record.
</P>
<P>
   The six runs gave the A's a 7-1 lead, but the Angels had an
opportunity to get back in it against Zito in the top of the fifth.
Adam Kennedy walked, Darin Erstad singled and Benji Gil walked to
load the bases with the heart of the Angels order coming up.
</P>
<P>
   But Zito responded by striking out Mo Vaughn (looking), Tim
Salmon (swinging) and Garret Anderson (swinging) to get out of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went away from his fastball and threw his breaking ball for
strikes,'' Vaughn said of Zito's three key strikeouts. ``He showed
some poise right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito finished with six strikeouts, six walks and one hit batter
(Vaughn).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the A's were geared up for Cooper, who shut them out
on three hits in a 7-0 Angels win June 30 in Anaheim. After that
game, Cooper mentioned how he knew the A's hitters were a patient
bunch (they lead the league in walks), so he focused on throwing
strikes early in the count.
</P>
<P>
   A's manager Art Howe read his team Cooper's comments, they
adjusted and took a more aggressive approach Saturday. Cooper went
with the same approach and was hit hard despite feeling good about
the way he threw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back over the game, there's not one pitch I would take
back in the whole game,'' Cooper (4-4) said. ``Even the pitch to
Grieve. It was a sinker down and away, the perfect double-play ball
... If I had the choice I'd take that stuff, and the way I threw,
every game of the year. If I get beat every time, then I wouldn't
be long for the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia had a little different view of
Cooper's outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Cooper struggled with his command,'' Scioscia said.
``He got behind a lot of hitters. He couldn't get the ball in the
location he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides working out of the fifth-inning jam, Zito got out of
potential trouble by picking off Erstad in the first inning. The
Angels scored their only run against him in the second inning on an
RBI single by Edgard Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you haven't seen a pitcher there's a slight advantage for
the pitcher,'' Scioscia said. ``But I don't think that was the case
today. When he had to, he made pitches to get out of jams. He
stepped up with the bases loaded. He has very good stuff, we knew
that. He kept his poise out there.''
</P>
<P>
   With the win the A's moved into a virtual tie with the Angels,
percentage points ahead in the wild-card race. Both teams are five
games behind AL West-leader Seattle.

ANGELS MIGHT BE NICE FIT FOR GWYNN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ No, it didn't work with Dave Parker, Eddie Murray or
Cecil Fielder. But this is different.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Angels have acquired talented hitters to be their
designated hitter in the past, only to learn the hard way they were
years beyond their prime. Way beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn is 40 years old and certainly beyond his prime. But
Gwynn has a message for those who might think his ailing knee and
his age have him thinking about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have the fire in my belly to play,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's bad left knee has limited him to 36 games this season.
He had surgery a month ago and is at least five weeks from
returning. He might not even make it back this season.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn is doing his rehab work with a passion every day. He says
even if he doesn't make it back this season, he'll be back in 2001
for his 20th season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes rehab easy,'' Gwynn said. ``Because I still
want to play. It's why you do what you gotta do. Whether or not I
make it back this year, I still want to play. I love what I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta put a lot of time and energy into (rehab). People
think it's a Caribbean vacation. But you work every day and don't
even get an opportunity to put a bat in your hands. You work every
day and you go home on crutches. No doubt it's a mental battle.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gwynn still wants to play. But isn't he still a Padre?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the National League,'' Gwynn said. ``But if (the
Padres) don't want me and nobody in the National League wants me
and there's an opportunity to DH, I'm not going to be stupid. I'll
weigh my options, but that's way down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn said he has no idea which way the Padres are leaning. The
club has an option worth $6 million for next season. If they don't
want to keep him, they can buy him out for $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn has meant everything to the Padres. He's won eight batting
titles, has a .338 career average and 3,108 hits. But business is
business and Gwynn understands.
</P>
<P>
   If Gwynn's knee problem limits him from being productive as an
outfielder, there's no use for him in San Diego or on any National
League club. The DH spot offers a player like him an opportunity,
and Anaheim is as close to his San Diego home as he can get.
</P>
<P>
   It's also worth noting that this year's Angels team has no true
DH. They've used nine players as their DH this season, mostly Scott
Spiezio, who still wants to be an every-day player.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also have a hole in the No. 2 spot in the batting
order, where six players have been used this season.
</P>
<P>
   How about a batting order of 1) Darin Erstad; 2) Gwynn; 3) Mo
Vaughn; 4) Tim Salmon; 5) Garret Anderson; 6) Troy Glaus, etc.?
Angels manager Mike Scioscia refused comment. But he couldn't hide
a smile at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   Money is another big issue. Payroll is obviously a concern for
the Angels, but next season they will save $10.2 million in salary
that is going to Ken Hill and Tim Belcher this season. Take maybe
$3 million or $4 million of that to pay Gwynn, and the Angels are
still up $6-7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, though, isn't simply looking for a paycheck. He doesn't
want to embarrass himself by playing one year too many. Gwynn
started slowly this season, but he got hot before his surgery and
is hitting .323.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hang around,'' he said. ``I'll only keep
playing if I can be productive. If I had my druthers, (San Diego)
is where I would finish playing. But with the situation here now, I
don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about (being a DH). It ain't hard to figure. If I
can swing a bat but have a bad knee and can't run, it's a natural.
If the opportunity presents itself, I'm willing to listen to
whatever anybody's willing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Are the Angels listening?

<P>
   Iwould be like Robin driving the Batmobile. Like Dr. Watson
finally getting to say, ``Elementary, my dear Holmes.'' Like Sancho
Panza tilting at windmills while Don Quixote trails behind him on a
burro.
</P>
<P>
   If George W. Bush asks Sen. John McCain to be his
vice-presidential running mate, it'd be like Gepetto letting
Pinocchio pull the strings, like the Lone Ranger calling Tonto
``kemosabe.''
</P>
<P>
   All across the land, sidekicks would rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. McCain still says he doesn't want the job. But for the
first time, his associates have indicated that if McCain is asked,
or better yet {ndash} begged {ndash} he'd take it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people close to the senator, Rep. Matt Salmon, told
me Friday, ``I believe McCain would take a place on the ticket. And
I believe they'd win.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon was asked why Bush would pick a running mate who'd be
more popular than he is?
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always said if you wanted to be successful, always hire
people who are smarter and more capable than you are,'' Salmon
said. ``They make you look good. If Bush swallows his pride and
takes McCain, I think people will really respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain, in turn, would become the hero of every regular guy
playing Abbott to some clown's Costello, of every working stiff
made to feel like Cheetah by some self-proclaimed Tarzan. Choosing
McCain would be a greater act of unselfishness and generosity than
Wynonna letting Naomi sing lead vocal.
</P>
<P>
   What if Bush (beginitalic)doesn't(enditalic) ask McCain to run
with him? Salmon was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't pick McCain,'' Salmon said, ``he'll get dumped
on by the media because he'll have had a chance to take someone who
virtually locked up the campaign and didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said he believes McCain will be able to handle the role
of vice president because he has been in the military and
understands the importance of maintaining a chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question people are asking is, `Can McCain be Number 2?'''
Salmon said. ``I think he can.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an easy arrangement to picture with past examples like
Nixon and Agnew. Or Kennedy and Johnson. But Bush and McCain?
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way:
</P>
<P>
   If these guys were cartoons, who would be Rocky and who would be
Bullwinkle? Who would be Yogi and who would be Boo Boo? Who would
be Pinky and who would be The Brain?
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a director in Hollywood who'd cast McCain as Barney
Fife to Bush's Andy of Mayberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is to win,'' Salmon said. ``Having gone through a
rough-and-tumble primary, Bush's natural tendencies probably don't
want to include McCain on the ticket. But he also wants to win. I
think this is one of those rare exceptions where a
vice-presidential candidate could make the difference. Al Gore and
the Democrats would have no answer for that ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to make it close, Gore would need a blockbuster second
banana of his own. Someone whose celebrity, competence and
popularity not only rival McCain's but completely outshine Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   For that, Gore likewise will swallow his pride and recognize
that the only person with enough political appeal and name
recognition is Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea.

MORE HOMERS PROVE COSTLY TO ROOKIE GAGNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers' next great pitching
prospect has evolved into their next great project.
</P>
<P>
   Capable of a dazzling performance one inning, and a stupefying
mistake the next, the education of Eric Gagne continued painfully
Saturday in a 5-2 loss to the Giants at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers look at the talented right-hander, watch him wobble
like the 24-year-old rookie he is, and scream patience.
</P>
<P>
   But after Gagne gave up three home runs to bottom of the Giants'
order on a muggy afternoon, he fell to 1-6 and his ERA swelled to
5.59.
</P>
<P>
   For a team trying to chase down the National League West leaders
and coming off a dramatic victory Friday, it made for a sobering
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or another, we need him to get it going,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne was just short of a sensation after a September call-up
last year from Double-A San Antonio, going 1-1 in five starts, with
30 strikeouts in as many innings.
</P>
<P>
   He was quickly dubbed the next great thing. Baseball Weekly
named him the top new impact pitcher for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, he's had his moments, and too many of them bad.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne started Saturday looking like the hot prospect, retiring
the Giants' first five hitters, including a strikeout of Barry
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw the ball like he did in the first inning, and you get
excited,'' Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter said. ``He's throwing the
ball 94 mph, had command, hitting my glove, strikes out one of the
best guys in the league, that's exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you're going to continue to roll. Then you end up
having the guys in the bottom of the order beat you. And that's a
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne started his troubles by giving up a two-out solo home run
to shortstop Rich Aurilia. Armando Rios then doubled to bring up
catcher Bobby Estella, with right-hander Livan Hernandez on deck.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne got ahead of Estella 1-2 ... and threw a curveball over
the plate. Estella jumped on it for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a crucial mistake to the catcher, with the pitcher
coming up,'' Kreuter said. ``That ball had no business being in the
strike zone. Once we have two strikes on him, you make him chase
something out of the zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to hit a ball a foot off the plate to get a base hit.
But a breaking ball basically down the middle of the plate, that's
a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the kind that Gagne hasn't made before. He's given up 18
home runs this season in just 75 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Patience, the Dodgers repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the starts he had last year were really good,'' Johnson
said. ``He's had a few little mechanical problems, been a little
too aggressive. But I still like him a whole lot, and he'll get it
right. Sometimes it just takes a little while.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a refrain even the young right-hander grows weary of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to losing,'' Gagne said. ``We have such a great
team, and we're so close. We need to win right now. I have to be
out there and win. I can't go out there and give up five runs in
five innings. It's real frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says you have to go through all those things, but
you want to perform. You're a baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne also gave up a two-out, two-run homer to Rios in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-0 lead was more than enough for Hernandez (9-7), who held
the Dodgers scoreless until Eric Karros' two-run homer in the
eighth. Robb Nen pitched a scoreless ninth for his 22nd save.

SHOWDOWN AWAITS JOHNSON, GREENE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 San Bernardino Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Michael Johnson felt an Achilles twinge.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene suffered a brain cramp.
</P>
<P>
   And now the greatest rivals in track and field could be matching
vapor trails twice in the span of two hours today in the U.S.
Olympic Trials at Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt my Achilles through the curve, and then it went away,''
Johnson said moments after winning his 200-meter heat in a
day's-best time of 19.89 seconds. ``Hopefully, it will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, meanwhile, made an error in judgment in his 200 heat.
Running smoothly, and well out in front, Greene downshifted into
cruise mode 150 meters into the race, only to have to reignite the
afterburners when threatened by Ramon Clay and Darvis Patton.
</P>
<P>
   Greene barely won, in 20.29 seconds and, because he was only the
fourth-fastest qualifier, was seeded into Johnson's semifinal
today.
</P>
<P>
   The top four in each semi go to the final.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the world 100-meter record holder, and Johnson, the 200
and 400 world-record holder, are in line to meet again in the 200
final. The top three go to the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Greene are 1-1 in their only head-to-head
encounters. Greene won the most recent meeting, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson refused to discuss his pending doubleheader with Greene.
``I'm not going to talk about that,'' Johnson said. ``It's silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene didn't speak at all, bolting Hornet Stadium within
seconds of watching Johnson's heat via TV in the athlete's
cool-down area.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who have waged a war of words for months, engaged in a
boxing-style staredown in the staging area before their heats.
</P>
<P>
   Competitor Brian Lewis said it ``kind of reminded me of a
heavyweight title fight. You know, when you got two guys in each
other's faces. Nobody said anything. They just stared at each
other, and then laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the women's 200, Marion Jones showed anew she is the person
to catch, striding to a 22.62-second mark, a full half-second
faster than reigning world champion (and putative arch-rival) Inger
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Like Greene, Miller was only the fourth-fastest qualifier (at
23.13),and sees Jones in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of all this, the trash-talk,'' Jones said after
running her first 200 of the year. ``If you're going to talk, put
up. If you're going to talk, come to the track and be ready to
race. That's all I'm asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Miller: ``I don't care how anybody else ran, just myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones needs only a top-three finish to take her dream of five
Olympic gold medals (100, 200, long jump, two relays) to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The dual 200 duels cap the busy final day of the trials today,
coming 12 minutes apart, with the women going first, at 5:36 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Saturday before another capacity crowd of
23,000-plus at Hornet Stadium:
</P>
<P>
   --Rising star Angelo Taylor, 21, won the 400-meter hurdles in
47.62 seconds, fastest time in the world this year, but declined to
identify himself as the gold-medal favorite for the Sydney
Olympics. ``I just want to get to the final,'' he said. Eric Thomas
and James Carter also gained Sydney berths.
</P>
<P>
   --Nicole Gamble led an underwhelming field in the women's triple
jump with an effort of 45 feet, 9 inches. She is the only American
guaranteed a spot in the Olympics, because none of the jumpers
reached the Olympic standard of 46-5.
</P>
<P>
   --Former American-record holder Tim Seaman won the 20-kilometer
racewalk in 1 hour, 25 minutes, 41 seconds. Again, none of the
competitors reached the Olympic qualifying mark, so only Seaman
goes to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   --Mark Crear, ranked Nos. 1 or 2 every year since 1995, barely
survived the first round of the 100-meter hurdle prelims with a
13.77-second time. Defending Olympic gold medalist Allen Johnson
was sharper, at 13.42 seconds, but finished second in his heat to
Dominique Arnold, who ran a day's best of 13.36.
</P>
<P>
   --Gail Devers, denied a berth on the sprint squad, charged into
the women's 100-meter hurdles semis with a 12.57 clocking, not far
off her best-of-2000 time of 12.47. Devers is a three-time world
champion in the hurdles, but has never medaled in the event at the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   --World champion Anthony Washington led discus qualifying with a
throw of 219-7. John Godina, fourth in shot put qualifying, had the
second-best mark, at 216-1.

JOHNSON-GREENE PART 1 SHOULD BE ALL MICHAEL'S
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ And so, at the end of weeks of hype and
hubbub, of disses and thats, we interrupt this Olympic Trials
yap-o-thon to bring you, of all things ... a race.
</P>
<P>
   In this corner, weighing in at 175 pounds, generously allowing
for contrived theatrics and accompanying run-on sentences, is the
reigning world champion at 200 meters, Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   In the other corner, wearing many hats _ businessman, part-time
``USA Today'' columnist, millionaire sprinter, Nike show pony _ is
the 1996 gold medalist and the fastest human ever to cover 200
meters, Michael Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   There was a golden moment yesterday, eyewitnesses reported, when
the two sprint supernovas finally crossed orbital paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, over in the warmup area,'' fellow 200 entrant Brian
Lewis recounted. ``Michael kinda walked by Maurice, and then
Maurice walked by Michael. It kinda reminded me of a heavyweight
title fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, nobody said anything. They just stared at each other, and
then they laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike pro wrestling, in other words. Or maybe Mike and Mo
just heard that somebody was asking $1,500 for a ticket to today's
finals on eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway. Somewhere near high noon yesterday here on the
California Ponderosa, Johnson eased into the starting blocks for
the first round of the 200 meters _ and nearly blew the whole
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Placed in lane five of heat No. 4, Johnson arrived at the apex
of the track's turn and _ gasp _ did not have his customary
six-boxcar lead. On the contrary, 21-year-old John Capel, a wide
receiver on the Florida Gators football team, was elbow-to-elbow
with His Goldenness, and they didn't appear to be chatting about
Maurice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt my Achilles cramp a little in the curve,'' Johnson
would say later.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed, perhaps, to be sensing someone's presence without
permission, Michael turned the radio down, accelerated and raced
young Capel to the finish line into the teeth of a mild headwind.
The electronic clock caught him in 19.89, which would have been
enough last year to win the world championships' 200 in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Greene? He had raced in the heat before Johnson's and had found
a similar adventure.
</P>
<P>
   First, understand the format that meet organizers devised for
entrants to advance. There were seven 200-meter heats. To reach
today's semifinals, a runner had to win his heat or have one of the
next nine best times.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there wasn't supposed to be any of the usual
chillin'-and-cruisin', looking-left-and-right,
only-wanted-to-qualify jogs to the tape seen in past trials. But
Greene must have missed the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of the turn, he began to shut it down. Which is when
he noticed TCU's Darvis Patton and Tennessee native Ramon Clay
creeping gently to his right side. Greene accelerated, then Clay
accelerated, and then Greene had to accelerate again.
</P>
<P>
   Greene ended up winning the heat in 20.29, followed by Clay's
20.37 and Patton's 20.40.
</P>
<P>
   When they line up today for the first semifinal heat, Patton
will be in lane three, Greene in lane four and Johnson in lane
five. The top four in each semi will return one hour, 48 minutes
later to compete in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the schedule won't be a problem, but I don't know right
now,'' said Johnson, who declined press interviews but spoke
through a USA Track and Field liaison.
</P>
<P>
   He explained the injury thusly: ``It went away on the straights.
Hopefully, it will be OK. I felt it through the curve, and then it
went away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what to say now. I was able to finish the race.''
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Nothing about tearing out and eating Maurice's heart.
Nothing blamed on any ``USA Today'' copy editors. Just a vague
medical prognosis by Johnson himself, and then an ominous ``I have
to go back and let my trainer look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Michael is hurt, of course, all bets and ebay bids are off.
Greene likes to chirp that he beat Johnson the last time that they
raced, but that was two years ago when the Olympic champion was
nursing a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   As a man who should know said here yesterday, ``It's Maurice who
is going to have to run the exceptional race.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, Ato Boldon of Trinidad, finished third behind Johnson
and won the bronze medal at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael knows a million ways to win a race like this,'' said
Boldon, who trains with Greene in Los Angeles. ``And I don't buy
Maurice's claim that if the race is close, Michael breaks down. I
always defer to the 400-meter sprinter.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it simple handicapping. Greene has never run faster than
19.86 in the 200. Johnson almost ran that yesterday _ with a cramp,
in a first-round heat.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he's healthy, His Goldenness will get the last word,
indeed. nn

WHO SHOULD BE IN ANGELS' CENTER FIELD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ One on, two outs, bottom of the seventh inning. The
A's lead, 9-3, when Jason Giambi hits a rope to the left-center
field gap.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim Angels center fielder Darin Erstad gets a good jump on
the ball, dives and makes a spectacular catch. Such plays have
become commonplace for Erstad, even in late in games when the
outcome essentially has already been decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things just happen,'' Erstad explained. ``I don't ever
think about diving. It just happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It also happens to stir conversation about who should be in
center field -- Erstad or Garret Anderson. Anderson was the DH for
the second game in a row Saturday because of a sore left Achilles
tendon.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no question Erstad is a better center fielder,
manager Mike Scioscia says the outfield as a whole is better with
Erstad in left and Anderson in center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about a lot of different scenarios,'' Scioscia
said. ``Darin obviously is an option in center field, but I feel we
line up well with Garret in center field. I think Garret's played
very good center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk about the couple of plays Garret has made (failing
to back up the right fielder) but Garret is getting good jumps on
the ball, his arm is accurate and he's shutting down runners from
going first to third. It's all part of the package why we think
he's a good major league center fielder.''
</P>
<P>
   About Erstad's catch, Scioscia said: ``Was I surprised? No.
That's Darin Erstad. That play right there is like Andre Dawson
used to play. Brett Butler for years played like that. Dusty Baker.
It does not matter what the score is. When they play, instincts
take over. Get the ball and get the out. I wouldn't expect anything
different from Darin.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it says it all. It's why I think he's the MVP of the
league so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad also had two hits Saturday, raising his major
league-leading total to 160. He's on pace to finish with 264 hits,
which would break George Sisler's 80-year-old major league mark of
257.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus' 29th: Third baseman Troy Glaus hit his 29th homer of the
season Saturday, tying his career-high set last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't witness what happened last year, but this year Troy
Glaus is making footprints as one of the best third baseman in the
league,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Simulated game: Pitcher Kent Mercker, having recovered from a
cerebral hemorrhage suffered May 11, will throw a simulated game
Monday or Tuesday in Texas.

JOHNSON IS NOW A MAYBE FOR RACE WITH GREENE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ After Maurice Greene sprinted the 200-meter
preliminaries in 20.28 seconds Saturday, he rolled his shoulders,
raised a finger in the air and motioned toward Michael Johnson as
if to say, ``Bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Running in the next heat, Johnson did exactly that, finishing in
19.89, within three-hundredths of a second of Greene's career best.
But Johnson felt his right thigh cramp in the middle of the turn,
and his status remained uncertain for Sunday's semifinal and final
rounds, which will be run two hours apart at the Olympic track and
field trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went away on the straights,'' Johnson said of the cramp
after having an ice wrap placed on his thigh. ``Hopefully it's
nothing. I hope the schedule won't be a problem, but I have no way
of knowing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   This 200 meters has become the most anticipated sprint since
Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson met at 100 meters in the final of the
1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Greene is the world's
fastest man, holding the world record of 9.79 seconds at 100
meters. Johnson is the Olympic champion and world record-holder at
200 meters (19.32 seconds) and 400 meters (43.18 seconds). However,
Johnson has frequently injured himself when running fast. His body
is as fine-tuned as a dragster, fragile in its searing speed,
needing much tinkering between performances.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Greene have been placed in the same heat of Sunday's
semifinal, Greene in Lane 4 and Johnson outside in Lane 5. The
sprinters need only to finish among the top four to reach the
final, but they may feel a need to send each other a message, which
could lead to a fast time or could aggravate an injury. There are
no byes or free passes to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney,
Australia. The only way to qualify for the 200 is to finish first,
second or third in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the cramp was a temporary seizure, nothing more. Johnson
cooled down with no problem after Saturday's heat. But the risk is
that he could reinjure himself Sunday, fail to qualify in the 200,
threaten his chances to repeat as Olympic champion at 400 meters
and also jeopardize an opportunity to win a third gold in the
1,600-meter relay. Clyde Hart, Johnson's coach, said a decision
would be made after Johnson warms up for the semifinal round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any doubt that he's not well, I'll recommend he
not run,'' Hart told the Dallas Morning News. ``There's no use
jeopardizing two gold medals to try to get more.''
</P>
<P>
   In track circles, Johnson has faced some skepticism about his
performances in big races, even though he possesses a combination
of speed and power that is unprecedented in the long sprints. He
pulled up with a strained left thigh during a 1997 match race
against Donovan Bailey of Canada, the reigning Olympic champion at
100 meters, leading Bailey to call him chicken and accuse him of
faking the injury. Johnson pulled a hamstring muscle while setting
his 200 world record at the Atlanta Olympics, then withdrew from
the 200 at the 1999 national championships with a strained right
hamstring. Greene has accused Johnson of ducking him. If Johnson
withdraws or pulls up again on Sunday, his motives will again draw
doubts in a sport that thrives on suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Michael sprints, he gets hurt,'' said Ato Boldon of
Trinidad, who finished third to Johnson in the 200 at the Atlanta
Olympics and who trains daily with Greene in Los Angeles. ``You
can't point to a time when Michael ran a really fast 200, and he
did not get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Boldon has picked Johnson to win Sunday's race because he is a
more experienced 200-meter runner than Greene. But, Boldon added:
``If for any reason Michael fails to show or does not finish, I
think it will conjure too many memories of Bailey-Johnson. He will
be seen as someone who can't handle the one-on-one thing. I don't
expect that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On a practice track before Saturday's race, Johnson and Greene
engaged in a stare down, sprinter Brian Lewis said. ``That kind of
reminded me of a heavyweight title fight, when you've got two guys
in each other's faces,'' Lewis said. ``Nobody said anything. They
just stared at each other and then laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   The format of the trials may have contributed to Johnson's
injury, said John Chaplin, who will coach the American men in
Sydney. In previous years, the 200 has been contested over four
rounds. This time, there are only three, leaving more of the top
sprinters grouped in the same early heats. Saturday, only the
winner of each of the seven heats was guaranteed a spot in the
semifinals, so the sprinters had to run faster than they might have
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heats are overstacked,'' Chaplin said.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a lack of experience in his heat, Greene accelerated
through the curve, eased up then sped up again when his lead was
threatened. Such an immature performance could have led to injury.
After saying, ``I'm going to get Michael Johnson'' for the past
week, Greene decided not to speak to reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trash-talking has become so ostentatious that it did
not seem out of place that an Elvis impersonator showed up at the
track Saturday in a gold lame suit. Asked whom he favored, Elvis
said: ``I don't have any opinion on that. If I say so-and-so, the
other guy is going to come and beat me up. I'm pretty vulnerable.
I'm already dead. I can't take any more blows like that.''

 OPEN-TEX 
Bidding for title, Webb is a Tiger 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIBERTYVILLE, Ill. _ Karrie Webb smiled at the analogy, perhaps
for the zillionth time this season. But this time, she conceded,
there is some common ground between her and Tiger Woods heading
into today's final round at the U.S. Women's Open.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, with a 68 in yesterday's third round, reached 7-under par
for the tournament and opened a four-stroke advantage on the field
at the Merit Club. With only two players in red numbers, Webb has a
chance to finish as the lone player at the Open with a sub-par
total. As Woods did while winning last month at Pebble Beach Golf
Links.
</P>
<P>
   If Meg Mallon (3-under) falters, or if Webb goes on another
birdie barrage like she did on yesterday's front nine, the world's
top-ranked female golfer could stretch her victory margin to double
digits. As Woods did at the men's Open in June. Or as Webb did in
March while trouncing the field by 10 strokes at the Nabisco
Championship, the LPGA Tour's first major of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Like Webb, Woods also has a chance to record a landslide victory
today. The world's top-ranked male golfer leads the British Open by
six strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods hasn't coughed up a final-round lead at a PGA Tour event
since 1996. Webb has won seven consecutive LPGA Tour events when
she's held at least a two-stroke lead heading into the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, the smart money is on a Woods-Webb daily double
in today's dueling major championships. For both players, it would
mark their third triumph in the past four major championships
played on their respective tours.
</P>
<P>
   Karrie, can you say ``common ground?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty uncanny that it has been so similar,'' Webb said,
when asked about comparisons to Woods. ``I think about that all the
time. But that's as far as it goes. It's hard to compare two
players that don't play against one another.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also harder to count Webb's situation at the Merit Club as
a closed book. Mallon, after all, is a two-time major champion who
won the 1991 Open and held the 36-hole lead. Webb changed that with
four birdies in her first seven holes yesterday, eventually
stretching the lead to five by the time Mallon reached the 15th tee
box.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon responded with consecutive birdies, moving to 5-under,
and crept within two strokes when Webb bogeyed No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the 17th took its toll on Mallon as well. She
drove into the left rough, chipped back into the fairway, then
pushed her approach into the right rough. From there, Mallon
chipped to 30 feet and two-putted for double-bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made two mistakes on the same hole, and there's no excuse
for that,'' Mallon said, referring to the drive and approach that
found the rough. ``I can't go out and make the same mistakes and
expect to win the tournament. I have to play my smartest round of
golf and take advantage of every opportunity. That's the only way
that I can catch Karrie and beat her.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the field, for all practical purposes, considers
itself little more than window dressing unless Webb implodes. Laura
Davies heads a four-player group at even-par, seven strokes off the
pace, but conceded Mallon is the only person in position to put
heat on Webb, unless Webb suffers self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat Karrie, you have to be better yourself,'' Davies said.
``You can't expect her to make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, for one, doesn't expect any free rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of weird things happen at the Open,'' Mallon
said. ``But you don't expect them to happen to Karrie. She's got
the best head of anyone out here. I'm going to have to take some
chances and try to make some birdies early on.''
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely the game plan that propelled Webb into the
lead. During her first seven holes, Webb buried birdie putts of 15,
12, 10 and 10 feet. She added an 18-footer at No. 10 and a
20-footer at No. 15, which were offset by two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, I played pretty solidly,'' Webb said. ``If I can
do that again, and that means I get to hold the trophy, I'll be
very happy.''

DEVIL RAYS BEAT YANKEES, 12-4 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In desperate search of his second victory of the
year, David Cone has experimented with every kind of adjustment,
from tempo to grip to stance. Saturday he rolled his newest
concoction out of the lab: an Orlando Hernandez clone.
</P>
<P>
   Cone hiked his navy socks up high and adopted the El Duque high
leg kick, hoping to change his luck, break his string of futility
and recover his dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for something different,'' he said with
resignation. ``It was a semi-tribute to my idol.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone struck out the first two batters of the game, but he gave
up a home run to the third, Greg Vaughn, and it was as if nothing
had changed. Even so, he recovered and pitched effectively. He even
retired nine straight batters, in the third, fourth and fifth
innings. He gave up three runs and six hits, struck out five, and
left after spotting the Tampa Bay Devil Rays a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' bullpen proceeded to unravel. Jeff Nelson and Jason
Grimsley allowed five of the nine remaining runs, and the offense,
no matter how much it was pressing to win for Cone, could not
provide enough support to erase his loss.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay pounded the Yankees, 12-4, and Cone got the loss. His
record dropped to 1-9 _ he hasn't won since April 28 _ and the
Yankees have not won in his last 11 starts, a dismal franchise
record that is destroying his pride.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was much improved from his last outing, when he
gave up six runs in five innings, Cone took no comfort in Saturday.
``It's not good enough,'' he said. ``I lost.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. ``Again.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the tinkering, he has not found his answer. ``It's a
ball of confusion for me right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not alone Saturday. ``Cone definitely pitched better
than the end result,'' said Grimsley, who gave up Jose Canseco's
double and back-to-back walks on eight straight pitches to begin
the Devil Rays' seven-run eighth inning. ``We had a chance to win
the ballgame and I didn't do my job. I didn't throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Nelson, who came on in the seventh and allowed the Devil
Rays to widen their lead to 5-2 by giving up two runs on two walks
and a single. The Yankees had a chance to tie in the seventh
inning, when Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill each had run-scoring
singles. With runners on first and third, Bernie Williams struck
out on a contested at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   On a 2-1 pitch by the Tampa Bay left-handed reliever Mark
Guthrie, Williams seemed to question Umpire Terry Craft's strike
call, as did Manager Joe Torre. When Williams struck out, ending
the inning, he turned to Craft and asked if he had fouled off the
pitch. Guthrie walked off the field, seemingly telling Williams to
keep quiet, and Williams mouthed that he was not addressing him.
Lee Mazzilli, the Yankees' first-base coach, rushed to restrain
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Einertson relieved Grimsley in the eighth. He gave up
two quick hits, and then Jeter's error on a force-out throw loaded
the bases. After Vaughn fouled out, Fred McGriff knocked a single
into center field. Williams ran slowly to the ball, assuming it
would be a two-run single, but that allowed another run to cross.
Bubba Trammell ended the scoring with a single that put the Devil
Rays ahead, 12-4.
</P>
<P>
   Cone did not see the score, only his mistakes. ``It's a broken
record,'' he said. ``We're not winning on days I pitch, regardless
of what my personal numbers are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won just 5 of Cone's 18 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Torre was encouraged. ``I thought he was a lot better,''
Torre said. ``He pitched out of jams and his fastball had life. It
was disappointing we let it get away.''
</P>
<P>
   The day began auspiciously for Cone. After his first two
strikeouts though, he threw a 3-1 fastball to Vaughn, who belted it
for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a microcosm of my season,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth straight game in which Cone had given up a
home run, and his ninth allowed in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Cone gave up a leadoff walk to Canseco.
After striking out Steve Cox, he gave up a ground-rule double to
John Flaherty. Miguel Cairo then fisted a singled past the left
side of the infield to give Tampa Bay a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees inched back into the game. David Justice,
playing left field again, singled in the second inning to extend
his hitting streak to 10 games. Tino Martinez followed with another
single and, after designated hitter Jorge Posada popped up to
second base, Chris Turner, who has turned into Cone's personal
catcher, helped his pitcher with a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch tied the game at 2-2 when he led off the third
inning by cranking a 2-0 pitch from Tampa Bay starter Ryan Rupe
(2-4) for his fifth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is enough for Cone right now. ``I've got no quit,'' Cone
said. ``I'm going to fight to the bitter end.''

REAL ESTATE: PLAY IT SAFE WITH GAS IN THE HOME
</HEADLINE>
  By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  While accidents caused by gas leaks in homes are relatively rare,
when they do occur they can be devastating. Here are some tips for
dealing with gas appliances and equipment in and around your house
or apartment.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``When gas lines and gas appliances are installed and maintained
properly, they're not going to be a problem,'' said Ralph DiBiase,
the service manager of Public Service Electric and Gas, a utility
company based in Newark, N.J. ``But when you're dealing with gas,
you can never take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   One way natural gas can pose a potential problem for a
homeowner, DiBiase said, is when there is a leak or break in the
gas pipe buried outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because gas is lighter than air, it seeks the path of least
resistance into the atmosphere,'' he said. ``That means that if
there is a leak in the gas line running from the street to the
house, and the gas is looking for the path of least resistance,
that path might be through a crack in the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the chances of an exterior gas leak making its way into
the house through the foundation are unlikely under ordinary
circumstances, he said, the possibility increases in winter because
the frozen ground could prevent the leaking gas from rising out of
the ground and instead force it to migrate toward the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, DiBiase said, if underground gas lines are left
undisturbed, they are not likely to develop leaks. Unfortunately,
they are not always left undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, a homeowner or worker digging outside the
house _ installing anything from a fence post to a swimming pool _
could strike and damage an underground utility pipe. While most
such pipes are buried at least three feet underground to be below
the frost line and protected from freeze-thaw cycles, a previous
owner could have changed the grading of the land or the pipe could
have been buried closer to the surface because of topographical
considerations or soil conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, DiBiase said, a homeowner or contractor digging
where pipes or power lines may be buried should call the utility
companies that service the house to determine exactly where the
utilities are located.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Yutkowitz, a spokesman for the Keyspan Corp., the Brooklyn,
N.Y., company that provides natural gas service to about 1.6
million homes in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island,
said gas lines and appliances inside the house are also potential
problems. As a result, he said, all gas appliances should be kept
clean and well maintained and should be inspected regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Ovens should be checked to ensure that all pilot lights are lit
and stay lit and that all burners work properly, Yutkowitz said.
Flames on gas appliances should burn blue, not yellow or orange.
``Any color other than blue means that the gas is not burning
properly,'' he said, explaining that improper combustion in a gas
appliance can produce dangerous levels of carbon monoxide, a
colorless, odorless and potentially deadly gas.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners should also be careful when moving stoves and clothes
dryers because they are usually connected to the gas supply by what
is known as a flex connector. That connector, designed to bend
without kinking, can develop leaks if stretched too far or bent too
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the flex hose is old or deteriorated, you might want to
have it replaced,'' Yutkowitz said, adding that Keyspan maintains
lists of contractors who can be hired to perform such services.
</P>
<P>
   Most homeowners, he said, first detect a gas leak by smelling
it. (While natural gas has no odor of its own, a chemical is added
to give it its distinct aroma.) Other things can also indicate a
potential gas problem.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no gas or the pressure is low (indicated by a low
flame) at all of a home's gas appliances, that could indicate a
leak in the line elsewhere in the house or outside. Another danger
sign would be the inability to shut off gas to an appliance or
heating unit.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, and whenever the smell of gas is detected in a
house, Yutkowitz said, the homeowner should immediately leave,
being careful not to smoke, light matches or operate any electrical
appliances or switches on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to, you can open doors and windows before you
leave, but just make sure you avoid doing anything that could
create a spark, including picking up the telephone,'' he said,
adding that once outside the house the homeowner should use a
public telephone or a neighbor's telephone to call 911 and the
local utility company. Homeowners should not use a cordless phone
to make the call, he said, since that would activate the base unit
inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Spear, director of education and safety for the National
Propane Gas Association, a trade organization based in Lisle, Ill.,
said similar cautions and procedures should be used with appliances
fueled by propane gas. ``Propane is widely used in areas where
natural gas is not available,'' she said, explaining that the fuel,
derived from natural gas and is stored in liquid form in metal
cylinders, also has an odor added to it so that it is recognizable
if it leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike natural gas, however, propane is slightly heavier than
air and dissipates more slowly. As a result, Spear said, if propane
leaks from a tank or an appliance, it can accumulate on the floor
in combustible concentrations, even in a room that is ventilated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good idea to use propane above the first floor of a
building,'' she said, explaining that if a tank is dropped and the
valve is broken or leaks, the gas could escape and drift down
stairways to the floors below.
</P>
<P>
   Spear added that all propane tanks should be inspected regularly
for rust and corrosion and to ensure that their valves are
operating properly. Moreover, she said, propane tanks should never
be filled to more than 80 percent of their capacity and should
always be stored outside.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners should also make sure that appliances that are to be
used with propane or natural gas have the proper burners installed
for the type of fuel being used. For example, Spear said, a clothes
dryer or barbecue grill that is set up to be used with propane fuel
cannot simply be attached to a natural gas line without changing
the orifice size of the burner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the orifice size isn't correct, that can potentially lead
to high levels of carbon monoxide,'' she said, adding that the
conversion, as well as any work on gas lines or appliances, should
be done by a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bellini, vice president of Varsity Plumbing and Heating
in Flushing, agreed. ``Homeowners think that if they can buy
something at Home Depot, they can legally install it,'' he said.
``But any time you are working on gas lines or installing new gas
equipment or appliances, you need a licensed plumber to do it and
he has to take out a permit.''
</P>
<P>
   And while it is legal for homeowners to replace existing gas
appliances themselves, Bellini said, it is not necessarily wise to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Messing around with gas lines is one thing you really don't
want a handyman to do,'' he said. ``Even when the handyman is
you.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending July 15 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; HOME TOWN &LR; , by Tracy Kidder. (Washington Square/Pocket Books,
$14.95.) Through personal profiles and historical and demographic
digressions, the author takes the pulse of Northampton, Mass., a
city of 30,000 highly diverse people. Most of the natives leave
when they reach adulthood, and are replaced by newcomers. Kidder's
``smart and gently ironic writing is always good company,'' Ben
Yagoda wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOUSE &LR; , by David Grand. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.) This satirical
tale of a monstrous tycoon modeled on the aging Howard Hughes and
the loyal valet who tends to his boss's increasingly eccentric
demands mirrors the plight of workers in an era of job insecurity
and corporate brainwashing. The result is ``a delightfully eerie
and angry first novel,'' David Sacks wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TRUE ADVENTURES OF THE ROLLING STONES &LR; , by Stanley Booth.
(A Cappella, $16.95.) This backstage account of the band's 1969
tour and the author's own seduction by the group's dark allure is
also a personal vision of how the 1960s, from Vietnam to Altamont,
shaped an era. ``It is the only book about the Stones that I would
recommend both to the general reader and to the most devoted fan,''
Robert Palmer wrote in 1984. ``Both will find an epiphany on almost
every page.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; FAITHFULL: An Autobiography &LR; , by Marianne Faithfull with
David Dalton (Cooper Square, $16.95), the singer, '60s survivor and
serial Rolling Stone paramour recounts her many love affairs with
men, women and controlled substances. Her narrative is filled with
``spicy stories about Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Bob Dylan,''
David Kelly wrote in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HUMMINGBIRD HOUSE &LR; , by Patricia Henley. (MacMurray &AMP; Beck,
$13.) This first novel is about a burned-out American midwife
working in Central America who seems to find her true cause in
fighting the Guatemalan government's persecution of the country's
indigenous Mayan people. ``Henley does a fine job of demonstrating
the cost of compassion,'' Jeannie Pyun wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SOPRANOS &LR; , by Alan Warner. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) This
tender novel follows a pack of choirgirls from rural Scotland as
they embark on an odyssey of carousing while in the big city for a
singing contest. ``It's refreshing to read a novel loaded down with
teen-age drinking, smoking, swearing and the urge for sex ... and
be spared the moralizing that usually goes along with these
activities,'' Charles Taylor wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TALES OF FISHING VIRGIN SEAS &LR; , by Zane Grey. (Derrydale,
$19.95.) The acclaimed writer of westerns was also an insatiable
angler and a passionate naturalist, as this illustrated account of
his sailing trips throughout the Pacific reveals. ``Anyone who
loves tales of adventure into far seas, unusual experiences,
accounts of exotic and almost intoxicating beauty, to say nothing
of those enthusiastic fishermen for whose perusal the book is
especially intended, will find it a fascinating volume,'' The New
York Times Book Review said in 1926.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MOLLIE PEER: Or, The Underground Adventure of the Moosepath
League &LR; , by Van Reid. (Penguin, $12.95.) This sequel to ``Cordelia
Underwood: Or, The Marvelous Beginnings of the Moosepath League''
describes the continuing exploits of a Dickensian collection of
journalists, journeymen, smugglers, baseball players, barkeeps,
crooks and street urchins at loose in late 19th-century Maine. The
result is ``a thoroughly easygoing and entertaining'' novel, Betsy
Groban wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ADDIE: A Memoir &LR; , by Mary Lee Settle. (Berkley, $13.) By
casting her autobiography as a memoir about her grandmother, whose
out-of-wedlock pregnancy scandalized turn-of-the-century West
Virginia, the novelist explores the way one understands truth by
indirection. ``Settle has preserved for us a moment in the South's
history palpable as the trumpet vines and rocking chairs of a
long-departed front-porch afternoon,'' Angeline Goreau wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE DRINK &LR; , by Kate Christensen. (Anchor, $12.) Claudia
Steiner could be Bridget Jones' darker twin: struggling to pay the
rent on her studio apartment by toiling as a ghostwriter to an
insane New York socialite, she can't keep from crawling through
some of the city's meaner streets. Last year the reviewer Vanessa
Grigoriadis called this a ``breezy and confident first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A SHORT HISTORY OF RUDENESS: Manners, Morals, and Misbehavior
in Modern America &LR; , by Mark Caldwell. (Picador USA, $13.) A
literary critic surveys social behavior, past and present, and
finds that while manners change over time, they are basically no
worse today than they used to be. Last year the reviewer Naomi
Bliven called this a ``modest, readable, intelligent and
companionable'' book.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: CREATING AN ONLINE LEASE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Falus said he was feeling a lot like Chuck Yeager these
days. Just like the first man to break the sound barrier in
aviation, Falus is trying to push the envelope of real estate
transactions by helping develop a system for doing the
often-complex deals over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, one of the largest commercial
real estate brokerages in the country, recently signed a contract
with Zethus Inc. to conduct leasing transactions online starting
next year. Zethus, which is based in Houston, is backed by the
Goldman Sachs Group, the Wall Street investment banking firm, which
has extensive links to real estate. Zethus officials have said the
system will require an investment of $40 million to $50 million
before its launch.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zethus is one of hundreds of companies trying to adapt
Internet technology to the real estate market (a recent report by
Credit Suisse First Boston listed 214), Falus said he thought it
had the best chance of developing a Nasdaq-like market for leasing
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are following a long-term business strategy,'' said Falus,
who is president of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield's new ventures group. ``We
think we have partnered with the best and the brightest in the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Falus acknowledged that in order to trade real estate like
stocks or bonds, standards would have to be developed so that terms
and descriptions of available space in different locations would be
comparable. ``All parties can agree that a foot is 12 inches, rent
is rent, and so forth'' he said. He noted that real estate debt
documentation had been standardized sufficiently to permit the
development of the commercial mortgage-backed securities market.
</P>
<P>
   Describing how such a system would work, Falus said: ``We could
put a request for proposals out on the Internet to landlords who
have space available. We could say that Cushman &AMP; Wakefield
represents a Standard &AMP; Poors AA rated tenant in the financial
services field that needs X thousand square feet in these locations
on a 10-year lease. The bidding closes at 12 p.m. next Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that it will be possible to simplify lease
transactions so they can trade like commodities. One doubter is
Julien J. Studley, chairman of the company bearing his name and the
dean of tenant brokers. He said there were too many twists and
turns in large commercial leases to trade office space like winter
wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to decide what it is you are buying,'' he said. One
example, he said, is the details attached to landlord allowances
for interior construction. ``If he gives you a certain amount of
money, the question is, how can you spend it? Do you have to use
his contractor? If you are free to use any contractor, do you have
to give back 20 percent? And how do you know that, after five
years, the guy next door has the right to take your space?''
</P>
<P>
   Studley said automated markets were most likely to develop for
very small spaces, where tenants have trouble attracting the
attention of brokers and value the speed of moving into a location
over the nuances of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew L. Farkas, the chairman of Insignia Financial Group,
which owns and manages commercial and residential properties and
supplies brokerage and other services, agreed that an automated
market might develop for smaller spaces, which he defined as
``15,000 square feet and south.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that, for the most part, ``the Internet will not
close transactions; people will close transactions over the
Internet.'' Nevertheless, he said, the perceived role of the broker
may change, and the commission structure may change to reflect
services, such as tax analysis, other than matching up buyers and
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value proposition has been seen as the place where supply
meets demand,'' he said. ``In fact that is the least important
aspect of sophisticated brokerage services.''
</P>
<P>
   James A. Hime, the chief executive of Zethus (the name comes
from a demigod in Greek mythology), said the system would be open
to all parties in commercial transactions and would be marketed to
the real estate officials of larger corporations. ``These companies
have hundreds and thousands of leases and corporate real estate
officers are beset by all this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The system, he said, would be programmed to notify these
officials of lease expirations well in advance of the need to make
a decision, and present them with alternative locations in the
market. Although the system will be capable of handling
transactions directly between a landlord and tenant without a
broker, he said, the expectation is that such deals will be
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``After much thought and discussion with corporate real estate
officers, we were persuaded that, while the technology would permit
principal-to-principal transactions, they will be the exception
rather than the rule,'' Hime said. ``Even with the best data base,
only someone who is in the market every day really understands
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said real estate professionals were like lawyers and
investment bankers, whose skills in making a legal argument or
structuring a deal are as important as filing a suit or selling
securities. ``Brains are still valuable,'' he said. ``The place for
the expert is secure for the future, even as new technology makes
them more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expected some resistance to on-line transactions by
brokers accustomed to conventional approaches. But he likens it to
the way lawyers at his old firm of Baker &AMP; Botts reacted to the
installation of Lexus terminals giving access to legal data. ``At
first they were seen as a back-up to the books in the law
library,'' he said. ``Five years later it was reversed. I consulted
the Lexus terminal while I was on the telephone with clients.''
</P>
<P>
   The changing value of information and expertise led Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield earlier this year to sell its nationwide database on
properties, rental rates and vacancies to a company formerly known
as RELocate, now doing business as RealtyIQ.com.
</P>
<P>
   Falus said the sale was a recognition that the value of
gathering and storing information had diminished at a time when
information will be widely available commercially on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cushman &AMP; Wakefield wants to be positioned at the highest
value-added points in the real estate business,'' he said. ``In the
past we gathered and disseminated information. Once we realized
that there were going to be companies specializing in information,
we decided we did not have to do it ourselves. There are better
uses for our financial capital and our human capital.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this thinking was also behind the linkup with Goldman
Sachs and Zethus. ``We are consumers of technology, but we are not
a technology company. We have capital, but as a private company we
have to use it sparingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for an alliance with an entity that knew about
technology and had access to capital inevitably led to Wall Street,
Falus said. The search for one that also knew about real estate and
transactions led to Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet-dependent services due to hit the market shortly
are not as far-reaching as the Zethus plan. Farkas said Insignia,
which launched EdificeRex, a portal of Internet services, for its
residential tenants in February, would start rolling out RexOffice
for its commercial properties next month. He said the service would
offer e-mail, instant messaging, calendars, community announcements
and concierge functions, like reserving tickets to events.
</P>
<P>
   He said tenants too small to set up their own intranets for
employees could have what appeared to be their own Web pages. ``The
Widget Co.'s Web page will look like it is owned by the Widget
Co.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Community buying services will also be possible, he said. As an
example, he gave tenants in a building who buy bottled water from
multiple vendors, each with it own delivery schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you have 70 tenants in a building, each buying 50 to 70
gallons a month,'' he said. ``The system would accumulate all those
order and put out a request for proposals and buy all the water
from one vendor and one delivery. That is a more efficient way to
do things.''

Woods sets up British grand finale
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ Theoretically, it could go either way today
in the final round of the Millennium Open Championship.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the genesis of a rivalry. More likely, it will be
nothing more than another Sunday victory lap for Tiger Woods as he
goes for the Claret Jug-ular and the career Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval made a big charge Saturday with a superb 6-under-par
66 at the Old Course and finally finds himself paired with Tiger
Woods in the final round of a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   But if it is a rivalry being born, it will start as a
long-distance affair. There is an awful lot of air between the
world's two top-ranked players on the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   If Duval could see anything other than Woods' tail lights, it
might really be something special today. At the least, it will mark
the first time they have played together in the final round of any
tournament. That it will happen at historic St. Andrews in the
129th British Open seems apt.
</P>
<P>
   Duval sank a six-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole to get to 10
under par for the tournament. That shot wound up securing his spot
alongside Woods. The bad news is that he is six strokes behind
Woods, who shot 67 Saturday, yet saw his lead double in size as his
closest pursuers faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I had a very good chance of getting into
the last group at 9 under,'' Duval said. ``I most definitely wanted
to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a circus. It'll be exciting. It'll be a slugfest.
Whatever you want to call it, I wanted to be sure I gave myself the
best chance to get there. To get in the last group of the oldest
tournament in the world with the player who is undoubtedly the best
in the world right now is an experience you want to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can swing the golf club like I have the last few days and
putt like I have, I can show him I've got a little game going right
now, too.''
</P>
<P>
   From Woods' perspective, the battle will be more with himself
than with Duval. He ensured that by calmly negating his first two
bogeys of the tournament with seven birdies. Woods survived three
three-putts, including one at the 17th, the Road Hole.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he is only a 69 away from beating Nick Faldo's St.
Andrews record of 18 under par set in 1990. Woods already owns the
scoring records at Augusta National (in 1997) and Pebble Beach
(this year). Shooting that number also would serve to shut out any
hope for Duval or Thomas Bjorn, who also is at 10 under par.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks like somebody out there is playing golf on
a different planet than the rest of us,'' Bjorn said. ``If you
shoot three rounds under 70 at St. Andrews (which Bjorn has done),
you're not doing so bad. Unfortunately for the rest of us, Tiger is
doing something that's just a different class.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt we're playing for second place. Unless some
of us go out there and make five or six birdies in the first six
holes well, St. Andrews has pulled off a lot of strange things in
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   This might be too much, however. Woods on Saturday briefly
showed his human side, making a bogey on the second hole when he
three-putted from 25 feet, botching a four-foot comebacker. But he
came back on the third hole with a birdie from 12 feet. Then he got
hit in the middle of the round after Ernie Els, Steve Flesch and
David Toms had gotten within close range of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   He slammed a 6-iron to within 18 inches on the par-3 eighth and
ran in a 15-footer on the ninth. He then birdied three in a row
starting on the 12th. Even when his lead slipped to five strokes
with the bogey at the 17th, he followed it with a birdie from 10
feet on the last hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of mess-ups on the card, but overall it was a
good day,'' he said. ``It (his position) is not bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to enjoy it. David and I are great friends. I know
the public has always been wanting to have Nos. 1 and 2 playing
each other in the final round of a major. We have that opportunity.
We're going to enjoy each other's company and give it everything we
have to try to beat each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval's showing on Saturday was impressive on many fronts. He
has been fighting a back strain that has bugged him since the week
after the U.S. Open. Plus, staring at a seven-shot deficit at the
start of the day can take the starch out of anybody.
</P>
<P>
   But birdie putts from 20 feet on the eighth and 10 feet on the
ninth highlighted a 32 on the front nine. And he never came close
to making a bogey on the way in. His 66 tied Bob May and Bernhard
Langer for the low score of the day, as well as the lowest of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was the best day I've felt all week,'' Duval said. ``For
the most part, I played pain-free. Oddly enough, coming in with a
back sprain, I really felt like I had regained my touch on the
greens. That's really important, as we all know. And it's something
that had been missing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval knows that he has a difficult, if not impossible, task
ahead of him today. He could shoot another 66 and still not get
close to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be trying to win my first major championship and
he's going to be going for the slam,'' Duval said. ``So there's
going to be some pressures on both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, probably not nearly as much on Woods. When you've got a
comfort zone the size of the Atlantic Ocean, it is easy to go out
swinging freely. Woods had a nine-shot lead at Augusta in 1997 and
was up by 10 last month at Pebble Beach after 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had big leads before and I've been able to succeed
before,'' he said. ``But we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Others took that comment as only so much posturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only pressure that comes to him is from himself,'' Bjorn
said, ``because he's trying to win the Grand Slam of golf.''

Rose rules Cooperstown, but not as Hall of Famer
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By RICHARD JUSTICE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Pete Rose sits at a table, greeting a line of
fans that begins inside his covered tent and snakes along the wall
of one building and around the corner of another. Men, women and
children of all ages began gathering an hour before his scheduled
arrival, and by the time baseball's hit king stepped from a
Mercedes sedan, some had been standing in a steady rain for close
to 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone seems to mind. They've come from Columbus and
Boston and Macon and other places. They've come with kids for Rose
to be photographed with and for the chance to get Rose to sign
their bats, balls, pictures, game programs and scrapbooks. They've
come for the opportunity to share a memory in the 30 seconds or so
they get with him.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on Main Street, there's a carnival atmosphere as a guy
chants: ``Pete Rose signing autographs! Pete Rose signing
autographs!'' When fans approach, they are directed to a table
selling the tickets required to get in the line that leads to Rose.
Purchase a $35 ticket, and Rose will sign your baseball. For $45,
he'll autograph a batting helmet. And for $70, he'll add his
signature to your bat or lithograph.
</P>
<P>
   For three hours, Rose, wearing a red Nike T-shirt and rolls of
gold jewelry on both wrists, works methodically, signing hundreds
of autographs, trading small talk, smiling for pictures and mostly
just listening and smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete, how much would you charge me for a hug?'' asks Pat Smith
of York, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Rose grins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's got to be worth $75,'' he jokes while motioning
her to come around the table.
</P>
<P>
   As Smith wraps her arms around him, Rose playfully screams:
``Now watch where you put your hands!''
</P>
<P>
   Another fan shows off a ball Rose has just signed and jokes that
his hands are still shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid $35 for his autograph,'' Jeff Morfolk of Columbus,
Ohio, says, ``and it was worth every penny of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Morfolk are among the thousands who've gathered in
this picturesque village in the rolling hills of upstate New York
for the Baseball Hall of Fame's annual induction ceremonies.
They've come to cheer as two more members of the Big Red Machine _
manager Sparky Anderson and first baseman Tony Perez _ are
enshrined today along with Red Sox/White Sox catcher Carlton Fisk
and two posthumous inductees, former Negro League star Turkey
Stearnes and 19th-century Reds player Bid McPhee.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans have also come to catch a glimpse of baseball's
most famous exile _ Peter Edward Rose.
</P>
<P>
   With Hall of Famers ranging from Willie Mays to Duke Snider to
Frank Robinson selling their autographs outside the book shops and
souvenir stores lining Main Street, it's Rose who draws the biggest
crowds. He arrived on Friday, and by the time he leaves Monday, he
will have signed thousands of autographs and pocketed thousands of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' Rose asks. ``Maybe I wouldn't be so popular if I
were in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his popularity, Rose knows he will not in the Hall any
time soon. Commissioner Bud Selig has indicated he has no intention
of ever lifting Rose's lifetime ban because of what he sees as
overwhelming evidence that Rose bet on big-league games while he
was managing the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the integrity of this game very seriously,'' Selig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rose has vigorously denied ever betting on major-league games,
although he declined the opportunity to cross-examine any of the
witnesses or refute any of the evidence during baseball's 1989
investigation that led to his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball had the goods on him, and he knows it,'' said chief
investigator John Dowd. ``You've got the betting records, where he
recorded the results of the games in his own handwriting. We had 10
separate witnesses who saw him betting on the Cincinnati Reds. We
had the betting records recovered from bookmakers. He told Bob
Costas he'd never seen the evidence. We spent two days in Dayton in
1989, and I showed Pete all the evidence. He simply couldn't handle
it. We made 113 witnesses available to him and his lawyers. They
never interviewed one of them. The report is uncontradicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rose remains a compelling figure, especially
during a weekend like this one when he stations himself a few yards
from the stately building from which he is banned. Anderson and
Perez will join Joe Morgan and Johnny Bench as the third and fourth
members of the Big Red Machine to be inducted. Along with Rose,
they were the heart of a team that won six division titles, four
pennants and two World Series in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he retired as a player in 1986, Rose had established
himself as one of the game's greatest players and fiercest
competitors. His 4,256 career hits are the most in history, and
they provide the footnote to almost every autograph he gives: Pete
Rose _ 4256.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rose, he seems in an upbeat mood this weekend even as he
adamantly refuses to admit he ever bet on a big-league game. He
does vaguely admit to ``mistakes,'' but insists that an 11-year ban
is enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, how long am I going to be punished?'' he asked. ``I've
lost millions; I've been to prison (for tax evasion); I've been
banned from baseball. I can't go to games. I think I've been
punished enough. Maybe you disagree. I know some people do.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bart Giamatti died eight days after suspending Rose
in 1989. Said Rose in a remark directed at Selig: ``If Bart were
alive, I think he'd have given me a second chance. He was a fair
man. We'll never know that, will we? Bud is afraid to make a move
because of his friendship with Bart. That's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the hundreds of fans awaiting the chance to get his
autograph, Rose said: ``Public opinion has snowballed for me. Fans
realize I made mistakes. They know I've paid for my mistakes.
They're willing to turn the page. But I understand the situation. I
just hope I don't get in after I'm dead. That would be empty. It's
important, but it's going to be more important to my kids who never
saw me play. I know what kind of player I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose goes out of his way, however, to say how happy he is for
Anderson and Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously special to me,'' he said. ``They are dear
friends. Sparky was the best manager I ever played for. Dog
(Perez's nickname) was the best clutch hitter I ever played with.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose is already in the Hall of Fame in a sense, because his
uniform, batting helmet and jersey are hanging in a display case
honoring his Cincinnati teams.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he has become something of a martyr despite the
evidence against him. He received the loudest ovation last fall
when he was introduced as a member of the All-Century team before
Game 1 of the World Series. And when baseball forbade him from
taking part in a 25th-anniversary celebration of the 1975 Reds, a
mention of Rose drew the longest and loudest cheers of the evening.
A drawing of Rose's jersey hung from the owner's box at Cinergy
Field, and Perez's wife Pituka wore a handmade button bearing
Rose's No. 14 and the inscription, ``For love and respect.''
Current Reds shortstop Barry Larkin provided the final punctuation
mark in the celebration by placing a rose at third base to
commemorate Rose's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is whatever he did that was wrong, he did as a
manager,'' Anderson said. ``Nobody could ever find a single thing
he did when he was a player. Believe me, he was the hardest-playing
player I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Perez: ``For Pete not to be here is something I don't
understand. I think he belongs here.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bench and others have been harsh in their criticism of
Rose, saying he's now sleeping in a bed of his own making. Even
some of the 47 Hall of Famers back for this weekend's ceremony
wrestle with the issue of Rose and the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just on his credentials, he gets in,'' Fergie Jenkins said.
``The problem is he agreed to a lifetime ban. And Pete has never
apologized for what he did. I guess he's too proud. I think if he'd
done that, there's no doubt he'd be in the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his presence this weekend might detract from Anderson
and Perez, Rose said: ``I won't bother them. Those guys know how I
feel about them. I won't steal their thunder. There are 50 Hall of
Famers here. Bench will be here. Morgan will be here. Those guys
know I won't steal their show. I'm me, and they're them. It would
be stealing their thunder if I went to the induction. Let me
explain something. If I got the feeling I wasn't wanted, I'd never
come back here. I get the warmest reception you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Rose is interrupted by a fan pointing toward the Hall
of Fame building and screaming: ``Pete! You should be down the
street!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean that Chinese restaurant?'' Rose shouts back. ``Yeah,
I'm going there tonight!''

Astros pummel Cards, give Miller first victory
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Baseball is indeed a funny game, although it hasn't put many smiles
on the Astros' faces this season.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after being pummeled with their hottest
pitcher on the mound, the Astros served payback to the St. Louis
Cardinals on Saturday behind a breakout offensive performance and a
pitcher starting for just the fourth time in his big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tied a season high with 17 hits, and rookie
righthander Wade Miller notched his first win in a 10-5 romp over
the National League Central leaders. It was a game that wasn't as
close as the score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros played like this every day, they certainly
wouldn't have the worst record in the majors. They scored five runs
in the first inning and put the game on ice with four more in the
fourth, winning for just the fourth time in 10 games since the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   A man of Drayton McLane Jr.'s stature no doubt received more
valuable birthday presents Saturday. But there was perhaps none the
Astros owner could have used more than a victory by his struggling
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' the 23-year-old Miller said when told the
significance of the day. ``Well, happy birthday, Drayton.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also couldn't have had any idea he would be blessed with
so much run support one day after the Astros and Scott Elarton took
a 12-1 beating from the Cardinals. Nevertheless, Miller was the
beneficiary of a four-run lead before many in the fourth
consecutive sellout crowd at Enron Field had found their seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good when the team goes out and gets a big lead
early like that,'' Miller said. ``When that happens, you can just
go right after the hitters. It seemed like we were scoring two or
three runs every inning. I just tried to stay focused and throw
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't seem to be much of a problem. For most of the day,
Miller had his way with a dangerous lineup, perfectly spotting his
95 mph fastball and keeping the Cardinals off balance with a hard
slider and a big-breaking curveball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of outs with my fastball,'' said Miller, who had
nine strikeouts. ``I guess I was just throwing it in the right
spots. I've waited a long time to win my first big-league game.
I've dreamed about this since I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The game ball from Saturday's victory immediately went to the
top of the list of mementos Miller has collected throughout his
playing days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give it to my parents,'' Miller said of the
keepsake. ``I'm sure they'll figure out something to do with it.
Maybe they'll put it in their coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   After Fernando Vina led off the game with a double, Miller
retired 15 of the next 16 batters he faced, including 11 in a row
during one stretch. He didn't allow another hit until Jim Edmonds'
two-run homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Astros already had put 10 runs on the board.
Edmonds' sacrifice fly gave the Cardinals an early lead in the
first, but the Astros quickly erased that with five runs in the
bottom of the inning. Jeff Bagwell, Richard Hidalgo and Chris Truby
each drove in a run in the uprising, and Mitch Meluskey added a
two-run homer off Cardinals starter Pat Hentgen (9-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I faced Hentgen, he got me,'' Meluskey said.
``This time, I got him. He's a tough pitcher. It was one of those
lucky things. I just got a good swing on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The first inning looked like extended batting practice for the
Astros, who established a season high with seven hits in an inning.
The Astros' other 17-hit performance this year came in a 10-inning
game against the Dodgers on May 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell hit a solo homer in the second, and the game took on the
look of a blowout in the fourth when Daryle Ward and Julio Lugo hit
RBI singles and Truby drove home a run with a double. Meluskey
collected his third RBI when he was hit by a pitch with the bases
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell finished 3-for-4 and came within a triple of the cycle,
which didn't exactly excite him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care about the cycle,'' he said. ``The only
good thing about the cycle is it means you got at least four hits.
I would have rather had another home run than a triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to feel a little better at the plate every day,
and that's a good thing,'' added Bagwell, who lifted his batting
average to .294. ``But every day is a battle. I don't know what's
going to come tomorrow, but I'm feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   ``After getting beat up like we did (Friday), we needed a game
like this.''
