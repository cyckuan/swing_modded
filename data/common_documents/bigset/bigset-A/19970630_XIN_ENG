<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails CPC's Role In Reunification (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, will publish an editorial Monday entitled "The
Force at the Core in Reunifying the Motherland and Invigorating
the Chinese Nation" to mark the 76th anniversary of the founding
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) that falls on on July
1. Excerpts of the editorial follow:
</P>
<P>
July 1 marks the 76th anniversary of the founding of the
Communist Party of China (CPC). It is also a day for China to
celebrate Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the end of 150
years of humiliation for the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to the motherland has been the
aspiration for which countless people with lofty ideals had been
fighting and made sacrifices over the past more than 100 years but
failed to realize. It is only under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China that the century-old dream has been
materialized step by step. From the very day when the CPC was
founded, it made the independence, unification, democracy and
prosperity of the motherland its goal to fight for.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
Committee in the late 1970s, the CPC has focused on
economic growth and introduced the reform and opening-up policy
while persisting in the four cardinal principles, preparing a solid
foundation and favorable conditions for the reunification of the
motherland and invigoration of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The first generation of leadership of New China including Mao
Zedong and Zhou Enlai showed great concern for the Hong Kong
issue. With foresight, they put forward a series of major policy
decisions concerning the settlement of the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
The second generation of the central leadership, with Deng
Xiaoping at its core, used their super wisdom and boldness and
foresight to make the creative great conception of "one country,
two systems", making a major contribution to charting the best
course for promoting the great cause of peaceful reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
With indisputable facts, history reveals to the world that,
without the Communist Party of China (CPC), it would have been
impossible to have a socialist new China; neither would it have
been possible to materialize the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong marks the end of China's more than 100
years' history of humiliation and the starting point for putting
into practice the new conception. Placing before us are new
historical subjects of how to carry out unswervingly the principle
of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", how to guarantee a high
degree of autonomy under the framework of "one country, two
systems," how to implement the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region and maintain a long-term prosperity and
stability of Hong Kong and go on to settle the Macao and Taiwan
issues in line with the same principles and ultimately realize the
great unity of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The CPC is the force at the core for reunifying the motherland
and invigorating the Chinese nation. It is the fundamental
guarantee for making the Party greater and stauncher and for
continuing to push forward the great cause of reunifying the
motherland and invigorating the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
In order to further strengthen Party building, it is, first of
all, necessary to hold aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and be
firm in adhering to the basic line of the Party for the primary
stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics is Marxism of contemporary China,
representing a powerful spiritual prop for invigorating and
developing the Chinese nation, as it has made a profound analysis
of and provides scientific answers to all major problems arising
in the drive for socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
China's tremendous achievements in building socialism over the
past two decades since China's introduction of reform and
opening-up policy have eloquently proved that the theory conforms
to the realities of China and it is a scientific guide to the
efforts to invigorate the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's smooth return is another eloquent proof that this
theory conforms to the realities of China and it is a scientific
guide to the reunification of the motherland.

<P>
The new situation in which the country is opening up to the
rest of the world and building a socialist market economy has made
it all the more necessary to strengthen the building of a clean
government and improve the Party style of work and to strengthen
the socialist spiritual civilization. The struggle against
corruption is a political struggle concerning the prestige of the
Party in the minds of the people, the close ties between the Party
and the masses of the people, the destiny of the Party, and the
long-term peace and stability of the country. The waging of the
anti-corruption struggle has won the support of the whole Party
and the people of the whole country. We must continue the struggle
with greater intensity and persistence. Leading cadres at all
levels must set an example, bear firmly in mind the fundamental
purpose of serving the people heart and soul, resolutely resist
the corrosion by such decadent ideas as money worship, hedonism
and individualism, display fully the fine tradition of hard work,
seek no fame and wealth, quietly immerse themselves in hard work
and make meritorious deeds to the Party and the people. Only by so
doing, is it possible to establish ourselves in an impregnable
position.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will call its 15th National Congress in the coming
autumn. The congress will be a historic grand gathering that will
bring the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, including the great cause of reunification of the
motherland, into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Let us, under the strong leadership of the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and under the
guidance of the theory of Deng Xiaoping for building socialism
with Chinese characteristics and the Party's basic line, make
greater efforts to strengthen the unity of the Party, the unity of
the people of all nationalities of the country and the unity with
all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation overseas.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Gives Zimbabwe Nod for Batoka Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has given Zimbabwe the
green light to proceed with the Batoka hydro-electric scheme on
the Zambezi river estimated to cost 909 million U.S. Dollars,
Zimbabwean Transport and Energy Minister Simon Moyo said today.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said the Zimbabwean government is now looking for a
private partner to finance the scheme expected to have a power
output of 1,600 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Zambia and Zimbabwe had in 1994 agreed in principle to jointly
build the power station which was expected to ensure reliability
of power supplies to both countries for over six decades.
</P>
<P>
But after careful consideration, the Zambian government has
decided that there are cheaper sources of power available
compared with the Batoka scheme.

<HEADLINE> NPC Discusses Joining Two International Conventions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending the ongoing
26th session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC) here say that it is in China's best
interests to join an international convention on obtaining
evidence from overseas to be used in court cases involving civil
or business-related disputes, and to approve two items included in
a treaty on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has submitted a proposal on each issue to the
NPC for examination.
</P>
<P>
Delegates believe that the two proposals will help to promote
and strengthen China's cooperation with the international
community, and have suggested that the standing committee pass
them.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng said in one proposal that the convention on
obtaining evidence from overseas will have an important bearing on
international judicial cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
The convention is basically in line with China's legal and
judicial practices, the premier said, and joining the convention
will encourage broader cooperation between China and other
countries in the area of judicial aid.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Zhaoxing, on behalf of the
State Council, pointed out in an explanation of the proposal that
China has always looked favorably on judicial cooperation when it
comes to obtaining evidence.
</P>
<P>
By September 1996, China had concluded treaties or agreements
with 23 countries for cooperation in obtaining evidence, either
for civil or business-related cases, from overseas.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that China cannot currently meet the demand of the
many countries requesting such evidence, because concluding a
treaty is complicated and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's regulations on obtaining evidence are
relatively simple, while the convention has more detailed
rulings. Joining the convention will both tighten China's
cooperation with foreign countries and aid its opening-up and
economic growth, he pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although some regulations of the convention concerning the
obtaining of evidence by consul and special envoy exceed the
criteria of China's legal regulations and judicial practice, they
will not be major obstacles to China's joining the convention, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa was passed
at the 31st summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity in
June, 1995 and opened for signing in Cairo in April, 1996. China
has signed the No.1 and No.2 protocols, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China has always respected and supported countries that
voluntarily decide to set up nuclear-weapon-free areas, in
accordance with the situation in the region, Li said in an
explanation of the proposal to approve the protocols.
</P>
<P>
China long ago pledged that it will not use or threaten to use
nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear weapon-bearing country or
region, and repeated the pledge in April, 1995 in a "national
statement" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
This has been China's consistent stand regarding
nuclear-weapon-free areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The themes and contents of the treaty and related protocols are
in line with China's stand on safeguarding world peace and
security, and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, he
said.

HARARE, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Children orphaned by AIDS are the
largest and fastest growing group of children in "difficult
circumstances" in Zimbabwe, according to a latest report of the
U.N. Fund (UNICEF) available here today.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled "Children Living in a World With AIDS"
paints a gloomy picture of the world, saying by the end of 1996,
approximately eight percent of Zimbabwean children under 15 had
lost their mothers because of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS, the joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS,
estimates that by mid-1996, nine million children under 15
worldwide had lost their mothers to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of these children live in sub-Saharan
African countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the World
Bank indicate that there are 1.2 million Ugandan children under
the age of 18 who have lost at least one parent to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The UNAIDS estimates that there are already over 23 million
people worldwide living with HIV, over 40 percent of whom are
women.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Opens Mobile Phone Services in Red Sea Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt opened today mobile phone
services in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, nearly seven
months after Cairenes first flashed the device.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Transport and Communications Suleiman
Metwally announced that with the operation of the first mobile
phone service station in the area, two others will begin business
next month.
</P>
<P>
He said the three wireless service stations will be enough to
cover the booming resort, 600 kilometers south of the Egyptian
capital, to serve thousands of foreign tourists thronging there
every day to enjoy its sunshine and seashore.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that a project to link the entire Red Sea
with fiber-optic cables is already being implemented to increase
the efficiency of communications services in the area.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians first laid their hands on cellular phone last
November, just a few days before the convention of the third
Middle East and North African Economic Conference in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months since the portable phone service
was introduced into Greater Cairo (including Giza, Cairo and
Qaliubya), it has developed a notoriety for poor quality and hefty
costs.
</P>
<P>
Due to state monopoly over the mobile phone market, users have
to pay 1,700 to 4,000 Egyptian pounds (500 to 1,177 U.S. dollars)
for the gadget itself, 2,000 pounds (588 U.S. dollars) for
networking, as well as tolls 10 times more than those of ordinary
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
According to the Egyptian MENA news agency, a handful of cities
around Cairo, such as Alexandria, Ismalia and Port Said are
beginning to get access to the luxury recently. But southern
provinces and other far-flung areas are yet to wait out their
turn.

<HEADLINE> Iran Launches Amphibious Military Exercise in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian navy forces today
launched an amphibious military exercise in the Persian Gulf
in a bid to enhance combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the four-day
war game was jointly carried out by the naval forces of
the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) and the army of the
Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the short report gave no detail about the number
of forces and weapons to be used in the war game.
</P>
<P>
Major-General Mohsen Rezaee, Commander of the Islamic
Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), said in an interview carried in
today's English daily Kayhan International that any U.S. military
 adventurism against Iran would be crushed and called on foreign
military forces in the Persian Gulf to get out the region.
</P>
<P>
Rezaee is believed to replace current Defense Minister
Mohammad Forouzandeh in the new government headed by Mohammad
Khatami, who won a landslide victory in the 7th presidential
election on May 23.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian general attacked the United States for seeking
to destabilize the region, adding "they want to keep the
regional states under pressure and threats. They create threats
to maintain their presence otherwise they can in no way
justify their presence.
</P>
<P>
However, he sent a message to Americans: "the Persian Gulf
is our region. They have to leave our region. We have vital
interests in the Persian Gulf and we are going to defend
interests."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of possible military confrontation between Iran
and the United States, he said, Iran will never start any
war. But if the Americans one day decide to attack us, then they
would have committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
"We will turn the region into a slaughterhouse for them.
There is no place better than the Persian Gulf to destroy
the Americans' might," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the Americans are after a military confrontation
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rezaee noted that the presence of foreign powers, especially
American forces, in the Persian Gulf, is tantamount to an
aggression against the region. "It is against international
norms and it creates instability in this region."
</P>
<P>
"Iran is committed to protect security in the Persian Gulf
and is trying with patience to get foreign forces out of
this region," he added.

<HEADLINE> Crisis Between Israeli PM, FM Deepens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The crisis between Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister David Levy
deepened today as the latter canceled a scheduled meeting with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was scheduled to meet Levy to work out a final
settlement of the crisis between them upon Levy's rage about his
exclusion from the government's decision-making process. This was
to be the third meeting between them in the past days aimed at
defusing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Levy informed Netanyahu only half an hour beforehand that
he would not show up for the meeting. Levy did so apparently out
of his anger over a secret meeting between National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
deputy Chairman Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Sharon-Mazen meeting was held without the knowledge of the
foreign minister, and Netanyahu failed to inform Levy of the
meeting last week even when he tried to defuse the crisis between
them.
</P>
<P>
Levy is deeply worried about the possibility of Sharon's
takeover of his position in charge of the negotiations with the
Palestinians. Sources close to Levy said he insisted that
Netanyahu should make it clear that he, not Sharon, would be in
charge of the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly promised Levy during the previous two
meetings last week that Levy would not be left out again in the
decision-making process and would be in charge of the
Israeli-Palestinian talks. However, Levy began to doubt
Netanyahu's promises when the news of the Sharon-Mazen meeting
broke out.
</P>
<P>
Instead of meeting Netanyahu, Levy held consultations this
afternoon at the Foreign Ministry with other members from his
Gesher Party on the crisis. On his part, Netanyahu held a meeting
with Sharon in reaction to Levy's refusal to meet him.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said afterwards that he was interested in finding a
quick solution to his crisis with Levy. He also expressed full
confidence in the foreign minister despite the crisis, promising
that he would consult Levy on future government decisions.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear if Netanyahu would announce the
long-delayed cabinet reshuffle on Monday as scheduled. Following
his acquittal by the High Court for his role in the Bar-On
scandal over the appointment of former Attorney General,
Netanyahu decided to reshuffle the cabinet to consolidate his
rule and clear the house.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle was also made possible following the resignation
of Finance Minister Dan Meridor, who was forced out of the
government because of his refusal to support Netanyahu during the
Bar-On affair.
</P>
<P>
Sharon met Mazen on June 16, immediately after he was offered
the finance portfolio. Sharon, a leading rightist hawk in the
cabinet, has since demanded to be included into the current
three-man inner cabinet which comprises of Netanyahu, Levy and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Levy is opposed to Sharon's inclusion into the inner cabinet,
warning that his hardline position could jeopardize the peace
process that has already been deadlocked in all tracks. Most
analysts predicted that Sharon's elevation in the government could
create more obstacles to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Levy, together with four Gesher lawmakers,
deliberately absented himself from the crucial Knesset
(Parliament) no-confidence vote against Netanyahu to register his
anger. Levy even considered resignation to protest Netanyahu's
violation of commitments to consult him on important government
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the depth of the Netanyahu-Levy crisis, analysts
believed that Levy still did not want to leave the coalition.
Like the first such crisis that occurred in last August, the two
traditional political rivals would hopefully work out a final
settlement over the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Lifts Restrictions on Foreign Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today formally lifted all
restrictions on foreign currency flow as part of the
government's efforts to attract foreign capital, Radio Jordan
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, Jordanian and foreign bank notes and
gold can enter and exit from the country freely, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The policy made by the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) in line
with the government's plan to liberalize foreign currency
transfer and further open up to the world market also lifted the
limitations on foreign currency withdrawal and transfer.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, there has been public fear here that
Jordan's foreign currency system was in danger as the government
imposed strict restrictions on foreign currency flow.
</P>
<P>
Under the restrictions, banks could not conduct foreign
currency transactions in a free way. A person was only allowed to
withdraw no more than 300 U.S. dollars once from his account, and
foreign currency interest rate was on decline.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's banks made huge profits from foreign currency
transfer for Iraq during the 1980s when altogether 18 European
and U.S. banks opened branches in the country.

<HEADLINE> Arab Ministers Denounce U.S. Decision on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 29 (Xinhua) -- Arab ministers of information today
termed as racist the recent U.S. congress' decision to transfer
the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to recognize
the holy city as the united capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing the decision, they said it is designed to Judaize
the city, regardless of the Palestinian claim of the eastern
sector of Jerusalem as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
"It gives the Israeli government a free hand in plundering more
Palestinian lands and encourages it to practice more intransigence
towards international resolutions," said the recommendations of
the 30th session of the Arab Information Ministers Council, which
concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and later
annexed it. But the annexation was not recognized by most
countries including the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The ministers called on the Arab media to unravel the dangers
of the congressional resolution and its repercussions on the Arab
and Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Adopting proposals agreed upon by the Arab League (AL) and the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) with regard to Jerusalem,
the Council will prepare a pamphlet depicting Israeli violations
of human rights in Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also decided to coordinate between the AL and the
OIC to find a working mechanism for the UN General Assembly
decision at its extraordinary 10th session under the title
"Unity for the Sake of Peace" and to cooperate with UNESCO to
protect the historic heritage of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
They decided in the recommendations to promote Arab media and
culture in occupied lands to help Palestinian media face up to
existing challenges, and promote the establishment of the
Palestinian's Popular Liaison Institute.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid in his speech
at the session said that the recommendations will give a strong
boost to Arab solidarity.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian-Croatian Summit Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A summit between Bosnian leader
Alija Izetbegovic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has been
postponed indefinitely due to a Muslim-Croat dispute on the
formation of joint police.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman's meeting with Izetbegovic, who is a Muslim and
chairman of the Bosnian Presidency, was originally scheduled to be
held in Split, Croatia, today.
</P>
<P>
According to Mirza Hajric, foreign advisor to Izetbegovic, the
main reason for the postponement was Bosnian Croats' refusal to
form the joint police in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton in
proportion to the pre-war census.
</P>
<P>
The Croats have insisted on ethnic balance of the police force
in line with the current population of the region, which "would
result in hampering the return of refugees," Hajric told the local
press.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Croatian government criticized the Bosnian
Muslim side for the third postponement of the summit.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to organize the meeting if there are any
conditions imposed, while the very aim of the meeting was supposed
to be the resolution of problems hampering the (Dayton)
agreements' implementation," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Spending Increases Moderately in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer spending rose by
a modest 0.3 percent in May bolstered by an identical increase in
personal income, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that consumer spending totaled an annual rate
of 5.37 trillion dollars, compared with 5.35 trillion dollars a
month earlier. Incomes rose to an annual rate of 6.77 trillion, up
from 6.75 trillion in April.
</P>
<P>
Personal spending on durable goods -- items expected to last
more than three years -- increased 0.2 percent after falling 1.7
percent a month earlier. Spending on nondurable goods such as food
and fuel fell 0.1 percent, slower than April's 0.6 percent
decline. Spending on services advanced 0.5 percent compared to 0.9
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Personal consumption in the U.S., which represents two-thirds
of the nation's economic activity, rose just 0.1 percent in April,
the slowest since last September.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe personal spending has decelerated to about a 2
percent annual rate during the April-June quarter, less than half
the 5.6 percent rate during the first three months, the fastest in
five years.
</P>
<P>
The report said that income growth in May was slightly above
the 0.2 percent advance in April. Private wages and salaries, the
most closely watched component of income, rose by 9.5 billion
dollars compared with a 2.7 billion increase a month earlier. Both
employment and average hourly earnings increased.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income -- income after taxes -- also increased 0.3
percent, up from 0.2 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
The combination of incomes and spending meant that Americans'
saving rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- was
5.1 percent, unchanged from April.
</P>
<P>
The income and spending figures in the month were not adjusted
for inflation. When adjusted, disposable incomes rose 0.3 percent,
up from 0.1 percent in April. Spending rose 0.4 percent after
remaining flat in the previous month.

<HEADLINE> New Homes Sales in US Up by 7.1 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- New home sales in the U.S. shot
up by 7.1 percent in May, rebounding from a big loss just a month
earlier, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that sales of single-family homes totaled a
seasonally adjusted 825,000 annual rate, up sharply from a revised
770,000 a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
New home sales in the U.S. hit 838,000 in March, the highest
since April 1986. But sales fell steeply by 8.1 percent in April
1997.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, sales of new homes were 9.4 percent above
those of the first five months of last year. During all of 1996,
757,000 new homes were sold in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the seasonally adjusted estimate of new
homes for sale at the end of May was 280,000, lowest since 278,000
in July 1993. It represented a supply of 4.1 months at the current
sales rate, smallest since a four-month supply in March 1971.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales jumped by 23.9 percent in the Midwest, the
biggest gain since a 31.7 percent advance in January 1996. Sales
increased 15.1 percent in the Northeast and 5.3 percent in the
South. But they fell 4.4 percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Association of Realtors also reported last
week that sales of existing homes jumped 4.4 percent in May to a
level just shy of the record set a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the advance to homeowners desire to
trade up, which was supported by the highest level of consumer
confidence in 28 years and the lowest unemployment rate in a
quarter-century.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong handover ceremony
that has been attracting worldwide attention is to start soon on
level five of the Extension to the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center (HKCEC).
The ceremony is expected to last 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ceremony will be delegations of the Chinese and
British governments led respectively by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Prince Charles of Britain.
</P>
<P>
Close at midnight today, the Union Jack of Britain will be
lowered at the ceremony. At zero hour of July 1, a five-star red
flag will be raised here. This will be the first five-star red
flag to be raised in Hong Kong, signifying China's resumption of
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the end of 156
years of British colonial rule here.
</P>
<P>
Present at today's ceremony will be more than 4,000 guests from
more than 40 countries and regions and more than 30 international
organizations, more than 300 representatives of overseas Chinese
and foreigners of Chinese origin in all parts of the world,
personages from Macao and Taiwan, and local Hong Kong figures.
Nearly 600 out of more than 8,000 Chinese and foreign reporters
are permitted to cover the historic event.
</P>
<P>
The rostrum in front of the viewing stand is covered with red
carpet, and two silver-colored flagpoles stand at each side of the
rostrum. The British national flag and the Hong Kong flag are
flying on the flagpoles on the right.
</P>
<P>
In the center of the rostrum, on raised daises, are ten wooden
chairs, where leading officials from China and Britain will be
seated.
</P>
<P>
The HKCEC is located at Wanchai on the northern side of Hong
Kong Island, overlooking the Kowloon Peninsula across the Victoria
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
The newly completed Extension to the HKCEC was constructed on
a 6.5-hectare man-made island. The Extension resembles a flying
seabird in shape, symbolizing Hong Kong's economic takeoff to even
greater prosperity. The entire center has more than 63,000 square
meters in floor space for convention and exhibition alone. It is
one of the largest facilities of its kind in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The venue of the handover ceremony--the Grand Hall and the Grand
Foyer on level five of the Extension -- has a combined floor space
of more than 6,000 square meters, the size of a football field.
On the giant glass wall overlooking the sea hang the national
flags of China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The handover ceremony will be televised live to every corner of
the world via satellites. Billions of people across the world are
expected to witness the solemn event on TV screens.
</P>
<P>
The HKCEC is now the focus of world attention.

Hong Kong and China, Wang expressed the hope that Sino-Israeli
trade and economic relations would further develop after the
handover.

<P>
In answering question by an Israel radio reporter, Ben-Tsur
said that Israel would not monitor the so-called democracy
situation in Hong Kong since it trusts China.

"We have good and close relations with China, and we will
discuss whatever items that will come up," he added.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Apologizes for Anti-Muslim Posters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman today
apologized to the Muslim world in the wake of the distribution of
an anti-Islamic leaflet in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release faxed to Xinhua by the Israeli
Embassy in Cairo, Weizman characterized in his apology the posters
depicting the Muslim Prophet Mohammad as a pig stomping on the
Koran as "despicable and insulting."
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the single incident could sour Muslim-Jewish
ties and add fuel to the all-time tense situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Tremendous damage had been caused by the stupidity of a single
individual," the release quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Muslim hate posters glued to about 20 Arab storefronts
near a Jewish settlement overnight Saturday have sparked two days
of renewed violence in the divided West Bank city. Israeli police
said a 25-year-old Jewish woman from Jerusalem had pasted the
leaflets.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu also expressed his
"revulsion" against such an offending act.
</P>
<P>
"This runs counter to our outlook as Jews and our respect and
appreciation for the Islamic religion and for its founder the
Prophet Mohammad," he told Jewish leaders at a conference in
Jerusalem Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Violence and provocations have been rife in the occupied
territories as international mediation has failed to resuscitate
the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that collapsed in
March over the construction of a new Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Two people died and 12 injured
in a mountaineering accident Sunday evening on Ptarmigan Peak,
about 25 kilometers southeast of downtown Anchorage, Alaska of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The students of a college mountaineering class were descending
a snowfield in the Chugach Mountains when they slid on the
60-degree slope into a boulder field 1,000 feet (300 meters) below.
</P>
<P>
A man and a woman were killed and twelve others were injured.
</P>
<P>
Seven men and five women were transferred from the mountain to
Providence Alaska Medical Center by helicopter, said hospital
spokeswoman Janet Asaro. She said two were confirmed dead and the
others were in serious condition with multiple fracture injuries
and lacerations.
</P>
<P>
Climbers in the University of Alaska Anchorage group were roped
together in teams of two or three. They were descending from the
top of Ptarmigan Peak, which is nearly 1,500 meters high, when
thearently slipped and fell and that started the whole group
falling,'' Wilhelmi said.

<HEADLINE> 2.4 Mln Apply for Voting in Bosnian Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- About 2.4 million Bosnians have
applied for voting in the upcoming municipal elections, the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
OSCE spokesman David Foley said the number, which is still
initial, is the same as the turnout in the national elections in
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
He called the figure "undoubtedly an excellent result" and
credited the OSCE voter education efforts and various political
parties for mobilizing potential voters to register.
</P>
<P>
The voter registration was originally arranged for six weeks,
but due to low turnout through much of the process, it had to be
prolonged for two more weeks until June 28.
</P>
<P>
In Brcko, a strategic area claimed by both Serbs and Muslims,
the voter registration had to be restarted after instances of
voter manipulation were found and would last until July 12.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Bank Wants Abolition of Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has little to lose
and much to gain by immediately removing remaining foreign
exchange controls, the Bank of Botswana says in its annual
Economic Review for 1996.
</P>
<P>
If the process is delayed too long, it is likely that Botswana
will be left behind by the liberalization process taking place in
other African countries, notably South Africa, the bank says.
</P>
<P>
Botswana would then face the choice of liberalizing in a hurry
to keep up with South Africa, thus possibly losing some control
over its own liberalization process, or falling behind South
Africa in the process and being disadvantaged from the point of
view of attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"Capital outflows of over one million Pula (one U.S. dollars
equals 3.5 Pula) remain restricted, and this constrains the
efficient operation of large companies," the bank says.
"(Foreign) exchange control regulations constrain the development
of the financial sector."
</P>
<P>
Recent foreign exchange control liberalizations had not led to
significant capital outflows, despite Botswana's real interest
rates being significantly below those in South Africa, the bank
said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Vows to Regain Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat today reiterated his determination to
take Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is the key to Middle East and is the capital of the
independent Palestine," said Arafat in a speech addressed to a
ceremony here marking the Solidarity Day With Jerusalem today.
</P>
<P>
The speech was delivered by Mohamed Sobeih, PNA's chief
delegate to the Cairo-based Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Arafat accused the Israeli government of Binjamin Netanyahu of
pursuing a settlement policy, particularly in Jerusalem, to
undermine the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem, Muslim's third holiest city, is a kingpin of the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which bogged down in March over
the construction of a new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians claim as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed
it later. But the annexation was not recognized by most nations,
including the U.S..
</P>
<P>
He said the much-condemned Jabal Abu Ghneim settlement, also
known as Har Homa, is only one aspect of the comprehensive Jewish
settlement scheme meant to isolate Jerusalem from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader described the U.S. House of
Representatives' resolution to transfer the U.S. Embassy from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem as a reward to Netanyahu for his anti-peace
plans.
</P>
<P>
His remarks followed recent uproar over the U.S. congress'
decision to recognize the holy city as the united capital of
Israel. The U.S. government, a key sponsor of the Mideast peace,
later reaffirmed its stance on settling the Jerusalem issue in
Palestinian-Israeli final talks.

LUANDA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Special Envoy to
Angola Blondin Beye today expressed satisfaction over UN Security
Council's resolution to replace the current Rectification Mission
with a UN observation mission.
</P>
<P>
Beye made the statement here after returning from an UN
meeting on Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, he said, supports the suggestions by the
Joint Commission for Angolan Peace Process concerning tensions in
north-east Angola, demanding that the Angolan government honor
its own promises and stop offensive activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Beye added, the Security Council required the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to
cooperate with UN observers in speeding up examiniations on its
policing troops in the diamond mining area.
</P>
<P>
According to UN resolutions, UN observers' mission on Angola
will start operation at 0:00 am on July 1 for a 7-month tenure.
</P>
<P>
The number of observers' mission, Beye noted, will be smaller
than that of the Rectification Mission.

Referring to the withdrawal of UN peacekeeping forces in
Angola, the envoy said, it's up to the situation in Angola.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Was Right to Bite, Says Former World Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain's former world welterweight
champion Lloyd Honeyghan said Monday Mike Tyson was right to bite
the ears of Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Honeyghan, a friend of
Tyson's, insisted Tyson's outrageous behaviour in the Las Vegas
heavyweight title fight on Saturday was justified as retaliation
for Holyfield's alleged head-butting.
</P>
<P>
"Holyfield should stop being a big baby and get on and sign for
the next fight," said Honeyghan.
</P>
<P>
"Holyfield head-butted in the first fight. And he did it again
in this fight. It was a professional head-butt. We've all done
these things if we can get away with them.
</P>
<P>
"I thought Mills Lane was the best referee in the world. But he
was wrong this time. He never warned Holyfield. Mike got
frustrated because the referee wasn't protecting him.
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame Tyson. I would have done the same -- if I
thought I'd get away with it."
</P>
<P>
Honeyghan, who said he was once bitten by a sparring partner
who lost his temper, added: "This will just make the public want
to see the return even more."
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who is godfather to Honeyghan's child, will carry on and
clean up with a Holyfield return match, said the former English
fighter.
</P>
<P>
"The next fight will be twice the money on pay-per-view," said
Honeyghan.

<P>
President Jiang said that he believed Hong Kong would become
more prosperous and stable after its return to China, and this
should be attributed to Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one
country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
"We had proceeded from the overall strategic situation of
stabilizing the world situation and creating a long-term peaceful
international environment, and taken into account Hong Kong's
history and current situation and the interests of various
quarters, before we formulated a series of policies for resolving
the Hong Kong question," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the maintenance of Hong Kong's long-term stability
and prosperity also laid a good foundation for the development of
the Sino-British relations.
</P>
<P>
"The British labor government now has a very good opportunity,"
he said. "our two sides should make common efforts to create a
beautiful future."
</P>
<P>
Blair agreed to Jiang's views, saying said that the British
government always valued highly the "one country, two systems"
policy.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng said that China kept a strong momentum in its
economic growth, providing a huge market for the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the economic and trade relations between China and
many countries in the world enjoyed rapid development, while
Britain lagged relatively behind in this aspect.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the British side will take measures to catch up,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Although the economic and trade relationship has its own law of
development, he said, it can certainly be promoted by a good
political relationship.
</P>
<P>
Blair echoed that the new British government is willing to
enhance cooperation with China in the political, economic and
trade, science and technology and other fields.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang and Premier Li invited Prime Minister Blair to
visit China at a time convenient to him

<HEADLINE> Tiananmen Gala for Hong Kong's Return Sets Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Tiananmen Square is welcoming a
sea of 100,000 jubilant partygoers who have gathered here to
celebrate the return of Hong Kong to the motherland with endless
forms of merry-making.
</P>
<P>
Among tonight's activities are several record-setting firsts,
biggests and bests ever to take place on the square. They include:
</P>
<P>
Biggest Lanterns
</P>
<P>
Upon entering Tiananmen Square, one of the most spectacular
sights is the glow of 160 giant red lanterns hung high around the
square. One hundred of the lanterns have been placed along both
sides of the digital countdown clock in front of the Museum of
Chinese History, symbolizing Hong Kong's return to the motherland
after more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The 100 red lanterns are the biggest ever to decorate the
square: 40 of them are 2.6 meters in diameter and 4.22 meters high.
</P>
<P>
Lengthiest Gala
</P>
<P>
The gala event, called the "Beijing Municipal Government
Greeting Hong Kong's Return Evening Party," started at 10 p.m. on
June 30 and will last seven hours and 15 minutes. It will be
longest celebration held in the square since the founding of New
China in October 1949.
</P>
<P>
Biggest Drum
</P>
<P>
The beating of 100 drums will be heard throughout this
evening's activities. One of the drums measures 3.03 meters in
diameter and 0.97 meters high, and is believed to be the biggest
drum in China. Six young boys standing on stools will beat the
instrument.
</P>
<P>
The drum was made specially for the party by five brothers in
Baimashi County, in the city of Luoyang, central China's Henan
Province. It will be donated to the Federation of Literary and Art
Circles after the event.
</P>
<P>
First Time Fireworks Launched in Center of Square
</P>
<P>
Standard practice has it that fireworks in Tiananmen Square are
launched from the top of high buildings surrounding the
area. Tonight, three rounds of fireworks were set off from the
central square region.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guanchen, a police official in charge of the fireworks
displays, said this is the the first time that fireworks have been
launched from this spot.
</P>
<P>
First Stage in Square
</P>
<P>
The stage erected in front of the Monument to the People's
Heroes is the first stage to be set up in Tiananmen Square since
New China's founding.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 actors, actresses and amateur performers are
participating in a variety of shows on the bi-level stage, which
covers 1,225 square meters.
</P>
<P>
First Large Color TV Screens
</P>
<P>
Five large color TV screens have been set up on the square to
provide live coverage of the handover ceremonies in Hong
Kong. Again, a first for super-sized TVs on the square.
</P>
<P>
The largest is 4.8 meters high and eight meters wide.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Li Peng met with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at
the Harbor Plaza Hotel in Hong Kong this evening.
</P>
<P>
"Premier Li Peng and I are very glad to meet with you at this
historic moment of Hong Kong's handover," President Jiang said to
Prime Minister Blair.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that this evening is of historic significance for

in the Sino-British relations, a new page will be opened as a new
starting point for the development of the relations between the
two countries.
</P>

He added that Hong Kong should also become a bridge in the
Sino-British bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said that it is very important to develop a
friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Britain
and to increase mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
"We always believe that as long as both sides can follow the
basic principles of mutual respect, equal treatment, seeking
common ground while reserving differences and non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, a long-term and stable relationship
of mutually beneficial cooperation can be established and
developed," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
With the 21st century around the corner, he said, leaders of
China and Britain should be far-sighted and regard the
Sino-British relationship as a matter of strategic importance
which can affect the overall global situation in the next century.
</P>
<P>
With the settlement of the Hong Kong question, the labor
government should have no burden in developing the relationship
between the two countries, he told Blair.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he believed a new chapter will be opened in the
Sino-British relationship with the joint efforts of both sides.

<HEADLINE> Thousands in Sydney, Melbourne Celebrate HK Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people gathered
tonight at the heart of Sydney and Melbourne, the two largest
cities of Australia, to celebrate China's resumption of its
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, hundreds of Australian-Chinese gathered at the heart
of the city's Chinatown as the clock was ticking away the hours
before the handover of Hong Kong to China at midnight on June 30.
</P>
<P>
People in the Market City shopping center complex in Haymarket
were in a festive mood for the historic occasion, enjoying
entertainment which included performances by Hong Kong-born
singers.
</P>
<P>
Scenes of the handover at midnight Hong Kong time will be
beamed live onto a large screen by courtesy of SBS TV, a local
television station.
</P>
<P>
Shops and restaurants at Chinatown brimmed with patrons taking
advantage of their extended trading hours until 2 AM.
</P>
<P>
Wong, 35, who was born in Hong Kong and made Sydney his home 16
years ago, said the handover will mark the beginning of a new era
for the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"From tonight onwards, we will be able to identify ourselves as
Chinese. For me, it's like finding the lost part of myself," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Teresa Cheng, 40, who was also born in Hong Kong and has been
living in Sydney for 20 years, is the managing director of the
Chinatown Promotions and Public Relations company which helped
organize tonight's celebrations with Market City management.
</P>
<P>
"It is a happy event for us ..." she said. "Hong Kong always
belongs to China and I am confident things will be okay."
</P>
<P>
One of the youngest taking part in tonight's celebrations was
13-year-old Andy Yung, who was born in Hong Kong and came to
Sydney five years ago. His sister, Eva, 19, said: "It is now a day
for history and celebration."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a party billed as Australia's largest changeover
party, more than 1,300 guests in Melbourne tonight prepared to
mark China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations, which began this evening at Melbourne's Crown
Casino, will continue until early tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
In Melbourne's Chinatown, along Little Bourke street, thousands
were expected to gather at a series of functions held to mark the
end of British colonial rule in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Restaurants have set up large screens for diners to watch
ceremonies in Hong Kong, but none could match the size of the
casino celebration organized by the Victorian Chinese Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Entertainment at the casino ranged from Scottish bagpipers to
traditional lion dances, acrobatic displays, and performances by
Normie Rowe and Hong Kong entertainer Susie Shen.
</P>
<P>
An indoor fireworks display was planned for the celebration's
climax.
</P>
<P>
Chamber spokesman Norman Wong said the 1,400 guests at the

<HEADLINE> Macao Editorial: Let's Celebrate HK's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- "Let's celebrate Hong Kong's return
to China tonight," the newspaper Macao Daily News said in an
editorial today.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will become the global spotlight tonight, not only
because Britain will end its 150-year-plus colonial rule in the
Far East, but also because China has set an example in peacefully
handling disputes left over from the past, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is to start a new historical era," said the
editorial. "Everywhere across the world, so long as there are
Chinese, there will be celebrations and joy."
</P>
<P>
China has won respect from the righteous nations around the
world in its peaceful resumption of exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The Si Man Pou newspaper said in a commentary that Hong Kong's
return to the embrace of the motherland is the common wish of the
six-million-strong Hong Kong citizens and also the long-cherished
wish of the 1.2 billion Chinese people as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the long-awaited moment is coming, how can we keep
ourselves from being excited and happy?" said the commentary. "We
should carry on the will of Deng Xiaoping and make Hong Kong and
Macao more prosperous."
</P>
<P>
Another commentary in today's Sing Pou newspaper said July 1
will be the most glorious day in the history of the Chinese
nation, because Hong Kong's return to the motherland is "like a
son returning to his family after more than 150 years of
separation."
</P>
<P>
"It is the most encouraging and most exciting moment," said the
commentary. "People in Hong Kong and Macao will have a joyful
night tonight."
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, Macao is to hold two grand parties tonight
to mark the historic moment. Thousands of Macao residents will
dance and sing throughout the night and will also count down to
the moment of handover. The local television station will
broadcast live the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a fireworks show will start at midnight.
</P>
<P>
Some commentaries urged the Macao government to quicken its
pace in the localization of the civil service, the localization of
law and the use of Chinese as an official language so that
Macao's handover will be conducted smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Holds Night-long Carnival To Welcome Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- All Beijing is lit up, but no
place more so than Tiananmen Square where 100,000 citizens have
gathered for a long night of celebrations which will continue
until dawn.
</P>
<P>
Just a few hours before China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, Tiananmen Square and adjacent
buildings were illuminated by floodlights while the dark summer
sky was brightened by fireworks galore.
</P>
<P>
"In about two hours, the return of Hong Kong to the motherland
will come true. It will be the solemn time for the Chinese nation
to wash away their humiliation of the past century, the brilliant
time for them to open up a new historical era, and the great time
for hundreds of millions of the Chinese people to march towards
unification and prosperity," Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin said at
around 10:00 p.m. on the gala night.
</P>
<P>
Performances are being held on two separate stages on the
square. On the central stage, beside the digital countdown clock,
a musical titled "Beijing Bless You, Hong Kong" is going on.
</P>
<P>
People are dancing and singing national favorites in an
explosion of patriotic fervor.
</P>
<P>
Six huge light-boxes are positioned in the center of the
square, bearing the characters "Celebrating Hong Kong's Return to
the Motherland".
</P>
<P>
As midnight approaches, five huge screens around the square
will provide revellers with live coverage of the handover ceremony
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Activities will continue until the national-flag-raising
ceremony at 4:50 a.m. on July 1.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Taxation Policy in Jerusalem Condemned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian government and
Islamic figures have strongly condemned Israeli taxation policy in
East Jerusalem, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in the city, today.
</P>
<P>
Suleiman al-Najab, member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Executive Committee and one of the leaders of
the Palestinian People's Party, said that it seems that the policy
of the Israeli government intends to liquidate all kinds of our
people's presence in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Al-Najab was commenting on Israeli decision to adopt measures
against Palestinians evading taxes in East Jerusalem. On Sunday,
Palestinian merchants in East Jerusalem went on a strike
demanding that the Israeli authorities cancel a 286
million-U.S.-dollar debt owed by the merchants in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of shopkeepers marched from the city center to the
Damascus Gate of the Old City and demonstrated for several hours,
with placards reading "Stop raiding our homes and shops," and
"Israeli taxation means only transfer."
</P>
<P>
The protesters told reporters that the Israeli policy --
including closure of the West Bank and military presence in the
Old City -- have reduced revenues and scared away customers,
making it impossible for the shopkeepers to pay their debts.
</P>
<P>
Al-Najab said bitterly that in its policy the Israeli
government finds no support country except the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Jamil Othman Nasser, the Palestinian National
Authority-appointed governor of Jerusalem, said that all the
Israeli measures in Jerusalem are aimed at forcing the Palestinian
residents to leave the city, so that when the final status
negotiations begin the Palestinian side will find nothing to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
He noted that all of the Palestinians insist in their rights
in Jerusalem, adding that "without Jerusalem, there will be no
negotiations, no state and no co-existence."
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud al-Zahar, one of the leaders of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas), said that "arguments (by Israel) about the
eternal capital of Israel are historic lies which cannot be
accepted by the Muslims anyway."

<HEADLINE> Tiananmen Square Ready For Celebrating HK's Homecoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tian'anmen Square has been
turned into a sea of jubilant people, numbering more than 100,000;
colored flags are flying in the balmy summer air; and numerous
traditional Chinese red lanterns are hanging over and around the
Square, where an all-night gala party is ready to begin in
celebration of the long-waited homecoming of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At 8:00 p.m., 60 minutes ahead of the scheduled gala, when the
giant countdown board displayed the words, "It is 13,500 seconds
before the Chinese government resumes the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong," the square was resounded with thunderous beating
of drums and gongs.
</P>
<P>
In the final hours before the big event, many people were
elbowing through the crowd to take pictures in front of the clock.
</P>
<P>
Tonight, the world's largest square is ablaze with floodlights;
red lanterns are hung on the Tiananmen Rostrum, the Great Hall of
the People, the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, the Museum of
Chinese History, and the Memorial Hall of Chairman Mao and along
the Chang'an Avenue, the major thoroughfare that runs across the
city proper.
</P>
<P>
Six huge lighted boxes, positioned at the center of the square,
bear the six giant Chinese characters which mean "Celebrating the
Return of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Two stages have been erected on the square: a central stage,
covered with red carpet, just in front of the countdown board, and
a double-decker platform, 35 meters in both length and width, at
the square's center. A variety of performances will take place
there.
</P>
<P>
The celebration activities, scheduled to begin at 10 p.m., will
last until 5:05 a.m. on July 1. Five TV screens on the square will
display the live broadcast of the handover ceremony in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong is an event I've long been looking
forward to, and I will never forget this historical night here,"
said Beijing resident Jin Xiaoyao.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 Chinese and overseas reporters are on the square to
cover the event.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Approves New Cabinet List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey President Suleyman Demirel
has approved the new government led by Motherland Party (ANAP)
leader Mesut Yimaz.
</P>
<P>
Yimaz made the announcement at the presidential palace at noon
after Demirel held a one-hour-long meeting with him for the
approval of the coalition government consisting of the ANAP,
Democratic Left Party (DSP), and Democratic Turkey Party (DTP).
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz told reporters that he believed that the
newly-established government would overcome the current
difficulties with the support of the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
The formation of Turkey's 55th government has started to help
ease the political tension in Turkey, said the new prime minister,
adding that this situation has given hope to the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz submitted the cabinet list to Demirel for approval
following extensive talks with his coalition partners this morning.
</P>
<P>
He said that DSP leader Bulent Ecevit, also former prime
minister, became deputy prime minister and DTP deputy chairman and
former parliamentary speaker Ismet Sezgin now serves as deputy
prime minister and national defense minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the cabinet list, ANAP member Murat Basesgioglu
took the interior minister's portfolio and DSP members Ismail Cem
and Zekeriya Temizel respectively serve as foreign minister and
financial minister.
</P>
<P>
The Yilmaz government will obtain a vote of confidence within
two weeks at the lastest.
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday, the Motherland Party-led alliance enjoys 278
votes in the 550-seat parliament with a vacancy of two, and an
alliance of the Welfare Party (RP) and the True Path Party (DYP),
with BBP and three independents support, has 270 seats in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that at present Yilmaz and his alliance
would have no difficulty in winning a vote of confidence in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Yilmaz government is expected to assume assignment on
Tuesday from the caretaker government led by Necmettin Erbakan,
who resigned on June 18.
</P>
<P>
Among the priorities of the new government is to reopen the
corruption files concerning Deputy Prime Minister and DYP Leader
Tansu Ciller which was blocked time and again by senior coalition
partner RP.
</P>
<P>
Local English newspaper Daily News said that this move was
aimed at wiping out Ciller from the Turkish political arena.
</P>
<P>
Ciller's efforts to gain the premiership from her coalition
partner Erbakan are bound to failure when her deputies resigned
one after another.
</P>
<P>
On June 20, Demirel assigned Yilmaz to form a new government to
replace the resigned RP-DYP coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, who had planned to taker over premiership from Erbakan,
was annoyed by Demirel's appointment of Yilmaz to form a new
government, calling it "a Cankaya (presidential palace) coup."
</P>
<P>
She has said that the RP-DYP alliance with the support of
the nationalist BBP could defeat Yilmaz's efforts to set up a
new government in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, however, expressed optimism about the new government,
saying that he believed the new government would win a vote of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the developments in the coming days will
expand the margin. The outcome of the vote will not be very
close," the ANAP leader said.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan stepped down under pressure from both the military and
DYP deputies, who have repeatedly criticized the Islamic RP
ledaer for his reluctance to curb rapidly expanding
fundamentalists force in the secular Turkey.

CAIRO, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr

to China of its once-lost Hong Kong, the Egyptian Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian top diplomat, who is in Hong Kong to attend the

After 156 years of colonial rule by the United Kingdom, Hong
Kong returns to China at midnight today in a harborside ceremony
with the swearing-in of a new chief executive and a provisional
legislature.
</P>

In statements to the MENA, Moussa said Egypt looks forward to
boosting flourishing trade, economic and investment ties with
Hong Kong, which is among the key trade zones in the entire world.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has already signed agreements to facilitate trade with
the once-British-occupied territory, including allowing Hong Kong
citizens to enter Egypt without entry visas, Moussa said.

billion U.S. dollars in 1995 to 16.12 billion in 1996, non-oil
exports only grew marginally from 285.7 million to 287.2 million,
revealed the CBN annual report and statement of accounts for
1996.
</P>
<P>
The CBN attributed the slight increase in non-oil exports to
the depressed prices of palm produce and cocoa in the
international market. Other non-oil products for export mainly
include minerals.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, Nigeria exported 745.9 million
barrels of crude oil last year, up from 666 million barrels
recorded in the previous year. The average price also increased
to 21.21 dollars per barrel from 17.33 dollars correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
Oil exports in 1996 accounted for 98.2 percent of the
country's total exports while the share of non-oil exports stood
at less than two percent.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that although the Nigerian government has vowed
to expand non-oil exports in a bid to diversify the channel of
foreign exchange income, the country still heavily depends on oil
exports.
</P>
<P>
While non-oil exports dropped, non-oil imports also went down
substantially last year, from an all time high of 601.64 billion
naira (about 7.08 billion dollars at current exchange rate) in
1995 to 400.98 billion naira (about 4.7 billion dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The CBN attributed this development to continued restriction
of import financing of letter of credit as well as delays arising
from administrative changes for clearing goods at the ports which
required all imports to be accompanied by import duty reports.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of imports by end users however showed that the
share of consumer goods in total imports increased by 5.6 percent
to 38.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, capital goods and raw material imports as a group
fell from 66.8 percent in 1995 to 61 percent last year. This,
according to observers, paints a negative picture of the
industrial sector which depends on capital goods and raw
materials to increase production.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured goods continued to rank highest in non-oil
imports. In 1996, it peaked at 158.27 billion naira (about 1.86
billion dollars) or 28.1 percent of the total imports, while
chemicals valued at 134.05 billion naira (about 1.58 billion
dollars) or 23.8 percent were recorded.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Syria Is Not Prepared to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iraqi official has said
that Syria is not prepared to resume its relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi minister of culture and information Hamed Youssef Hammadi
made the remarks in an interview Sunday with the Jordanian
newspaper al-Arab Today in Amman, capital of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted Hammadi as saying that Iraq
and Syria have been seeking, over the past years, to resume
bilateral relations. However, the Syrians were not prepared to do
so.
</P>
<P>
He said that Syrian businessmen "betrayed" recently their
desire to re-export to Iraq foodstuffs and medicines under the
Iraqi-U.N. "oil-for-food" deal, which allows Iraq to sell oil to
raise money to buy food and other necessities for humanitarian
needs in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq signed last month several contracts with Syrian companies
to import food and other daily necessities under the deal.
</P>
<P>
It also declared that its customs offices on the border with
Syria will soon be reopened and it has asked for the U.N.
permission to open a crossing on the Iraq-Syria border for
transporting humanitarian goods bought by Baghdad under the
"oil-for-food" deal.
</P>
<P>
Recent developments showed that the relations between Baghdad
and Damascus have begun to thaw after a Syrian trade and
industrial delegation visited Iraq, the first of its kind in the
past 17 years, and an Iraqi trade delegation paid a return visit.
</P>
<P>
However, observers here noted that there is a long way to go
for the two long-time rivals before their relations are
normalized.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad severed its diplomatic ties with Damascus in 1980
following the eight-year Iraqi-Iranian War broke out, because
Syria sided with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral relations worsened farther after the Syrian
troops joined in the U.S.-led allied forces to drive Iraqi
troops out of Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Leaves for Athens for Talks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides left here today for Athens of Greece on a three-day
visit for talks on the protracted Cyprus question with the Greek
government in view of the forthcoming direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before his departure, Clerides said that he had to
visit Athens in order to coordinate and discuss with the Greek
government issues on the strategy of handling the Cyprus question,
in view of the fact that Greece will be in the wings of the
U.N.-led direct talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the Athens talks, "we will not discuss any
changes of our positions," agreed between the two governments in
the past both in Nicosia and Athens.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ongoing military dialog between the Greek
Cypriot National Guard and the Turkish forces to discuss the
U.N. proposal aimed at reducing tension on the island, Clerides
said he does not think an agreement on the military dialog is
possible before his face-to-face talks with Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Clerides' trip to Athens came just a week before the
U.N.-sponsored direct negotiations between leaders of the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities are to take place from
July 9 to 13 near New York.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at hammering out a comprehensive solution
to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took control
of the northern third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Maintains Alert in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine troops have been
maintaining red alert status in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, to prevent any retaliatory attacks by Muslim rebels
who fought fierce battles with soldiers last week, the military
said today.
</P>
<P>
Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the Army's Sixth Infantry Division,
said Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels might launch
retaliatory attacks against government forces who overran an MILF
camp in Pikit Town, North Cotabato Province, last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said latest intelligence reports monitored movements of big
groups of MILF rebels circling the remote areas near Pikit in what
has been perceived as an attempt to take back the camp.
</P>
<P>
The government forces are now busy securing the entire area for
the thousands of evacuees affected by the recent conflict that
killed about 100 rebels, soldiers and civilians, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 40,000 residents fled the conflict, the fiercest so far
this year, and sought refuge in various evacuation centers,
earlier reports said.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos has released an initial 3 million pesos
(114,000 U.S. dollars) as relief funds for the conflict-affected
areas in the provinces of North Cotabato and Maguindanao.

The Times:
</P>

with a pledge to safeguard the rights and freedoms of Hong
Kong citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Chair ASEAN Standing Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will chair the
Standing Committee of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and the ASEAN Regional Forum starting in July, the
official Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Manila welcomes these tasks assigned to the country by the
collective ASEAN leadership, the report quoted officials at the
Foreign Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
The chairmanship of the Philippines becomes all the more
challenging because of the ASEAN's membership expansion with the
admission of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar next month, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Part of the committee chairmanship responsibility is the close
monitoring of the three new member countries' adherence to and
performance of their membership obligations in the ASEAN and
helping them adjust to the demands of their membership in the
regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Standing Committee, which reports directly to the
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, is the policy-making and coordinating
organ of the regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN, which now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, will finally realize
its ASEAN-10 vision with the formal admission of Cambodia, Laos
and Myanmar in July.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Regional Forum is a consultative forum between the
group and its dialogue partners including China, Japan, New
Zealand, Australia, Russia, the United States and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The forum meets yearly immediately after the annual ASEAN
Ministerial Meeting to discuss security matters.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh government will
continue to place top priority on attracting foreign investments,
a government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Kazakhstan would attract 5.28 billion
U.S. dollars of foreign investment, including loans, credits and
direct foreign investment this year.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh government plans to attract 22 billion dollars from
1997-2000 between 1997 and 2000, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's investment environment has been improved and it
attracted 1.9 billion dollars of foreign investment last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman pointed out that some Kazakh enterprises
have suffered bad economic results and could not repay loans and
credit. As a result, it has brought some disadvantages to the
government's efforts to attract more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Turkey, Germany and South Korea are
the main investors in Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Strengthen Economic Structure for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Acting Prime
Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said today that the
country needs to strengthen its economic structure in order to
continue to achieve quality growth.
</P>
<P>
Strict controls would be imposed on government spending in the
1998 budget whose policy will stress prudent and disciplined
spending to avoid unnecessary spending and waste, he said at the
first session of the 1998 budget dialogue here.
</P>
<P>
He said the government expenditure must be according to
allocation and additional expenditure outside the allocated sum
would not be allowed except if they were approved by federal
agencies in urgent cases for health, education and rural
development programs.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the dialogue whose theme is "Sustaining High
Quality Growth," the minister said that in addition, the country's
existing strong financial standing ought to be closely nurtured by
the regulatory financial authorities and that banks should have
prudent internal management.
</P>
<P>
"This is to prevent Malaysia from being affected by financial
crisis which had affected a few other countries recently as a
result of non-performing loans in view of the over-exposure of
their banking systems to the property sector and the poor quality
of loans," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has projected a growth of 8 percent for this year
after a growth of 8.8 percent for nine consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for the first five months of this year
amounted to 2.9 percent compared with 3.5 percent last year and
the country's balance of payment for the first four months of this
year showed a small deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian economy has been described by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) as having achieved "high quality growth" which
has brought benefits to all segments of society while the rate of
poverty has been sharply reduced.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus cited
Malaysia as a model country in the efforts to sustain stable
economic growth while strengthening its strong banking system,
according to Anwar.

SINGAPORE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Share prices rose on the
Singapore market after last week's continuous fall as the

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Chinese President Arrives in HK for Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
heading a Chinese government delegation, arrived here this
afternoon by special plane.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, is here to attend the Hong Kong handover ceremony at
midnight today.
</P>
<P>
At about five o'clock this afternoon, two special planes with
the Chinese government delegation on board landed at the Kai Tak
International Airport one after another.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang and Chinese Premier Li Peng emerged from the
cabins and waved to the cheering crowd braving a heavy rain on the
tarmac.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that top Chinese leaders have ever set
foot on this part of Chinese soil, which was under British
colonial rule over the past one and a half centuries.
</P>
<P>
Stepping on the red carpet, Jiang and Li were presented flowers
by four teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people from various walks of life in Hong Kong
waved Chinese national flags, regional flags of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and flowers to greet the
arrival of the Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
They were greeted at the ramp side by Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, who also a member of the Chinese government
delegation had arrived here earlier, Director of the Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch Zhou Nan, Chief Executive of the HKSAR
Tung Chee Hwa and principal officials of the HKSAR government.
Jiang and Li shook hands and exchanged greetings with them one by
one.
</P>
<P>
British Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs
Derek Fatchett was also on hand.
</P>
<P>
Also arriving were members of the Chinese government
delegation, including Wang Hanbin, Zhang Wannian, Fei Xiaotong,
Lei Jieqiong, Cheng Siyuan, Wu Jieping, Luo Gan, Wu Xueqian, Dong
Yinchu, Ma Man-kei, He Luli and Zhuo Lin.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the 72-strong delegation came here from
Shenzhen by car earlier today.
</P>
<P>
After the welcoming ceremony, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng were
driven to their residence at the Harbor Plaza Hotel in Kowloon.
</P>
<P>
The fact that a high-level delegation with extensive
representation headed by President Jiang Zemin came here to attend
the handover ceremony has drawn wide attention of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
It is generally agreed that this reflects the utmost importance
the Chinese government attaches to the return of Hong Kong, as
well as the determination of the central government to
unswervingly implement the basic principles of "one country, two
systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the handover ceremony, President Jiang Zemin will
also head the central delegation at a ceremony marking the
establishment of the HKSAR and the swearing-in of the HKSAR
government and a grand celebration for the establishment of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng will also meet with
Prince Charles, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and dignitaries
from various countries attending the handover ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hails Hong Kong's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran today hailed the return of
Hong Kong to China, which falls midnight tonight, describing it as
a very important development in the political scene of the world
and a great success for China.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Maleki said at a
ceremony held here to celebrate Hong Kong's return to China that
"we again witness that a page in the history of colonization has
been turned over and China enters a new era of its political life."
</P>
<P>
"I seize this occasion to congratulate the Chinese government
and people for this historical event," he said in his address to
300 diplomats, government officials and representatives of various
circles at the ceremony hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Iran Wang Shijie, said on the occasion
that July 1, 1997, will be a big day in the history of China. The
Chinese government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong and wipe out the disgrace brought on China about
one-and-a-half century ago.
</P>
<P>
Ala'eddin Boroujerdi, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for
Asia-Pacific Affairs said Sunday that the event is an end to
one of hundreds of examples of British colonialism in the world
and Iran is pleased with such a great success.
</P>
<P>
He said that the time of colonialism exerted by world powers
has come to an end and the nations now in every corner of the
world stand up against any kind of oppression.
</P>
<P>
Iranian press today also devoted large coverage to the return
of Hong Kong to China by carrying news stories or editorials.
</P>
<P>
English daily Iran News said that China will get its own
territory back after 156 years and the Chinese people have every
reason to be delighted on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio criticized Britain for its rule
over Hong Kong, saying that the return of Hong Kong to China
signaled the end of the British Empire.
</P>
<P>
The radio predicted that Hong Kong would turn into a shinning
star of China due to its powerful economy. The return of Hong
Kong to China will have positive effects on the People's
Republic of China.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower Ahead of RBA Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
lower against the U.S. currency with the market being cautious
about tomorrow's Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board meeting to
consider monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 74.58 U.S. cents, down from
Friday's close of 74.9 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia's treasury manager Paul Macarounas said
the local unit had traded well during the day in a tight range of
74.48 to 74.6 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
He said good selling earlier in the day by a local bank had
seen the Australian dollar test the 74.5 U.S.-cent level, but
buying by exporters had held it up.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen some good business here. It's hard to say whether
it's related to the end of the financial year or corporate
interest," he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted a "tense couple of days" in the foreign exchange
markets, with dealers likely to be bearish on the local currency
until outcomes of tomorrow's RBA meeting and the U.S. Federal
Reserve's monetary policy meeting tomorrow night and Wednesday
were known.
</P>
<P>
The RBA last reduced rates by 50 basis points on May 23,
bringing its official cash rate to 5.5 percent, in line with the
comparable U.S. rate.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, the majority of financial market economists think
the RBA could ease policy by the end of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, Banker's Trust Australia Ltd. fixed interest
strategist Rory Robertson said it appeared increasingly likely
that the central bank would not cut rates this week.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished in Sydney at 85.27 Japanese yen,
falling from 85.49 yen on Friday and at 1.2972 Deutsche marks, up
from 1.2927.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Hails HK's Return (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the moment when the whole nation celebrates Hong Kong's
homecoming, it should be kept in the minds of all the tortuous
paths that the Chinese people have gone through towards the
historical day, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
-- For the day to come, millions of heroic sons and daughters
of the Chinese nation struggled against colonial rule and resisted
foreign aggression unyieldingly, and in wave upon wave, to defend
their national dignity and maintain the integrity of the country's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the weakness and impoverishment of the country
and the decadence and incompetence of its governments in the old
days, generations of patriots in history failed in their struggle
to accomplish their lofty aspirations.
</P>
<P>
-- For the day to come, after the founding of the People's
Republic of China, the Chinese Central Government has constantly
announced that Hong Kong has been an inseparable part of China's
territory since ancient times, that China does not recognize the
three unequal treaties imposed by the British imperialists, and
that this historical question should be peacefully settled through
negotiations at an appropriate time. They also stated that Hong
Kong's status quo should be maintained before a solution is
achieved.
</P>
<P>
New China's first generation of leaders, including Mao Zedong
and Zhou Enlai, paid full attention to the future of Hong Kong and
formulated a series of strategic policies on the Hong Kong issue,
which has contributed to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, and
laid a solid foundation for the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
After the reform and opening-up policy was implemented in 1978,
China entered a new period of development and has rapidly improved
its comprehensive strenghth and its status in the international
community with a most invigorating image. This has provided the
solid basis for negotiating Hong Kong's smooth return.
</P>
<P>
-- For the day to come, the Chinese government, in its quest
for national unity as well as the stability and prosperity of Hong
Kong, put forward the proposal of "one country, two systems." The
proposal has provided practical means to solve the issues
of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, and for the eventual reunification
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Practice has showed the principles of "one country, two
systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" are in the
best interests of the Hong Kong people, and they have gained wide
support from both people in Hong Kong and China's inland areas
as well as approval of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says now "one country, two systems" is being
widely acclaimed as a theory of broad vision and a work of great
creativity in the history of civilization.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily's Editorial Hails Hong Kong's Return (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When celebrating the return of Hong Kong, the editorial says,
we cherish a deep memory of esteemed Comrade Deng Xiaoping. As a
great revolutionary, patriot and the chief architect of China's
reform and opening up drive, he took liberation, revitalization
and reunification of the motherland as his main responsibilities
throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
At the core of the second generation of China's collective
leadership, he creatively put forward the great proposal of "one
country, two systems" with rare political courage, broad
open-mindedness and supreme wisdom, thus playing a significant
role in securing the smooth process of Hong Kong's return to the
motherland. The "one country, two systems" proposal will be
recounted in the country's history as one of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping's most significant contributions to the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The editorial attributes Hong Kong's return to the leadership
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the great achievements of
reform and opening up, the unremitting efforts of three
generations of China's leadership and especially to Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building a socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
This is the solemn conclusion that we draw from history, the
editorial says.
</P>
<P>
However, the return of Hong Kong is just an initial step being
taken to implement the "one country, two systems" guideline. It is
more important now to guarantee the long-term prosperity and
stability of Hong Kong. The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China provides
the fundamental guarantee in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls on people from both Hong Kong and the
inland areas to study and strictly abide by the Basic Law. It
expressed the hope that Hong Kong people will assume the
responsibility of governing Hong Kong with a high sense of being
the master in the house, so as to administrate and build Hong Kong
in an efficient way.
</P>
<P>
Now, under the guidance of the basic theories and lines of the
CPC and the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core, the country enjoys political stability,
economic growth, national unity and social development, it says.
</P>
<P>
The world can expect to see a brighter future for China. With a
5,000-year-old history of civilization, the Chinese nation will
stride ahead with pride into the new century toward the
magnificent goal of modernization. The reunification of China and
the revitalization of the Chinese nation will become a glorious
fact in the future, the editorial says.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Rabbi Salutes Hong Kong People's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A Jewish Rabbi saluted
patriotism of the Hong Kong people on the eve of the territory's
return to China's sovereignty at the midnight today.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by Israel radio, Rabbi Levi Weiman Kelman, head of
Jerusalem's Kol Haneshama congregation who has been visiting Hong
Kong since last year, described the immediate atmosphere there as
one of "real celebration."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese in Hong Kong are by large enthusiastic about
rejoining the motherland as they described," Kelman said.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the Western media's negative reports of the Hong
Kong people's feelings about the historic return, Kelman said the
joy of the Hong Kong people over the return to the motherland
surpasses the so-called worries about their future.
</P>
<P>
"It surprised me, but the Chinese residents feel more strongly
about being connected to what they consider their natural
motherland than they do about issues of democracy and freedom of
press," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kelman added that despite the 156-years of the British
colonial rule of Hong Kong, people there still consider their
place belongs to China rather than Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish Rabbi said that there is still tremendous amount of
resentment among the Chinese residents against the British as the
colonial rulers.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the feelings among the 3,000 Jews living in Hong
Kong, Kelman said they do not worry about the future of the region
at all, adding "The Jewish community really feels unaffected by
the handover."
</P>
<P>
Shmuel Lopin, Rabbi of the Jewish community in Hong Kong, told
Israel Television Sunday that Jewish people are optimistic about
their future in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that rather than going running and hiding
ahead of the Hong Kong's return, the Jews there are growing in
number and making more money than ever.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 714 Jewish families in Hong Kong, who are mostly
not native, are traders, bankers, lawyers and others who are on
limited-time contracts with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The radio report also said that about 300 Jewish parents and
children in Hong Kong will drift merrily tonight into the new age
of Chinese rule aboard a rented ferry at the Victoria Harbor to
share the joy of all the Chinese people celebrating the return of
Hong Kong to the motherland.

TIANJIN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Recent statistics show that
overseas-funded enterprises in the north China port city of
Tianjin have employed 320,000 local people, providing one-third of

<HEADLINE> HK to Add Share to Kenya-China Trade: Kenyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan business official has
predicted that Hong Kong's return to China would have a more
positive influence on Kenya-China trade, The East African
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper quoted Mary Kinyani, Director of Internal
Trade at Kenya's Ministry of Commerce, as saying that the return
would further open China to Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is confident of better quality imports
from China as there are more industries producing quality goods
in Hong Kong, which will find ready markets in East Africa, the
official noted.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya has had a good relationship with China for a long
time," he said, adding this is essential for bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Kenya's Export Promotion Council told the paper
that "we hope to make Hong Kong a model coffee drinking city
within China" because Kenyan coffee is not yet very popular in
the city.
</P>
<P>
One sector in Kenya which could attract Hong Kong people is
likely to be tourism, the paper said, adding that local travel
agents in Hong Kong had reported growing interest in East Africa,
particularly Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Vicky Keng, Operation Manager of Morning Star Travel Service
which is one of the largest tour operators in Hong Kong, was
quoted as saying that "Kenya is currently our second choice
destination in Africa, particularly for people who have been to
South Africa before."
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the prospect of this trend spreading to
China raised exciting visions of bringing thousands of Chinese to
spend their money in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
The paper disclosed that selected Kenyan producers would visit
various Asian cities including Hong Kong next month to promote
their commodities.

<P>
HANGZHOU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest offshore

<HEADLINE> Banks' Interest Rates Likely to Slide in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's bank interest rates are
expected to come down following a drop in Treasury bills rate and
a meeting held last week between the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
and the Kenya Bankers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The CBK and commercial banks have been agreed on the measure
to encourage borrowing and stimulate economy, according to local
reports today.
</P>
<P>
The average interest rate for the 91-day Treasury bills
slipped from the 12 weeks' moving average of 20.1 percent to 18.9
percent last week. Commercial banks use the 91-day Treasury bills
rates as the benchmark for base lending rates.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates have in the past been a point of public dispute
between the CBK and government officials on one hand and
commercial banks on the other.
</P>
<P>
The governmental officials have called for reduced lending
rates in line with the steady drop of Treasury bills, continued
low rate of inflation and a stable foreign exchange regime.
</P>
<P>
The large banks, led by Barclays Bank (22 percent), charge the
lowest base interest rates while the smaller ones, led by
Investments &AMP; Mortgages Bank (31.50), charge the highest,
according to central bank figures.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates retard economic growth because only
short-term investors and existing industrialists can afford to
borrow. Few new enterprises are set up in periods of high
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Stability of the exchange rate, low inflation and high
interest rates offer attractive investment opportunities for
speculative foreign exchange inflows, making the Kenyan currency
Shilling artificially stronger than it should be, experts say.
</P>
<P>
The CBK perhaps seeks to strengthen the financial sector by
compelling poorly performing banks and this could force them to
increase their capital, they say.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said in the 1997
budget speech that locally incorporated banks will be given up to
December 31, 1999, to raise their share capital from some 1.3
million U.S. Dollars to 3.6 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Only 33 out of the 52 commercial banks doing business in Kenya
have 3.6 million Dollars in capital at present.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 25 percent of Kenyan banks are below the
CBK-set industry performance standards, according to a report
recently released by the CBK's Supervision Department.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Reduces Guinea Worm Cases by 99 Percents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has reduced recorded cases
of Guinea worm from 126,400 in 1992 to 1,445 in 1996, "The New
Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
John Okidi, the field coordinator of the global 2,000/Uganda
Guinea Worm Eradication Program (UGWEP), told the newspaper that
their new target in 1997 is to prevent transmission of every
detected cases and eliminate the remaining cases.
</P>
<P>
Kampala itself reportedly has a five-year-absence of the
disease, which spreads when people drink contaminated water with
Guinea worm larva. The only exception in the city now is an
affected prisoner from Kotido District in the north-east.
</P>
<P>
UGWEP has introduced a reward system for those reporting the
disease. The remaining cases are now in the north and north-east
of the country, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's 1997 Budget Deficit Expected Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel's state budget deficit
for 1997 could end at 423 million U.S. dollars to 570 million
U.S. dollars, much above the target, according to a report of The
Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Leo Leiderman, head of Bank of Israel Research Department, was
quoted by the pro-government English daily as saying something
must be done to ensure that there should be no repetition of the
fiscal expansion tendency seen in the last two years of the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
He said Bank of Israel, the country's central bank, will
shortly propose to the Treasury the creation of an annual state
expenditure target to curb government spending.
</P>
<P>
At present, the government is aiming to keep the budget
deficit within its own target of 2.8 percent of the GDP, which
translates to a deficit of some 274 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and former Finance Minister Dan Meridor agreed in May
to a budget cut by some 171 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far, the government has failed to implement the cut, with
sources close to Netanyahu admitting that he is fearful of
entering a new round of budget negotiations in the cabinet,
particularly in the light of ongoing political upheavals.
</P>
<P>
The central bank is now of the opinion that the budget deficit
will be 0.43 percent to 0.58 percent higher than the one estimated
by the government, which suggests the proposed 171 million
dollars' cut will fall short of the required cutback.
</P>
<P>
An overall economic growth will reach 2.5 percent to 3 percent
this year, but is likely to be surpassed in 1998, totalling
some 3 percent to 4 percent, according to estimates of Bank of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The bank also believes the economic slowdown is bottoming out
and does not foresee a further slowdown, or a slide into
recession. But independent economists are reportedly not as
optimistic as the official central bank.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Upgrade Choppers Against Missile Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is to invite international
bids to equip its military helicopters with anti-missile systems
in an effort to avoid terrorist missile attacks, local newspaper
Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted defense experts, who asked not to be named, as
saying that firms from the United States, France, Sweden and
Israel would bid for equipping the Turkish helicopters.
</P>
<P>
According to expert estimate, equipping such an anti-missile
system for each helicopter will cost around 100,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50 Sikorsky helicopters, 19 Cougars, 17 Mi-17s and
around 30 Cobras will be included in the modernization program,
defense sources said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the sources as saying that this bid is
launched to increase Turkey's military choppers' ability to resist
terrorist missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military were shocked when their two military
helicopters were downed by anti-aircraft missiles of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels in northern Iraq last month,
which killed 11 servicemen.
</P>
<P>
This has forced Turkey to take urgent measures to improve its
choppers to prevent such incidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war
in southeastern Turkey. Turkish troops began a cross-border
military operation in northern Iraq on May 14 to attack the PKK
rebels.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wool Price Expected to Continue Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Analysts today predicted that
wool prices would be weak this week after a sharp correction last
week saw the Eastern Market Indicator (EMI) plummet 47 Australian
cents to 706 cents (529 U.S. cents) per kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
The fall followed five weeks of escalating wool prices due to
limited supply, which brought the EMI to an almost two-year high
of 753 Australian cents (564 U.S. cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Brokers Wesfarmers Dalgety said today that the confidence and
strength of the market came to a halt last week in response to
increased quantities on offer, after growers released stocks
hoping to take advantage of boosted prices.
</P>
<P>
"Weakness is expected to continue this week," Wesfarmers said
in its Wool Weekly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
"However, grower reaction to the downturn is anticipated to
make this less severe."
</P>
<P>
Wesfarmers said a larger offering of 132,492 bales would be up
for sale this week in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
After this week, there will be a three-week break in sales.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Approves First Gold Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has approved investment
license to the first gold refinery plant in the country,
according to a latest statement released by the Zambia Investment
Center.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that about four million US dollars will be
spent in establishing the gold refinery by Milkwood Ltd., a
company jointly owned by two South African and two British
nationals, to purchase, assay and refine precious metals
including gold, silver, platinum, rhodium and palladium.
</P>
<P>
This investment will make Zambia the second country in Africa
to have a gold refinery after South Africa, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Milkwood Ltd. is expected to purchase precious metals in
Zambia and from the region and to refine them for the export
market.

<P>
The investment comes after some foreign companies heightened
their gold prospecting activities last year in Ndola rural of
Copperbelt province.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia's strategic position on the regional market as well as
its good economic environment influenced Milkwood Limited's
choice of the country as the location of the investment," a
partner of the company was quoted by the statement as saying.

<HEADLINE> Lanterns, Streamers Greet Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 30 (Xinhua) -- With just a few hours left before
the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, many places in China
have been decorated with red lanterns, colored lights and
streamers to greet the historic event.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing's Tiananmen Square, strings of giant red lanterns
have been hung high on buildings. In Shanghai, some two million
pots of flowers have been laid along the streets, and in Shenzhen,
a city neighboring Hong Kong, several hundred thousand lamps will
add color to the city's night sky.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, ordinary Chinese people are welcoming Hong
Kong's return in their own ways. In central China's Henan
Province, six brothers made the biggest drum in China for the gala
in Tiananmen Square this evening. It measures three meters in
diameter and nearly one meter in height.
</P>
<P>
Dagu Fort in Tianjin in north China, once occupied by British
invaders, has been renovated as a place for patriotic education,
and in Nanjing City in east China, where an unequal treaty was
imposed on China by imperialists, a "warning bell" weighing some
3.5 tons has been made to remind people never forget history.
</P>
<P>
Art troupes are staging various performances to greet Hong
Kong's return. Xie Jin, director of the film "Opium War," said in
an interview with Xinhua News Agency that "A nation can only face
its humiliating history when it is really standing up on its own
feet." His film is being shown in 1,300 cinemas across the
country.

<HEADLINE> Customs Efficiency Helps Boost Ship Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Customhouse has been
striving hard to improve its service, which has contributed much
to a marked increase in the export of ships.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the city's customs show that it supervised the
exports of ships and boats valued at 167 million U.S. dollars
between January and May of this year, an eight-fold increase on
the figure for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The shipbuilding industry has become a pillar force in China's
export of machinery and electronic commodities.
</P>
<P>
Information from China State Shipbuilding Corporation indicated
that 85 percent of ships built in China last year were exported,
earning a total of 1.19 billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange.
Both figures are record highs.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is one of China's oldest shipbuilding bases. The port
city has several large shipyards whose competitiveness has
improved on the international market.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, half of the output value of China State Shipbuilding
Corporation was generated by Shanghai Shipbuilding Company.
</P>
<P>
Streamlining measures introduced by the Shanghai Customs
include the establishment of a new express service window at
Pujiang Customs Office to provide a swifter service to those going
through necessary export procedures.
</P>
<P>
It also provides major shipbuilders with certificates of tax
rebates for exports of vessels in time to expedite circulation of
funds. They have also accelerated inspections of imported
equipment needed for the building of exported vessels.
</P>
<P>
China-built vessels have been sold to more than 40 countries
and regions, including Norway, Greece and the United States,
themselves major shipbuilding nations. China has become the
world's third largest builder and exporter of ships after Japan
and the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
According to development plans drafted for the Ninth
Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000) by China State Shipbuilding
Corporation, China will generate 30 billion yuan in annual
shipbuilding industrial output value, build ships and boats
exceeding three million dwt annually and generate three billion
yuan in pre-tax profits by 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said here today that he is confident in the prosperous future
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"As we approach the midnight (of June 30), there is more
confidence in Hong Kong's future than any of us could...predict
five years ago," Cook told a press conference after a meeting with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright this morning.
</P>
<P>
"You're in a city in which the stock exchange is rising,
property prices are rising, and investment is leaping forward," he
said.
</P>
<P>
There are more people coming to Hong Kong to stay than those
leaving Hong Kong, said the foreign secretary.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the terms of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration will be adhered to, and the future for Hong Kong's
next 50 years will be as good as the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
On the deployment of Chinese troops in Hong Kong after the
handover ceremony, Cook said that under the Joint Declaration and
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
China has the right to station troops within Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Declaration and the Basic Law, the
troops are for external defense only, and the internal security is
a matter of the future Hong Kong government and the Hong Kong
police, he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain wants to set up a "constructive working relationship"
with China, and central to the relationship will be Hong Kong,
which will become "a bridge, not a barrier," between the two
countries, he said.

11, k. k. Modi, vice-president of the Federation of Indian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), said the people of
Indian origin in Hong Kong can be the good-will ambassadors for
Indian business in China since many of them have been dealing with
India for a long time.
</P>
<P>
They can easily propagate Indian goods to China's inland and
can easily source them from India, Modi said, adding that once
this direct trade route is opened up, bilateral trade between
India and China will accelerate and can reach 1.4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The India-China Joint Business Council (JBC) has identified a
number of projects for Chinese investment in India and China these
days are aggressively bidding for major projects in the country,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
India's investment in China has gone up over the years and a
large number of Indian companies are also exploring the
possibility of joint ventures in China, he further said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair said here today that adherance to the Joint Declaration and
a desire to build a strong and constructive relationship with
China are the two pillars of future Britain-China relationship.
</P>
<P>
He flew into here this morning to attend the handover ceremony
at midnight.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at Kai Tak airport, Blair said: "What is
absolutely essential is that there are two pillars, foundations,
of our relationship of the future."
</P>
<P>
"The first is adherance to the Joint Declaration, the agreement
between Britain and China that guarantees the future prosperity
and freedom of Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
And secondly, a desire to build a strong and stable
relationship with China for the future, because "it is in the
interests of the people of Hong Kong, in the interests of the
people of United Kingdom, and of course, in the interests of the
people of China."
</P>
<P>
Blair voiced confidence in Hong Kong's prosperity after it
returns to China.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that it has a good future, a prosperous future for
the people of Hong Kong provided we keep in place those basic
agreements that we have," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> FIIs Remain Upbeat Over HK's Return to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Fund managers of leading
foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remain upbeat over the
handover of Hong Kong to China, India's "Business Standard" paper
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The red sun that will rise over the island from tomorrow has
not cast any shadow over the upbeat business mood of Hong Kong's
FIIs community. Some FIIs have already drawn up plans to expand
their staff and operations in Hong Kong," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, Morgan Stanley Asia ltd and some other FIIs have
lined up formal black-tie balls to celebrate the handover at
midnight."
</P>
<P>
According to a cross-section of FIIs, the trading community's
mood is positive and the Hong Kong financial markets seem bullish.
Trading activity on the Hong Kong stock market was reported to be
brisk on Friday, the last trading day before the five-day handover
holiday, it further said.
</P>
<P>
"The mood is definitely upbeat. We have seen the financial
markets here do well ( with indices touching a new high and Hong
Kong red chips moving up). We plan to strengthen our operations
further," the paper quoted Morgan Stanley Asia ltd's Executive
Director J. Wesley Mcdade as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hoare Govett (HG) Asia Securities is also planning to increase
its staff strength in Hong Kong. S. Subramanian, director of HG's
Indian operations, said that fund managers in Hong Kong are
confident that its economy will not change dramatically after the
handover.

<HEADLINE> Finance Bill Passed Amid Opposition Walkout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's much-debated national
budget for fiscal 1997-98 is expected to be passed today after the
Parliament passed the Finance Bill Sunday night amidst angry
walkout by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has
called a half-day strike on July 3 in protest against the
Infrastructure Development Surcharge and some other new duties and
taxes, which they said, would undermine production.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria Sunday night piloted the
Finance Bill 1997, in which he dropped duties on a number of items
proposed in the new budget, but rejected the plea for withdrawing
the much-talked import surcharge.
</P>
<P>
Winding up general debate on the proposed budget in Parliament,
he also rejected the demand for keeping some items like slippers
and nails out of the Value Added Tax (VAT) net.
</P>
<P>
The Minister withdrew the 2.5 percent duty on raw cotton and
reduced the proposed duty of 7.5 percent on textile machinery and
textile air conditioners to 2.5 percent "considering the need of
backward linkage for readymade garments and national priority".
</P>
<P>
But Kibria spoke strongly in favor of the proposed
Infrastructure Development Surcharge and said the alternative of
such a low rate surcharge was to impose duties at a higher rate on
many more items.
</P>
<P>
The half-empty House passed the bill "unanimously" by voice
vote after the BNP legislators walked out of the House in protest
against the additional taxes.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the countrywide strike program, BNP Secretary
General Mannan Bhuiyan said the opposition in Parliament had tried
to press the government to withdraw the additional taxes but the
government did not listen to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
"Now we are compelled to go for greater movement like strike,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Sign New Investment Pact with Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Hong Kong have
been negotiating an Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement
(IPPA) that will enhance their close bilateral economic relations,
the Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Even as Hong Kong prepares to become a Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China on July 1, It has been business as usual for
Hong Kong-Singapore ties, it said.
</P>
<P>
The IPPA has been under negotiation for the past year. Like
those monetary cooperation agreements that the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority signed with its regional counterparts, the IPPA with
Singapore is part of the confidence-building measures to dispel
any jitters the foreign business community might have about Hong
Kong after its return to China, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The IPPA seeks to give the investment community added
confidence in each other's territory," Chan Heng Wing, Singapore's
Consul-General to Hong Kong, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
With or without the IPPA, investment flows between the
Singapore and Hong Kong have been growing at a rapid pace, the
report noted, adding that the heavy bookings in the first-class
and business section of Singapore Airlines flights between
Singapore and Hong Kong attest to the strong commercial links.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore is expanding its enormous ties with Hong Kong
because we believe that Hong Kong will maintain its prosperity and
way of life as before. We are confident that Hong Kong will revert
smoothly from Britain to China," Chan Heng Wing said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Drivers Protest Against Gas Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Nepali transporters launched a
jam-the-road campaign here Sunday to protest against the gas price
hike and demand rise in transport fares.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of buses, minibuses, tempos, taxies and other public
transportation vehicles jammed the roads in front of the Nepal Oil
Corporation (NOC) offices, with their owners calling for a 20
percent hike on fares on gas operated vehicles and 35 percent hike
on diesel operated public vehicles.
</P>
<P>
They have threatened to increase the fares unilaterally without
government permission from Monday.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, the NOC lifted the price of gas from 34 rupees (60
U.S. cents) per litre to 39 rupees (68 cents), diesel from 14
rupees (25 cents) to 17.5 rupees (30 cents) and kerosene from 9.5
rupees (17 cents) to 11 rupees (19 cents).
</P>
<P>
The NOC argued that it had no other choice because in the past
8 to 9 months, it had suffered a loss of 490 million rupees (8.5
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the price hike has since spelled a spate of protest
movements across the country.
</P>
<P>
Bowing to mounting pressure, the government decided last week
to cut the prices of diesel and kerosene by two rupees and half a
rupee respectively, but maintain the gas price unchanged at 39
rupees (68 cents) per litre.
</P>
<P>
The government said its subsidy has reached 510 million rupees
(8.95 million dollars) in the past five months alone.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen met here this morning with British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
Both Qian and Cook are here to attend the Sino-British Hong
Kong handover ceremony at midnight today.
</P>
<P>
Qian described the meeting as of great significance as it is
just hours before the historical moment of Hong Kong's return to
China, a moment that marks the end of a past period and ushers in
a new period.
</P>
<P>
He added that he believed Hong Kong will maintain long-term
prosperity and stability after July 1.
</P>
<P>
Cook described the coming evening as one of pride for China,
and congratulated the Chinese government on recovering Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Britain and China had made sensible and fine arrangements for
the return of Hong Kong, he said, adding that Hong Kong should
become a bridge linking the two countries in the future.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the settlement of the Hong Kong question, which
started in 1982, took 15 years, during which there were
cooperation, disagreement and even confrontation between China and
Britain. The road was far from even.
</P>
<P>
"However, we finally found a peaceful solution to this major
problem left over by history. This is the result of both sides'
efforts to rise to the trend of the times, seek common ground
while reserving differences, and cooperate in a pragmatic manner,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that both sides should look into the future, and that
 maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability is not only in
the interest of China, but also in the interest of Britain and
even the entire international community.
</P>
<P>
Cook agreed to Qian's views, and pointed out that Britain has
tremendous business interests in Hong Kong and hopes to further
develop its relations with China through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue to maintain good dialogues and contacts,
and make the Hong Kong handover a new starting point for the
Sino-British relations," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers held that in the future, China and Britain
should make further efforts to develop their relations of
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
They also exchanged views on other questions of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Cook said that Britain supports China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade relations between China and the rest of
the world have been developing rapidly, he said. It's a good thing
that China becomes a member of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the wish that Britain and China could enhance
consultation and make joint efforts for the successful convening
of the Asia-Europe Meeting next year.
</P>
<P>
Qian agreed that it is conducive to world peace and stability
that Asia and Europe strengthen economic cooperation and leaders
of Asian and European countries meet regularly.
</P>
<P>
he said that Chinese and British officials can have more
contacts in this direction.
</P>
<P>
Qian invited Cook to visit China at his convenience. Cook
expressed his gratitude for the invitation.

<HEADLINE> Former Australian PM Praises China, Blasts UK Over HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Former Australian prime minister
Bob Hawke today praised China's handling of Hong Kong's transition
and attacked Britain's role in introducing "democratic reform" to
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"They (China) are acting properly in accordance with
international law, custom and practice and the provisions of the
decisions of 1984 (joint declaration)," the former minister was
quoted today by the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
"The Brits grabbed Hong Kong, forcefully took it from China 150
years ago. Why? Because the Chinese had the temerity to say we are
not going to allow you to sell opium to our people," Hawke, who
was prime minister from 1983-1991, said.
</P>
<P>
"China could have taken this back ... it has chosen not to take
back Hong Kong as it was entitled to, it's chosen to honor the
99-year lease in regard to the new territories," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the so-called democratic reform introduced by Governor Chris
Patten to Hong Kong, he said "Britain had this place for 150-plus
years and they did nothing in that period about introducing
democracy until the dying minutes".
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I am a believer in democracy, but I am not a
believer in trying to shove down other people's throats a
timetable for bringing into existence rights which took the West
an enormous period ... to bring about in our own countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"And the record of the West in regard to China is one of
barbarism, they have seized their countries, they have raped and
pillaged. The values which they have exposed to China over a
century and a half have been frightful values," Hawke said.
</P>
<P>
"And now for them to be standing up and preaching to China as
to how they should behave I find basically morally repugnant."

<HEADLINE> China Holds Seeing-off Rally for PLA Hong Kong Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 30 (Xinhua) -- China held a grand rally here
this morning to see off the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA)
troops to be stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
General Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military Commission
(CMC) and chief of the PLA General Staff, read out the order by
Jiang Zemin, chairman of the CMC, on the troops' entering and
stationing in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and vice
chairman of the CMC, asked the 4,000-strong officers and men of
the HKSAR garrison to carry out their defense duties in accordance
with law and fulfill all tasks successfully.
</P>
<P>
Liu reviewed a guard of honor made up of men of the ground,
naval and air forces of the troops at the beginning of the rally,
which was attended by more than 6,000 people including senior
officials from central military departments, central government
departments and local governments, and local civilians and troops.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the rally, Liu said that the stationing
of PLA troops in Hong Kong is a significant symbol of China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and also
an important guarantee for safeguarding the national sovereignty
and security and for maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability.
</P>
<P>
He urged the troops to unswervingly carry out Deng Xiaoping's
great conception of "one country, two systems" and enhance their
sense of duty and sense of responsibility for safeguarding Kong
Kong's prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
He called on the officers and men of the HK garrison to bear in
mind the principle of serving the people whole-heartedly and be
loyal to the party, the motherland, the people and socialism.
</P>
<P>
Liu stressed that the troops should tighten its own management
in a strict way, carry out their duties in accordance with law,
abide by discipline strictly and never commit even the slightest
offense against the civilians.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary for the troops to strengthen cultural
development, make great efforts to enhance military training and
improve their comprehensive quality, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The troops are surely capable of inheriting and developing the
fine traditions of the PLA and always maintaining the good image
of the PLA as a mighty, civilized force in line with Deng
Xiaoping's thought guiding army building in the new period and
Jiang Zemin's expositions on army building, he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the troops will surely live up to the great
expectations placed upon them and fulfill their duties and tasks
in Hong Kong successfully.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Tao Bojun, commander of the Guangzhou Area
Command, also asked the troops to firmly carry out the order by
Chairman Jiang Zemin so as to ensure safe and smooth entering and
stationing in Hong Kong on scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ruihua, governor of the Guangdong province, and Li Youwei,
secretary of the Shenzhen Municipal Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party, expressed in separate speeches that local
governments and people will go all out as before to support the
troops as a powerful backing and reliable rear, and make
contributions to the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Major General Xiong Ziren, political commissar of the troops,
said on behalf of all officers and men that they will keep in mind
their tasks, always be loyal to the motherland, strictly perform
their defense duties, safeguard the sovereignty and dignity of the

<HEADLINE> hkhk - IOC President Samaranch Reaffirms HK's Post-Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- Juan Antonio Samaranch,
President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), reaffirmed
that Hong Kong will remain independent and autonomous for Olympics
and other major international competitions after it returns to
China.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch is to meet with A. de O. Sales, President of the Hong
Kong Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (HKF&AMP;OC) and
other local sports leaders for detailed discussions on related
sports issues after the handover, when Hong Kong have become a
special administrative region of China.
</P>
<P>
"For me, the most important thing is that the youth of Hong
Kong can take part in Olympic Games and all other main
international competitions in the future in an independent and
autonomous way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch made these comments upon his arrival here this
morning for ceremonies for the Hong Kong handover and the
inauguration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) government around midnight here today.
</P>
<P>
The IOC chief is visiting Hong Kong at the invitation of the
local Sports Community for celebrations marking Hong Kong's return
to China.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law of the HKSAR, Hong Kong will in the
future keep its independent status in the field of sports under
the name "Hong Kong, China."
</P>
<P>
An official statement would be issued at the end of his visit
to Hong Kong, Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC chief is also expected to meet Tung Chee Hwa, Chief
Executive of the HKSAR, here today.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch is scheduled to leave here on Tuesday for a visit to
Beijing, where he is expected to meet Wu Shaozu, the Chinese
minister in charge the State Physical Culture and Sports
Commission, who is on a Chinese governmental delegation arriving
here later today for the handover ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch is scheduled to fly back to Hong Kong Wednesday to
attend the Reunification Cup soccer match on Thursday in Hong Kong
Stadium, where an all-star team of the International Football
Federation (FIFA) plays their counterpart from the Asian Football
Confederation (AFC).
</P>
<P>
Joao Havelange, President of the FIFA, is scheduled to arrive
here later on Monday, who is also to attend the handover
ceremonies and the Reunification Cup.
</P>
<P>
Sepp Blatter, FIFA's Secretary-general, had assured the game's
local governing body, the Hong Kong Football Association, on an
earlier visit to Hong Kong that the Association would keep its
FIFA membership as well as its independent status after the
handover.

"Hong Kong's return will help settle the Macao and Taiwan
issues and set an example for the settlement of the outstanding

<HEADLINE> Bullish Share Market Waits On Australia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market is
set to threaten its record high this week, following renewed
confidence on Wall Street and increased expectations of a cut in
official interest rates in Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia board meets tomorrow and will
consider whether to deliver the fifth cut in official interest
rates in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
"Interest rate speculations is likely to resurface this week
given there is market consensus that the US Federal Reserve will
not raise rates," said Chris Loong, a fixed interest strategist.
</P>
<P>
The US Federal Reserve meets tomorrow and Wednesday. Its
decision will influence Australian markets because of "the equal
cash rates between the two economies and the vulnerability of the
Australian dollar to what happens in the US," Loong said.
</P>
<P>
Loong said there was "a high probability" that the Reserve Bank
of Australia (RBA) will move to cut rates, "as long as we have
continued stability in the Australian dollar and if upcoming
figures for retail sales and employment are on the weak side."
</P>
<P>
Ian Horton, managing director of Prudential Portfolio Managers
Australia, said continuing weak consumer demand and low inflation
meant there was not a lot to be lost from cutting interest rates:
"It doesn't seem to be a high risk move".
</P>
<P>
A key reason for RBA to cut rates is to try to boost
Australia's struggling economy, particularly the manufacturing and
retail sectors.
</P>
<P>
Australian retail trade figures and building approvals for May
are due out on Wednesday. The latter may show signs of increased
consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
RBA cut official interest rates by 0.5 percentage points just
over a month ago and opinion is divided over whether they should
implement another cut so quickly.
</P>
<P>
The Australian share market closed last week at 2702.4 points,
just 10 points below its all-time high.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it's going to go a bit higher," Horton said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The People's Republic of China
is to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.
The following is a chronicle of major events in Hong Kong's
history.
</P>
<P>
From the late 1700s to 1842: in an attempt to cut trade deficit
with China, Britain started to sell opium to China from the late
1700s, thus bringing great affliction upon Chinese people and
plundering a huge amount of wealth from China. In 1838, the Qing
Dynasty government sent Lin Zexu as the imperial envoy to ban
opium trade in Guangdong. Under the pretext of China's prohibition
of opium trade, Britain decided to launch a war against China.
Hence the Opium War broke out in 1840.
</P>
<P>
On January 26, 1841: British marines disembarked near the
present Possession Street in Sheung Wan, and occupied the Hong
Kong island by force.
</P>
<P>
On August 29,1842: Britain forced the Qing Dynasty government,
which had been defeated in the First Opium War, to sign the
unequal Treaty of Nanking, in accordance with which the Hong Kong
island was ceded to Britain. The area of the island was about 78
sq. km.
</P>
<P>
In 1860: by launching the Second Opium War, Britain forced the
Qing Dynasty government to sign the Convention of Peking, which
ceded Kowloon to the British. In accordance with the convention,
the area south of the present Border Street on the Kowloon
Peninsula was ceded to Britain. The area was measured nearly eight
sq. km then.
</P>
<P>
On June 9, 1898: Britain forced the Qing Dynasty government to
sign in Beijing the Convention Respecting an Extension of the Hong
Kong Territory, and forcibly leased the area south of the Shenzhen
River and north of the Border Street, as well as 235 nearby
islands (namely, the so-called "New Territories," which account
for about 91 percent of Hong Kong's land area). The term of the
lease was 99 years and would expire in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On April 16, 1899: the British hoisted the Union Jack at Tai Po
in "New Territories", claiming that Chinese residents in "New
Territories" were under British rule from 2:50 p.m. on April 16,
1899. The local residents rose to fight the British, and were
cruelly put down by the British army with force.
</P>
<P>
On the morning of December 8, 1941: the Japanese troops started
to attack Hong Kong, and occupied it on December 25. Hong Kong was
ruled by the Japanese for three years and eight months.

<P>
On August 14, 1945: Japan announced unconditioned surrender to
the Allies. On September 16, the ceremony to accept the surrender
of the Japanese troops in Hong Kong was held in the Government
House. Britain resumed its colonial rule over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, 1949: the People's Republic of China was founded.
On January 6, 1950, Britain officially announced its recognition
of the government of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
On October 1971: China resumed its legitimate seat in the
United Nations. In March 1972, China and Britain reached an
agreement on establishing diplomatic relations at the
ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
On March 8: Huang Hua, the Chinese ambassador to the United
Nations, wrote the chairman of the UN Special Committee of
Twenty-Four, a committee on the decolonialization issue, declaring
that Hong Kong and Macao are not "colonies", and the solution to
the Hong Kong and Macao issues is within the scope of China's
sovereignty. In November, 1972, the UN General Assembly voted 99-5
to adopt the resolution on deleting Hong Kong and Macao from the
list of colonies.
</P>
<P>
On March 29, 1979: Deng Xiaoping, while meeting visiting
Governor of Hong Kong Sir Murray MacLehose, pointed out that Hong
Kong "is part of China's territory, but we regard Hong Kong as a
special region and a special issue to deal with. No matter how the
Hong Kong issue will be solved by 1997, the special status of Hong
Kong will be maintained, namely, within this century and over a a
long period in the next century, Hong Kong may practice its
capitalism, while we will practice our socialism." He assured
investors around the world that they did not have to worry.
</P>
<P>
On September 24, 1982: when meeting British Prime Minister
Margarite Thatcher, Deng Xiaoping made it clear that the issue of
sovereignty over Hong Kong was not open to discussion. Under
China's jurisdiction, Hong Kong's existing political and economic
systems, and even most of its laws, could be maintained.
</P>
<P>
From July 12, 1983, to September 5, 1984: China and Britain
held 22 rounds of negotiations on the issue of Hong Kong question.
On September 26, 1984, China and Britain initialed the Joint
Declaration on the Hong Kong Issue.

<P>
On December 19, 1984: the Chinese and British governments
officially signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing.
In the Declaration, the two governments solemnly announced that
the government of the People's Republic of China had decided to
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997;
and the government of Britain would return Hong Kong to the
People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
On May 27, 1985: China and Britain exchanged the instruments of
ratification for the Joint Declaration and three annexes, which
demonstrated that the Joint Declaration came into force and Hong
Kong entered the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1985: the Drafting Committee of the Basic Law of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was officially
established. The committee consisted of 59 members, including 23
from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On December 18, 1985: the Consultation Committee of the Basic
Law was established in Hong Kong. It consisted of 180
representatives from all sectors and all strata of the Hong Kong
society.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, 1990: the Third Session of the Seventh National
People's Congress (NPC) deliberated and passed the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the three
annexes. The Basic Law, in the form of national law, embodies the
concept of "one country, two systems" and the principle and policy
of "one country, two systems", Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong, and a high degree of autonomy. It serves as the fundamental
code for maintenance of Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
On October 7, 1992: the newly appointed Governor of Hong Kong
Christopher Patten made public the political reform bill, which
made drastic changes in Hong Kong's existing political structure.
The bill violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the
principle of dovetailing with the Basic Law, and the agreements
and understandings concerning the arrangements for Hong Kong's
election for 1994/1995, which were reached between the Chinese and
British governments in the late stage of drafting the Basic Law.
Hence it was called the "triple violation" bill.

On March 31, 1993: as the British side adopted an uncooperative
attitude on the issue of Hong Kong, the First Session of the
Eighth NPC adopted the decision that authorized the NPC Standing
Committee to establish a preliminary working body of the
Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR. On July 2, the Standing
Committee of the Eighth NPC adopted the decision to establish the
Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the
HKSAR. The preliminary working committee was officially
established on July 16. Its main duties included all kinds of
preparatory work for China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 and for Hong Kong's smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
From April to November in 1993: representatives of the Chinese
and British governments held 17 rounds of talks concerning the
arrangements for the 1994/1995 election. During the 17th round,
the British side unilaterally announced the suspension of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
On January 26, 1996: the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR
was established. It consisted of 150 members, of whom 94, or 63
percent, came from Hong Kong. The committee was in charge of the
preparatory work for the establishment of the SAR. As the British
side unilaterally pursued its "political reform package," the
existing Legislative Council of Hong Kong could not become the
first Legislative Council of the HKSAR. To ensure the smooth
transition and avoid a legal vacuum, the Preparatory Committee
decided to form a Provisional Legislative Council for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On November 2, 1996: the Preparatory Committee elected the
Selection Committee for the first HKSAR government. The Selection
Committee was in charge of selecting the first Chief Executive and
the Provisional Legislative Council of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, 1996: the Selection Committee elected Tung Chee
Hwa as the first Chief Executive of the HKSAR; on December 16, the
11th Plenary Meeting of the State Council approved the
appointment, and Premier Li Peng signed the No. 207 State Council
Decree that appointed Tung Chee Hwa as the first Chief Executive
of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On December 21, 1996: in Shenzhen, the Selection Committee
elected 60 members of the Provisional Legislative Council of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On January 24, 1997: Tung Chee Hwa announced the list of the
members of the first Executive Council of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On February 20, 1997: the 23 principal officials of the HKSAR
government nominated by Tung were appointed by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, 1997: according to the recommendation by the
Judiciary Recommendation Committee, Tung agreed to appoint Li
Kwok-nang Chief Justice of the HKSAR Court of Final Appeal. The
appointment will take effect on July 1.

Ronaldo's goal gave Brazil a 2-1 lead and Ze Roberto added the

<P>
Christos Kolas, 30, an ethnic Greek, died after being fatally
wounded Saturday by an armed gang attacking the building.
</P>

Albania, in which Greece played a leading part.

grief at the shooting death of Kolas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Economic Coordination Pact Proposed at Athens Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 29 (Xinhua) -- The socialist finance ministers
from European Union (EU) member states today proposed that an
economic coordination pact be signed in order to coordinate
efforts related to EU economic policy and to counterbalance the
German-inspired stability and development pact.
</P>
<P>
Greek National Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou
said at a press conference that the proposed economic coordination
was put together with the decisive contribution of the former
European Commission President Jacques Delors, who is currently the
head of the research group "Our Europe."
</P>
<P>
Delors would be willing to exercise his influence with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an effort to convince him to accept the
pact aimed at abolishing the political vacuum in which the
European central bank would operate at the risk of following an
"autonomous monetary policy," Papantoniou said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers wanted to upgrade the council of national economy
and finance ministers (ECOFIN) so that the politicians, and not
the bankers and technocrats, would be making the end decisions
regarding the union's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the German central bank and Kohl's ruling
party constitute the strongest opposition to plans by the EU's
socialist ministers to place the European central bank under
political control.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, who gathered here for a two-day conference on
economic and social developments, also said in a communique that
they agreed to finding more resources in order to finance major
infrastructure projects as well as the union's small and
medium-sized businesses which employ two thirds of Europe's labor
force.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the need for more active policies to boost
employment and fresh motives to help the unemployed find new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese in Moscow Celebrate Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 29 (Xinhua) -- More than two thousands Chinese
gathered in Moscow on Sunday to celebrate their happy event -- the
return of Hong Kong to its motherland, which is to realize on July
1.
</P>
<P>
The celebration held in the "People's Threat" of "Izmailovsky
Hotel" started with the Chinese national anthem, when all the
people in the hall stood up.
</P>
<P>
On one side of the hall there was a red silk banner with
more than one thousand signatures of overseas Chinese in Moscow,
which is to be passed to the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HK SAR) on the day of the return of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the beginning of the celebration, the charge'
d'affairs ad interim of the Chinese embassy Guan Hengguang noted
that since ancient time Hong Kong was a part of Chinese territory.
Hong Kong's problem was completely caused by Britain which forced
China to accept three unequal treaties.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to our great leader Deng Xiaoping, who put forward the
great concept of `one country, two systems' and through long and
tough negotiations with the English side, Hong Kong at last
returns to its motherland", Guan said.
</P>
<P>
This event, he continued, means that China washes off its shame
of more than one hundred years and a victory of the great concept
of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Moscow union of the overseas Chinese Zou
Hougong also expressed his excitement on behalf of the overseas
Chinese. He said "one day later, Hong Kong will return to the
embrace of its motherland, and we have the same happy mood with
1,300 million Chinese people." "Let us cheer ! Let us enjoy !" he
acclaimed with excited voice.
</P>
<P>
During the celebration Chinese actors and some Russian
actresses offered brilliant programs for the evening party,
including recitation of poems, singing, dancing, Beijing and local
operas, modern drama and so on.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the performance all the participants loudly sang
the famous song "Sing For Our Motherland". The hall was full of
lively and warm atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The performances were followed by fireworks display and a film--
"The Opium War". Then, the great celebration was concluded with
dance.
