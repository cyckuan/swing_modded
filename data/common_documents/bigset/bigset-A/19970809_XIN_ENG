<HEADLINE> German Neo-Nazi Stands Trial for Murdering Policeman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A self-confessed German neo-Nazi
said today that he had shot a policeman to defend himself against
the German state which had declared war on him.
</P>
<P>
Kay Diesner, who claims to be a member of the U.S.-based
right-wing extremist group White Aryan Resistance Movement, is
charged with murdering one policeman and injuring another at a
parking lot along the Berlin-Hamburg highway on February 23.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred after the policemen went to question
Diesner about his car after noticing that the the license plate
was that of a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old neo-Nazi, who has spoken openly of his hatred
for all non-Germans, said the policeman fired at him first and he
had a right of defense against the state which had declared war on
him.
</P>
<P>
He told a Luebeck court that he had shot the policeman but did
not intend to kill him.
</P>
<P>
Diesner is also charged with wounding a bookkeeper of the
German Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) at its office in Berlin
on February 19.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM: Agreement on Integration Undermines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides said here today that an agreement on partial
integration signed Wednesday by Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot
regime has undermined upcoming negotiations for a settlement to
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides made the remark after his first meeting with new
Greek Ambassador to Cyprus Kyriacos Rodousakis, during which
they discussed the latest development on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot foreign minister expressed concern that Turkey
decided to create a new fait accompli only a few days before the
start of negotiations on a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates Turkey's intention to undermine efforts for a
solution to the Cyprus question and shows a lack of political
will," the foreign minister said, noting that the Cypriot
government has informed the five U.N. Security Council permanent
members of its views and will also make them known to the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed in Turkish-controlled northern part of
Nicosia during a visit Wednesday by Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem calls for the "gradual economic and financial
integration and partial integration on security, defense and
foreign policy matters."
</P>
<P>
It came as a reaction to a recent EU reconfirmation that
accession talks with Cyprus will begin next year.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides pointed out that Denktash knew of the EU decision
long ago and said it should be made clear to the Turkish side
that Cypriot EU course will not be postponed or affected.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Greek Cypriot side will participate in
the second round of direct talks to be held in Switzerland on
August 11-16 in "all goodwill".
</P>
<P>
He also reassured that the Greek Cypriot side remains
dedicated to efforts for a solution to the Cyprus problem and
urged the international community and the EU not to be affected
by "this Turkish blackmail."
</P>
<P>
Greek Ambassador Rodousakis described the agreement between
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot regime as "worrying, because it
undermines the effort taken up by the international community,
the U.N. Secretary-General, the EU and other countries which
will be in Switzerland for the talks."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Cyprus and Greece will try to overcome this
issue and will be "constructive during the negotiations
procedure."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after Turkey sent troops in and took
over the northern third in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Greece.

BRUSSELS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- English-speaking business
executives in the European Union are being offered free trips to
Japan in a bid to boost European exports.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's Export to Japan Study Program is offering
two free trips to the Asian country to European business managers
keen to sell goods to Japan but who lack direct experience in the
Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
The sponsor of the program, the Japan External Trade
Organization, will choose the business executives from such
industries as environmental protection equipment and computer
software.
</P>
<P>
The managers, supported by the European Commission, will visit
places suggested by the Japanese organization and immerse
themselves in the Japanese business culture through meetings,
presentations and on-the-spot inspections.
</P>
<P>
The two trips, each lasting nine days, will be conducted in

<HEADLINE> India's Opposition Party Vice President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Delhi Chief Minister
Madan Lal Khurana today resigned from vice presidentship of the
opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the party high
command failed to reinstate him as Delhi chief minister, Press
Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
Khurana resigned from the post of Delhi chief minister on moral
ground early last year when the Central Bureau of Investigation
accused him of being involved in the hawala case, a corruption
scandal in which many politicians allegedly took bribes from
illegal foreign exchange dealers (hawala dealers).
</P>
<P>
Sahib Singh Verma, widely believed to be rival of Khurana, took
over the chief ministership following Khurana's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Though Khurana wanted to regain his chief ministership after
his recent acquittal by a court in the hawala case, the BJP high
command decided yesterday to retain Verma as Delhi chief minister.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his resignation today, Khurana said he was
humiliated by the decision of the party high command.

<HEADLINE> Stockholm Olympic Stadium Rocked by Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A powerful bomb explosion early
Friday destroyed sections of Stockholm's Olympic stadium which
hosted the 1912 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of attacks in the city.
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the explosion in the early hours of the
morning, police said.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the inner Stockholm neighbourhood where the
stadium is located were woken up by an explosion at about 1.00 am
local time (2300 GMT), said police inspector Harreet Leeftam.
</P>
<P>
Police on a routine patrol in the area arrived at the stadium
almost immediately and searched the area with dogs, but no
suspects were found, she said.
</P>
<P>
The explosion left a gaping hole in the roof above the main
entrance on the eastern side of the arena.
</P>
<P>
Most heavily damaged were the stadium public address booth and
press boxes, police spokesman Claes Cassel said.
</P>
<P>
The police had no leads, he said.
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, maintenance men have closed off the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Glass littered the stadium's all-weather track. Tiles blown
off the roof were strewn across the pavement inside the stadium
gate.
</P>
<P>
Swedish media have linked the attacks to opponents of
Stockholm's bid for the 2004 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
Olof Stenhammar, chairman of the Stockholm bidding committee,
said no proof had been found linking the explosion to Stockholm's
candidacy of the Games.
</P>
<P>
If the bombing was the work of Olympics opponents, it would
carry a heavy symbolic weight when the International Olympic
Committee picks a site next month.
</P>
<P>
However, the International Olympic Committee president Juan
Antonio Samaranch said during his visit to Finland, the attack
would not "have any impact" on the choice of the city where the
2004 Olympics will be held.
</P>
<P>
Stockholm is competing with Athens, Buenos Aires, Cape Town and
Rome to stage the 2004 Olympics. The decision will be made on
September 5.

<HEADLINE> Vancouver Real Estate Loses Luster, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Real-estate in Canada's west
coast city of Vancouver is losing its luster as more Chinese
immigrants head back to Hong Kong, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Once North America's hottest real-estate market, Vancouver is
now watching prices plunge as eager sellers put up For Sale signs
in up-scale neighborhoods stamped "price reduced".
</P>
<P>
The average house price in the city's affluent west side has
dropped 27 percent from a year ago, according to Canada's leading
newspaper the Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
Since the July 1 return of Hong Kong to China, some of the
city's richest Chinese immigrants are heading back across the
Pacific and taking much of their money with them, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong immigrants have watched real-estate values in Hong
Kong, along with the Hang Seng stock index, soar to new highs. In
the meantime, interest in Canada as a heaven appears to have
faded.
</P>
<P>
At this point in 1996, there had been about 8,600 immigrants
visa applications from Hong Kong. So far this year, there have
been only 2,700, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
International immigration has long buoyed the real-estate
market and economy in Vancouver and the British Columbia (B.C.)
province as a whole.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the province will see a steady downward
slide in international immigration.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government estimate that 42,000 new immigrants,
mostly from Asia, will come to B.C. in 1997. The figure will slide
down to about 35,000 in 1998 and 32,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, the number of Canadians migrating
westward to B.C. will also dry up considerably to some 10,000
people in 1997, which is about 50 percent below what had been
expected.

Defending champion Ottey, 37, who finished a disappointed seventh
in the 100 meters final five days ago, bolted out of the blocks with a
perfect start and surged to a clear lead off the curve, but
Pintussevich, the silver medal winner of the 100 meters final here,
caught up her with 50 meters to go.
</P>
<P>
Javasinghe, little-known in the world, nipped Ottey in the photo
finish, beating her own Asian record of 22.44 set yesterday.

<HEADLINE> UK's Building Market Is in Good Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The UK's construction orders in
the second quarter of this year were the highest for 18 months,
according to the latest figures released by Environment
Department.
</P>
<P>
The department said orders were 5 percent higher in real terms
than in the first quarter of this year and 8 percent higher than
in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
New orders in the private housing sector were 9 percent higher
than in the same period last year although 4 percent lower than in
the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
Nick Raynsford, construction minister, said the figures
reflected the continuing improvement in demand for a wide range of
building and civil engineering works.
</P>
<P>
The increase indicated that the gradual recovery in output
expected by industry forecasters was set to continue, he added.
</P>
<P>
The National Council of Building Material Producers predicted
that industry output would rise 3 percent this year, 4 percent in
1998 and 2.5 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
This rate of increase was well ahead of forecast growth for the
UK economy as a whole, said the council.
</P>
<P>
However, builders have blamed slow progress in getting planning
permissions for a pause in the number of new homes started this
year.
</P>
<P>
It is generally expected that an improving UK economy, the
release of local authority capital receipts and millennium
projects will provide a continuing impetus to the UK' construction
output over the next three years.

infrastructure and cooperation in the political, cultural and
security spheres.

<HEADLINE> UK Pension Among The Lowest in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The pension of the average British
employee is one of the lowest in the European Union relative to
earnings, it is reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Those on national average earnings retire on an average net
pension of less than 80 percent of net earnings, the second lowest
ratio in Europe, according to a report by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes,
a leading employee benefits consultancy.
</P>
<P>
Only Finns earning average wages retire on a lower percentage,
said Sedgwick.
</P>
<P>
The findings reinforce the "potential importance" of the
government's plans to introduce stakeholder pension schemes, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The government recently said it would review pensions provision
over the next 12 months. Stakeholder pensions will be aimed at
people who cannot join an employer's occupational pension scheme
and cannot afford the high level of charges involved in personal
pensions.
</P>
<P>
Sedgwick's report concludes that the UK's current pension
system hits individuals unable to "take advantage of private,
occupational pension plans".
</P>
<P>
The average British employee - a married individual earning
the annual national average of 18,200 - retires on a net pension
of 77 percent of net earnings.
</P>
<P>
According to Sedgwick, average earners in Greece do best of
all, retiring on 103 percent of earnings and "making them better
off in retirement than in work".

<P>
BANGKOK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has
instructed the state-owned media to seek official clearance before
broadcasting news, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pokin Polakul, a minister of the prime minister's office,
passed on the instruction from Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh to directors and supervisors of state-owned or
military-run television channels and radio stations at a meeting

The directors and supervisors have pledged to follow the
instruction, but said that the government should clear doubts over
some controversial news reports, the newspaper said.

The instruction was aimed at easing public confusion triggered
by a recent avalanche of "distorted and groundless" reports, said
Pokin, who cited recent rumors on coup for example.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister would like the media to provide precise and
unbiased information for the public because some recent reports
have no grounds and cause confusion and frustration among the
public, Pokin said.
</P>
<P>
Pokin also admitted that the government sometimes failed to
clarify doubts and clear confusion, but he promised that the
government would improve its work on this matter.

<HEADLINE> Boldon Wins Men's 200m Gold in World Athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago won
the men's 200 meters gold medal at the 6th World Athletics
Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
His winning time was 20.04 seconds, ahead of Frank Fredericks of
Namibia's 20.23 and Claudinei Da Silva of Brazil's 20.26.
</P>
<P>
Boldon, world bronze medal winner in 1995 and the year's best time
19.77 setter, exposed away from the blocks first and gained a clear
lead off the turn. The 23-year-old, who failed to win a medal in the
100 meters after clocking a fast time 9.87 in the heat, won the 200m
gold with ease.
</P>
<P>
"I am really disappointed with the time, but what it is all about
is the placing. What I didn't come through over the 100 meters was
because of my body. Now my head has helped me to overcome my body, "
said a beamed Boldon.
</P>
<P>
The winner also added:"I am obviously sorry for Fredericks as he is
more than a rival, to me a mentor, an example to humanity and a world
class sprinter. So let's start chasing an Olympic gold."
</P>
<P>
Fredericks, who won two silvers at the previous meet, and finished
second both in the sprint events at last year's Olympics, said:"It
seems that I am stuck in second place! However, I am just tired, so
the silver will be Okay!"

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Urges Israel to Observe Cease-fire Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri today accused Israel of breaking the cease-fire agreement
and escalating tensions in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with his visiting Egyptian
counterpart Kamal Ganzouri, Hariri said, "the crisis will
continue as long as Israel doesn't comply with the United
Nation's resolutions and doesn't stop occupying south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Israel and Lebanese resistance guerrillas have
been mounting in south Lebanon this week, causing heavy civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
He also refused the formula of "Security for Peace", saying
that means Israeli continued occupation. He called on Israel to
withdraw from the occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri said the war is not in the interest of Israel, nor of
the Arab, but he said Egypt stands by the Arab countries whose
lands are occupied.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the collective punishment imposed on
Palestinians by Israeli government after the twin suicide bombings
in Jerusalem should not become an obstacle for the continuity of
mediation efforts and resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Before the news conference, the two prime ministers signed 12
agreements in trade, tourism, education, justice, culture and
journalism.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri left here this afternoon winding up a two-day
official visit to this country, the first by an Egyptian prime
minister since decades.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Zhanna Pintussevich of Ukraine won the
women's 200 meters gold medal here today at the 6th World Athletics
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Her winning time was 22.32 seconds, ahead of Susanthika Javasinghe
of Sri Lanka's 22.39 and Merlene Ottey of Jamaice's 22.40.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Ottey, 37, who finished a disappointed seventh
in the 100 meters final five days ago, bolted out of the blocks with a
perfect start and surged to a clear lead off the curve, but
Pintussevich, the silver medal winner of the 100 meters final here,
caught up her with 30 meters to go.
</P>
<P>
Javasinghe, little-known in the world before the race, nipped Ottey
at the photo finish, beating her own Asian record of 22.44 set
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
"I am so tired after so many rounds, but I am fresh in my head.
This makes up for the disappointment in the 100m. I don't know what
happened to Merlene as she sould have won this one but I felt I had a
good shot at the gold too," said Pintussevich after her big win.
</P>
<P>
Ottey, who has been among the top world class sprinters over 18
years but often suffers bad lucks at major competitions, looked just
upset, saying:"I had many problems this year. I was sick for a long
period, so there was no way to prepare the 200 meters. See what
happened in the last 30 meters!"

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today called on ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) to
maintain and promote unity, dynamism and self-reliance so as to
play a pivotal and constructive role in regional and international
fora.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech when launching the 30th ASEAN anniversary
celebrations at a grand reception here this evening, the president
said during the 30 years of its existence, ASEAN has always
subscribed faithfully to the principles enunciated in the Bangkok
Declaration signed in 1967 and has been trying seriously to
realize its aspirations through various activities.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said that ASEAN has made heartening progress in the
economic area. He said he was confident that the ASEAN free trade
area will be materialized by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that each ASEAN member state continue to reinforce
its national resilience which, in turn, will strengthen regional
resilience.
</P>
<P>
He said that each ASEAN member state should also continue to
play its role in the endeavors to integrate the economies of ASEAN
members.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN was established in August, 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand,
with the signing of the Bangkok Declaration by the five original
member countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Brunei joined the ASEAN in 1984. Vietnam became the seventh
member of ASEAN in 1995.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN admitted Laos and Myanmar as full members on July 23 this
year, bringing its members to nine.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was previously scheduled to join the grouping but due
to its recent political crisis its entry was deferred.

<HEADLINE> Nairobi Calm on Strike Day Despite Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan capital of Nairobi
remained calm today when a one-day nationwide strike and protest
marches were launched by the opposition with no police
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Kenyan opposition supporters marched on the
streets in downtown Nairobi this afternoon, demanding sweeping
political reforms before the forthcoming general elections and
the step-down of President Daniel arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
Some demonstrators smashed shop windows and beat several
youths who were accused of being ruling party members or
plainclothes policemen, a witness said.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came at the end of a rally where a man was
said to have been beaten to death on suspicion of being a
policeman.
</P>
<P>
Most shops in downtown were closed for fear of violence, but
buses were still running and many workers went to work as usual,
defying the opposition strike call which has been announced
illegal by the government, a witness told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The strike failed in most parts of the eastern African
country, including the leading towns of Mombasa, Kisumu and
Nakuru, as the majority of Kenyans ignored the strike and were on
duty normally, according to a Kenyan News Agency report.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. Environment Program and some other U.N.
agencies based here gave their staff a one-day leave today in
advance, citing personal security.
</P>
<P>
Today's strike has split Kenya's opposition ranks, as two key
opposition leaders said " no " to the strike which was called by
opposition's umbrella body National Convention Executive
Committee (NCEC).
</P>
<P>
Opposition FORD-Asili Chairman Kenneth Matiba said Wednesday
that he was opposed to the mass action's timing, a day after
FORD-Kenya leader Kijana Wamalwa announced the same stance.
</P>
<P>
The strike should be suspended because President Daniel arap
Moi has instituted dialogue with interested parties, Wamalwa
stressed in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But 30 opposition lawmakers, led by Democratic Party chief
Mwai Kibaki, urged "all workers, matatu (bus) operators, and
business people to cooperate to make the Nane Nane (August 8)
strike a resounding success."
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Labor Minister Philip Masinde had warned that the
government would not protect workers who might lose their jobs as
a result of participating in the strike.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Vows to Eradicate Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today vowed to eradicate corruption in the country and pledged to
have all those involved fully investigated.
</P>
<P>
The president called on all Kenyans to join in the fight
against corruption, saying there is a need for Kenyans to change
their attitude on such a social vice which "is ingrained in the
hearts of some people".
</P>
<P>
The government will not spare anyone committing graft,
including those with high status, he was quoted by a Kenyan News
Agency report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund announced last Thursday it
held back a three-year 215-million-U.S.-Dollar aid package to
Kenya, citing the alleged failure of the Kenyan government in
showing " its commitment to fighting corruption."

ATHENS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Nezha Bidouane of Morocco overtook the
world big names in the run-in to win the women's 400-meter hurdles
gold medal here today at the 6th World Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
Her winning time was 52.97 seconds, ahead Jamaica's Deon Hemmings'

Morocco at the current meet.
</P>
<P>
Batten, world record holder, and Hemmings, Olympic champion last
year, fought hard for the top position when they were running into the
home straight, but Bidouane, third best in the world this year before
the final and three meters behind the leading pair 40 meters from
home, caught up the early leaders to everyone's surprise during the
run-in. Her winning time is well inside her previous personal best of
53.48.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect the victory until the last 30 meters. The win of
El Guerrouji pushed me a lot. I give this feat to Moroccan athletics
and our King," said Bidouane happily.

Hemmings said:"I have done all I could. It has been Bidouane's day.
Sometime you win, sometime you lose. We are all human and it is just
one race."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today said he supports restructuring of the Russian space industry,
when visiting the Moscow-based Khrunichev State Space Research and
Production Center, a leading enterprise of the Russian space
industry.
</P>
<P>
Interfax news agency quoted the president's adviser Yevgeny
Shaposhnikov as saying, Yeltsin supports abolishing duplicate
structures and production enterprises so that only necessary
enterprises and organizations will remain in the Russian space
industry.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also favors centralizing management of the country's
space industry so that the Russian Space Agency will become the
single state customer, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin expressed satisfaction with programs for
modification of the Proton and Rokot booster rockets designed for
commercial use. He said he wanted the Khrunichev space center to
step up its commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
According to Shaposhnikov, Yeltsin has signed a decree to
provide Russian government guarantees for a 100 million US dollars
loan from commercial banks for implementation by Russia of its
obligations under the Alpha international space station project.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Khrunichev space center leaders and experts
explained to Yeltsin the cause of recent problems aboard the Mir
space station and the repair plan.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that to speak out the reasons and the full
analysis of the damages at the orbital station Mir will be possible
only after cosmonauts Vasily Tsybliyev and Alexander Lazutkin
return to the Earth on August 14.

<P>
ATHENS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The joint world record holder and
defending champion Wilson Kipketer ran from the gun to the tape to
retain his 800 meters title here today at the 6th World Athletics
Championships.
</P>
<P>
His winning time was one minute 43.38 seconds, well outside of the
listed world record of 1:41.73. Tellez Norberto of Cuba and Kenah Rich
of the United States finished second and third in 1:44.00 and 1:44.25
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the race that included the seven fastest men in the world this
year, Kipketer, who equalled the 16-year-old world record last month,
burst straight into the lead from the gun and took the control of the
race after 150 meters.
</P>
<P>
His leading position was never challenged, so the Kenyan-born Dane
just relaxed and gave up his bid to shatter the world record in the
long-awaited final.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't my pre-race plan to run from the gun to the finish in
the lead. I decided to do it that way just before the final because I
felt it was right," said Kipketer at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
He also reveal that he wouldn't attempt the 1,500 meters and he
thought the world record would be erased this year.

I tied my shoe laces very hard for the first round but they snapped. I

<HEADLINE> Israel to Act within Ceasefire Pact with Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today said Israel desires to maintain the
U.S.-brokered ceasefire understanding with Lebanon concluded in
April, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel Television reported that Mordechai made
the remark at a press conference in Kiryat Shmona, a northern
border town hit early this morning by a barrage of Katyusha
rockets from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire understanding bars either fighting party, Israeli
troops or Muslim militants, from attacking civilian targets on the
last active battlefront of Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Four people were lightly hurt and a Jewish synagogue seriously
damaged in the Katyusha attack, which was reportedly launched by
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God. But Hezbollah denied
its involvement.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, accompanied by Chief of the General Staff
Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak and head of the army Northern Command
Maj.-Gen. Amiram Levine, visited the area to see first hand the
damage caused by Katyusha attack.
</P>
<P>
It is important to maintain the ceasefire understanding, and
act within it, Mordechai said. He charged that Lebanese government
should be held responsible for the attack and that Hezbollah
denial of involvement is not convincing.
</P>
<P>
When asked why the Israel Defense Forces had not reacted to the
Katyusha attack, Mordechai said that Israel will react "in an
appropriate manner, time and place."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a report from the Lebanese capital
Beirut, Secretary General of Hezbollah Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah
threatened to continue Katyusha attacks on northern Israel, but
said that his organization had nothing to do with today's assault.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah told a press conference that the ceasefire
understanding, inked after Israel's Grapes of Wrath operation last
year, had failed to protect Lebanese civilians. He was apparently
referring to the incident Thursday, in which a Lebanese couple and
their two children were killed by a roadside bomb planted by
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The situation in northern Israel was quiet during the day today
and those who slept in security rooms and bomb shelters Thursday
night have returned to their homes.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Hires Ukraine Ships Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's military junta has
hired Ukrainian shipping companies to import fuel and food in
defiance of an embargo, risking military confrontation with the
west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
"The emergence of Ukraine into an otherwise tense political
tango could develop into some armed confrontation between ECOMOG
and Ukraine," one diplomat in the capital Freetown was quoted
today by a report reaching here as saying.
</P>
<P>
After the collapse of peace talks last week, the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has called for "a
full-scale" embargo and economic sanctions against the junta
which seized power in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG also has warned all ships and aircraft to keep off
Sierra Leone's territorial waters and airspace.
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG reserves the right to mete out appropriate reprisals
if this warning is violated," the force said in a statement on
Wednesday in Monrovia, capital of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Before the warning, Ukrainian vessels brought in shipments of
rice and fuel to Freetown, reported the daily "Expo Times", the
mouthpiece of the junta.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, a captain of one of the Ukrainian
vessels has vowed against any military action.
</P>
<P>
"In the event that we are attacked while delivering food and
other essential supplies to Sierra Leone, we will prove to
Nigerians what military might we also have," the unnamed captain
was quoted as warning.
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine has one of the largest naval fleets in the world and
Nigerians know the might of Ukraine where the most deadly
military weapons are made," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Resume Oil Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq could resume its
limited oil sales as none of the 15 members of the Security
Council's sanction committee voiced objections to Iraq's new
pricing formula, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Fred Eckhard
said today.
</P>
<P>
"No objections have been raised by any member of the sanction
committee, so the formula was approved," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had delayed submitting the pricing formula until U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Monday approved iraq's program
to distribute the humanitarian goods bought with the oil revenue.
</P>
<P>
The "oil-for-food" plan, which allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months, went into effect last
December and was renewed for another six months on June 8.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls on Assisting Children in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Carol Bellamy, executive
director of United Nations Children's Fund, today urged the
international community to help relieve the 800,000 children at
risk in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Among the 800,000 infants and young children at risk, many need
special feeding and urgently required medicines to halt their
downward spiral of sickness and malnutrition, she told reporters
after an official visit to the drought-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
"The safety net for children is breaking down," she said. "The
pantries are bare, hospital medicine cabinets are empty -- and the
results could be catastrophic if these shortages are not eased by
Winter."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that the number of children suffering from the
effects of food shortages has risen dramatically in recent months,
with some 800,000 children severely malnourished and in imminent
peril of succumbing to starvation or disease.
</P>
<P>
UN agency experts pointed out that DPRK is producing only half
the food that it needs for subsistence.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has tripled its international appeals for aid to 14.3
million dollars, but so far has received only 3.5 million
dollars, she noted.
</P>
<P>
"If the North Korean people -- and particularly the children --
are to get through the difficult weeks and months ahead," Bellamy
said, "it is critical that they are given the tools to help
themselves survive -- and thrive."

<HEADLINE> European Shares down on Weak Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all
stopped their recent climbing and fell sharply Friday, depressed
by Wall Street's retreat and the dollar's weakness.
</P>
<P>
Leading British share index the FTSE 100 closed down 55.5
points at 5,031.3, but still up 132 points on last week. Dealers
said market sentiment was dominated by profit-taking after this
week's record-setting rally.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares also suffered heavy losses today,
with the DAX-30 index closing at 4,354.15, 60.20 points lower on
the day and 54.64 points down from last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market had a lacklustre session as
overnight weakness on Wall Street and a touch of pre-weekend
catharsis hit sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse likewise was sent lower by profit-taking and
the slide in the dollar which was bad news for exporters. The
CAC-40 index finished down 60.07 points at 2,996.27, falling 53.17
points on the week.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Striking electricity workers in
Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone, declared today they would only
return to work once their security was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as 10 of their colleagues had been
hospitalized after soldiers beat them up, according to a report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
One of the strikers was quoted as saying that they were
"beaten up by a group of soldiers who went to the generating
plant to inquire the reason for persistent blackouts".
</P>
<P>
The capital has been without electricity for nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to explain that there was no lubricant to mix with
the generating oil but they would not listen. They beat us up.
About 10 of our workers are still in hospital," the striker said.
</P>
<P>
According to the state radio, Col. Abdul Sesay, an army
representative visited the complex afterwards and said, "all
those responsible for this irresponsible act will be severely
dealt with as their action is not a directive from the
government."
</P>
<P>
Energy and Power Minister Hassan Barrie was quoted as
confirming that "The persistent blackouts are due to the
unavailability of lubricating oil which is used simultaneously
with the heavy fuel oil by the power plants."

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned About Turkey-Northern Cyprus Partial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Ambassadors of the European Union
(EU) member countries in Ankara today called on Turkey to clarify
its position on the Turkey-Northern Cyprus partial integration
process.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted diplomatic
sources here as saying that the ambassadors asked Turkish Foreign
Ministry for information about the partial integration agreement
between Turkey and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The EU ambassadors did not show their clear opposition towards
the accord, but called for the full text of the document,
diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and northern Cyprus signed on Wednesday an agreement to
establish a Partnership Council in a bid to push forward partial
integration on security, defense and foreign policy and full
integration on economy and finance.
</P>
<P>
The latest development caused grave concern from the EU and
Cyprus. The Cypriot government spokesman said that this
Turkish-Northern Cyprus agreement will harm the ongoing Cyprus
peace talks, describing it as a provocative action.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Turkey signed the integration
agreement with northern Cyprus was a tough gesture for both the
EU and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission announced last month that Cyprus was
included in the ranks of the prospective EU membership candidates,
triggered strong reaction from Turkey and northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Ankara, which has been kept outside the EU membership
candidates despite years of application, accused the European body
of adopting double standards on this question.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
in and took over the northern third of the eastern Mediterranean
island following an pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots, with the support of Turkey, declared
unilaterally a breakaway state "the Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" in 1983, which has only been recognized by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafoks Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktas met last month near New York under the
U.N. mediation. The two leaders is scheduled to start their second
round of peace talks in the Swiss town of Montreux next
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Taylor Gives Top Jobs to Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's newly-inaugurated
President Charles Taylor has given top jobs to two members of the
Independent Elections Commission overseeing the July 19 election
in which he won.
</P>
<P>
The state radio in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, reported
today that Taylor named former justice minister Gloria Scott as
Chief Justice and Evelyne Kandakai as Education Minister.
</P>
<P>
He also named Elias Saleeby, former president of the Liberian
Bank for Development and Investment, as Finance Minister.
</P>
<P>
According to reports earlier, Taylor named 15 persons as
members of the cabinet last week, including three of his former
rivals in the bitter civil war.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Tome Woeyiyou for labor, Roosevelt Johnson
for transport and Francois Massaquoi for youth and sports, is
seen by most Liberians as a sign of Taylor's promise to forge
unity and encourage reconciliation in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, whose rebel fight against late President Samuel Doe
triggered off the bloody civil war seven years ago, was sworn in
as the 21st president of the country a week ago.
</P>
<P>
He has promised to follow the order of law and respect human
rights, while assuring Liberians that there will be equal
opportunities for all and no witch hunting.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 49, also called on his former opponents to join him in
the rebuilding of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that the new government is facing the daunting
task of reconstruction of the country which Taylor helped destroy
in the past seven years.

<HEADLINE> Investigators:Too Early to Blame Any One on Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board (NTSB) officials investigating the Korean Air jet
crash on Guam said that it was too early to blame any one on the
crash as they are collecting evidences.
</P>
<P>
 NTSB member George Black said that some sort of error
caused the crash, but "it's too early to talk about what or who
that was."
</P>
<P>
He said that a preliminary examination of evidence at eh crash
site and the plane's data and voice recordings showed no panicked
messages to the control tower in their final seconds and no sign
of mechanical failures that could have downed the jet.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. TV network NBC's "Nightly News" on Thursday quoted
unidentified sources as saying the initial analysis of the
recorders showed the crash of Korean Air Lines (KAL) Boeing 747
carrying 254 people was caused by pilot error.
</P>
<P>
It said the pilots apparently homed in on a radio signal on a
hilltop three miles (five km) from the airport, mistakenly
believing they were homing in on the runway.
</P>
<P>
However, KAL defended itself against a U.S. news report blaming
the deadly crash on pilot error, saying such conclusions were too
hasty.
</P>
<P>
"We are not yet ruling out the possibility of a sudden change
in altitude caused by torrential rains, the breakdown of the glide
slope or other elements, which combined, could have caused the
accident," KAL said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they would have to get more evidence and
receive a full transcript of the "black boxes" to get a better
idea of what mistakes were made.
</P>
<P>
Black said even if the pilot had confused the beacons, it would
not have led to the crash.
</P>
<P>
Today, Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall also played down the
speculation about pilot error, saying it's too early to tell.
"There are still a number of things that have to be looked at in
this accident. The weather conditions, the navigational aids and
their operation have to be checked. I want to look very closely at
the tower operations," he said on NBC's "Today."
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747 was carrying 254 people when it crashed into the
dense jungle of the U.S.-governed Pacific island. More than 200
people died.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC-IFP Peace Talks Break Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) today slammed a decision by the
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) to pull out of peace talks in
Kwazulu-Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
The IFP's decision had little to do with the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and more with internal problems
in the party with regard to peace, the ANC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
ANC spokesman Dumisani Makhaye said the IFP was falsely
claiming that the TRC was biased.
</P>
<P>
Makhaye said no single organization could stop the tide of
peace. However, the IFP withdrawal might make the achievement of
lasting peace more difficult.
</P>
<P>
IFP National Chairman Ben Ngubane confirmed today that his
party, the biggest black opposition party in South Africa, had
withdrawn from peace talks with ANC following the "spectacle" of
the TRC hearing in Durban in which witnesses implicated top
ranking IFP officials in hit-squad activities.
</P>
<P>
The TRC hearing in Durban reportedly had heard evidence from
IFP members trained by the South African Defense Force in the
1980s to allegedly "eliminate" ANC leaders and activists.
</P>
<P>
Ngubane said the IFP would call on President Nelson Mandela to
appoint a judicial commission of inquiry into the partiality of
TRC members "whose bias was threatening peace and the stability
of the country".
</P>
<P>
The TRC, a fact-finding group authorized by the Government of
National Unity to investigate violent activities during apartheid
era, said today it was shocked at IFP claims that the commission
was responsible for the collapse of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Richard Lyster said the commission was committed
to establishing the truth, but the IFP had refused to
participate. He said the IFP's withdrawal from peace talks was a
decision that had nothing to do with the TRC.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Blames Israel for Tension in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today blamed Israel's failure to observe the U.N. Security
Council resolution for the deteriorating situation in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The tense situation in south Lebanon is a result of Israel's
non implementation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425
which calls for Israel's full and unconditional pullout, Moussa
said, quoted by the Egyptian official MENA new agency.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Israeli attacks in the past few days on
suspected positions of Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah in
south Lebanon with more than 75 shells, killing at least one
civilian and wounding five others.
</P>
<P>
"What is going on in south Lebanon and the Israeli offensives
against the area are another negative development for the peace
process," the Egyptian top diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Full peace requires full Israeli pullout from south Lebanon,
the Syrian Golan Heights and the occupied Palestinian territories,
Moussa said. He stressed the importance of reviving the peace
talks on all tracks under the accords that have already been
agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
For all parties to enjoy security of their borders, peace
should be based on the land-for-peace principle which took shape
in the Madrid Mideast peace conference, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombardment was in retaliation against an ambush
that killed one pro-Israel south Lebanese militiaman in the
Israeli self-declared "security zone."
</P>
<P>
In response to the Israeli bombardment, the Lebanese resistance
forces launched today a Katyusha attack against northern Israel,
injuring four Israelis and damaging a Jewish temple.
</P>
<P>
Israel has pinpointed Hezbollah as behind the rocket attack
early this morning, a charge quickly denied by the militant
group.

BEIRUT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli jet fighters rocketed a
base of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
General Command at Jabal Naameh, 20 kilometers south of Beirut
tonight, but caused no casualties.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman confirmed the air raid, and stressed

Local military observers linked the air raid, the 48th launched

One Israeli women was reportedly wounded when three Katyusha

<P>
The United States still lead the medal table with five golds, two
silvers and seven bronzes, followed by Germany, 3-1-2, and Cuba,
3-1-1.
</P>
<P>
Two world best marks this year were set by Yoelvis Quesada of Cuba
in the men's triple jump and an American 4x100m relay team anchored by
Gail Devers of the United States, the 100m winner in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Quesada, Olympic bronze medallist last year, landed Cuba's third
gold, all in the men's field events, with a brilliant leap of 17.85
meters in the second round, beating Edwards to the second place, 16
centimeters behind. Aliecer Urrutia of Cuba wound up third at 17.64.
</P>
<P>
"I beat Jonathan before but that was a very special win over him.
In a certain moment I might be able to attack the 18-meter mark,"
promised the Cuban winner.
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who set a sensational world record of 18.29 at the
previous meet but had been plagued by an injury before the
championships, felt just upset.
</P>
<P>
"I fought hard but it just wasn't there. I was really playing catch
up but I just wasn't jumping properly," said Edwards.
</P>
<P>
Ottey was struck again by a bad luck when the 37-year-old led a
sizable lead in the first 170 meters but lost her power in the end to
settle a bronze finish in 22.39.
</P>
<P>
The title was snatched by Zhanna Pintussevich of Ukraine, a dark
horse at the meet, with a time of 22.32 seconds. Susanthika Javasinghe
of Sri Lanka nipped Ottey at the line to win her country's first ever
medal at the championships history. The victory also marks the first
 medal win ever for Asia in the Olympics and world championships
histories.
</P>
<P>
"I am so tired after so many rounds but I am fresh in my mind,"
said Pintussevich, who won the 100m silver five days ago.
</P>
<P>
Ottey said disappointedly:"I had many problems this year. I was
sick for a long period, so there was no way to prepare the 200 meters.
See what happened in the last 30 meters!"
</P>
<P>
Nezha Bidouane brought Morocco's second gold when the little-known
girl upset Olympic champion Deon Hemmings of Jamaica and defending
champion Batten in the women's 400m hurdles final with a 52.97
clocking, the joint best this year in the world. Hemmings and Batten
were timed 53.09 and 53.52.
</P>
<P>
Bidouane, the third best runner this year in the world before the
race, was a distance third off the final bend, while Hemmings and
Batten fought desperately for the lead three meters in front. But the
Moroccan somehow found some extral reserves to overtake the leaders
during the run-in.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect the victory until the last 30 meters. I am so
excited that I beat the big name and improved my personal best so
much!" exclaimed the winner.
</P>
<P>
Hemmings said:"I have done all I could. It has been Bidouane's day.
Sometime you win, sometime you lose. We are all human and it is just
one race."
</P>
<P>
Batten said in a low mood:"Bidouane did a big win. I'm kind of
shocked. Never got into my rhythym. I'm really disappointed."
</P>
<P>
The man who wasn't disappointed today is Ato Boldon of Trinidad and
Tobago, who was denied a medal in the 100 meters final five days ago
though he chalked up a record fast heat time of 9.87 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The world double sprint bronze medal winner blazed down the track
to win the men's 200m title in 20.04 seconds, ahead of Frank
Fredericks of Namibia, 20.23, and Claudinei Da Silva of Brazil, 20.26.
</P>
<P>
"I am really disappointed with the time, but what it is all about
is the placing. What I didn't come through over the 100 meters was
because of my body. Now my head has helped me to overcome my body, "
said a beamed Boldon.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks, who won two sprint silvers both at the previous meet
and the Olympics last year, romped home second again this time. The
unlucky man complained:"It seems that I am stuck in the second place!
However, I am just tired, so the silver will be okay."
</P>
<P>
The Kenya-born Dane Wilson Kipketer didn't give the packed crowd
something to cheer about. What the defending champion did in the men's
800 meters final was just a simple win.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old world record was never challenged and Kipketer's
winning time of 1:43.38 was well outside the 1:41.73 global record,
which he equalled last month.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't my pre-race plan to run from the gun to the tape as a
leader. I decided to do it that way just before the final because I
felt it was right," the winner said after his win.
</P>
<P>
The day also saw Devers anchor an American squad to register the
fastest time in the world this year in 41.52 in the women's 4x100m
relay semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Six finals are slated for tomorrow.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Two fighting sides have agreed to
stop the conflict after a fierce shoot-out in Dushanbe, the Tajik
capital, earlier on Saturday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire negotiations were arranged by the government and
mediated by members of a Commonwealth of Independent States
peacekeeping force stationed in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Kasymov and Salimov had signed a
cease-fire protocol that took effect at 2:30 p.m. The clash broke
out in Dushanbe's northern neighbourhood and stopped by midday.
</P>
<P>
It occurred between supporters of Col. Sukhrob Kasymov,
commander of a special purpose brigade of the Tajik Interior
Ministry, and supporters of Yakub Salimov, chairman of the Tajik
Customs Committee.
</P>
<P>
A source in the president's office said that the positive
result of the negotiations will at least make it possible to avoid
any further aggravation of the situation in the country and
definitively settle the conflict soon by purely nonviolent means.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the situation in Dushanbe remains tense. Armed
clashes continue and sporadic bursts of automatic gunfire can be
heard.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Bans Smoking in Federal Buildings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday outlawed smoking in all federal buildings and facilities
except areas that have exhaust systems to pump smoke outdoors.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton said the new executive
order he signed today also bans people from smoking near intake
ducts in areas outside of federal facilities.
</P>
<P>
The ban, part of an effort to reduce the amount of second-hand
smoke in enclosed areas, takes effect in a year, although 15
federal agencies already have put in place regulations that ban
smoking in their buildings.
</P>
<P>
Clinton says, "Our federal workers and the thousands of people
who visit federal facilities will now be protected from...
second-hand smoke."
</P>
<P>
The executive order also directs agency heads to evaluate
whether smoking also should be limited in outside doorways and
courtyards.
</P>
<P>
Sources said an earlier draft version of the executive order
included stronger language that banned smoking from within 50 feet
outside of federal buildings.

<HEADLINE> China Battles Marine Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China has launched 29 marine
environmental protection projects in coastal areas, with said
projects involving investments of more than 10 million yuan (1.2
million US dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
China has introduced improved marine environmental protection
measures and has accelerated its battle against marine
pollution. Shanghai, China's largest metropolitan area, has
completed 84 water treatment projects along rivers, with related
efforts effectively reducing pollutants flowing into the sea by 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by Shandong, Liaoning and Fujian provinces to bring
river pollution under control have greatly improved the water
quality in the Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
The central government has approved coastal environmental
administration programs drafted by five provinces and 11 cities,
and coordination departments have been opened in coastal cities to
strengthen cooperative efforts.
</P>
<P>
China is currently drafting laws and regulations governing
fines and compensation for cases involving marine environmental
pollution, and is gradually establishing control systems to
prevent land pollutants from reaching the sea. Plans also call for
the introduction of registration and licensing systems governing
discharges of wastewater into the sea.
</P>
<P>
A new coastal monitoring network has enhanced marine
environmental protection by providing timely updated information
on environmental situations in key marine areas.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Environmental Protection is conducting a
survey of nondisposable organisms and is carrying out an
international action plan to protect the marine environment from
land pollution.

<P>
Kasymov and Salimov, reportedly former field commanders in
Tajikistan's four-year civil war and one-time allies in the
Popular Front, accused each other of creating tension in
Tajikistan in a bid to seek political influence.
</P>
<P>
The war ended in June after the Tajik government and the
republic's armed Islamic opposition signed a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Kasymov's deputy Sadi Kholmurodov said in Dushanbe that the
shoot-out left two servicemen from the brigade wounded, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was reported killed.
</P>
<P>
Kholmurodov said an announcement about the intention to settle
the conflict by political means was made at 11:00 a.m. (0600 GMT)
and the two sides were waiting for a mediator to organize the
talks.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. mission in Tajikistan said it had not
received any requests to organize talks between the conflicting
sides.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government is trying to bring an end to the fighting
peacefully by sealing off the conflict area. It is also taking
measures to speed up talks, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The time and venue of talks are expected to be decided within a
few hours.

<HEADLINE> Sterling's Decline Triggers Share Sell-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The pound has been falling
sharply on the foreign exchange market since the Bank of
England hinted that no further interest rate rises were
necessary in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The pound dropped 4.51 pfennigs to 2.9249 German marks by the
close of trading Friday after the Central Bank hinted on Thursday
that interest rates have peaked at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
While announcing a 0.25 percent increase on Thursday, taking
rates up from 6.75 percent to 7, the bank said, "Upward pressure
on the exchange rate should be reduced by the perception that
interest rates have reached a level consistent with the inflation
target."
</P>
<P>
Sterling has fallen 12 pfennigs in the past week and 17
pfennigs from the recent eight-year high of 3.0878 mark.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's attempt to talk down sterling kicked off
a sharp fall in leading stocks, but sparked a welcome boost in
shares of medium-sized companies, many of whom are exporters hurt
by the high pound.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index of leading shares - which broke through the
5,000 barrier for the first time on Wednesday - skidded 55.5
points to 5,031.3, with more than one billion shares traded for
the third day running Friday.
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast, the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies
rose 52.3 points to close at 4,650.5.
</P>
<P>
There were signs that investors, taking profits in some sectors
which have done well this year - banks, oils and pharmaceuticals
-- are reinvesting in the smaller stocks.
</P>
<P>
Observers in the City said that sterling was now taking a bath
and some correction to the pound's overvaluation was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
However, some currency experts in the City argued that the
correction has come too late to undo the damage manufacturers have
suffered since the pound began its upward climb in August last
year.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers have adjusted to some extent, but to reverse
their fortunes the pound would need to drop a lot more than it has
now, they added.

<HEADLINE> More Cypriots to Vacation Abroad This Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- What about a summer vacation
abroad this summer? One in every three Cypriots says "Yes."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Travel Agents Association said today that Cypriots who
are traveling abroad on their summer vacation are expected to hit
250,000, up some 25 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Cyprus said those Cypriots are
taking with them more than 115 million Cyprus pounds (about 230
million U.S. dollars) in foreign currency, compared with some 220
million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The mass exodus started at the beginning of this month, is
expected to reach its zenith by mid-August and will last until
September comes, CTAA spokesman Michalis Zingas said.
</P>
<P>
The most popular destination for the Cypriot vacationers this
year again seems to be Greece and its islands because they are not
expensive and not far away.
</P>
<P>
"Forty percent of the 250,000 Cypriots who will have traveled
abroad in the summer will go to Greece," said Zingas.
</P>
<P>
Second on the list of preferences of Cypriot holiday makers
comes the United Kingdom, described as one of the most traditional
vacation destinations.
</P>
<P>
Zingas said that although Cypriots have during the last few
years shown a marked interest in the Far East, this year more and
more people book vacations for exotic destinations in South
America.
</P>
<P>
A very attractive option also seems to be a short cruise to
neighboring countries like Israel or Egypt, mostly preferred by
people with not a lot of money to spend but a desire to travel.
</P>
<P>
Cruise liners are said to have been fully booked since early
June while not a single cabin is expected to become available
until September.
</P>
<P>
This year, 30,000 Cypriots are expected to join some 250,000
tourists to take a cruise to either Egypt or Israel.

<HEADLINE> Ung Huot Says Cambodia to Join ASEAN by Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Newly-appointed First Prime
Minister Ung Huot said Friday he is confident his country will
join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
"I am fully confident that Cambodia will be a member of the
ASEAN family by the end of the year," Ung Huot told a celebration
to mark the 30th anniversary of the founding of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
With Cambodia's entry into ASEAN, the southeast Asian countries
will be truly integrated. This is of great importance not only to
Cambodia, but also to ASEAN, which plays an important and active
role in the region, Ung Huot said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's membership is conducive to peace and stability in
the country and to exchanges and contacts between Cambodia and
ASEAN and other countries, thus promoting the recovery and
development of Cambodia's economy.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia was scheduled to join ASEAN in July, but the grouping
decided to suspend its admission in the wake of the political
crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Former First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh was ousted
after heavy fighting between troops loyal to him and his rival,
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, in early July.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot was nominated by Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party
as the new first prime minister and his nomination has been
approved by parliament and acting head of state, Chea Sim.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Inland-Hong Kong Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A seminar carrying the theme
"China in the 21st century and the historical mission of youth in
contemporary times" opened here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 young people from China's inland areas and Hong
Kong attended the seminar and discussed how to improve scientific,
educational and economic exchanges and cooperation between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Lu Jiaxi, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, told participants that Hong Kong, an
international financial, trade, shipping and information center,
has maintained close ties with the economy of the world as a
whole, and has served as both a window and bridge enabling
inland areas to absorb the fruits of the worldwide civilization.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong will
enable the new administrative region to forge even closer ties
with inland areas in areas such as science, education, the economy
and trade.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong's role as a bridge will be enhanced, and
expanded mutual exchanges and cooperation will propel the momentum
of China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Liu Peng, president of the All-China Youth Federation, said the
seminar is a meaningful event for young people from both inland
areas and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the historical mission requires that young people
in two areas be engaged in bold exploration, expand their
international perspectives and shoulder historical tasks in order
to contribute to the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong, as well as the prosperity of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Gets Food from Ukrainians Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, August 9 (Xinhua)-- The military government of
Sierra Leone has asked a number of Ukrainian state-run shipping
companies to transport urgent vital commodities into the country
against sanctions imposed by the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
African diplomatic sources here said that no official
confirmation on the development is available yet.
</P>
<P>
But one diplomat said the emergence of Ukrainians could lead
to armed confrontations between the West African Peace-keeping
Force (ECOMOG) and Ukraine if any of their ships are attacked.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Trade said in an interview,
"We shall no longer announce any consignment that comes in, but
simply put them into the market without publicity."
</P>
<P>
He said that previous consignments of rice and diesel brought
in by Ukrainian vessels, had been given wide publicity to prevent
merchants from hoarding or increasing prices.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here are expecting the likelihood of a
confrontation with a statement Friday by the captain of the
Ukrainian MV Kapitan which brought in the consignment of 6.000
metric tons of rice last week.
</P>
<P>
The captain said, "In the event that we are attacked while
delivering food and other essential supplies to Sierra Leone, we
will prove to the Nigerians what military might we also have."
</P>
<P>
"Ukraine has one of the largest naval fleets in the world and
Nigerians know the might of Ukraine where the most deadly weapons
are made," the captain was quoted by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the six year rebel war in Sierra leone, Ukraine pilots

JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has
repatriated forcibly thousands of illegal Mozambican immigrants
during the past week.
</P>
<P>
Over three thousand young people are the latest Mozambicans
who have been dropped at the Kompartipoot border post by train
from Johannesburg, said a report reaching here from Maputo today.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican authorities described the move as a weekly
crackdown on illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Most of the repatriated Mozambicans have worked as casual
labourers on farms or in trading companies in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Most of the young Mozambicans were exploited by their
employers as undocumented migrants.
</P>
<P>
The repatriated told Mozambican police that large land-owners
in South Africa had used the despair situation they were facing
as a pretext not to pay them.
</P>
<P>
South African commercial farmers are the main recruiters of
the young Mozambican job-seekers who flock to their estates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry will
seek cabinet approval next week to slash another 50-70 billion
baht (1.7-2.3 billion U.S. dollars) from the 1998 budget as part
of the government's austere measures, local newspapers reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Once the cabinet approved the cut from the previously planned
expenditures of 982 billion baht (32.7 billion dollars) for the

work out specific reductions for each government agency, Deputy
Finance Minister Chaturaon Chasing said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh Thursday said that
the 1998 budget will be cut by 60-100 billion baht (2-3.3 billion
dollars), noting that the budget cut is what Thailand has to do no
matter whether Thailand seeks help from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) or not.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will win back confidence from foreign institutions
when we have fiscal discipline, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the budget cut will mainly fall on
non-essential projects and the Defense Ministry could be hit
severely, while education, health and social welfare funds would
less be affected.

Chavalit said that he was also considering plans to cut funds
for parliament members, meeting allowances for government
officials and salaries of government advisors.

<HEADLINE> Ping-Pong Diplomacy Commemorated in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Commemorative events marking
Sino-US "Ping-Pong Diplomacy" reached a climax today in Beijing
with the end of the international men's table tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Chinese player Liu Guoliang won the championship, with Belgian
Jean-Michel Saive taking second place.
</P>
<P>
The tournament was part of the series of activities
commemorating the 25th anniversary of Sino-US Ping-Pong
Diplomacy. The China Table Tennis Assoc.(CTTA), National Committee
on Sino-US Relations and US Table Tennis Association jointly
sponsored the commemorative activities.
</P>
<P>
Other activities included exchange visits by Chinese and US
table tennis delegations, including a number of people who played
a major role in related diplomatic activities between 1971-1972.
</P>
<P>
Today's tournament was televised nationwide along with a tv
documentary which brought back memories of ping-pong diplomacy
carried out some 25 years ago. The images of Late Chairman Mao
Zedong, late Premier Zhou Enlai, late US President Richard Nixon
and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who made
outstanding contributions to opening up Sino-US relations,
appeared on the screen time and again.
</P>
<P>
The capacity crowd attending today's match joined Chinese and
US player in greeting the documentary with a warm round of
applause.
</P>
<P>
Judy Hoarfrost, who visited China in 1971 at the age of 15,
said that table tennis has blossomed into a friendship belt
linking people in China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Hoarfrost, who returned to China with her entire family,
including two daughters and one son, sensed the friendly feelings
Chinese cherish for Americans, and expressed hope that her
children will continue to contribute to friendly relations between
people in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Runner-up Saive noted that small "white ping-pong ball" opened
the door between the US and China some 25 years ago. This, he
continued, was of great significance to both China and the United
States as well as to the game of ping-pong itself.
</P>
<P>
According to CTTA President Xu Yinsheng, who also serves as
president of the International Table Tennis Federation, "We have
gathered to commemorate Sino-US ping-pong diplomacy. The more we
explore that phase of history, the more we treasure the existing
hard-won friendship between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Ping pong diplomacy will encourage China's table tennis
community to spare no effort in promoting friendship between the
people of the two countries, as well as with people throughout the
world, said Xu.

take any new protectionist measures to restrict the flow of
exports from the least developed countries (LDCs), Bangladeshi
Minister for Commerce and Industries Tofail Ahmed appealed today.
</P>

The minister also called for taking into account the difficult
times of the LDCs before taking up new and controversial issues
like environment, trade and investment, labor standard and
competition policy for discussions and negotiations in the World
Trade Organization (WTO).

Bangladesh had concluded an extensive study under the Uruguay
Round Study Project and its recommendations were now being

Tofail also called the developed countries for taking positive
measures benefiting the LDCs to improve their overall capacity to
respond to the opportunities offered by the WTO trading system.
</P>

his country. "We have no option but to face it boldly and endeavor
to reap maximum benefit out of it," he added.

<HEADLINE> Artificial Heart Pumps Implanted in Indian Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in India,
three patients, urgently requiring heart transplants, have been
implanted with battery-powered artificial heart pumps while they
wait for a donor, the Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
The implantations were carried out by the famous All Indian
Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here.
</P>
<P>
The pump will keep a patient's heart running for at least two
years, a spokesman for the institute said.
</P>
<P>
An artificial pump was first implanted at AIIMS on August 11,
1994, on a 15-year-old boy. But the pump was pneumatically driven,
with a heavy machine kept on the patient's bedside, keeping him
confined to hospital.
</P>
<P>
The newly-developed pump is implanted and power control is with
the patient. The patient can go home after the implant and
continue normal activities.
</P>
<P>
The rechargeable battery is kept in a shoulder holster and has
a running time of five to eight hours. A miniaturized control is
worn on a waist-belt.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Shilling Regains on Strike Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Shilling strengthened
marginally against the U.S. Dollar Friday when a nationwide
strike was called by the opposition, one day after it slumped to
a record low, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
At 12:30 local time Friday, the shilling was trading at a
commercial mean rate of 68.96 against the Dollar compared with
its opening rate of 70.26 -- a 1.85 percent gain, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The shilling was down 4.08 percent from Wednesday to close at
a commercial average of 70.26 to the Dollar Thursday. The closing
rate stood at 67.50 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Commercial Bank dealers said it was too early to
declare an end to the shilling's slide following the suspension
of a three-year 215-million-Dollar aid package by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on July 31.
</P>
<P>
"The market is very thin today (Friday) because most people
did not turn up to trade" as a result of the strike, a dealer was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to calm the turbulent foreign exchange market,
Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said Friday the government was
considering talks with the IMF on securing a second year of the
three-year loan package.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an IMF spokesman said Kenya must move against
corruption before any talks to revive the IMF loan.

<HEADLINE> Emergency Wells Benefit Dar es Salaam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 210 wells
constructed in various parts of Dar es Salaam, are a good source
of water for the residents who experienced inadequate water
supplies for several years here.
</P>
<P>
The wells, capable of supplying 8.5 million gallons of water
per day, have been constructed in the city under an emergency
program started in February following a critical shortage of water.
</P>
<P>
The low water flows in the Ruvu river, which is the main
source of water for Dar es Salaam, is the main reason for the
short water supply.
</P>
<P>
The project is under financial support by the United Naions
Development Program (UNDP) and a donar community, according to
the Minister of Water, Pius Ng'wandu.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted Ng'wandu as saying recently that the
government has also plans to drill boreholes along the two
transmission mains between Dar es Salaam and the upper and lower Ruvu
pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
This will ensure isolated villages and farmers along the mains as
they shall then receive ground water for their needs, Ng'mandu said.

<HEADLINE> 2-in-1 Payphone Using Multinational Coins Launched in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A telephone company today
launched a kind of 2-in-1 payphone in Malaysia, which accepts
coins from selected ASEAN countries, besides allowing customers to
make calls with the company's smart cards.
</P>
<P>
After the launching of the 2-in-1 payphone here, Malaysia's
Citifon Sdn Bhd (Private Limited) director Tengku Adnan bin Tengku
Mansur said the company will invest 60 million ringgit (about 23
million U.S. dollars) by the end of this year to install the
2-in-1 payphone booths in all states throughout Peninsular
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The 2-in-1 payphones, the first of such a kind in Malaysia,
would be able to accept coins from 15 different countries, but for
start, it will accept coins of Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia, he said
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to introduce coins from European
countries such as the pound sterling and Australian coins to be
used in the 2-in-1 payphones, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the value of a selected foreign coin would depend on
its exchange rate and should its exchange rate fluctuate, the
payphones will be programmed such to make the necessary
conversion.
</P>
<P>
He said the coins accepted can be programmed such that it would
be very convenient for tourists as it allows them to make calls
without seeking the help of money changers.
</P>
<P>
Tengku Adnan said Citifon will make available its services in
stages to the states and is optimistic that the company will be
able to establish a complete network of the new payphone service
within two years.
</P>
<P>
The company will also extend the 2-in-1 payphone system to
Sabah and Sarawak with 3,000 units to be installed in these two
states in East Malaysia by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Citifon is the smallest and the youngest of Malaysia's three
payphone operators. Telekom Malaysia and Uniphone are the major
players who command more than 90 percent of the market.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Condemns Burundi Executions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean president Robert
Mugabe has condemned the exectution of six people by Burundi's
military regime on July 31.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, Mugabe, also chairman of
the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), said that
Burundi did not have a legally constituted government and therefore,
could not claim to have legitimacy and an "impartial" judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
"As chairman of the Organisation of African Unity and on
behalf of Zimbabwe, I strongly condemn the execution as a
violation of human rights,'' Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
The execution runs counter to the spirit of the Rome Agreement
reached March this year, which provids for the creation of an
international criminal tribunal to adjudicate all cases involving
alleged acts of genocide and political crimes, Mugabe stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that by carrying out the hangings, Major Pierre
Buyoya's government has also created a situation that did not
augur well for the envisaged all-party peace talks to be held
later this month in Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe pointed out that Buyoya has a responsibility to
contribute towards the restoration of peace and stability in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Burundian government to desist from any acts that
would worsen the situation in the country and derail the efforts
to achieve national reconciliation and eventually a return to
national democracy, at a time when sanctions against it were
being relaxed.

<HEADLINE> Israel Raids Guerrilla Targets in Eastern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli jet fighters carried out
air raids at today at bases of Lebanese and Palestinian guerrilla
groups in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese police sources reported that four Israeli F-16
warplanes launched a raid at a base of the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, near Nabi Shit in Baalbek, at 12:10
a.m. local time (0910 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli fighter fired four air-to-surface missiles at the
base only five kilometers west of the Syrian border, the
police sources said, noting that one person was killed and
three others wounded.
</P>
<P>
A Hezboollah spokesman said that Israeli warplanes bombarded
vicinities of Nabi Shit, and denied any casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, the Israeli warplanes flied back and
launched a second air raid at a base of the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine at Raeet, three kilometers away
from the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
The air raids took place only 15 hours after the Israeli air
force rocketed a base belonging to the radical Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine - General Command at Jabal Naameh,
some 15 kilometers south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers interpreted the three air raids as a
signal Israel sent to Damascus which is considered by Tel Aviv
responsible for the Katyusha attack at Karyat Shmona in northern
Israel Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
And the air raids came following five days of Israel's
military escalation in south Lebanon since Lebanon, which has
caused heavy Lebanese civilians casualties.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
mixed.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market, August South saw an upward
movement, opening at 1,205 ringgit (463.46 U.S. dollars) per ton
and ending at 1,247.50 ringgit (479.80 dollars) per ton, after
last week's close of 1,202.50 ringgit (462.5 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to be firmer next week following the
current weak performance of the ringgit (local currency) which
closed the week at 2.6500/30 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The price of August South is expected to increase by at least
another 10 ringgit per ton next week, said a dealer.
</P>
<P>
This week, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) was volatile,
influenced by the performance of three-month tin on the London
Metal Exchange (LME) which fluctuated throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
On the KLTM, the metal's price opened at 14.29 ringgit (5.5
dollars) per kg, up 14 sen from last week's close, but eased
slightly the following day in line with the fall of three-month
tin on the LME.
</P>
<P>
However, the KLTM surged the next day on heavy buying activity,
despite an easier performance on the LME.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM, which saw Japanese, European and locals dominating
transactions throughout the week, closed the week higher at 14.52
ringgit (5.58 dollars) per kg, up 37 sen from 14.15 ringgit (5.44
dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover for the week rose sharply to 914 tons from 751
tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The price differential between the KLTM and that of the LME
stood at a discount of 5 dollars per ton against a discount of 15
dollars per ton last week.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM is expected to maintain its firm performance next week
as players anticipate the ringgit to remain weak against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market, both RSS One and SMR 20
performed weaker this week compared with last week as RSS One
closed at 250.50 sen (96.35 U.S. cents) per kg and at 250.00 sen
(about 96.15 U.S. cents) per kg respectively.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for Friday stood at 191.02
Malaysia/Singapore cent (sen) per kg against 192.87 cent (sen) per
kg last week.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market is expected to improve its performance
following the coming monsoon season which will lead to the
shortage of the raw material.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the monsoon season which is expected to hit
Southern Thailand and Malaysia in October, November and December
would likely boost rubber prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia has been warned by the
International Basketball Federation (FIBA) to re-evaluate security
measures for the 2,000 Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
FIBA gave the warning after a riot happened in a match at the
world under 23 men's basketball championships in Melbourne on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A riot followed Turkey's 75-57 quarter-final defeat by
Yugoslavia on Friday at Melbourne Park, also home of the
Australian Tennis Open each January, with police reinforcements
called in to keep rival supporters apart.
</P>
<P>
Flares were set off inside the stadium where chairs, food and
drink containers were hurled about, while five windows were
smashed at the complex after the match. Some supporters were
seen spitting at players as they left the arena.
</P>
<P>
FIBA media boss Florian Wanniger said Saturday the incidents
would prompt Australian officials to make careful security
arrangements for the sport at the next Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"They will have to think about it, given the fact that Sydney
is one of the most multi-cultural cities in the world and they
have ethnic groups like Greeks and Turks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They just have to try to anticipate what can happen and look
at the scheduling and teams and ethnic groups."

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa, India, New Zealand
and Scotland qualified Friday for the women's field hockey World
Cup finals in the Netherlands next May.
</P>
<P>
The four teams finished winners and runners-up in the two pool
sections in the qualifying tournament at Harare's Magamba stadium.
</P>
<P>
The third and fourth teams in each pool will play off for the
remaining two spots. After a rest day Saturday, England will meet
Russia and Ireland will play China in crucial matches.
</P>
<P>
India secured their place with a 3-0 win over Canada. They
ended up with the same points as England, but under new count-out
rules introduced after the 1996 Olympic Games, India go through
with most wins.
</P>
<P>
And Scotland won their place by beating China 1-0 in the final
match of the pool series. After defending for most of the match,
Scotland's Rhona Simpson got the vital goal 11 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, to everybody's surprise, forced their way from bottom
place into fourth _ a play-off placing _ by beating Japan 3-2, to
lift them above the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Ireland were two down at halftime, but in the final 35 minutes
produced the goal-scoring ability that had eluded them
previously. Canada's defeat by India left them in the bottom spot.
</P>
<P>
Russia make the playoffs even though they suffered a 5-2 defeat
by pool leaders New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Spain's 4-0 win over hosts Zimbabwe was not sufficient and they
will both join Canada and Japan in matches next week which will
adjust world rankings and affect future invitations.

</P>
<P>
Lebanese police sources reported that two Israeli warplanes
launched a raid at a base of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, near Nabi Shit in Baalbek, at 12:10 a.m. (0910
GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli fighter-bombers fired four air-to-surface missiles
at the base only five kilometers west of the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
A Hezboollah spokesman said that Israeli warplanes bombarded
vicinities of Nabi Shit, and claimed that no casualties were
caused.
</P>
<P>
Half an hour later, the Israeli warplanes flied back and
launched a second air raid at a base of the Populat Front for
the Liberation of Palestine at Raeet, three kilometers away from
the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
The air raids took place only 15 hours after the Israeli air
force rocketed a base belonging to the radical Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine - General Command at Jabal Naameh,
some 15 kilometers south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers interpreted the three air raids as
a signal Israel sent to Damascus believed to have the
responsibility for the Katyusha attack at Karyat Shmona in
northern Israel Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
And the air raids came following five days of Israel's
military escalation in south Lebanon since Lebanon, which has
caused heavy Lebanese civilians casualties.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Resume Contacts with Bosnian Envoys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- After France, Germany announced
today that it will lift the ban on contacts with Bosnian
ambassadors which was imposed after a dispute among Bosnia's joint
presidency over naming future envoys.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry officials announced the decision Friday
evening and Germany decided to follow suit on Saturday, German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel said in an interview with the German newspaper
Bild.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Bosnia's three-member joint presidency agreed
on Friday that the country's 33 ambassadorial posts will be split on
ethnic lines with Muslims having 13, Serbs 11 and Croats 9.
</P>
<P>
The compromise was brokered by the United States envoy Richard
Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France suspended contacts with Bosnia along with 10
other European Union countries and the United States after the
fractions in Bosnia had failed to settle differences by an August 1
deadline on the naming of envoys.
</P>
<P>
In the interview with the Bild, Kinkel also called on the UN
Security Council to adopt a resolution as soon as possible in order to
search out and confiscate property and bank accounts which Bosnians
accused of war crimes have in foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Continue Winning at Volleyball Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China and Russia continued their
triumphant advance as they won their second straight matches as
the three-day World Women's Volleyball Grand Prix went into second
day here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
China defeated the United States 15-0, 15-7, 15-4 and Russia
beat Italy 15-10, 15-5, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
On the event's opening day on Friday, China won over Italy
15-6, 15-6, 15-11 and Russia beat the United States 15-1, 15-8,
15-3.
</P>
<P>
The taller Chinese trounced the Americans 15-0 in the opening
set. The score came out for the first time in the five-year
history of the Macao event here.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, with most newcomers on the court, went on to take
the two following sets with a fairly ease to win the match three
sets to null.
</P>
<P>
The Russians were surprised in the opening set of their game
today against the Italians as their opponents made it 4-4, 9-9
before leading 10-9.
</P>
<P>
But the Russians, taking the advantage of the unforced errors
of the Italian players, collected six points in a row to win the
set 15-10.
</P>
<P>
The two following sets went to the Russians 15-5 and 15-3.
</P>
<P>
Lang Ping, head coach of the Chiense team, said that the
newcomers of her team performed to their normal form today and
they have their independent style, which she said is good for the
team.
</P>
<P>
"Our confrontation to the Russians tomorrow will be very
tough. They had brought here almost the same line-up as at last
year's Olympic Games," she said.
</P>
<P>
The good performance in spiking and blocking here by the
Russians pose a great threat to the Chinese, Lang admitted.
</P>
<P>
"But we will be fully ready before going onto the court
tomorrow and I am sure we two teams will give our best shot and a
good game to the spectators," Lang said.
</P>
<P>
Italy takes on THE United States for the third place of the
Macao tournament and, with two straight wins each, China meets
Russia on the event's third and final day on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition Rejects Govt's Reform Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A number of Kenyan opposition
leaders have rejected two bills raised last week by the
government over constitutional reforms, the East African Standard
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, at a rally called by the opposition umbrella body
National Convention Executive Council (NCEC) Friday, also vowed
to boycott the general elections if reforms are not undertaken.
</P>
<P>
Elections are expected to be held by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
They demand that the government will convene a meeting to
discuss the reforms next week or face the continuous strike
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Among the opposition leaders are Democratic Party Chairman
Mwai Kibaki, FORD-Kenya Vice Chairman James Orengo, National
Development Party (NDP) leader Raila Odinga, NCEC members as well
as opposition parliamental members.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi and his ruling party Kenya African
National Union (KANU) have accepted demands for reforms
half-heartedly, Democratic party Chairman Kibaki charged.
</P>
<P>
If the government refuses to heed calls for speeding up the
reforms, chaos will erupt, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leaders reiterated that the NCEC, set up in
April by the opposition to coordinate its campaign for the
reforms, is the official spokesman of the opposition parties in
the dialogue with KANU.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC is the only body which could lead the opposition in
the reform negotiations with the government, NDP leader Odinga
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, opposition FORD-Asili Chairman Kenneth Matiba denied
the NCEC as the representative of the opposition parties, saying
the NCEC itself is an interested party in the reform campaign.
</P>
<P>
Both Matiba and FORD-Kenya leader Kijana Wamalwa opposed to
Friday's nationwide strike called by NCEC, thus deepening the
split among the opposition ranks.
</P>
<P>
The strike should be suspended because President Daniel arap
Moi has instituted dialogue with interested parties, Wamalwa
stressed in a statement Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Market Remains Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China's sugar market expects to
remain stable this year with adequate production and smooth sales,
according to the China Sugar Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, sugar refineries across the country had
sold a total of 4.96 million tons of sugar, accounting for 73
percent of the total production. Now sugar sales of the 1996-1997
period has entered its later stage, the association said.
</P>
<P>
The sugar consumption is expected to rise in the coming months
as more will be needed for the present peak season of soft drink
production, for fruit processing and fruit liquor production, and
for the coming Mid-autumn Festival and the celebration of the
National Day on October 1, the association said.
</P>
<P>
"If it is free from man-made interference and cut-the-price
competition of the refineries, the national sugar market will go
smooth," an analyst of the association noted.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A series of discouraging
events prompted heavy selling of stocks on the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange this week.
</P>
<P>
For this week, local institutions have cautiously supported the
market and their presence were especially felt on Wednesday and
Friday, when the market was able to finish higher. Heavy selling
pressure was noted especially from foreign players.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the Central Bank to restrict swap
transactions on the local currency ringgit coupled with ceilings
on base lending rates, the 2.8 billion ringgit (1.12 billion U.S.
dollars) trade deficit for June and overall bearishness in
regional bourses were just too much for the market to "swallow".
</P>
<P>
The bearish sentiment saw the Composite Index dropped 70.27
points to 932.36 as against 1,002.63 at last week's close.
</P>
<P>
The Emas Index shed 17.79 points to 269.99 from 287.78 last
week, the Industrial Index shed 133.84 points to 1,880.57 and the
Second Board Index lost 36.40 points to 809.46.
</P>
<P>
Following some heavy selling on finance stocks, especially
Maybank, the finance index dropped below 8,000 level and lost a
whopping 640.56 points to finish at 7,977.75 this week.
</P>
<P>
This week's grand total market turnover declined to 1.401
billion shares valued at 8.768 billion ringgit (3.37 billion
dollars) as against 1.450 billion shares valued at 9.856 billion
ringgit (3.79 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
On the Main Board, total turnover increased to 1.065 billion
shares valued at 7.430 billion ringgit (2.86 billion dollars) as
against 920.498 million shares valued at 5.053 billion ringgit
(1.94 billion dollars) at the end of last week.
</P>
<P>
On the Second Board turnover decreased to 186.816 million
shares valued at 1.938 billion ringgit (750 million dollars) as
against 222.880 million shares valued at 2.770 billion ringgit
(1.07 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Direct business deals dropped to 149.936 million valued at
1.338 billion ringgit (510 million dollars) as against 306.960
million shares worth 2.033 billion ringgit (782 million dollars)
last week.
</P>
<P>
Four companies -- Chuan Huat Resources, Autoindustries
Ventures, YLI Industries and Sarawak-based Utama Banking Group --
were listed this week with the first three on the Second Board and
the last on the Main Board.
</P>
<P>
Top 10 actives this week were Renong, Malaysian Helicopter
Services, MBf Capital, MCB Holdings, Anson Perdana, Utama Banking,
Magnum, Sime Darby, Telekom, and Asia Pac, all except Utama
Banking shedding.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the bearish trend this week is expected to have a
dampening effect on the market next week with pressure on the
Composite Index to drift below the 900 points level.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The lower reaches of the Yellow
River dried up again yesterday after resumption of water flow for
only 56 hours, but experts still warn against possible flood
threat.
</P>
<P>
Because of inadequate rainfall, the lower reaches of the Yellow
River, China's second longest, has been hit by severe drought,
which cut the water flow as early as February 7.
</P>
<P>
When this year's first flood peak hit the area, the water
carrying great amount of sand was not even adequate to water the
dry farm land along the river. So the river soon dried up agains
after the resumption of water flow on August 6, water conservancy
experts said.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts are still on their guard against possible
flood, saying huge flood peaks are still possible in dry season,
and thus calling for vigilance against flood during the present
drought period.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Outlines Plans for Growth, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
outlined its programs for economic growth and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Closing the second international seminar with the theme "from
stabilization to economic growth and poverty alleviation" on Friday,
Zambian Deputy Finance Minister Godfrey Simasiku said that to
achieve growth and reduce poverty, the government has been
pursuing a policy to liberalize the economy, free prices and
provide incentives to make Zambia one of the most attractive
destinations for investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved macroeconomic stability and are keeping
inflation in check. It is the intention of the government to
continue with this process so that innflation will come downto
below 15 perent by the end of this year and thereby set the stage
for single digit inflationin 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the liberalization and stabilization reforms
introduced over the last six years have considerably improved
Zambia's growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
"This growth if sustained, will give us a fair chance at
meaningfully addressing issues of poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in the coming years the government can and must
achieve much higher growth, make a more decisive advance in
poverty reduction and achieve a signficant reduction in the
currently unsustainable rate of population growth.
</P>
<P>
The government must mobilize internal resource to create an
appropriate monetary and fiscal policy mix and sensitize Zambia's
external creditors of its need to contribute more towards the
tasks of reducing its external debt burden, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Macroeconomic policies will only be seen to be successful if
in the long run they result in the improvement of general living
standards of the people of Zambia," said Simasiku.
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign bankers, businessmen and representatives of
international organizations had attended the three-day seminar to
discuss ways of promoting growth and reducing poverty in Zambia
and Africa as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Suicide Bombers Not from Palestinian Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat has confirmed that Israel had
informed him that the two suicide bombers who attacked a
Jerusalem market came from abroad instead of the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with Israel's state television
Channel I which was broadcasted Friday night, Arafat said the
recent military operations launched by Israel against the
Hezbollah guerrilla forces in south Lebanon indicated that Israel
might have determined that the two suicide bombers, who killed 15
people and wounded 170 others in a West Jerusalem vegetable
market on July 30, were actually sent by pro-Iranian Hezbollah as
some earlier rumors claimed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader strongly accused Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of insulting the Palestinians with tough
measures following the Jerusalem bombings, including imposing
total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a ban on internal
travel by Palestinians in the West Bank, and the freeze on
transfer of tax revenues to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Israel applied the sanctions against the PNA on the assumption
that the two suicide bombers were sent by the militant Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) from the Palestinian territories. It
held the PNA responsible for failing to crack down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Arafat condemned the Israel's collective punishment against
the Palestinians, saying Netanyahu could not achieve his goals
by insulting the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
He also angrily denied the frequent Israeli charges that he
and other senior Palestinian officials have organized and
encouraged anti-Israeli terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He demanded Israel provide evidence to support the recent
claim that three Palestinian policemen, allegedly caught last
month on their way to carry out a shooting attack against a
Jewish settlement near Nablus, were sent by Palestinian police
chief Ghazi Jabali. Israel has been pressuring Arafat to arrest
and try Jabali for his alleged involvement in terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's comments were made on the eve of the arrival here
today of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross for a new round
of mediation aimed at reviving the stalled Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks. Security matters will top the agenda of Ross's
mission, which is open-ended.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Ross will call on the PNA to take
tough measures against Islamic extremists and resume the
suspended security cooperation with Israel. Meanwhile, he would
try to persuade Israel to lift the punitive measures taken
following the Mahane Yehuda market bombing and halt the
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
As a good-will gesture, Israel has begun taking actions to
gradually ease the tough sanctions against the Palestinians. On
Friday, Israel announced to lift the internal travel ban on
Palestinians in the West Bank cities of Jericho and Nablus,
allowing them to travel freely.

<HEADLINE> China-Made Gamma Scalpel Enters American Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- China-made rotary Gamma scalpel
has entered the American market with the approval from the Food
and Drug Administration of the United States, according to the
State Pharmaceutical Administration of China (SPAC).
</P>
<P>
The international market of large medical equipment has been
dominated by Europe, the United States and Japan, which set strict
regulations on the import of medical equipment from other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The access of the Chinese gamma knifes to the American market
marked the first step the Chinese medical products sector took to
enter the international market.
</P>
<P>
Gamma scalpel is the most advanced medical equipment for brain
surgeries. Sweden had been the only country producing and selling
such equipment before China developed the rotary Gamma scalpel in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The product, patented by the Shenzhen OUR International Science
and Technology Development Company in south China's Guangdong
Province, has passed the state appraisal and obtained production
certificate from the SPAC.
</P>
<P>
The rotary Gamma scalpel uses Gamma rays to kill tumor cells
by focusing it with pin-point accuracy on the trouble spot in the
brain. The rotary Gamma rays cause less damage to the healthy
parts of the brain than the still rays, used by the foreign Gamma
scalpels.
</P>
<P>
The new invention, which requires no anesthesia, refrains from
destroying surrounding tissue, and has no after-effects associated
with common surgical operations, has been applied at more than a
dozen hospitals in China, and helped hundreds of patients.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry has
decided that the value added tax (VAT) on some business contracts
signed before August 16 could remain at the current seven percent
for two years.
</P>
<P>
The payments made on contracts signed between private and
public companies before August 16, the day when the new
ten-percent VAT policy goes into effect, will be charged at the
current rate for a period of two years, local newspapers reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government announced on August 5 that Thailand will
raise its VAT from the current seven percent to ten percent
starting on August 16.
</P>
<P>
The move is among the measures introduced by the government to
meet conditions for seeking financial assistance from the

</P>
<P>
In addition, officials from the Revenue Department of the Thai
Finance Ministry said that the department had proposed to

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Take Active Part in ASEAN Cooperation Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van
Kiet said today that Vietnam, a new ASEAN member, is taking an
active part in ASEAN cooperation programs aimed at maintaining
peace and broadening regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Vo Van Kiet made the remark in a speech on Vietnam Television
on the 30th anniversary of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is playing an important role in keeping peace and
stability as well as promoting cooperation and development in the
region and the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he hoped ASEAN members would continue
to complement one another in a common drive to improve
socio-economic development, national construction and the quality
of the people's lives.
</P>
<P>
He said Southeast Asia has become a dynamic region with
economic growth rates ranking among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Even though there still remain latent factors in the region
that may cause instability, ASEAN countries, under the principles
of the Bali Treaty, are able to maintain peace and stability in
the region," said Vo Van Kiet.
</P>
<P>
He said all ASEAN nations would strive together for peace,
stability and cooperation, entering the 21st century with new
opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said that Vietnam,
which will host the sixth ASEAN summit in 1998, would actively
prepare for entering a new century under the theme of "One ASEAN
to the 21st Century."

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Monitoring Network Ready Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The global monitoring network for
nuclear tests will be ready by the end of 1998, a senior official
from the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory work for inspections has also made much headway,
Daniel Rozgonova, chairman of the CTBTO preparatory committee,
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Hoffmann, executive secretary of the CTBTO, said at
the conference that the CTBT would stop nuclear tests and make it
"practically impossible" to develop new nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Although inspections could not be implemented widely until
after the treaty came into effect, the international monitoring
system would not be affected by that, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that relevant data had been processed in Vienna, where
the CTBTO, a new United Nations body which started operations in
March, is based. The CTBTO is working on the monitoring stations.
</P>
<P>
The treaty outlawing nuclear explosions, which was adopted by
the U.N. General Assembly last year, opened to signatures in New
York in September in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But it will not come into effect until each of the 44 nations
with nuclear facilities ratifies it. So far, 145 countries have
signed.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, a worldwide network of 321 monitoring
stations will be set up to track the globe's atmosphere, seas, and
earth so effectively no nation will be able to conduct a secret
nuclear explosion.

<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Silicon Valley is moving eastward
and will spread some of its wealth in the Beijing Economic and
Technological Development Zone, according to a report in today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yucheng, deputy mayor of Beijing, commented that it is in
agreement with the city's plan in the 21st century for development
of high-tech on top of government agenda, and a channel for
high-tech enterprises from the Silicon Valley to establish a
high-tech city in the area.
</P>
<P>
A contract was signed in Beijing yesterday between Beijing
Economic and Technological Investment Development Corp (BETIDC)
and Viagolel Inc to establish Silicon (China) Development Co Lt.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will provide 25 percent of the 25 million U.S. dollars
infrastructural investment, located on two square kilometres in
the development zone.
</P>
<P>
Beijing was chosen for the initiative after beating competitors
from both home and abroad, sources from Viagolel Inc. said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will increase efforts to attract multinational
companies because they possess advanced technology, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's 500 biggest multinational companies, 21 are
doing business in the development zone.
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, 20 to 60 enterprises from the Silicon
Valley are expected to open factories in the zone, authoritative
sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Competition in China's cosmetics
industry is getting fierce and becoming more high-tech.
</P>
<P>
While cosmetic producers fought one another in the past by
launching advertisement campaigns, they are now competing to
attract customers through technology-intensive products.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of new varieties of cosmetics have been welcomed
by customers of different ages and professions whose needs are
fully considered.
</P>
<P>
The leading products of the cosmetics industry are those for
skin care and hair care, authoritative sources said.
</P>
<P>
Joint-venture cosmetic producers have taken the lion's share of
the cosmetics industry, occupying 80 percent of China's cosmetics
market with their advantages in brand name and price.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some famous Chinese brand names have
reinforced their competitive edge in terms of product quality,
price and varieties.
</P>
<P>
The cosmetics market will develop with strong momentum in the
following years, with annual demand increasing 25-30 percent, the
authoritative sources added.

<HEADLINE> Thai State Enterprises See Tougher Investment Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's National Economic and
Social Development Fund (NESDB) has introduced new guidelines for
investment projects by state enterprises as the country is
following austere measures to seek funds from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Under the new guidelines, the country's state enterprises, for
the first time, must conduct a feasibility study covering the risk
of foreign exchange before they determine returns from their new
investment projects.
</P>
<P>
The investment projects by the state enterprises also must
consider the maximum use of local natural resources or raw
materials, Virat Ratanasiritham, secretary general of the NESDB,
was quoted as saying by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
However, overseas investment projects by the state enterprises
will not be affected as they use foreign currencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NESDB chief noted that the new guidelines are essential to
bring the country's state enterprises in line with the IMF's
austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government on August 5 announced that Thailand would
turn to the IMF for financial assistance, while introducing a
package of fiscal and reform action plans and measures to meet the
IMF's conditions, including termination of subsidies to state
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian PM Urges Support for Small Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valeriy
Pustovoitenko called for support for small businesses, saying that
the lack of effective legislative policy had hindered the
development of small businesses in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko was quoted today by local press as saying that the
lack of effective legislative policy has made it impossible to
create a governmental body to oversee the small business sector.
</P>
<P>
A system for providing credits to small businesses was
practically non-existent in the country, he said at a meeting with
entrepreneurs on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine now has 93,000 small businesses. However, these
businesses, employing 10 percent of the labor force, have not
achieved any substantial development.
</P>
<P>
The transformation of small businesses from the start-up stage
to the development stage should take place in the process of the
economic reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the development of the private economic
sector is one of the main aspects of Ukraine's economic reforms.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Rate Continues to Rise in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed in the
Czech Republic reached a record high in July and recent
statistics indicate that unemployment will continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
Czech Labour and Social Affairs Ministry statistics show
that the number of unemployed in July was 222,000 and the
unemployment rate countrywide was 4.3 percent, making July the
month of highest unemployment in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The ministry predicts the number could go above 250,000, and
the unemployment rate could reach five percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's unemployment rate was 3.5
percent. Despite the rise this year, the unemployment rate is
still lower than those of other Central and Eastern European
countries such as Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the most important reason leading to the increase
in unemployment is the austerity measures adopted by the Czech
government to slash budget and reduce staff members.

<P>
MARDERT, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Three top riders, the Tour winner
Jan Ullrich, Dane Bjarne Riis and Marco Pantani, all withdrew from
the Saturday's San Sebastian Classic cycling race, organizers said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Ullrich, who became the first German to win the
Tour de France two weeks ago, had complained of being tired at an
international race in Buehl, Germany on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ullrich has already announced his withdrawal from the Tour of
Spain from September 6 to 28 and the world championships, also in
San Sebastian, from October 12 to 17.
</P>
<P>
As the first World Cup event since the Tour de France, San
Sebastian organizers had said they failed to persuade the German
to race on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mountain specialist Pantani, third in the Tour de France, will
also be sorely missed in Saturday's Basque country race, while
Riis, the 1996 Tour de France winner, has also announced he will
skip the Tour of Spain in order to prepare for the world road
racing championship.
</P>
<P>
Italian Claudio Chiappucci, France's Laurent Jalabert and
Richard Virenque, and Spain's Fernando Escartin and Abraham Olano
are among the favorites for the 230-kilometer, 238-rider World Cup
event.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Senator Shot Dead Outside His Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 8 (Xinhua) -- A ruling Liberal Party
senator and close ally of Colombian president was shot dead today
in northeast Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Cristo, 67, was shot six times after he got out of his
car to enter his office in Cucuta, the capital of the Norte de
Santander province. His bodyguard, Agent Pedro Cogaria, was also
killed.
</P>
<P>
The senator was shot by a gun in the head, neck and thorax. He
was rushed to the San Jose Clinic and officials said he was dead
upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
The assassins were four unidentified women and two men, who
rode in a Toyota van, said the chief of the local police,
Col. Luis Fernando Bautista. The gunmen's vehicle was later found
abandoned in the Nuevo Horizonte sector of Cucuta.
</P>
<P>
A local military commander blamed the attack on National
Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas who are waging a campaign to
disrupt local and congressional elections scheduled for late this
year and early next.
</P>
<P>
The ELN, Colombia's second largest guerrilla army, claimed
responsibility for kidnaping six mayors in southern Narino
province earlier this week, and for killing another in the town of
Toledo, also in the Norte de Santander province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, they pledged to stop politicians who did not
share their views from campaigning in their zones of influence.
Norte de Santander province was one of their traditional
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
Cristo, ex-president of the Senate foreign relations committee,
was a staunch backer of Samper's 1994 run for president. He was
the father of the Colombian ambassador to Greece, Juan Fernando
Cristo.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Ernesto Samper swiftly condemned the
assassination, describing it a a cowardly and terrorist act
against the democracy of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The enemies of Senator Cristo are the enemies of democracy, of
peace, of the poor, and of social justice," Samper said in a
communique.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had ordered an immediate investigation
into the attack and called on people to vote for peace and
democracy on October 26.
</P>
<P>
Elections then will choose new provincial governors, mayors,
town councillors and provincial legislators. National
congressional elections are scheduled for next March 6.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Norte de Santander province, Sergio Entrena
Lopez, offered a 50,000 U.S. dollar reward for a tipoff on the
murder.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Forests Declining Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Millions of hectares of forest
land are still being converted into industrial estates and
plantation areas, pushing Indonesia's forests toward the brink of
total destruction, an official said.
</P>
<P>
"In Kalimantan alone, 2,940,000 hectares of forest land have
been given up by the Forestry Ministry, not to mention 1,800,000
hectares in Riau," Sumahadi, director of forest inventory and
utilization, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show Indonesia currently has 113 million
hectares of forest land, but the latest estimates put the figure
at less than 90 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the seventh five-year development plan in 2003,
all forests in Indonesia will have been claimed as state property.
Presently, only 21.36 percent of the forests are controlled by the
state, local press today quoted Sumahadi as saying.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to curb rampant deforestation, the
government has ordered that no more cement plants will be
established within Java.
</P>
<P>
Java Island officially has 2,938,813 hectares of forest land.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, some of the projects are unavoidable, such as
the construction of power plants, reservoirs, roads as well as the
extension of towns, mining operations and new agricultural
estates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The fifth Kunming Export
Commodities Fair which opened Friday draws a record number of
participants.
</P>
<P>
The annual event, which began in 1993, is designed to present
products of southwest China to domestic and overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, 220,000 business people have participated in the
fair, wrapping up business contracts worth nearly six billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
This year's fair overshadows the previous four editions in
terms of both numbers of participants and enterprises, today's
English newspaper China Daily quoted Liu Jing, vice governor of
Yunnan Province and vice-director of the organizing committee of
this year's fair, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The increased 1,592 booths in the Kunming International Trade
Center this year could hardly meet the demand as domestic sellers
alone had required more than 1,900 booths.
</P>
<P>
Finally the organizers reduced the number of domestic booths to
1,392 and allocated 200 for overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 overseas business people from 16 countries and
regions are expected to attend the fair, of which the delegations
from Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Viet Nam are led by their trade
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, Singapore and the Hongkong Special Administrative
Region are also present to showcase their products.
</P>
<P>
The Kunming fair is the only such annual trade event in
southwest China, which includes Yunnan, Sichuan and Guizhou
provinces, Chongqing municipality and the Tibet Autonomous
Region.

active part in ASEAN cooperation programs aimed at maintaining
peace and broadening regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Vo Van Kiet made the remark in a speech on Vietnam Television

Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
ASEAN is playing an important role in keeping peace and

</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he hoped ASEAN members would continue
to complement one another in a common drive to improve

<HEADLINE> Chinese River Dolphin on Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese river dolphin, an
endangered rare species, is on exhibition which opened Friday in
Beijing Natural History Museum.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the exhibition offers
visitors through samples, photos, articles and lectures
information about the dolphin, knowns as baiji, which is
considered one of the rarest and most endangered species in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Once numbering in the thousands, there may now be less than 50
baiji in the world, all living in the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Considered the "living fossil," baiji is believed to have lived
in the world for more than 25 million years, much older than
another precious and endangered animal -- the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
Owing to rapid development of the Yangtze, the water pollution
and overfishing, the rare animal's living environment and food
sources are threatened.
</P>
<P>
In order to heighten public awareness and protect the creature,
the China Wildlife Protection Association and Green Earth
Volunteers, with four other wildlife and environmental protection
groups, began "Save Endangered Wild Animals" in June and suggested
designating 1997 "The Year of Baiji."
</P>
<P>
In a campaign to protect baiji, Chinese scientists will search
for the dolphin, which measures 2-2.5 meters long and weighs about
150 kilograms,, trying to catch at least 20 of them, moving them
to semi-natural protection areas.

KIEV, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine expects to reap 37 to 38
million tons of grain this year, 13 to 14 million tons more than
in 1996, Agro-Industrial Complex Minister Yuri Karasyk said Friday.
</P>
<P>
But harvesting has been delayed by torrential rains. Farmers
were asked to harvest grain crops by August 15 to leave time for
putting grain into silos, officials with the complex said. Sugar
beet and corn are to be harvested in September.
</P>
<P>
By August 5, about 5.3 million out of a total of 11 million
hectares of grain and leguminous crops had been reaped.
</P>
<P>
The average yield was 1.39 tons per hectare. The highest yields
of 1.47 and 1.69 tons per hectare were reported in the Kherson and
Odessa regions.
</P>
<P>
Farms have begun preparing the soil for the sowing of winter
crops. More than three billion hectares or 34 percent of the total
have been tilled.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are experiencing problems with fodder because poor
weather has hampered its sowing. At present they have only 47
percent of the required quantity of fodder at their disposal.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urges Exporters to Surrender Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
urged exporters to surrender their U.S. dollars to help stabilize
the foreign exchange market sooner.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista made the appeal
here Friday as Philippine exporters apparently held their dollars
in the hope of future gains following the depreciation of the peso
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Businessmen should be either in manufacturing and selling, not
in speculating," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bautista, however, said that the appeal should be taken as an
advice to exporters.
</P>

"This is a kind of advice if you like in the same manner that
we requested manufacturers of domestic goods to cooperate by not
raising prices of their products," he said.

<P>
Sergio Ortiz-Luis, president of the Philippine Exporters
Confederation, admitted that some exporters may be holding on to
their hard-earned dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that exporters were only expecting a peso-dollar rate
of 28:1 at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine currency devalued to 29 pesos against the dollar
on July 11 under speculative pressure but it has appreciated to
28.50 pesos to the dollar since then.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Sales Rise in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle sales in Venezuela rose
dramatically to 74,736 units during year ending in July.
</P>
<P>
The 161 percent growth in sales over the period of the previous
year is attributed to the economic recovery and ample
opportunities offered by banks and other institutions to finance
the purchase of vehicles, reports the Auto Manufacturers Chamber
of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Of the vehicles sold, both imported and domestically-made,
41,038 were for transporting passengers -- 61 percent more than
that in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Annan Appoints Reed Brody as Third Member of Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today appointed Reed Brody of the United States as the third
member of a three-person team to investigate alleged human rights
abuse in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, said a statement by
the spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
Brody was director of the Human Rights Division of the UN
peacekeeping mission in El Salvador and executive director of the
International Human Rights Law Group.
</P>
<P>
The other two members of the secretary-general's team are
Atsu-Koffi Amega of Togo, chairman, who was president of the
Supreme Court of Togo, and Andrew Chigovera, the deputy attorney
general of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief decided to launch his own investigation of the
allegation after President Kabila objected to the composition of
an investigative team assembled by the UN Human Rights Commission
in Geneva, added the statement.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Suffers Big Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar suffered the
worst one-day slide in three months today after Japan reported
another marked trade surplus and the German bank's top economist
suggested it's ready to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The second straight drop in the British pound also indirectly
helped drag the dollar down against most other major currencies.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar fell to 114.95 yen from 118.45 yen
Thursday, down 2.9 percent. The dollar fell to 1.8473 marks from
1.8683 Thursday, down 1.1 percent. Both were the biggest one-day
declines in the dollar since May 20.
</P>
<P>
The pound fell to 1.5855 U.S. dollars in New York from 1.5893
U.S. dollars, its second consecutive 10-month low.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed part of the dollar weakness today to Japan's
report that its broadest measure of trade rose nearly 60 percent
in June from a year earlier, the third straight monthly advance.
</P>
<P>
German bank officials indicated that the central bank wouldn't
hesitate to raise interest rates to keep prices stable.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday: 1.5103 Swiss francs, down from 1.5305; 6.2238 French
francs, down from 6.3000; 1,802.50 Italian lire, down from
1,823.00; 1.3896 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3878.

<HEADLINE> Dow Plunges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Investors' profit-taking spree
sliced more than 150 points off the Dow Jones industrial average
today as interest rates soared again in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow plunged 156.78, or 1.9 percent, to 8,031.22, down
162.82 for the week. It recovered from a loss of nearly 212 points
that briefly put the famed market gauge below the 8,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 4-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 561.30
million shares as against 576.04 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 17.65 to 933.54, and
the NYSE composite index fell 8.83 to 483.79.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 25.66 to 1,598.52, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 5.92 to 646.15.
</P>
<P>
With no major news to explain today's jitters, analysts
attributed most of the selling to fears the markets had rallied
too enthusiastically last month over the prospects for slow-growth
and tame inflation.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
rose as high as 6.66 percent before settling at about 6.63
percent, up from late Thursday's 6.53 percent and the highest
finish since early July.

<HEADLINE> US Condemns Israel-Lebanon Border Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
condemned cross-border rocket attacks between Lebanon and Israel
and urged all sides to exercise "maximum restraint" in ending the
violence.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn such attacks and we are concerned this could lead
to an escalation of violence," State Department spokesman James
Rubin said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, rockets fired from Lebanon slammed into a town
in northern Israel while Israeli warplanes retaliated by rocketing
guerrilla targets south of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the attacks had violated an agreement arranged last
year by the United States to stop attacks on civilians on both
sides, and Washington was contacting all parties concerned
directly so that "maximum restraint" could be held.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington had told Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the
Hezbollah via Lebanon that "this is no time for escalation, this
is no time to see civilians suffer."

<HEADLINE> Greece: Turkish Actions Not to Contribute to its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece warned today that the
recent actions made by Turkey would affect its European
orientation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today, Greek Foreign Undersecretary
Yiannos Kranidiotis said that statements such as those recently
made by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and the signing of the
cooperation agreement between Turkey and northern Cyprus did not
contribute to improving the climate between Greece and Turkey and
did not help resolve problems.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the claim by Yilmaz that international law
could not be applied to the Aegean Sea, and the agreement signed
between Turkey and northern Cyprus which provides for their
partial integration.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government condemns these actions and warns Turkey
that such moves block its path to Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the policy on Cyprus' accession to the
European Union (EU) would continue without deviation because this
course would help resolve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened it will unite with northern Cyprus if the
Cyprus government begins membership talks with the EU. The
organization has invited Cyprus to begin accession talks early
next year.
</P>
<P>
Greece had protested Turkey's recent actions at the United
Nations as well as to the EU, he said, adding that Athens would
raise the issue within the framework of the community in the next
few days.

<HEADLINE> US Excavates War Remains in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States, under the
help of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has
recovered the remains of four American soldiers, killed in the
Korean War, the U.S. Defense Department said today.
</P>
<P>
This was the second joint operation, "which we've done with
North Korea since an agreement was reached with them last year,"
Deputy Director of the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel
Office Alan Liotta told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The first joint operation was done last year, which resulted in
the recovery of the remains of one U.S. soldier, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liotta said there will two more operations scheduled for later
this year to try to find the remains of U.S. soldiers unaccounted
for during the Korean War, which amounted to more than 8,100.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the battlefield excavation, U.S. officials were
also allowed to do joint archival research with DPRK officials in
their military war records, Liotta said.
</P>
<P>
That will help "get additional archival information, which can
help lead to answers involving the United States' unaccounted-for,
he said.

<HEADLINE> EU to Restore Contact With Bosnian Ambassadors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today called
its member states to restore contacts with ambassadors from
Bosnia-Herzegovina after the former Yugoslav republic agreed to
nominate its foreign service corps in accordance with the Sintra
accord.
</P>
<P>
The accord stipulated that Bosnia nominate its ambassadors by
common agreement among its Muslim, Serb and Croat population.
</P>
<P>
The EU suggested Tuesday that its member countries suspend
contacts with Bosnian ambassadors in protest against its
non-respect for the deadline concerning the nomination of its
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia nominated all its ambassadors from the Muslim section of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was proposed by EU High Representative for
Bosnia-Herzegovina Carlos Westendorp upon whose recommendation
the EU made the new suggestion of restoration.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg, now serving the six-month rotating presidency of
the 15-nation union, notified EU members about the decision.
A copy of the notification was received here late today.

<HEADLINE> 12 Injured After Jetliner's Aborted Takeoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 8 (Xinhua) -- Twelve people were injured
when the pilot of a Delta Air Lines jetliner carrying 316 people
aborted a takeoff at Honolulu International Airport today after
seeing flames, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The plane came to a stop near the end of the runway just in
time at about 4 p.m. Thursday and the passengers slid down the
emergency chutes to escape.
</P>
<P>
Some of the passengers were injured, including one who suffered
a broken ankle, one who suffered a sprained back and 10 who
suffered smoke inhalation.
</P>

the pilot decided to return to the terminal.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration officials said the cause
of the fire was under investigation. But reports said it
apparently caused by one of the the engines of the L-1011 that
caught fire.
