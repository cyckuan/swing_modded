<HEADLINE> World Economic Forum to Launch New Global Visual Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Economic Forum (WEF)
will launch its new global visual network on February 3 in Davos,
Switzerland, the WEF said today.
</P>
<P>
The network, named WELCOM -- World Electronic Community, is
developed by the WEF to provide for the first time its community
of global leaders from business, government and academia with a
"secure, private, high-level and reliable" global visual
communications network, the WEF said.
</P>
<P>
"Having had the vision of an electronic community over 10 years
ago, I now look forward to bring the many members of the Davos
community closer on this new unique hotline of global decision
makers," said Klaus Schwab, WEF's founder and President.
</P>
<P>
"WELCOM transcends the barriers of space and time and allows
members to hold visual and interactive sessions at any time during
the year from wherever they are in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new system is said to enable WEF members to open up new
business opportunities, facilitate expanded commerce, joint
ventures and strategic alliances, and enhance global business and
government understanding.
</P>
<P>
"The central theme this year at Davos is 'Building the Network
Society'," Schwab said, "and WELCOM is a direct reflection of the
Forum's commitment to enable its members to positively shape the
direction and influence the impact of this rapidly emerging
society on a global basis."
</P>
<P>
Some of the services WELCOM offers are multi-point
video-conferencing both with WELCOM and non-WELCOM members, a
24-hour multilingual concierge service, crisis management support,
direct face-to-face counseling with world experts and
organizations such as the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Recommends Flexible Anti-Dumping Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) could
be more flexible in the way it accepts minimum price undertakings
from central and eastern European companies facing anti-dumping
investigations.
</P>
<P>
The point was made today by EU trade commissioner Sir Leon
Brittan, speaking at an anti-dumping seminar in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The trade commissioner said the EU should consider letting
involved companies determine the exact prices at which they sold
in different EU markets, rather than imposing a fixed EU-wide
minimum price as a way to avoid dumping.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon also recommended that eastern European industries be
encouraged to adopt Western pricing and marketing techniques,
through the transfer of know-how and closer ties between trade
associations, in order to reduce the need for anti-dumping action.
</P>
<P>
He said fears of EU anti-dumping policy were greatly
exaggerated in eastern Europe, where only 0.28 percent of their
exports to the EU were affected.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, he added, western European companies had boosted
their exports by 464 percent between 1990 and 1995, and had little
to fear from increased competition from eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Needs 27 Billion Cubic Meters of Natural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Energy and Natural
Resources Minister Recai Kutan has said that Turkey will need 27
billion cubic meters of natural gas in the year 2000, a
considerable increase from the current 8 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency today quoted Kutan as
saying that energy is the number one problem for the Turkish
industry and Turkey gains 58 percent of the whole energy it
needs from abroad and 42 percent from itself.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present, Turkey purchases 6 billion out
of 8 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia and 2
billion from Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has signed agreements with Iran, Egypt, Yemen,
Turkmenistan, Algeria and Nigeria on natural gas purchases.
</P>
<P>
Pipelines will be built to transport the natural gas from Iran
and Turkmenistan, said Kutan. The construction of the pipeline
between Iran and Turkey would begin in March this year and the
natural gas from Iran would reach Erzurum, eastern Turkey, within
one year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Iran signed a 20-billion-dollar gas deal during
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's visit last August.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Turkey will import natural gas for 22
years beginning from 1999.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Exploded Bombs Over Canada, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. bomber crews have twice
exploded empty nuclear bombs over Canadian territory, according to
a new study by a Canadian military historian.
</P>
<P>
The bombs were dumped and detonated in separate incidents in
1950 after U.S. strategic bombers encountered mechanical problems,
one off British Columbia, the other over Quebec.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear materials had been removed from the bombs' cores so
the blasts were non-nuclear, relying instead on the powerful
chemical explosives in the bombs, said author John Clearwater.
</P>
<P>
Neverthelsss, each blast dispersed about 45 kilograms of
uranium into the atmosphere, he was quoted as saying by reports
today.
</P>
<P>
The first incident occurred on February 13, 1950, when a B-36
bomber lost three of its six engines en route from Fairbanks,
Alaska, to Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
The crew, following standard procedure for such emergencies,
released its nuclear bomb and detonated it at about 1,000 meters
over the Pacific Ocean, off Vancouver Island. The plane crashed
into a mountain side and five of the 17 people on board lost their
lives.
</P>
<P>
The atomic bomb, either a Mark III or Mark IV, used a
conventional high explosive to trigger nuclear fission but the
plutonium core had been removed for safety. Yet, a casing of
uranium remained in place.
</P>
<P>
A second and more serious incident occurred on November 10,
1950 when a four-engine U.S. B-50 bomber carrying a Mark IV bomb
from a military exercise in Goose Bay, Newfoundland, to its home
base in Tucson, Arizona, ran into engine trouble over the
St. Lawrence River.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, also without its essential plutonium core, was
detonated near Riviere-du-Loup, Quebec, at about 760 meters. The
blast of 2.2 tonnes of high explosives shook the ground and
scattered 45 kilograms of uranium.
</P>
<P>
The B-50 bomber later landed safely at a Maine air base, and
the U.S. Air Force covered up the incident by saying a load of
500-pound conventional practice bombs have been jettisoned.
</P>
<P>
The order to detonate whenever aircraft developed problems was
intended to safeguard nuclear-bomb design secrets, surviving
crewmembers told the author.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Canadian Defense Department has declined to confirm
the two incidents, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> US Plans to Capture Bosnian Indicted War Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is
altering its policy on Bosnia, seriously considering capturing
indicted war criminals.
</P>
<P>
A New York Times report today said that Washington has begun
altering its strategy by supporting opponents of Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic and looking past Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman to identify a new generation of leaders.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60,000 troops led by the U.S. were sent to Bosnia after
the signing of the Dayton accord that ended the war in Bosnia
one year ago.
</P>
<P>
To protect the troops, the Clinton administration chose not to
hunt down accused criminals.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the earth has shifted in the former Yugoslavia," the
U.S. newspaper said. The U.S. government is seriously considering
plans for commandos to capture some accused war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Roughly 70 people in Bosnia, including the retired Bosnian
Serbian leaders like Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, were
indicted on charges of war crimes by the international tribunal
in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbian authorities have repeatedly rejected
putting Karadzic and Mladic on trial.

ISLAMABAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Afghan northern warlord
Rashid Dostum today destroyed a strategic highway leading to the
northern Afghanistan in an attempt to stop advances by the Taliban
militia, according to reports reaching here this evening from
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Salang Highway, about 105 kilometers north of Kabul, is
destroyed, a Taliban frontline commander was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This will only cause problems for the civilians. We will

The Islamic student militia, obviously buoyed with recent

No ceasefire could be observed unless its opponents give up

There was no immediate reaction from the opposition alliance,

LISBON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, met Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio today.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central

traditional friendship, and relations between the two countries
have developed smoothly since they established diplomatic ties in
1979.
</P>
<P>
A friendly Sino-Portuguese relationship was crucial not only
for peoples of the two countries but also world peace as a whole,
Hu said. He expressed hope of further strengthening such a healthy
relationship on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio agreed and said if there were no participation by
China, it would be impossible to talk about world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his appreciation for China's support
for Portugal's application for the non-permanent membership of the
United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his country's backing for China's admission into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
As for the Macao issue, Sampaio said he hoped the two countries
would continue to enhance trust and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio is expected to visit China next month.

<HEADLINE> US Existing Home Sales Hit Record High in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes in
the U.S. totaled a record 4.09 million in 1996 despite the
slowdown at the end of the year, the U.S. National Association of
Realtors reported today.
</P>
<P>
The association said that sales of previously owned
single-family homes increased by 7.5 percent last year and broke
the previous record of 3.99 million set in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Each of the four regions in the U.S. saw an increase in the sale
last year. Sales jumped by 13.2 percent in the West and were up by
6.6 percent in the Northeast, 6.1 percent in the South and 5.5
percent in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the robust activity to low mortgage rates
and an economy that boosted job and income growth.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.6 percent in
December, down slightly from 7.62 percent in November but up from
7.2 percent a year earlier. However, they were much lower than the
the rate of 9.15 percent in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the sales of existing homes in December fell by 3.5 percent
to 3.87 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, from 4.01
million a month earlier, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales dropped by 7.7 percent in the West, 4.1
percent in the South and 3.8 percent in the Midwest. The sales in
the Northeast increased by 5.1 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Housing analysts have predicted that the housing market
this year will continue its slowdown beginning from the second
half of last year but remain healthy.

HARARE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Board
Director Rodney Luwaca today said Zimbabwe last year experienced a 20

</P>
<P>
Luwaca told participants at the launch of the 1997 road safety

of last year, 2,202 were caused by pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
''From 863 fatalities during the nine months under review, 304
were pedestrians and this means pedestrian accidents contributed 26
percent of serious injuries over the past nine months and 36 percent
of total fatalities,'' said Luwaca.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Republic Police Deputy Commissioner Enock Ngenya said
while the emphasis of the campaign was directed towards pedestrian
behaviour, motorists should also honour their responsibilities

CNMH's parent company China National Nonferrous Metals Industry
Corporation (CNNC).
</P>
<P>
The Int'l Copper Industry share, valued at RMB 500 million

Copper Mine, Yongping Copper Mine and Guixi Smelter -- into JCC
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
CNMH Vice Chairman and Managing Director Fang Dacheng said:
"JCC Ltd. will seek a Hong Kong listing, making it the first
Chinese nonferrous metals industrial cooperation to be floated
overseas.
</P>
<P>
"It represents a planned measure by CNNC to restructure and
modernize its subsidiaries following its own securitisation. It
also symbolizes the move overseas by high quality Chinese
corporation to achieve globalisation."
</P>
<P>
JCC General Manager He Changming said that the three projects
that JCC is injecting into the company are among the best and most
promising copper projects in China.

ATHENS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Four armed men burst into a post
office in the Athens suburb of Vyronas this morning and made off
with 95 million drachmas (about 400,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to police, three of the men, wearing masks and armed
with rifles, broke into the post office by prizing open the rear
door with a metal bar.
</P>
<P>
After immobilizing staff and customers, two of the robbers went
to the basement where the money was kept, leaving the third man on
the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
A fourth robber, armed with an automatic weapon and without a
mask, stood guard at the main entrance to the post office.
</P>
<P>
As soon as they had gathered the money, the three masked
robbers sped off in a van, while the fourth left on foot. The van
was later found abandoned at a short distance from the post
office.
</P>
<P>
The stolen money had been delivered to the post office shortly
before the robbery and was to have been used to pay pensions in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Athens has witnessed a rise in armed robbery in the past year
and the country's Public Order Minister George Romaios said last

<HEADLINE> PC Industry Worldwide Continues Strong Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Last year saw continued strong
growth of the personal computer industry worldwide with the
industry shipping 70.9 million machines, up 17.8 percent from 1995
shipments of 60.2 million machines.
</P>
<P>
The figures were contained in a market research report published
today by Dataquest, a subsidiary of the Gartner Group.
</P>
<P>
The Compaq Computer Corporation, the world's largest maker of
personal computer, shipped 7.1 million computers in 1996, giving
it 10.1 percent of the world market and worldwide growth of 18.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
International Business Machine Corporation, the world's second
largest personal computer maker, grew even faster than Compaq, as
the number of systems it shipped rose to 6.09 million from 4.7
million, a 27.9 percent growth rate. The corporation commands 8.6
percent of the world's market, up 7.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard &AMP; Company, which is now the fifth largest maker
of personal computer, grew more than 30 percent in every region of
the world.
</P>
<P>
However, Apple Computer, now the fourth largest PC maker, lost
almost 22 percent of its market share, which fell to 5.2 percent.
Also losing market share last year was Packard Bell NEC INC.,
which shipped 4.3 million computers globally in 1996, down from
4.5 million in 1995. The company's market share slipped 6.1
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that despite the growth of big computer
makers globally last year, the group lost the ground as a whole.
The number of computer shipped by those companies not among the
top computer makers rose from 38.1 million to 46.7 million in
1996.

<HEADLINE> UK Defense Ministry Pressed to Lease US Transport Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Air Force (RAF) is
pushing the Ministry of Defense to lease six C-17 U.S. transport
aircraft in a bid to help move heavy equipment for the country's
rapid development force.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that McDonnell Douglas, the American
manufacturer of the new-designed C-17 planes, had submitted an
informal proposal to the British side on the costs of leasing the
aircraft, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
However, the British defense leaders were unlikely to make any
early decision on its future military transporter needs until
later in the year when the future of the European Future Large
Aircraft (FLA) becomes clearer.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany are discussing how to finance the
5-billion-dollar development cost of the FLA project, which is
smaller than the C-17 and powered by slower turbo-prop engines,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the British government decided to join Franco-German
program, but the project has since run into difficulties because
of cuts in the French and German defense budgets.
</P>
<P>
The RAF, which has never wanted the FLA, is lobbying hard to
buy a small number of C-17 transport planes, as well as replacing
its smaller Hercules transporters with a new version of the
Lockheed C-130J Hercules.
</P>
<P>
If the European FLA project cannot meet the timetable or
finally collapses, serious considerations may be given to the C-17
transporters, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Global Environment Continues to Degrade: UNEP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The global environment
continued to degrade in the last decade with key environmental
problems deeply embedded in the socio-economic fabric of nations
in all the regions, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP)
warned today.
</P>
<P>
Human use and pollution of water, soils, forests, fisheries
and urban air are depleting renewable resources faster than they
can naturally recover, said the Global Environment Outlook issued
by UNEP here today.
</P>
<P>
"If we allow the trends to continue, we will ultimately run
out of the essential ingredients for life on this planet... It
is clear we are on an unsustainable trajectory," UNEP Executive
Director Elizabeth Dowdeswell said at the launch of the report.
</P>
<P>
The report, the first of a series of reports on the global
environment that will be published by UNEP on a biennial basis,
was released on the first day of the two-week 19th Session of the
UNEP Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will discuss energy efficiency and renewable energy
resources, appropriate and enviromentally sound technologies,
hazardous chemicals and global action on fresh water.
</P>
<P>
Half a billion hectares of land in Africa, where food security
and poverty alleviation are priorities, is moderately to severely
degraded, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Some 47 percent of Latin Aferica's grazing land have lost
their fertility as a result of erosion, overgrazing, salinization
and alkalinization, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The world's forests and wooded land fell by some two percent
over the past 10 years and natural forest cover in the developing
world declined by eight percent.
</P>
<P>
African forests are the most depleted in all the tropical
regions, with only 30 percent of historical stands remaining,
while Asian timber reserves may last for no more than a further
40 years, said the report.
</P>
<P>
On water supply, as many as 25,000 people die every day due to
poor water quality. Some 1.7 billion people, more than one
third of the world's population, are without a supplly of safe
water, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that one quarter of the world's population
will suffer from chronic water shortages in the beginning of the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Africa has 19 of the 25 countries that have the
highest percentage of populations without access to safe drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the world's coastal regions, where some 60
percent of the global population live in, are at the high risk of
degradation, particularly from land-based activities.
</P>
<P>
European coasts are the worst affected, with some 80 percent
at risk, followed by Asia and the Pacific, with 70 percent at
risk, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Acid rain and transboundary air pollution, once considered a
problem only in Europe and parts of North America, are now
increasingly apparent in parts of Asia and the Pacific and Latin
America, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly rising demand for energy to fuel economic
development will aggravate these problems, particularly in Asia
and the Pacific, where a 100-percent hike in energy use is
predicted for the period 1990-2010, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
"Current patterns of energy use require drastic changes,
because of their destructive impacts on land and natural
resources, climate air quality, rural and urban settlements, and
human health and well-being," the report urged.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Dairibord to Be Privatised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Dairibord Zimbabwe Limited
(DZL) will be listed in the stock market by April this year, a
move which marks the beginning of the privatisation of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Zimbabwean Agriculture Minister Denis
Norman here today. Dairibord, together with the Cotton Company,
both commercialised three years ago, are the two former
parastatals earmarked for privatisation this year.
</P>
<P>
Norman said the government approved the privatisation of DZL
and the Cotton Company last year in a bid to enhance performance,
increase profitability and give the companies more autonomy in
decision making,
</P>
<P>
As part of its indigenization program, the government also set
aside 20 million U.S. Dollars this year for establishing the
Zimbabwe Investment Trust, which is supposed to warehouse shares
in privatized public companies until black entrepreneurs are
ready to acquire them.

<HEADLINE> Average Incomes in Canada Drop Slightly in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The average incomes in Canada
dropped slightly in 1995, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
The average Canadians working full-time in 1995 earned less
than the year before, with incomes falling by 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The federal agency said men working full-time earned 30,051
U.S. dollars in 1995, down by 2.4 percent, offsetting gains they
made in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The decreases in men's earnings were especially noticeable in
higher wage occupation groups such as managerial, administrative,
medical, and social and natural sciences.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, women who worked full-time recorded average
earnings of 21,970 dollars, up 2.2 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
The increase of women's earnings was noted in the managerial
and administrative, medicine and health, social and natural
sciences occupations, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
However, women earned on average 73 cents for each dollar
earned by men, which is up from 70 cents the year before.
</P>
<P>
The earnings ratio of women to men has tended to move upward
since data were first collected in 1967, when the figure was 58.4
cents for women for every dollar earned by men, the agency noted.

<HEADLINE> Waterlogging Reduces Zimbabwe's Tobacco Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's potential tobacco
yield, expected to top 240 million kg in the 1996-97 fiscal year,
has been reduced by between 10 and 12 percent, because of
waterlogging, Agriculture Minister Denis Norman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Norman said continuous rainfall was causing soil leaching and
waterlogging in many parts of the country and beginning to affect
the production of tobacco, which is Zimbabwe's major foreigh
exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
"We are getting reports of waterlogging and this is pushing
hard the security measures farmers have to use to maintain high
quality, especially at the curing stage," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Potential yield has already been reduced by 10 and 12 percent
of what could have been achieved and there is nothing much the
commercial sector or small-scale farmers can do," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Seize Large Quantity of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police seized 84
kilograms of hashish in recent operations against drug traffickers
in Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency report today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a statement issued by the Istanbul Security
Directorate as saying that the Turkish police had seized 76
kilograms of hashish, 309 grams of cocaine and seven grams of
heroin in two different operations in Istanbul in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the police had also detained 12 people
suspected of being involved in the drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Turkish police seized eight
kilograms of hashish in Diyarbakir, center of southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a strongly-worded statement issued by Turkey's
Foreign Ministry denounced the allegations from the western
countries that some Turkish government officials had been involved
in illegal drug dealings.
</P>
<P>
The charge made by Britain and France followed allegations by
German Judge Rolf Schwalbe in the Frankfurt State Court that
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller
was in personal contact with known Turkish drug smuggling
families.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel today told
reporters at a weekly press conference that German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel phoned Ciller Sunday night and expressed
his regret over the latest developments in the relations
between Germany and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Tuncay Yilmaz, an official of the Turkish Security
Directorate-General, said here today that the Turkish police
seized 4.422 tonnes of heroin in 1996, accounting for 40 percent
of the world's total haul, and 12.294 tonnes of hashish, 233
kilograms of opium, 13 kilograms of cocaine and 1,157 kilograms
of base morphine.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Economy to Grow 5 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Central Bank of
Iran (CBI) Mohsen Nourbakhsh said today the growth rate of Iran's
gross domestic product (GDP) would reach 5 percent in the
current fiscal year, which will end on March 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The governor made the prediction at a press conference to local
press. He said this will be a 4.5 percent increase over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the retail price index stood at 18.1 percent in
the past nine months, whereas the inflation rate jumped up to 56
percent last year over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The governor predicted that the inflation rate of the current
year is expected to stand at 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
On oil export revenue, he said, Iran has earned 15.06 billion
U.S. dollars from oil exports in the past 10 months, 2.7 billion
dollars more than the figure envisaged in the current year's
budget.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Iran is expected to earn a total of 19 billion
U.S. dollars from oil exports during the current fiscal year, 3
billion dollars more than the pre-set target.
</P>
<P>
The higher oil export revenue would greatly relieve Iran's
economic crisis and enhance Iran's foreign debt service
capability.
</P>
<P>
The CBI chief said that Iranian foreign debts stood at 19.55
billion dollars until the end of 1996, 10 billion dollars of
which were rescheduled debts.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's total foreign commitments would reach 2
billion dollars by the end of the Second Five-Year Development
Plan (1995-1999) and the CBI would handle repayment of foreign
debts in a way that 8 billion dollars of debts would be repaid
during the five-year period.
</P>
<P>
Nourbakhsh said Iran would repay 3.7 billion dollars in 1997,
3.3 billion dollars in 1998 and 1.9 billion dollars in 1999 and
182 million dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic sanction by the United States, he said,
Iran has received credits of 5 billion dollars since the
beginning of the past fiscal year and is working to obtain
another 2.7 billion dollars worth of new credit for different
projects.
</P>
<P>
He said 2.4 billion dollars of the credit was spent on 50
development projects.
</P>
<P>
Iran's foreign currency reserves in the past 10 months
increased by 2.2 billion dollars compared with the same period in
the preceding year. Iranian hard currency reserves are strong enough
to finance whole imports of next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
On attracting foreign investment, he said, the government has
planned to attract foreign investment because it raises
employment and revenues and that foreign investment in Iran has
amounted to 1.2 billion dollars in the past six months.

<HEADLINE> Irrigation Farming Urged in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister for
Agriculture and Cooperativee Paul Kimiti called today for more
irrigation farming so as to boost food production.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation will upgrade food supply in quantity and quality in
the eastern African country which enjoys more than one million
hectares of potential area for irrigation farming, Kimiti said at
a seminar on irrigation and modern techniques in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The output of grain, vegetables, flower and other cash crops
will increase to meet the demand from local use and export and
enhance food security by spreading irrigation farming, said
Kimiti in the two-day seminar starting today.
</P>
<P>
However, there are only 150,000 hectares is under proper
irrigation in the country, Kimiti told over 130 participants
including the regional and district commissioners and other
government and private company officials.
</P>
<P>
Among them only 33,050 hectares have so far been covered by
modern irrigation schemes in the country and some 100,000
Tanzanian farm families now till lands with the traditional
irrigation system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kimiti also called on foreigners to assist or invest in
Tanzania to develop modern irrigation farming.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and a
local Israel firm called Tanzania Transcontinental Trading
Company. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israel Optimistic About Resuming Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today said that he believed the peace talks
with Syria would be resumed in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a special debate held at the Knesset(parliament),
Netanyahu said efforts were under way to find a formula on
resuming the stalled talks with Syria and it would be soon
known that if there was such possibility.
</P>
<P>
Saying he was pleased to hear that Syrian President Hafez
Assad viewed the prospects of peace more important for Syria
than for Israel, Netanyahu expressed hope that the talks would
be resumed with good will on both sides and with the help
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Foreign Minister David Levy voiced the same optimism
while attending the meeting of Knesset Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee. He said Israel had sent a peace message
to Syria, and believed a bridging formula would be found
soon to revive the stalled talks.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Israel would only honor the signed
agreements by the previous Labor government instead of informal
understandings.
</P>
<P>
Israeli leaders made the remarks when the European Union
peace envoy Miguel Angle Moratinos traveled today to Damascus
to explore ways of bringing the two sides back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The State-run Israel Radio reported that Moratinos brought a
message from Israeli government on the basis for resuming
talks: Israel would accept that the United Nations Resolutions
242 and 338 which called for trading land for peace will
apply to the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition Members of Knesset (MK) also believed that
the Israeli-Syrian talks could be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
Labor MK Ori Orr said he was sure the talks would
restart soon. "After I listened carefully to David Levy, I
believed they will find a solution to open the peace door
that leads to negotiations with Syria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another opposition MK Meretz leader Yosi Sarid urged the
government to state publicly that the UN Resolution 242 will
apply to the Golan Heights. He noted that Likud officials
had stated in the past that the UN resolutions only applied
to the Sinai Peninsular, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, so
the government had to make a public statement on this
matter.
</P>
<P>
Following the Hebron redeployment which was completed early
this month, Israel has now shifted its attention to the
Syrian talks that broke off last March.
</P>
<P>
Syria is insisting that the talks should be resumed on
the basis of the "land-for-peace" formula and on the informal
understanding it reached with Israel's previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Under the understanding, Israel pledged to withdraw troops
from the occupied Golan Heights in return for Syria's agreeing
to seal a peace pact with Israel.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel is keen to assist
Tanzania in the floricultural sector with an aim to help Tanzania
become one of the leading flower exporters in the world, Israel's
Ambassador to Tanzania Menashe Zipori said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has immense potential in the field, Zipori said at a
two-day seminar.
</P>
<P>

Tanzania's horticultural industry, which is still practised on a
small-scale basis in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
Israel is ready to help Tanzania strengthen irrigation
farming, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Irrigation farming does not raise production only but also
guarantees a steady income to peasants. Therefore, Israel is also
ready to share her know-how in this field," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which will end tomorrow, has been organized by
Tanzania' Ministry of Agriculture and a local Israel firm called
Tanzania Transcontinental Trading Company. enditem

<HEADLINE> Sudan Urges International Help to Stop Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government appealed
to the UN Security Council and the international community to
stop the "Ethiopian violations" of territories in eastern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement said today that the invading
Ethiopian forces captured 160 students as well 15 teachers.
</P>
<P>
The statement, released by the Sudanese embassy here, said that
information has confirmed the deaths of Ismael Mahmoud, secretary
of the National Council in Kurmuk and Rabie Ahmad, head of the
local council a week after they fell in the hands of the Ethiopian
forces. But the fate of Kurmuk Governor Yaacob Hussein is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
The ministry called for investigation into the crimes committed
by the invading forces and working for the immediate release of
the captives.
</P>
<P>
Sudan accused Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda of behind the
attacks launched by Sudanese rebels along its borders, but these
countries have denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa today blamed
the Sudanese government for the turmoils in the country and
reaffirmed that Egypt will not favor any party involved in the
clashes.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Arabic daily "al Hayat," he urged Khartoum
to change its policies which "stirred the neighboring countries
and led to the division of the Sudanese people."
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt wants to help Sudan but its support for any
party would mean an intervention in its domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Moussa excluded the holding of an Arab summit at present to
solve the crisis in Sudan noting that there is no reason for
holding this summit.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said recently that the latest
development in Sudan is its domestic affairs and there is not
evidence of involvement of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Egypt objects to
the division of Sudan and supports its sovereignty and integrity,
he said.
</P>
<P>
A coalition of northern and southern opposition forces began
attacking Sudanese army units along the eastern border of the
country nearly two weeks ago in what they say is a bid to pressure
the Sudanese government and pave the way for a popular uprising.
</P>
<P>
Sudan said Sunday it had attacked a rebel base near the
southern border with Uganda, opening another front in the war
against rebels.
</P>
<P>
Rebels and the government have previously reported clashes
further to the north near the Ethiopian and Eritrean borders.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Concerned Over Israeli Efforts to Grip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa today expressed his concern over Israel's stepped-up
efforts to tighten its grip over East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks after Israel decided Sunday to allocate
39 million U.S. dollars to strengthen its hold over Eastern
Jerusalem, where the Palestinians hope to establish the capital of
their future state.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli government statement said the funds would be used to
improve infrastructure in East Jerusalem, which Israel says is an
eternal and inseparable part of its capital.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Israeli move, Moussa said these changes will
have an adverse bearing on the situation which started to improve
after the two sides clinched the executive protocol of the Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, which sides with the Palestinians in their cause, is
following this "critical" issue, which is supposed to be raised
during the final stage of negotiations between the Palestinians
and the Israelis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Moussa told the Egyptian MENA news agency that the
honest implementation of the Hebron deal, concluded recently
between the Palestinian Authority and Israel on Israeli troop
pullback from 80 percent of the West Bank city Hebron, would help
Arabs restore trust in the Israeli intention regarding peace.
</P>
<P>
"Hebron deal could be the springboard for solving other stalled
issues between the Palestinians and the Israelis, namely, the
status of the rest of the occupied territories, Jerusalem and the
Palestinian refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Arab coordination in the light of the present contacts,
Moussa said any consultations with any Arab party is beneficial.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian envoys were sent to Damascus and Tel Aviv to try to
bring the two countries' viewpoints closer, according to the top
Egyptian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first country to make peace with Israel, backs the
Syrian demand that Israel should swap the occupied Golan Heights
in return for a peace treaty and the normalization of ties with
Syria.

<HEADLINE> British Military Exercise Goes Ahead Despite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A British military exercise
in the environmentally fragile area of Akamas on the western
part of Cyprus went ahead today after two hour delay,
despite a protest by Cypriot environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British bases said this afternoon that
the exercise was delayed for about two hours because of the
demonstration, but went ahead with the use of live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The week long exercise was scheduled to begin Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Cypriot police apprehended 12 protesters,
who tried to prevent British soldiers from entering the area
where the military exercise is scheduled to begin.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were released later without being charged.
</P>
<P>
In Nicosia, members of environmental organizations staged this
afternoon a sit-in in town center, in support to their colleagues
who have remained in Akamas and to protest Cyprus police efforts
to end their demonstration in the area.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said today that the
Cyprus government agrees with a House of Representatives
decision against British Bases military exercises in the
environmentally sensitive Akamas region, but believes it has a
contractual obligation to let them go ahead.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Foreign Ministry has been discussing the
issue with the sovereign British bases in Cyprus, in order to
decide on another area for British military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the House of Representatives issued a
statement calling on the government to take measures to stop
the British military exercises in Akamas, which was described as
"utmost ecological importance and rare beauty".
</P>
<P>
Britain retains two military bases on the island since
Cyprus gained its independence from British colonial rule in
1960, and has the right to use designated areas, including
part of Akamas, to carry out military exercises.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Scarcity in Lagos to Be Relieved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The fuel scarcity hitting
Nigeria's largest city Lagos last week is to ease from Tuesday,
the Nigerian TV Authority reported today.
</P>
<P>
As many as 62 million liters of oil have arrived here from
Harcourt Port and is expected to enter the market by Tuesday,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the largest oil producer in Africa which daily
produces some two million barrels of oil, has to import a large
sum of finished oil products due to its poor refinery industry.
</P>
<P>
The fuel crisis in Lagos is said to be caused by disagreements
on credit arrangement between fuel dealers and the Nigeria
National Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The scarcity has forced most of the city's numerous gas
stations out of business and thus caused a chaos in the public
transport sector, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Many commuters were stranded at bus-stops today and some bus
drivers have taken the chance to raise their fares, the report
said. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Prime Minister Reiterates on May Poll Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major reiterated today that the Conservative Government intends to
continue in office until May 1.
</P>
<P>
Conservative Party sources said Major reiterated the date at
the start of a cabinet meeting at his country home Chequers to
consider proposals for the party's election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
One of the sources said: "We have a five-year mandate and we
intend to plan on the basis of completing that mandate."
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives won a fourth consecutive general election
victory in April 1992, but are allowed to delay a poll until May
this year.
</P>
<P>
On the manifesto itself, Party chairman Brian Mawhinney told
BBC: "I think you will see a manifesto that is full of exciting
ideas, that is a people-centered manifesto and that carries forward
the opportunity revolution this government has put in place."
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure this country becomes the enterprise
center of Europe. We want to develop, build on what we have
already put in place," Mawhinney added.
</P>
<P>
British media speculated that substantial programs to boost
enterprise through cutting business rates and red tape for small
firms and to increase choice in education will be the main theme
in the manifesto.
</P>
<P>
A pledge to sell the London Underground is expected to be the
most eye-catching of a new wave of privatizations to be announced.
The Post Office will be given greater commercial freedom and could
also be sold as expected.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls have shown the Conservatives trailing some
20 points behind the opposition Labor Party. Critics say the
Conservatives have run out of ideas after almost l8 years in power
and it is time for a change.

ANKARA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller left here this evening for Rome
for a meeting with her European Union (EU) counterparts to discuss
ties between Turkey and the EU.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting scheduled for Wednesday, Ciller is expected to
call on EU countries not to exclude Turkey from the EU expansion
process.
</P>
<P>
She will also reiterate Turkey's demand for an immediate

</P>
<P>
Ciller, also chairwoman of the True Path Party, will express
Turkey's serious concern over the Cyprus government's purchase of
Russian-made anti-aircraft S-300 missiles, which has fueled
tension on the divided Mediterranean island recently.
</P>
<P>
Although some EU countries have voiced their support for
Turkey's bid for the EU membership, Turkey is still kept
outside the European body due to some controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts, however, said that the Rome meeting would
be a turning point in the Turkey-EU relations if Ankara could
convince Europe that it was preparing serious reforms in certain
areas.
</P>
<P>
During her three-day stay in Rome, Ciller is also expected
to discuss Turkish-Italian relations with Italian leaders.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Send Out Teams to Promote Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt, haunted by an
ever-widening trade deficit, plans to send delegations to the
United States, Canada, the Gulf states and Africa in March to
promote its flagging exports.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Exports Promotion Center Hamdy Salem
told the Egyptian MENA news agency that while maintaining
traditional markets, the center will give priority to opening new
markets for Egyptian products.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait will be foremost among the countries to
be visited by the Egyptian export promotion delegations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The European markets will also become a focus of its selling
pitch, in addition to the American market.
</P>
<P>
Besides promoting Egyptian products abroad, the Center makes
arrangements for foreign importers to meet with Egyptian
businessmen and to visit factories and companies in Egypt, he said.
</P>
<P>
The decision is largely fueled by Egypt's plan to augment
exports by an annual rate of 10 percent in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Egypt's trade deficit reached 28 billion Egyptian
pounds (about 8.235 billion dollars), with its import bill amounted
to 40 billion pounds (about 11.764 billion U.S. dollars) against an
export value of mere 12 billion pounds (about 3.529 billion
dollars). The volume of import increases by about 12 percent a
year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies Purchase of Russian Tor-M1 Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Minister of Defense
Costas Eliades today denied reports that Cyprus is planning to
buy Russian anti-missile and anti-aircraft system Tor-M1.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Cyprus News Agency, Eliades expressed surprise
with reports carried by the Russian news agency Itar-Tass which
said that Russia explores the possibility of selling to Cyprus
the Tor-M1.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister categorically denied that the Cyprus
government intends to purchase the Tor-M1, saying "we are not
interested" and added that such reports "create many questions."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on press reports coming from Moscow in the past
few days, Eliades expressed surprise that "information and
statements concerning the government's military program are made
public."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a contract with Russia on January 4 to buy
anti-aircraft S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
The deal has triggered criticism from the United States, and
Turkey has threatened that it will strike at the missiles if
they are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied the
northern third of the island following a short-live coup seeking
union with Greece by some Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Launches "Crusade" of Employment for Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today launched a "crusade" for increasing employment for the
country's youths, calling for "the mobilization by all means and in
all fields" to increase job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Chirac visited a computer training center for the youths,
l'Espace Cyber Jeunes, in Boulogne-Billancourt west of Paris, where
he called on all the French to use their imagination, provide ideas
and take actions to help the young people.
</P>
<P>
France's unemployment now stands at 12.6 percent, and is expected
to increase to 13 percent by the end of the year, according to
official statistics research institutions.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said in a television speech last month that he would make
1997 "the year of employment of the youths," after the Socialist
Party promised to increase 700,000 jobs in an electoral platform for
the 1998 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Local media said that with the 1998 legislative elections 13
months away, Chirac is beginning to take initiatives to prevent the
leftwing forces from winning the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French presidential office today denied rumors
that Chirac is speculating to reshuffle the cabinet of Prime
Minister Alain Juppe in perspective of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the French people now better understand the
way of social, economic and financial reforms initiated by Chirac
and carried out by Juppe, whose support rate has risen slightly,
according to a recent poll.

<HEADLINE> National Minimum Wage "Unnecessary": CBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's flexible labor market
is improving business productivity, with strong evidence of a firm
link between pay and performance, business leaders said today.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) used evidence
drawn from its pay data bank to reject any new "unnecessary" labor
market regulation, specifically citing Labor Party's plans to
introduce a national minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
In a special survey of a sample of more than 700 manufacturing
and service companies, covering almost one million employees in
the private sector, the CBI's study shows evidence of a strong
link between pay and performance.
</P>
<P>
Productivity and performance gains are now outpacing - or
increasing at the same rate as - pay rises for 90 percent of
companies in Britain, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
The CBI says that its analysis shows a strong correlation
between companies saying that greater labor flexibility is an
important source of productivity growth and those seeing
productivity rising more quickly than pay.
</P>
<P>
Companies saying the opposite show an equally strong link with
those with an unwillingness to shed labor.
</P>
<P>
The confederation says that its survey results are "a clear
indication that flexibility is working for business, and that any
unnecessary imposed regulation could result in barriers to further
economic growth".
</P>
<P>
Increased investment in new technology and plant and machinery,
though, is still seen as the best means of obtaining improved
productivity, the CBI says.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
sentenced five more members of the National League for Democracy
(NLD), a leading opposition group, and nine other people to
imprisonment for their involvement in a student unrest last
December.
</P>
<P>
However, say official sources, the sentencing authorities have
not yet disclosed how many years they are expected to stay in
prison.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with agitation and throwing rocks at the
security personnel during the unrest, the authorities said. They
added that none of those sentenced were students.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar government had earlier arrested 13 NLD members in the
wake of the student unrest. Six of them and 14 others were
sentenced to seven years imprisonment, according to earlier
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Students from some universities in Yangon staged demonstrations
in early December, last year, leading to suspension of classes in
the universities which were involved.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar government accused some groups in the country,
including the NLD, of inciting the demonstration.

<HEADLINE> Defeat on Schools Hits Tory Show of Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Conservative government
suffered a defeat by just one vote Monday night over an amendment
to the Education Bill, the first Commons defeat since parliament
returned.
</P>
<P>
The government's plan was to allow grant-maintained schools to
increase their provision by more than 50 percent. At the moment,
they cannot do this without the permission of the secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives were defeated by 273 votes to 272. The defeat
came shortly after the cabinet had returned from an all-day
strategy meeting at the prime minister's home Chequers.
</P>
<P>
The government's embarrassment was compounded when an analysis
of the voting showed that five cabinet ministers failed to take
part in the vote.
</P>
<P>
Conservative sources said that they had not expected Labor MPs
to turn out in force and one source admitted, "It was always going
to be difficult. We did not quite have the numbers because it was
a Monday and all out MPs were not back."
</P>
<P>
Labor was delighted at the success of its tactics which
resulted in the government's most serious reverse since losing its
overall Commons majority.
</P>
<P>
Labor deputy leader John Prescott said, "The government is in
complete disarray. The prime minister talks about carrying on
until May, yet it is clear that their grip on power is slipping."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to pile the pressure on the government
because the country needs and deserves a general election as soon
as possible."
</P>
<P>
Education Secretary Gillian Shephard was said to be "totally
disgusted" at Labor's move in attempting to block the expansion of
grant-maintained schools.
</P>
<P>
She accused Tony Blair, the Labor leader, and Harriet Harman,
the shadow social security secretary, of "hypocrisy" for sending
their children to grant-maintained schools but denying the choice
to other parents.
</P>
<P>
The government indicated that the bill would now be sent back
to the House of Lords where the amendment would be re-introduced.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK dignitaries Meet to Mark Jiang Zemin's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Dignitaries of various
sectors in Hong Kong gathered here today to mark the second
anniversary of Chinese president Jiang Zemin's speech on China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
The dignitaries noted that it is significant to review Jiang's
speech with eight propositions for the reunification of the
Chinese nation at the key phase for Hong Kong's returning to her
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zaiming, editor-in-chief of Wen Wei Po, said that Jiang
Zemin's eight propositions on the peaceful reunification of China
embodied Deng Xiaoping's concept of "One Country, Two Systems".
</P>
<P>
He said that the eight propositions represent the Chinese
Communist Party and the Chinese government's efforts to find a
solution to the Taiwan issue and to achieve China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Being rational and practical, the eight propositions agree with
the fundamental interests of the people on the two sides across
the Taiwan Straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since it was published, Jiang's speech has received positive
response from international communities and it has produced great
effects on checking "Taiwan Independence" tendency and promoting
the development of the relations across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
Tsui Sze Man, member of the Standing Committee of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, said that Hong Kong's transition is now proceeding
smoothly and many key tasks for the establishment of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region have been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
He said that the progress of Hong Kong's transition has showed
that the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government have
sincerity and determination in carrying out the principle of "One
Country, Two System", adding that he believed that under the
principle, China's reunification will be realized.
</P>
<P>
Tan Ko Kun, editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong Economic
Information Agency, said that Hong Kong has played a positive role
in promoting the exchanges between the two sides across the
Straits.
</P>
<P>
He said that after Hong Kong returns to China in the middle of
1997, Hong Kong will be an example for implementing the principle
of "One Country, Two Systems" and it will contribute to China's
reunification in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Fan Che On, chairman of the New Asia Cultural Foundation, said
that foreign investors are now increasingly confident in Hong
Kong's future and they have increased their funds in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the reasons for the increasing
inflow-investment trend lies in the prosperity of the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
He said that with China's economic development, the
reunification of the Chinese nation is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the meeting also criticized the Taiwan
Authorities' separative acts, noting that they talk
"reunification", but pursue for "One China, One Taiwan" and "Two
Chinas".
</P>
<P>
They urged the Taiwan Authorities to return to "One China"
principle and take positive measures to meet Jiang Zemin's eight
propositions on the reunification of the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Signed Article Criticizes US Media on Hong Kong Issue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A signed article written by Wen
Ming has criticized some American media for groundlessly attacking
the Chinese government for eliminating or revising some current
ordinances in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Some articles (in the American media) have used lame arguments
to charge the Chinese Government a number of offenses such as
robbing Hong Kong people of their freedom, disrupting Hong Kong's
prosperity and swaying the confidence of investors," the article
said.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the Legal Panel of the Preparatory Committee of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) suggested that
some ordinances in Hong Kong which run against the Basic Law will
be revised or not be adopted.
</P>
<P>
"They (American journalists) continued to criticize that the
suggestions of the Legal Panel of the Preparatory Committee
`violated' the Sino-British Joint Declaration. But reading through
the lines of their articles, it is not hard to see that they are
not even clear about the contents of the Joint Declaration and the
Basic Law," the article said.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, it is well-known that the declaration
was signed in 1984, and the "current laws" it referred to were
Hong Kong's laws in 1984. Therefore, it is the common duty of both
China and Britain to basically make no changes to such laws.
</P>
<P>
An appendix to the declaration also clearly states that all
duties and responsibilities to be assumed by the HKSAR government
must be discussed by China and Britain, and then actions can be
taken following consensus, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article went on to say that in 1990, the Chinese Government
stated through the Basic Law that those laws in Hong Kong not
violating the Basic Law could remain.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the established practice of discussion and China's
repeated objections, the British Hong Kong authorities, Governor
Chris Patten in particular, arbitrarily made some major changes to
Hong Kong's original laws, and the changes are not conducive to
the smooth transfer of Hong Kong, the article said.

<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China is pleased to see the
expansion and deepening of friendly cooperation between China and
France in various fields, Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with a French delegation from AXA National Mutual, led
by its president Claude Bebear, Li said that China is looking
forward to French President Jacques Chirac's China visit this year,
and that the tour will surely improve long-term, stable and
friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that as a powerful and seasoned business group, AXA
National Mutual has carried out smooth cooperation with the
People's Bank of China and the China Association for International
Friendly Contact (CAIFC) in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his appreciation for the group's commitment to
training personnel for China's insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
Touching on China's foreign trade, Li cited the country's
stable political situation, economic advancement and laws and
regulations as providing the sound social environment needed for
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Li said that great changes have taken place in China's practice
of introducing of overseas investment, because while foreign
investors take into account the need to choose good Chinese
partners, China tends to seek suitable and satisfied overseas
partners.
</P>
<P>
Bebear said that the AXA National Mutual, with a sound
reputation and extensive international business network, is
enthusiastic about its access to China's market.
</P>
<P>
Bebear added that AXA group's cooperation with China has been
supported by both French President Jacques Chirac and the French
government, and the business is willing to further friendly
contact with China by continuing to offer help to China's
insurance industry.

"It totally violated the statements of the Joint Declaration,
and contradicted related statements of the Basic Law to preserve
original laws in Hong Kong," the article said.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard the declaration and Hong Kong's stability and
development, the Legal Panel suggested that some of the ordinances
concocted solely by the Hong Kong British authorities would not be
adopted.
</P>
<P>
It should be pointed out that in the process of negotiations on
the Hong Kong issue between China and Britain, the British side
had time and again stated that Hong Kong's laws conformed with
human rights conventions, and such statements lasted at least till
1989.
</P>
<P>
However, after 1991, Britain started to make major changes to
original laws, using the excuse that they did not conform to the
Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
If the Bill of Rights derived from human rights conventions,
how can the laws which were said to conform to human rights
conventions by Britain change overnight into those that do not
conform to the Bill of Rights?
</P>
<P>
The simple reason lies in that Britain is seeking an excuse to
violate the Joint Declaration, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The Legal Panel has pored over the ordinances concocted only by
the British Hong Kong authorities, adopting as many as possible to
illustrate the panel's tolerance. In fact, the panel will not
adopt some major revisions that seriously violate the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Bill of Rights, the panel suggests that some
articles in it which override the Basic Law should not be adopted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Basic Law has a special chapter on the basic
rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents, and such contents are
even broader than the Bill of Rights.

<HEADLINE> Signed Article Criticizes US Media on Hong Kong Issue (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article said the Legal Panel's suggestion is fair,
reasonable and legitimate, and the "human rights" excuse used by
the British Hong Kong authorities will only bring trouble to Hong
Kong in the future.
</P>
<P>
To review British history, whenever Britain ended its colonial
rule in a place, it would always provoke some disputes, and plant
several "time bombs" that would explode in the future, but never
let the matter alone, the article said.
</P>
<P>
As for why some media in the United States blamed China without
grounds on this issue, the article quoted a "New York Times"
editorial as saying that "Every step toward the transfer of Hong
Kong back to China is a somber reminder that after the recent
liberation of so many countries from Communism, a vibrant and
relatively free society is soon to be swallowed up by a Communist
dictatorship."
</P>
<P>
Nothing can show more clearly that some people in the United
States still have deep-rooted prejudice and hostility to China, it
pointed out, adding that they are extremely unwilling to see Hong
Kong's smooth return to China.
</P>
<P>
Whenever there is an opportunity, these people will create
negative public opinion and contribute confusion in order to block
the smooth transition, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-US relations are now improving, the article said, but
some people in the US are trying to link the Hong Kong issue with
their policies toward China, and restrain the United States
government from improving relations with China.
</P>
<P>
When the Legal Panel put forward its suggestions, some US media
claimed that the Hong Kong issue should be included in China's
"human rights" issue, and urged the US government to launch
another attack against China on the UN meeting on human rights,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
The "Washington Post" also said, "How the new administration
responds to this latest threat to Hong Kong's freedom will
represent an early test of that commitment."
</P>
<P>
The article said the smooth transition of Hong Kong is the will
of the people, and no one can restrain this move.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to create disturbances and mislead international
opinions, done solely to contain and isolate China, will not be
successful, the article said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of the works of
a female Finnish painter opened in the Shanghai Art Gallery today,
marking the first show of a Finnish painter's works in China.
</P>
<P>
Solie Yli-Mayry, a well-known Finnish artist, has more than two
decades of painting experience. Her trademark style features
people and cities that appear three-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
She has held more then 100 exhibitions, including some in
Europe, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"I used to be a typical traditional painter who mainly paints
portraits," said Yli-Mayry, who has a masters degree in political
science from Helsinki University. "The present style has formed
gradually."

<HEADLINE> Austria's New Chancellor and Cabinet Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Austria's new Chancellor Viktor
Klima and and a changed ministerial line-up were sworn in today by
President Thomas Klestil at the Presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Klima was elected chancellor following the resignation earlier
this month of the former chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, of the
Social Democratic Party (SPO).
</P>
<P>
The cabinet coalition between the SPO and the People's Party
(OVP) remains intact.
</P>
<P>
Klima radically reshuffled the SPO team of Vranitzky's
coalition government when he announced the composition of the new
government last week, but did not change the OVP team, led by vice
Chancellor and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
From the previous SPO cabinet Klima has retained only Former
Interior Minister Caspar Einem, whom he named as Transport and
Science Minister.
</P>
<P>
Karl Schloegl, Civil Service Minister in the outgoing
government, takes over as Interior Minister.
</P>
<P>
Klima appointed Vienna Councillor Rudolf Edlinger to the post
of Finance Minister, which was held by Klima himself in the former
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Klima combined into one the former Ministry of Labor and Social
Affairs and the Ministry of Health, and appointed Lore Hostasch,
former chairman of the workers' committee, to head it.
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Scholten, former Transport and Science Minister, Franz
Hums, former Minister of of Labor and Social Affairs, Christa
Krammer, former Minister of Health and Helga Konrad, former
Minister of Women, were dismissed from their posts.
</P>
<P>
The new chancellor is expected to publish his administrative
program on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urges Peruvian Restraint on Hostage Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today urged Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori not to
let police maneuvers around the Japanese ambassador's residence in
Lima endanger the 72 hostages held by rebels inside.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Kyodo News Service reported that the prime minister
made the pitch when Fujimori told him of the Peruvian government's
completion of preparations for direct talks on a prompt resolution
of the hostage standoff with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement (MRTA) guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize the need to tighten the guard around the
residence but want you to take sufficient care that nothing
unexpected occurs," he was quoted as telling the Peruvian
president.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's renewed expression of worry over the Peru situation
came a day after the MRTA insurgents fired several shots at
armored vehicles that were parading around the diplomatic compound
and blaring martial music through loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
The premier also reassured Fujimori that Tokyo was supporting
Lima's efforts for a peaceful solution to the crisis and early
release of those in captivity, the news service said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hiroshi Hashimoto declined to
divulge Fujimori's response to the prime minister's request but
noted the Peruvian president must have received Japan's message.
</P>
<P>
The heavily armed MRTA rebels seized Japanese Ambassador
Morihisa Aoki's residence on December 17 and took captive several
hundred guests attending a party there.
</P>
<P>
They have gradually set free many of the hostages, while
repeating their demand for the release of imprisoned MRTA
members.

<HEADLINE> The Economic Operation In Zhejiang Goes Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- East China's coastal province
of Zhejiang achieved a smooth and moderate economic growth in
1996, according to statistics released today.
</P>
<P>
The province's gross domestic product in 1996 was 415 billion
yuan (50 billion US dollars), a 12.7 percent increase over the
previous year and three percentage points higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the increase of the overall market price had
slowed down. During the last quarter of 1996, the rate of retail
sales price increase had been reduced to 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The grain-production area in the province last year was 2.87
million hectares, 2.1 percent more than the previous year, with
15.17 billion kilograms of grain produced, six percent more than
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector added to the province an output value of
195 billion yuan (24 billion US dollars); Zhejiang's industrial
output value of rural enterprises was 401 billion yuan (50 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The statistics show Zhejiang invested a total of 160 billion
yuan (nearly 20 billion US dollars) in fixed assets in 1996, 18
percent more than in 1995. Investment in real estate projects was
less than in 1995, but that for infrastructures, water conservancy
facilities and irrigation works had risen.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the province achieved an export volume of 9.33 billion
US dollars, 10.5 percent higher than in 1995. As for the import
volume, the figure was 4.05 billion US dollars, a 31.5 percent
rise over 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province is reporting a 49.3 percent increase
in use of overseas funds, with 2.3 billion US dollars of overseas
investment channeled into the province's economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The province's good economic operation in 1996 has created a
better condition for a sustainable development in 1997," said an
economist.

<HEADLINE> HKMA Participate in New Arrangements to Borrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) will be one of the 25 participants in the New
Arrangements (NAB) to Borrow, which was adopted by the Executive
Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at a meeting on
Monday, an HKMA spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The IMF decision was taken following an agreement by potential
participants in the NAB on the terms and conditions under which
they will be prepared to make loans to the IMF when additional
resources are needed to cope with exceptional situations which may
 impair or pose a threat to the stability of the international
monetary system, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA will be participating with a share of the NAB credit
line at SDR 340 million (about 476 million US dollars). SDR is an
 international reserve asset created by the IMF to supplement
existing reserves and its exchange rate as at the close of January
 27 this year was 1.4 US dollars to one unit of SDR.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, HKMA's Chief Executive said that the loan will be
drawn from the Exchange Fund and have a maturity of five years and
 will earn market interest rate.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Lending to the IMF, an institution of high credit
rating, represents a prudent investment and is compatible with the
 established investment strategy of the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
last year, Hong Kong joined the Bank for International
Settlements.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, financial secretary, said that it is clear from
these developments that Hong Kong is well recognized by the
international financial community as a leading international
financial center.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Foreign Waste Left Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- All 50 containers (about 700
tons) of stranded foreign waste left Hong Kong today, as a result
of close liaison work by the Environmental Protection Department
(EPD) with the relevant authorities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
According to the EPD, the plastic waste, believed to be mostly
of German origin, was shipped from the Netherlands to Hong Kong
and left unclaimed since arrival in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
On learning of the incident in late October last year, Hong
Kong's EPD immediately began pursuing arrangements for the return
of the waste to the country of export.
</P>
<P>
The German and Dutch authorities agreed to the return of the
waste to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. They will sort out the
responsibilities and waste disposal arrangement in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Experts Meet on Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) ended their 22nd experts meeting on defense
and public security here today, with progress achieved on the
advance party of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on the matter have lasted for 10 months and both
sides have agreed that the entry of a limited number of advance
PLA staff into Hong Kong is just to make necessary preparations,
so that the PLA Hong Kong garrison are able to fulfill their
mission after July 1, Chen Zuo'er, the Chinese representative on
the JLG, said.
</P>
<P>
A proposal on advance troops, which had been put forward last
April by the Chinese side, received an official and substantial
reply from the British side for the first time at the two-day
meeting, Chen told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Although the reply was still far away from the minimum
requirements for the garrison to carry out their tasks after July
1, "we are not pessimistic as the experts on both sides are making
great efforts," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Chen stressed, the Chinese side presented a
more flexible plan, and expected an early reply from the British
side.
</P>
<P>
The plan was drafted with regards to the smooth defense
handover, which constitutes a key part of the handover of the Hong
 Kong government and lays a solid foundation for the smooth
transition, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped greater progress would be achieved at the next
meeting, adding Hong Kong residents and the international
community would like to see that result.
</P>
<P>
Alan Paul, who headed the British team on the JLG, described
the atmosphere of the meeting as "very pragmatic and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
"We have gone right through this complex and difficult matter,
and I believe we have a much better understanding on each other's
concerns, and at least we have a good basis to take our
discussions forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning of the meeting on Monday, we are doing our
best to bring these discussions to an early and successful
conclusion," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Govt to Acquire Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
issued notices to compulsorily acquire nine commercial farms
under the controversial land acquisition act of 1992, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) said the notices of
compulsory acquisition were signed by Secretary of the Ministry
of Lands and Water Resources Frederick Chunga, and the affected
landowners had been receiving them over the past fortnight.
</P>
<P>
''The administrative court has to confirm the decision where
the Minister of Lands and Water Resources has to justify the
necessity to acquire the property in the national interest,'' the
CFU said.
</P>
<P>
It said, ''in the event of the minister having the orders
confirmed, landowners have the right to adjudication of the
compensation levels in the administrative court should there be a
disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
The government is pursuing a controversial land acquisition
program under which it designates and acquires land from largely
white farmers.
</P>
<P>
But, the British government, which once financed the land
acquisition program until 1990, wants the Zimbabwe government to
buy land on a willing-seller/willing-buyer basis.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 families are in desperate need of land
and are currently resettled in some of the country's most
ecologically fragile areas.

<HEADLINE> Nation Urged to Control Flood During High-Water Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The whole nation was urged
today to make good preparations for the coming high-water season,
so as to ensure the rivers across the country well under control.
</P>
<P>
Vice Premier Jiang Chunyun said at a working meeting held by
the State Flood Control Headquarters that all the related
departments should make all possible efforts to refrain from any
risks.
</P>
<P>
In China, the high-water season usually comes only 100 to 150
days from now, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since last middle December, six teams have been sent by the
State Flood Control Headquarters to inspect the water-preventing
work on the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and other big rivers
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
"Still more attention should be given to increase the
flood-fighting effectiveness", said the vice Premier.
</P>
<P>
Last year China suffered from floods and a large number of
waterloging-preventing facilities were destroyed, one third of
which have not yet been repaired.
</P>
<P>
"All the related departments should recognize clearly the
possible dangers and take early measures accordingly", the vice
Premier said.

<HEADLINE> Press Urged to Watch Environmental Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress
is going to enforce the environmental protection law by
encouraging Chinese journalists to write more investigative
reporting about the country's environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
"All the government departments concerned must pay their utmost
attention to those environmental problems exposed by the public
and the media," said Wang Bingqian, Vice-President of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We should not lay aside and neglect those problems exposed by
the public and the press," Wang told a national conference of
environmental officials and journalists which was organized by the
Committee of Environment and Resources under the National People's
Congress here today.
</P>
<P>
"The violations of the environmental protection law is still
widespread in the country and the public have complained a lot
about this," Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
"China has rich natural resources and some of the resources top
the world, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"But the per-capita consumption of resources in China is much
lower than the world's average," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And due to the fast growth of economy and population, the
country will face a serious challenge to meet its demand of
resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of China in 1949, its GNP has increased by a
dozen times, but the consumption of the country's mineral
resources has grown by over 40 times, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 2,300 Chinese journalists were organized
by the Committee of Environment and Resources of the National
People's Congress to write stories about the country's
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Over 17,000 investigative stories about the country's
environmental problems were published or broadcast in the
country's national and local media last year, which , according to
the National People's Congress, had great impacts on the country's
efforts to fight against the environmental pollution.

<HEADLINE> Germany, France Seek Uniform Tax Rates within EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany and France have called
for more uniform tax rates across the European Union (EU) to
prevent countries like Luxembourg and Ireland luring jobs away
from other EU members through tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France shifted tensions over the EU's planned
single currency from the central bank to taxes by making the
appeal at a meeting of EU finance ministers, which closed in
Brussels on Monday.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said banks and companies
were making use of lower taxes elsewhere in Europe to siphon off
German tax revenue. This made it more difficult for the German
government to meet the economic criteria set for the single
European currency.
</P>
<P>
Germany forecast a deficit of 2.9 percent of its gross domestic
product this year, just under the single-currency ceiling of three
percent.
</P>
<P>
Waigel said; "We want and need competition between the various
tax systems in Europe, but priority must be given to measures to
prevent unfair competition."
</P>
<P>
Jean Arthuis, the French finance minister, agreed with his
German counterpart and said the so-called competitive
exchange-rate devaluations and "social dumping" within Europe were
causing dangerous divisions.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Belgium expressed similar concerns at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, ministers from Luxembourg and Ireland maintained that
the EU should coordinate a range of economic policies to support
monetary union rather than focusing only on issues like corporate
taxes and withholding tax on savings.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg, with a huge offshore banking industry and free of
withholding tax, has attracted more than 1000 billion Deutsche
marks (about 610 billion U.S. dollars) of savings from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ireland, which provides a cut-rate 10 percent tax
for multinational companies, lured more United States investment
than any other EU country last year.
</P>
<P>
But German and French finance ministers also insisted that any
further approach toward uniform tax regimes must be approved
unanimously by all 15 EU member states, a requirement which had
paralyzed tax harmonization efforts before.

<HEADLINE> California Welcomes Chinese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Pete Wilson, governor of the
U.S. state of California, said here today that Chinese investment
"has not been as much as we would like to see" and that his state
welcomes enhanced investment from China.
</P>
<P>
Wilson made the remarks at a press conference during his
week-long visit in China.
</P>
<P>
The 63-year-old governor said that China has invested 107
million US dollars in California, creating job opportunities for
some 400 people there. He added that Chinese investment has mostly
centered on high technology industry and real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that another reason he came to seek China's investment,
besides strong economic ties, is that nearly 43 percent of Chinese
Americans live in California. Therefore, he said, the Chinese
should "feel at home" investing in California.

<HEADLINE> China, Mongolia Need More Economic and Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- There are great potentials in
Sino-Mongolian economic and trade cooperation, and China is
willing to work with Mongolia to explore further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, Chinese minister of Foreign Trade and Econnomic
Cooperation, said this while meeting the visiting Mongolian
Minister of External Relations Shukher Altangerel here today.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have witnessed a big increase in Sino-Mongolian
trade, Wu said, adding that bilateral trade volume last year
reached 200 million US dollars, up 24 percent than that in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Although the present economic cooperation between the two
countries is still on a small scale, she said, however, a broad
prospect for further cooperation can be seen since China has a
integrated industrial system and Mongolia is rich in oil and many
kinds of other mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that both governments could encourage more contacts
and understanding between the large enterprises of the two
countries and seek more opportunities for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Altangerel said that economic and trade cooperation plays an
important role in bilateral relations, adding that his country
hopes to increase its economic and trade ties with China.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Wu and Altangerel signed an exchange of
notes on trade and economic cooperation between two countries.

<HEADLINE> China's Airline Industry Enters Period of Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- After almost a decade of
staggering expansion, China's airline industry has entered into a
period of steady growth, said a senior civil aviation official
here today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC), told a national conference that the annual growth
of the industry averaged 16.3 percent from 1994 to 1996, 10.7
percentage points lower than that during the previous three years.
</P>
<P>
This year, Chinese airlines are expected to handle 62 million
passengers this year, and the overall air transport volume will
reach nine ton-kilometer, both growing by about 12 percent from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
With China's economic take-off at the beginning of the 1980s,
its airline industry started to flourish with an average annual
growth of over 20 percent. The high speed, for all its merit,
caused some problems for the industry, with flight safety as the
most outstanding one.
</P>
<P>
"To check the over-high growth, resulting in an imbalanced
structure and unstandardized market competition, the government
has increased macro control over the industry in recent years,"
Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the safety record of Chinese carriers have been
improved very much. By the end of 1996, the airlines created a
record of 29 months and 2.35 million hours of safe flights for
commercial transport, the longest safety cycle since 1982.
</P>
<P>
To upgrade basic facilities, Chen said, the majority of funds
were invested in building airports and improving air traffic
control systems in the past three years, while aircraft purchase
used to claim most of the fund.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen airports were built from 1993 to 1996, while
communications, navigation and meteorological facilities were
modernized.
</P>
<P>
Chinese airlines are expected to handle 80 million passengers
by the year 2000, while the overall transport volume of the
industry will reach 12 billion ton-kilometer, according to a
development plan worked out by the CAAC.

<HEADLINE> Better Cross-Strait Relations Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan authorities were
urged today to conform to the times and take practical action to
improve relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering to greet the Spring Festival in Beijing,
Peng Qingyuan, executive vice-chairman of the Central Committee of
the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, summed up
new achievements made last year in China's economic construction,
social progress, and diplomacy as well as the work of his party.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern for compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Macao and overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
He said to fulfil China's reunification is the trend of the
times and the desire of the people.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, Hong Kong will return to its motherland, and Macao
will return in 1999, he said, adding that this is a point of pride
of all Chinese people throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
In order to realize the reunification across the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits, the Chinese Communist Party and government
have put forward the principle of "peaceful reunification, and one
country, two systems," and President Jiang Zemin issued an
eight-point proposition on the Taiwan Issue, which are in the
interests of all the Chinese people, including the Taiwan people.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that significant achievements have been made on the
campaign of anti-separatism and anti-"Taiwan independence," but it
is necessary to remain vigilant of the Taiwan authorities'
worldwide activities to create "two Chinas" and "one China, one
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his party will continue to expose and refute
the separatist words and actions of the Taiwan authorities, while
actively putting forward cross-strait economic, trade and cultural
exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Bounce Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Japanese stocks bounced back up
for the first time in four days, ending up over 461.67 points to
17,796.57 points this morning.
</P>
<P>
But analysts warn Japan's banking sector may be still be in for
turbulent times with more rough roads ahead for the market.
</P>
<P>
Investors' concerns over the rickety banking sector has spawned
the malaise in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector is also being shaken by the plunging stock
market. The key Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues has
fallen more than 3,000 points since the beginning of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts warn of serious trouble ahead for most of Japan's
banks if the Nikkei index falls to the 15,000 level. At that
level, all except the big strong banks will lose all profit on
stock transactions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say government measures planned for next year will
make the situation worse. Some of those measures include raising
the consumption tax and ending the special income tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
"These banks, you must remember, their primary ability to earn
revenue comes through their loan portfolio and if the economy is
going to be weak and loan demand is not going to improve then
profits are not going to improve," Reuters quoted James McGinnis,
a banking sector analyst, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It can get to be quite a vicious cycle," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some banks say they may slow down the writing off of bad
loans. If they did that, some in the market say it could be the
straw that breaks the camel's back.
</P>
<P>
Huge amounts of loans made by Japanese banks turned bad after
the collapse of Japan's late-1980s "bubble" of inflated land
prices.

others, Ronald Arculli, convener of Patent Rights Task Force of
the association, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Regional Manager Director of CYRK, Ms Rosalinda Ko, said, they
feel honored to make a unique contribution to the handover, by

of the most significant days in history.
</P>
<P>
They are not only commemorating a historical event but also
promoting Hong Kong's importance to consumers around the globe,
she added.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of items ranging from T-shirt to keychains bearing the
dolphin design were displayed at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The association was inaugurated in November 1996, half a year
after the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) decided in March 1996 to set up the
body to mark the handover.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Ruling Party to Fight Hanbo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's ruling New Korea
Party (NKP) said it would launch a counter-offensive in the
presidential election later this year to prevent the opposition
camp from taking advantage of the collapse of the Hanbo Iron and
Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
Under a decision made today at a high-level NKP staff meeting,
the party will form a 15-member fact-finding committee to probe
into how the company got billions of United States dollars in bank
loans.
</P>
<P>
Hanbo Iron and Steel Company, a subsidiary of South Korea's
Hanbo Business Group, was declared bankrupt by its creditors on
January 23 after it failed to honor billions of U.S. dollars in
notes.
</P>
<P>
The opposition camp, including Kim Dae-jung from the National
Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and Kim Jong-pil from the United
Liberal Democrats (ULD), claimed that the Kim Young-sam government
was instrumental in helping the debt-ridden firm obtain loans of
some 5.95 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
They defined the "scandal" as the biggest case of financial
irregularity since the founding of the republic.
</P>
<P>
NKP Spokesman Kim Chull said if the oppositions try to tie the
Hanbo issue with their election strategy, the NKP would fight back
with all its wisdom and energy.
</P>
<P>
Kang Sam-jae, NKP secretary-general, described opposition's
demand for a special public prosecutor to investigate the case as
"utterly unreasonable."
</P>
<P>
A special prosecutor should be named only after investigations
by the prosecution and parliament were considered unreliable, he
said.

<HEADLINE> ADB Becomes First Overseas Investor in Chinese Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank has
become the first international financial organization to have a
stake in a Chinese bank after it made a landmark investment of 20
million US dollars in the Everbright Bank of China (EBC).
</P>
<P>
The EBC, which formerly was a subsidiary of China Everbright
Group Ltd., has been turned into a joint-stock commercial bank
with an ADB investment of 20 million US dollars, Zhu Xiaohua,
chairman of the Chinese bank's board of directors said here today
at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The EBC's effort to transform itself into a joint-stock entity
between July and October last year netted an actual capital
investment of 3.093 billion yuan (about 370 million US dollars),
according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
V.N. Gnanathurai, a senior economist of the ADB, said that the
world financial international institution invested in the EBC
because the Chinese bank has had "one of the best track records in
the past four years."
</P>
<P>
He added that the ADB investment is in line with China's effort
to reform its financial sector.
</P>
<P>
With the restructuring, the EBC has a total of 131
shareholders, which cover a wide range of industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is also the bank president, told reporters that he
hopes the EBC will be approved as the second listed Chinese bank.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Development Bank in south China is the only
Chinese financial institution that has been listed on the stock
market.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Down to 24-Year Low in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's inflation
dropped to its lowest level last year since 1972 despite a sharp
depreciation of the country's currency of Rand pushing prices up
in the latter half of the year, an official survey said today.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Service said in a statement that
average inflation in South Africa fell 1.3 percent in 1996 to 7.4
percent, the lowest level since 1972 when the country's inflation
rate was 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The average consumer price index was measured at 8.7 percent
in 1995 and nine percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Average food inflation was also at a record low, falling to
6.1 percent from 8.7 percent in the previous year. This was the
lowest level since 1971, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The South African currency of Rand fell more than 25 percent
to the U.S. Dollar from 3.65 Rand in mid-February to end-1996 at
around 4.70 against the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
The survey also said that despite the positive average
figures, the weaker Rand did have a marked effect on the price of
goods, lifting 1996's consumer price index from 5.5 percent in
April to 9.4 percent in December.

<HEADLINE> Salvation of Sunken Warship Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The front deck of the famous
"Chungshan" Cruiser was successfully lifted out of the Yangtze
River this morning, half of a month ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government of Hubei held a ceremony at Jinkou
Town to mark the warship's rise to the water's surface.
</P>
<P>
At 10:15 a.m., on orders of Jia Zhijie, secretary of the Hubei
Provincial Communist Party Committee, the cruiser was lifted by 38
hoists, amid the din of firecrackers, gongs, drums, sirens and
military music.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Li Tieying announced the successful recovery
of the warship at 11:50.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Guanghui, chief director of the salvation
operation, the two-meter-high front deck is now above-water, but
five meters of the warship are still submerged.
</P>
<P>
The cleaned, uprighted ship will be sent to the Hubei Shipyard
24 km from the salvation site. Later, it will be returned to
Jinkou Town to be on display, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The warship set sail in 1913 under the name of "Yongfeng"
Cruiser. In 1925, it was renamed the "Chungshan" Cruiser after
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, father of the Chinese Democratic Revolution, by
his Guangzhou revolutionary government.
</P>
<P>
The warship was sunk by Japanese planes on October 24, 1938,
around the Jinkou waters.
</P>
<P>
The salvation of the warship has been a common wish of Chinese
both at home and abroad. Hubei Province has been making
preparations for the work since 1988.
</P>
<P>
The salvation operation formally began on November 12, 1996. On
December 31, cables were attached to the hull at the river bed,
and the bow was hoisted slightly on January 8 of this year. By
January 19, one of the ship's masts had risen to the surface.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets US Congressmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China has adopted a positive attitude toward the
development of Sino-US ties, but that the two sides should act out
of mutual respect if bilateral relations are to advance.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the comment during a meeting with six US
congressmen, including Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pennsylvania), chairman
of the sub-committee of military research and development with the
House of Representatives, and Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-New York), a
senior congressman in charge of Asian-Pacific affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that the United States is carrying out
a 'contact policy' toward China," Li said. Contact is better than
containment, and dialogue is better than confrontation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Weldon told Li that his visit is meant to further the exchanges
between the two countries, especially between their congresses.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the leaders of the US Congress, Weldon said he
wanted to discuss with the Chinese how best to establish a system
of regular talks and exchanges between the officials of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The current US congress is willing to commit to better
understanding China, its culture and history, he said, adding that
the practice will enable his country to form appropriate
US-Chinese policy, and ensure the stable and sound development of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Ackerman spoke highly of China's economic achievement, saying
he is deeply impressed by the great changes which have taken place
since he was here last.
</P>
<P>
Li agreed with Weldon's view of the need to strengthen ties
between the US Congress and China's National People's Congress. He
said that since all countries have their own unique social
systems, cultural backgrounds and development levels, it is
natural for them to have a different understanding of some issues.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing is believing," he quoted a Chinese saying, adding that
Communication, especially in the form of visits between leaders,
is the best way to lessen misunderstandings and establish harmony.
</P>
<P>
Li reiterated China's basic principle on Sino-US ties, which
according to President Jiang Zemin, is to increase trust, reduce
troubles, develop cooperation and refrain from confrontation.

any eventuality," said P.N. Panchal, fire safety consultant and

Fire India '97, an international conference and exhibition on fire
safety beginning here tomorrow.

from Somalia's central region of Hiran today met and talked to
pacify the intense situation caused by clan fightings between
the Hawadle and the Badi Adde.
</P>
<P>
The intense situation was created following the Sunday killing
of a Somali aid worker serving Oxfam Quebec, Canadian relief
agency, by gunmen of the Badi Adde clan in an attempt of car
robbery at a checkpoint out of the Bulo Burto town, 220 km north
of capital Mogadishu.

The Hawadle clansmen of the deceased launched a counter-attack
on the Badi Adde position on Monday afternoon, only to result in
the death of nother Hawadle militiamen and the seizure of their
vehicle and weapons.

Chieftain Mohamed Ahmed Hussein, leader of the Badi Adde clan,
intervened before the situation went out of hand. Other community
elders also attended the peace talks to contain the hostility.
</P>
<P>
The elders called on the Badi Adde men to bring back the
vehicle they seized, turn in the weapons they confiscated, and
hand over the murderer of the aid worker.
</P>
<P>
However, no response has been made so far by the Badi Adde
men.

leaders, calling for an emergency aid to the drought effected
areas of the country, pledged to guarantee the security of the
aid workers and to facilitate the smooth flow of the humanitarian
deliveries to the target areas.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Become Fourth Largest Aerospace Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada's aerospace industry is
set to become the fourth largest in the world, surpassing Japan
and Germany, said the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada
(AIAC).
</P>
<P>
With an output of 9.3 billion U.S. dollars of aerospace
products in 1996, Canada was the 6th largest supplier after the
United States, France, Britain, Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
AIAC's forecast was bolstered with Bombardier Inc.'s
announcement last week that it's going to develop the 70-seat
Regional Jet, the largest civilian aircraft ever made in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 59,000 people are employed at Canadian
aerospace companies, up 5,000 since 1994.
</P>
<P>
"At the current growth rate, Canada should move into fourth by
the year 2000" with an output of 12.2 billion dollars, AIAC
President Peter Smith was quoted as saying by media reports today.
</P>
<P>
The president listed several reasons for Canada to move up the
aerospace corporate ladder.
</P>
<P>
First, governments everywhere are cutting defense
budgets. Since Canada spends relatively a small sum of money on
defense, cuts have a smaller effect.
</P>
<P>
Second, the Montreal-based Bombardier foresaw a worldwide
demand for regional aircraft and moved quickly to position itself
as a leader.
</P>
<P>
Third, air travel is growing steadily, more than 10 percent a
year in the Asia-Pacific region, fueling huge demand for new and
replacement aircraft.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the weak Canadian dollar helps exports while the
stronger yen and Deutsch mark hurts the product sales of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is not implausible" for Canada to reach fourth place in the
world aerospace industry, but it will depend on how well Canadian
products tap into the Asian air market, an analyst was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> China Sets to Tackle Teachers' Housing Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Housing conditions for teachers
in China have been markedly improved, thanks to joint efforts by
governments at different levels.
</P>
<P>
But many are still not properly housed, according to a national
conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The central government has pledged "to provide all teachers
with adequate dwelling places by the end of this century, in two
to three years," Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the State
Education Commission told a national conference on housing
construction for teachers yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
"Due to historical reasons and an imbalance in economic
development in different regions, there are a large number of
teachers who have no apartments, or who find it difficult to house
themselves," Zhu Kaixuan said.
</P>
<P>
College teachers and other staff live in houses with per capita
space still lower than the urban average level, he said, adding
that most of the young teachers are especially being confronted
with severe housing problems.
</P>
<P>
To encourage more professionals to devote themselves to
education, which has become a less-coveted career, China has made
greater efforts to improve housing conditions for teachers in the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
Over 1.18 million apartments of 84 million square meters were
completed at a cost of 48 billion yuan (5.78 billion US dollars)
from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
As the result, the per capita living area in a teachers' home
has climbed to eight square meters, from 6.6 square meters in
1992, statistics revealed.
</P>
<P>
The State Council and local governments have adopted a series
of policies and laws to increase the income of teachers, and make
ensure they are adequately accommodated.
</P>
<P>
The conference was sponsored by the State Council, and attended
by officials from related ministries and localities.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Have Own Satellite Dish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar will be ready
to have a satellite dish installed next July for direct world
communications without having to pass through the Tanzania
Telecommunication Corporation Limited (TTCL).
</P>
<P>
Director General of the Zanzibar Free Economic Processing
Zones (EPZ) Salmin Senga said in the town of Zanzibar Monday that
the dish will be installed at Fumba South Unguja by the Zanzibar
Telecommunication Limited (ZANTEL).
</P>
<P>
He said that the Tanzania Communication Commission (TCC) has
already negotiated with ZANTEL on the installation of the
satellite dish and 30 other sub-transmission towers around Unguja
and Pemba.
</P>
<P>
The project, which should have started before January, was
delayed because TCC did not allocate frequencies to ZANTLE as
expected, he said.
</P>
<P>
TTCL is the sole company having a satellite dish which enables
both internal and external communications.
</P>
<P>
ZANTEL is a foreign-invested telecommunication company in
which the Zanzibar government will have shares.
</P>
<P>
However, Senga declined to give details on the expenditure of
the project.

The summit, scheduled on February 21, will be attended by

</P>
<P>
At today's meeting here, Hussein and Arafat also talked about

<HEADLINE> Inflation Drops to 15.4 Percent in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to the tight
monetary policies, the inflation rate dropped from 16.2 percent
in November to 15.4 percent by the end of December last year, the
lowest in the past 11 years in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
A monthly economic review issued here on Monday by the Bank of
Tanzania (BOT) said that the decline was also due to tough stance
on imports, government's budgetary discipline and a satisfactory
food supply situation.
</P>
<P>
"The decline of the inflation rate was mainly accounted for by
relatively low rate of inflation registered in food group index
which accounts for 71.2 percent of total weight in the consumer
basket," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in the eastern African country reached 21.8
percent in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted the inflation rate would drop further by
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
However, in spite of enough food supply under the Strategic
Grain Reserve (SGR), a total of 58,423 tons in December, Tanzania
will experience a food crisis between February and May due to
drought, said the report.
</P>
<P>
SGR storages should be properly managed and grain exports be
discouraged so as to ease the potential food crisis in the
country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports are continuing to decline, mainly
because of the government's tough measures leading to a lower
trade deficit of 22 million U.S. Dollars by the end of December.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a 37.7 percent decrease compared to 35.3
million Dollars during the same month in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, exports volume rose to 100.7 million Dollars by the
end of December, up 8.6 percent from 97.7 million Dollars in
December, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The total of 1996 exports rose to 861.7 million Dollars, up
11.5 percent than 1995's 682.9 million Dollars, while imports
fell by 9.5 percent from 1.54 billion Dollars to some 1.4 billion
Dollars in 1996.

Each Canadian use the equivalent of nearly 25 liters of gasoline

Though containing no clear recommendations for government policy,
the report urges Canadians to consider the environmental consequences
of their daily actions.

<P>
Yet, the report insists that the individual Canadian cannot be
held solely responsible for a society's impact on the environment.

"The individual is a part of society; therefore, social, cultural

<HEADLINE> Eight New Airports Set to Open in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China is to open eight new
airports this year.
</P>
<P>
Aviation officials say 1997 will see a record investment of
18.4 billion yuan in China's aviation infrastructure and
technological renovation.
</P>
<P>
Among the total, 11.8 billion will come from the central
authorities, and the remaining 6.6 billion from local authorities,
and businesses, said Chen Guangyi, director of the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
Chen told a national conference in Beijing today that eight
airports will go into operation this year, including Fuzhou,
Nanjing and Nanning; the construction of five airports will
continue; and construction of Pudong Airport in Shanghai and the
expansion of three other airports will start.
</P>
<P>
The main structure of the new terminal building at Capital
Airport in Beijing and some support facilities are scheduled to be
completed this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The project, started in October of 1995, is so far the largest
airport expansion project in China, costing an estimated three
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
There will also be five key technological renovation projects
this year, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
The projects include the expansion and upgrading of a national
computerised seat booking system, the flight management system of
China Southern Airlines, the second-phase construction of the CAAC
management information system, an approach control center in the
south China city of Zhuhai, and a maintenance base for China
Eastern Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Some 9.92 billion yuan was invested in aviation infrastructure
and technological renovation in 1996, representing a 57 percent
rise over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Harbin-Khabarovsk Ground Telecommunications Cable Line Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A short cut link has brought
about a telephone revolution for two cities, one in China the
other in Russia.
</P>
<P>
A ground telecommunications cable line linking Harbin, capital
of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, and Russia's far east
city of Khabarovsk, became operational today.
</P>
<P>
The entire cable line is 970 kilometers long, of which 820 km
is laid on Chinese territory, and is connected to Beijing and
Moscow through the two cities' respective telecommunications
systems.
</P>
<P>
Although the two cities are not far from each other, they have,
until now, had to rely on their phone services being relayed
through Beijing and Moscow, which was both time-consuming and
expensive.
</P>
<P>
To cater to increasingly growing demands of economic and trade
development between China and Russia, the two countries signed an
agreement to jointly finance an international cable line in the
Far East in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that completion and commission of the
Sino-Russian telecommunications cable will advance the development
of relationship between China and Russia, and enormously improve
international telecommunications services between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Officials at relevant departments say that earnings from
international telecommunications services account for a quarter of
China's entire earnings from telecommunications services, with
international telephone service earnings making up a half of the
country's earnings from long-distance telephone services.
</P>
<P>
China has now expanded its international telecommunications
lines from less than 10,000 in early 1990s to the present more
than 30,000 lines by building two submerged optical cables from
China to Japan and to the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
China has also been building or making preparations for the
construction of a number of other large international optical
cables, including a 27,000-km-long Eurasian ground optical cable
and a south Asian optical cable linking China, Viet Nam, Laos,
Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
All these international optical cables will be completed within
this century. By then, China will have an international
telecommunications transmission network linking China and most
countries and regions mainly through optical cables.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Stay Where It Is in Sydney Olympics, Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Romania will try to regain a
top 15 spot at the medal standings of the 2000 Olympic Games, the
nation's top sports official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"To regain a spot among the top 15 is the main goal for the
Romanian sports authorities," said Sorin Stanescu, newly-
appointed Romanian Youth and Sports Minister.
</P>
<P>
Romania finished 14th in the medal tally at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
Stanescu, who became the minister in December last year, said
Romania would cultivate more "medal hopefuls" for the 2000 Summer
Games and the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that a national fund will be established to
ensure that top athletes won't slip into poverty and isolation
after their retirements.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the doping case of Romanian women's runner Iulia
Negura, who has been tested positive for banned drugs, Stanescu
said: "If she has really taken drugs, she should be banned."
</P>
<P>
The minister promised that the Romanian authorities will try
all means to battle drug-using in the sports.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The skies above Guangzhou
City in south China are full of the sweet scent of Spring as the
city's flower trade scales new heights.
</P>
<P>
Every day 12 tons of fresh flowers are airlifted from Guangzhou
to other major Chinese cities such as Beijing, Harbin, Shanghai,
Hangzhou in northern and eastern parts of China, according to Zhao
Wenfeng, an official in the freight department of China Southern
Airlines. He added that about three tons of fresh flowers are
delivered to Guangzhou from Kunming, provincial capital of
southwest China's Yunnan for the flower trade in the south China
city.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival which starts from February 7, is the most
important festival for Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said flower customers include local flower growers and
flower business people from big and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
Some flower business people at the Baiyun Airport said they
have to pay for spare rooms as the airlines are busily engaged in
the flower transportation.
</P>
<P>
But they believe that though they have to pay higher charges
for air transport, the capital turnover can be realized quickly
and the quality of the fresh flowers can be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers in foliage plants and potted landscapes prefer
to send their goods by train or ship.
</P>
<P>
About seven tons of flowers, mainly foliage plants and potted
landscapes, are sent to other cities daily from Guangzhou Railway
Station and Huangpu Port.
</P>
<P>
More well off Chinese people now send fresh flowers to their
families or friends as holiday or anniversary gifts, instead of
sending sweets, cakes or fruits.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Issues Five Million Land-Use Certificates in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 28 (xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government issued
more than five million land-use right certificates to farmer
households and individuals nationwide in 1996, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for 42.3 percent of the total number of
certificates granted throughout the country since early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, about 37 million hectares of land or 47.3
percent of cultivable and forest area were allocated to farmers in
4,588 communes.
</P>
<P>
Cultivated land was transferred to farmers in some localities
as early as the late 1980s to boost agricultural productivity,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the process of granting land-right to farmers has been
slow due to the shortages of funds and qualified land
administrative officials as well as the poor technical facilities
to serve the process, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, only 10 percent of the requested land-use right
certificates have been granted to farmers each year.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's IFP Denies Facing Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) has strongly denied it was being plunged into
crisis due to the resignation of its national chairman Frank
Mdlalose and two other senior officials, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
Mdlalose, also the Kwazulu/Natal premier, said at the weekend
that he would step down from the two posts at the end of next
month partly due to poor health.
</P>
<P>
IFP's spokesman Ed Tillett said Monday the party's leadership
viewed the resignation as an opportunity to boost the party into
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed an African National Congress (ANC) statement that
the IFP was in crisis of "opportunistic, hypocritical and gutter
politics of the worst kind".
</P>
<P>
However, IFP leader, also Home Affairs Minister of the ANC-led
government of national unity, said at the weekend that Mdlalose
had indicated that for personal reasons he would not be prepared
to lead the party into the 1999 general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ngubane, the provincial finance minister, would replace
Mdlalose as acting IFP chairman and Kwazulu/Natal premier.
</P>
<P>
IFP's Gauteng provincial legislature leader Musa Myeni has
resigned while IFP Secretary-General Ziba Jiyane indicated to
remove himself from the party's forthcoming annual general
conference in July.
</P>
<P>
The ANC in Kwazulu/Natal Province said in a statement that
these resignations and the "sidelining" of party stalwarts Walter
Felgate and Correction Services Minister Sipho Mzimela plunged
the IFP into deep crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The IFP is at war with itself and the rest of the society," said
the ANC.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Rand Reaches Two-Month Trading High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's local
currency Rand on Monday continued its strong trend beginning with
the new year and touched a two-month intraday trading high of
4.5890 against the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers attributed the continuous in-flow of Dollars
into the money market by local and foreign speculators to Rand's
recapturing its lost ground in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Rand has lost about 30 percent of its value against the U.S.
Dollar since last year.
</P>
<P>
A rally bond market also contributed to the bullish Rand.
Foreign purchase of South Africa's bonds reached 304 million U.S.
Dollars in January 1997 alone as against the 735 million U.S.
Dollars in the whole year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report released by the Union Bank of Switzerland
(UBS) last weekend further boosted Rand's Monday sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on South Africa's high real interest rates
and improved trade balance, predicted that the Rand would
strengthen sharply this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the December figures released by the Central
Statistical Service last week, South Africa's trade surplus rose
to 2.30 billion U.S. Dollars in 1996, up from 1.06 billion U.S.
Dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Studies for Free Currency Convertibility Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Dai Xianglong, China's central
bank governor, has urged government departments to study the
feasibility of making the country's currency fully convertible as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Though we have not worked out a timetable for the yuan's free
convertibility, it should be regarded as a subject for earnest
study," Dai, governor of the People's Bank of China, told an
on-going national meeting attended by heads of provincial branches
of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
</P>
<P>
The yuan's free convertibility is of great significance to
strengthening ties between China and the other countries, as well
as to the country's effort to open wider to the rest of the world,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year China took several major steps to make the yuan
convertible under the current account, which includes trade, labor
and tourism, as well as normal short-term banking and credit
facilities, as of December 1.
</P>
<P>
A SAFE spokesman has said that it is China's long-term goal of
the reform of the foreign exchange system to lift control over
transactions under the capital account and eventually make the
yuan fully convertible.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese government has not worked out a specific
timetable for the yuan's capital-account and free convertibility,
the spokesman said, adding such convertibility depends on China's
macro-control ability, the ability of Chinese enterprises to adapt
to the market and overall economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China exercises strict control on the capital
account, which includes direct investment, international loans and
security trading, in order to avoid fluctuations in the financial
market.

<P>
Chinese scientists have more evidence to their credit. During
December 10 last year and January 2 this year, scientists at
Qinghai Observatory in northwest China's Qinghai Province recorded
the spectrum of the comet's carbon monoxide with a 13.7-mmw radio
telescope.
</P>
<P>
The calculation based on 68 observations proved that the comet
produces a 30th power of ten carbon monoxide every second, much
more than that of Halley's Comet when positioned at the same
distance from the sun.
</P>
<P>
The sudden increase in magnitude when the comet exploded showed
that the comet has great power and violent activity, scientists at
the Purple Mountain Observatory, in the capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province, explained.
</P>
<P>
The increase of carbon monoxide, the main component of the
comet, also showed that the comet is in an active period. The
frequency of the comet's explosion and its degree of violence are
much greater than those of Halley's Comet, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Hale-Bopp will reach the proximity of the sun in March this
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- India's Expert Committee on
Small Scale Industries has in a recent report emphasized the need
to liberalize the sector for its fast development.
</P>
<P>
The committee has proposed to completely abolish the list of
products currently reserved for small industries, scrap the
24-percent equity participation ceiling by large companies and
foreign investors, increase the investment ceiling from 500,000
rupees (14,084.51 U.S. dollars) to 2.5 million rupees (70,000
dollars) for tiny units and from 6 million rupees (170,000
dollars) to 30 million rupees (850,000 dollars ) for small
industries.
</P>
<P>
It has also proposed setting up a corpus of 5,000 million
rupees (140.85 million dollars ) on an annual basis to support
small industries and earmarking 70 percent priority sector lending
for the tiny sector.
</P>
<P>
The committee has also recommended the formation of a steering
committee under the chairmanship of the industry minister to
oversee the evolution of the new policy approach suggested in its
report.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister M. Maran, who was given a copy of the report,
said the government would implement the uncontroversial parts of
the recommendations as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Reviews Employment Policy for Creating Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is in
the process of reviewing its policy for creating more jobs as the
country is under growing employment pressure.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba Monday told a national
workshop on "Employment Policy Review in Nepal" here that the
review comes timely as the government is preparing to formulate
the Ninth Development Plan to be implemented beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
Poverty alleviation will be the prime objective of the plan and
its long-term goal is to bring down the proportion of population
below the poverty line from 42 percent at present to 15 percent by
2015, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stating that job creation will be emphasized more than ever
before, the prime minister said a two-pronged strategy has been
adopted with a view to enhancing employment promotion and economic
growth and launching special employment programs.
</P>
<P>
The job-generating programs will mainly focus on vocational
training to prepare the youths in the country for such emerging
sectors like tourism, industry, banking, transport, construction
and power production, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need of massive rural skill training to
tap employment opportunities in the country's vast
poverty-stricken rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The one-day workshop on Nepal's employment policy was held by
the International Labor Organization (ILO) with the objective of
helping Nepal work out a concrete employment strategy.
</P>
<P>
According to an ILO report recently published here, employment
conditions in Nepal are likely to deteriorate rapidly unless a
coherent strategy for improving them is urgently put in place.
</P>
<P>
The report said around 40 to 50 percent of Nepali workers are
underemployed and urban unemployment, particularly among educated
youths, is emerging as a major problem.

<HEADLINE> Global Debate to Focus on "Network Society" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 27(Xinhua) -- The threats and opportunities
created by technology and the digital revolution, and its impact
on the world, will be discussed later this week when government and
business leaders from all over the world gather in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"Building the Network Society" will be the central theme of the
World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conference will explore the temendous repercussions of the
digital revolution on the strategies of businesses around the
world, on the way people conduct business, and on society as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
WEF Managing Director Claude Smadja said the network society
could bring about "an exacerbation of social and political
tensions at the national and international levels".
</P>
<P>
"We cannot sit idly waiting for technological change to take
its course," Smadja said. There is need to "build" the network
society around new partnerships, to bring along social, economic
and political concepts."
</P>
<P>
Without any guidance, it could widen the gap between those who
have access to knowledge and information and have learned to
master these assets, and those who are increasingly on the
sidelines, unable to adjust and recycle their skills to the
ever-increasing requirements of the global economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
With proper guidance, Smadua said, "the digital revolution
might play the role of a 'great equalizer' between the 'knows' and
the 'know-nots', between industrialized and emerging countries by
allowing the latter to leap-frog their economic development'.
</P>
<P>
To spread the message worldwide, leaders in the information
technology have been invited to talk to thousands of government
leaders, bussinessmen and journalists.
</P>
<P>
The speakers include many giants in the technology field - Bill
Gates, Chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Microsoft;
Andy Grove, President and CEO of Intel; Lewis Platt, President and
GEO of Hewlett Packard; and Jack Welch, Chairman and CEO of
General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
On February 3, a new global visual network developed by the WEF
will be launched in Davos. The system, named WELCOM -- World
Electronic Community, is said for the first time to provide WEF's
community of global leaders from business, government and academia
with a "secure, private, high-level and reliable" global visional
communications network.
</P>
<P>
WEF founder and president Klaus Schwab said "WELCOM is a direct
reflection of the Forum's commitment to enable members to shape
the direction and influence the impact of this rapidly emerging
society on a global basis."
</P>
<P>
The WEF is a private organization which holds an annual
gathering of business and government leaders and academics to
discuss global economic issues.

<HEADLINE> Chile Defends Military Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government today
rejected a report by the Washington-based Peace Institute claiming
Chile's armed forces had embarked on an arms race.
</P>
<P>
It also denied a United Nations report that Chile has the
biggest military budget in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Peace Institute report, acting interior
minister Edgardo Riveros said the armed forces were purchasing
arms on a replacement and replenishment basis, not to increase
their weaponry.
</P>
<P>
And Mariano Fernandez, acting foreign minister, said that Chile
is reducing its spending on weapons purchases.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report, by the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (CEPAL) said Chile's defense spending
was 3.5 percent of gross domestic product, well above the average
regional defense spending of 1.6 percent of GDP and above the
average ratio of 3 percent of GDP by industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Defense Committee for the Chamber of Deputies
(lower house of parliament), Vicente Sota, denied the
U.N. report's findings and said Chile is spending 1.56 percent of
its gross domestic product (GDP) on defence.
</P>
<P>
Sota said Chile had successfully reduced defense cost in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Recalling Chile's defense spending in 1991 which was 1.5 times
the education budget, Sota said the situation "is now exactly the
opposite", with 1.5 billion U.S. dollars spent on defense and 3
billion dollars on education.

<HEADLINE> Sunken Warship Lifted Out of Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- "Chungshan" Cruiser, which has
been sleeping on the bed of the Yangtze River for nearly 59 years,
rose to water surface today.
</P>
<P>
Part of the warship can be seen above the water surface at the
salvage site of Jinkou town, central China's Hubei Province. The
warship has been lifted some two meters above the river, one meter
higher than it was yesterday. But it still has a draught of five
meters.
</P>
<P>
The Cruiser, named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen, father of the Chinese
Democratic Revolution, was sunk at Wuhan October 24, 1938, after
having shot down three Japanese fighters in China's Anti-Japanese
Aggression War (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held at the salvage site this morning. State
Councillor Li Tieying was on site watching the salvage operation.
</P>
<P>
"Chungshan" is now in the water 90 meters away from the
southern bank of the Yangtze River. The warship is very much
sloping to the north, however, with the ship stem emerging over
two meters out of the water.
</P>
<P>
Workers will move "Chungshan" to the right position before
removing all bomb shells, mud and sand off the warship. The
Cruiser will towed some 24 kilometers to a shipyard and receive
reparation.
</P>
<P>
The 62.1-meter-long and 8.9-meter-wide cruiser was built in
Japan in 1913. Weighing 780 tons, "Chungshan" weighs even more in
China's history. It has been connected with a famous historical
event -- the Cruiser Chungshan Incident -- when Chiang Kai-shek
betrayed the revolution, created the incident and launched a
surprise attack on the Chinese Communist Party March 20, 1926.
</P>
<P>
The salvage operation started on November 12, 1996, the 130th
anniversary of Dr. Sun's birthday, and is scheduled to finish in
February, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Estimation showed that the salvage project will cost about five
million yuan (about 600,000 U.S. dollars) and the expenditures for
its protection, repairs and display will reach 84 million yuan
(about one million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Brazil Seeks More Exports to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian Foreign
Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said today he hoped a trade dispute
with the United States over barriers to Brazilian steel exports to
the U.S. would be sorted out in March.
</P>
<P>
He said the issue would be discussed when Brazil's President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso meets U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington on March 17.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony to inaugurate Joel Korn as the new
president of the American Chamber of Commerce here, the minister
said he hoped the meeting would lead to increased Brazilian
exports to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
He said Brazil's trade deficit with the United States has
reached 3 billion U.S. dollars, due partly to barriers imposed on
Brazilian exports, particularly steel, orange juice, textiles and
footwear, where Brazil is highly competitive.
</P>
<P>
Brazil faced tariff and non-tariff barriers, such as sanitary
and technical standards, as well as antidumping and countervailing
duty processes, he added.
</P>
<P>
But although he believed an agreement on steel could be reached
at the March 17 meeting, he saw no sign of a solution to the
problems regarding orange juice and other agricultural products.

<HEADLINE> Chile Rejects Carter's Comment on Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government
rejected and deplored former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's comment
that the democracy in Chile had shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
The rejection, made through Acting Foreign Minister Mariano
Fernandez, followed Carter's labeling of Chile as an anachronism
during his recent visit here and to other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
To back his labeling, Carter charged that the Chilean
government was not able to extricate itself from military tutelage
and remove the commanders in chief of its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Fernandez said that every democracy could be
perfected and that President Eduardo Frei recently announced a
series of constitutional reforms in the 9th district of Chile.
</P>
<P>
The measures were meant to optimize democracy and they had
"nothing to do with shortcomings in it," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez stressed that "the people who govern Chile are
convinced that it is a perfectly democratic country and the
opposition parties and the people believe so."
</P>
<P>
"For that reason," he added, "we don't see why we have to give
any explanation about whether or not the commanders in chief are
elected or designated in one way or another."
</P>
<P>
Gutenberg Martinez, the president of Chile's chamber of
deputies, emphasized today that good relations are existing in
Chile between the military and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary leader said that the army "is already where
it should be. It is disposed to collaborate with its country, the
state, the Chilean nation."

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Expected to See Weak Recovery in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy is expected to
undergo a weak recovery this year and the country's National
Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) is predicting the
growth rate at 7.1 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports are expected to rise by 11.6 percent this
year based on a forecast zero-growth last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's current account deficit is likely to lower to 396
billion baht (15.8 billion U.S. dollars), or 7.7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product, slightly down from last year,
according to NESDB data available today.
</P>
<P>
Inflation may be brought down to 5 percent, the board says.
</P>
<P>
The brighter economic outlook for Thailand is based on an
improving world economy, in particular in key markets like Japan
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Recovering markets for electronic products will boost Thai
exports to other Southeast Asian countries, while a weakening baht
against the U.S. dollar will make Thai goods more competitive
abroad, the NESDB said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economic growth rate was estimated at around 6.8
percent in 1996, the lowest during the past decade. The slowdown
of its exports was believed to be the main factor behind the
country's economic downtrend last year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Bans CFC Use in Home Refrigerators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will ban the use of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) in all household refrigerators and spray
products, effective next month.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Economic Ministers ruled at a meeting on Monday
that imported products using CFC would also be banned, as would
new factories that use the chemicals in their production.
</P>
<P>
However, makers of commercial and industrial refrigerators will
have until the start of 1998 to stop using the chemicals, which
are banned under the Montreal Protocol. Thailand ratified the
protocol in 1989.
</P>
<P>
CFC, used as a coolant in refrigerators and as a propellant in
sprays, is linked to the destruction of the earth's protective
ozone layer and subsequent global warming.
</P>
<P>
Household refrigerator producers in Thailand, such as
Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Singer, said they already stopped using
CFC early this month.
</P>
<P>
Exporters are under pressure to eliminate CFC use because many
countries, including members of the European Union, prohibit the
import of refrigerators using CFC starting this year.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Builds China's Largest Drip Irrigation Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China's largest drip irrigation
area, spanning 340 hectares, has been built in Northwest
China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The irrigation area in the Malutan Forestry Center in Gulang
County has introduced Israeli drip irrigation equipment.
</P>
<P>
The center faces the Tengger Desert and suffers from serious
desertification problems.
</P>
<P>
Hu Shengyong, head of the forestry center, said that the
Israeli equipment had proved to be very effective in terms of
water saving.
</P>
<P>
Previously, he said, one hectare of fruit trees needed 10,200
cubic meters of water, while only 2,085 cubic meters of water is
needed with the drip irrigation facilities.
</P>
<P>
The area, 1,700 meters above sea level, has an annual rainfall
of 183 mm, while the evaporation rate reaches up to 2,800 mm.
</P>
<P>
The forestry center, established in 1991, has planted a
22-kilometer long sand-defense tree-belt, and reclaimed hectares
of fruit-tree land with the help of drip irrigation technology.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the Israeli technology not only saved water but also
land and working hours.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province, suffering severe water shortages in
agricultural development, has decided to spread drip
irrigation technology to more areas.
</P>
<P>
Wuwei Prefecture is to introduce the technology for trees
planting across 666 hectares of land in the coming year.

MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and the Philippine government are close to
resolving their differences over the country's official
development assistance (ODA) law, a local newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
An end to this dispute will pave the way for the implementation
of ADB-assisted projects, which were affected due to the ongoing
negotiations between the ADB and the government, the Manila
Chronicle said.
</P>
<P>
ADB officials were just awaiting a letter from the National
Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) assuring that provisions
of the ODA law would not hamper the implementation of the
ADB-assisted projects, the paper quoted a NEDA official as saying
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Josefina Esguerra, NEDA director for public investment staff,
said the ADB wanted a clear interpretation of the ODA law,
particularly the section that requires projects to obtain prior
congressional approval before negotiation and implementation of
projects funded by ODA loans can proceed.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is the only ODA donor that has yet to accept the
government's explanation of its ODA law. The World Bank, Japan's
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and other official creditors
and multilateral institutions have already accepted the law.
</P>
<P>
The ADB, currently the Philippines' biggest multilateral source
of concessional loans, has agreed to provide 405 million U.S.
dollars to the country over the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Defenses Conclude Closing Argument at Simpson's Civil Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January, 27 (Xinhua) -- Former American football
star O.J.Simpson's lawyers claimed Monday in his final remarks of
the civil trial that police had planted evidence to deceive the
court.
</P>
<P>
Robert Baker, Simpson's principal defense lawyer, said two
pieces of evidence found in Simpson's home -- a glove and some
bloodstained socks -- were deliberately planted, blaming in
particular one policeman Mark fuhrman, who he described as that
"rogue Fuhrman".
</P>
<P>
Mark Fuhrman was convicted of lying on the court when he was
depositing for Simpson's killing his ex-wife Nicole Brown and
Ronald Goldman trial.
</P>
<P>
Fuhrman had claimed during the trial he did not use the word
"nigger".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing argument, Baker said there was neither
motive nor time for Simpson to slash Niclole and Goldman to death
on June 12, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Baker's closing was followed by rebuttal arguments from lawyers
Daniel Petrocelli and Tom Lambert, and the jury wasn't likely to
get the case until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At least nine of the 12 jurors must agree to find Simpson
responsible for the deaths and award damages to the victims'
families.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Government's Foreign Debt Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government's
foreign debt fell to 54.6 billion U.S. dollars last November from
57.22 billion dollars in September and 59.59 billion dollars at
the end of 1995, a senior official announced.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad told a House of
Representatives plenary session Monday that the remaining 54.6
billion dollars debt has a cumulative interest value of 21.4
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not disclose the size of private foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
However, Bank Indonesia Governor J. Soedradjad Djiwandono
revealed earlier this month that the country's total foreign debt
had reached about 110 billion dollars, indicating that private
foreign debt was about 55 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said the reduction of government foreign debt was due
mainly to early repayment of high-interest debts and a sharp
depreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The government has repaid 2.6 billion dollars in foreign debt
ahead of schedule since the 1994/95 fiscal year, saving the
government 1.45 billion rupiah (about 600,000 dollars) in interest
payments.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government has repaid its high-interest
loans with budget surpluses and proceeds from the sale of
government shares in state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government would continue to repay its high-interest loans
in the coming years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Although the government's external debt is decreasing, Mar'ie
said, the country's debt service ratio -- the ratio of foreign
debt servicing to export revenue -- would not reach the 25-percent
target by 1999 because of increasing private debt.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's debt service ratio would reach 31.7 percent
by the end of the 1996/97 fiscal year (from April 1, 1996, to
March 31, 1997), of which government debt would contribute 14.1
percent, private debt 15.5 percent and state enterprise debt 2.1
percent.

BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:

<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- A front-page story described Qiu E'guo as a model
policeman. Qiu, who has been a policeman for 17 years in the
Jiangxi provincial capital of Nanchang, is always ready to give a
helping hand to those needing help. He tries his best to help
local residents solve various kinds of difficulties in their daily
lives.
</P>

"People's Daily" (overseas edition)
</P>
<P>
-- China is now enjoying a stable balance of international
payments, a senior Chinese official said here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China's foreign exchange situation showed a sound
development trend, along with the remarkable achievements in the
country's macro-economic control and the evident improvement of
the economic and financial situation, according to Zhou Xiaochuan,
Director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).
He estimated that there would be a balance of international
payments under current accounts, with a little surplus, while
there would be a relatively big surplus for capital accounts.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- The best path to follow for China's urban housing reform
lies in the establishment of a public housing fund system and
commercializing apartments, said Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
At a recent national conference on housing reform, Zhu said
that the people face the immediate need to improve their
living conditions, and housing funds have to be raised from the
state, businesses or institutions and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The public housing fund system requires that individuals turn
in a certain portion of their income, their work units set aside
supportive funds, and at the same time the state gives financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
In this way, steady and low-cost housing funds can be made
available, Zhu said. The practice in some places proves that the
method is effective in promoting the construction of more urban
housing.
</P>
<P>
-- China will step up the fight against corruption in the new
year, based on the nationwide achievements made in 1996, a senior
Communist Party official said here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, secretary of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
called for intensified supervision to be enforced among Party
members, and more supervision over Party members by the masses of
people.
</P>
<P>
The spirit of hard work and thriftiness should be carried
forward, and the malpractice of spending public money
lavishly must be halted, said Wei, also a member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, at the commission's eighth
plenary session which opened yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is essential to build up a contingent of
high-quality and competent officials to oversee disciplinary
inspection, he noted.

</P>
<P>
-- Co-operation between police in China and other countries
yielded great achievements in battling crime in 1996, said China's
Interpol chief Zhu Entao.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police carried out visits, scientific and technological
training, co-investigations of cases and joint crackdowns on crime
along with police in dozens of countries in 1996.
</P>
<P>
-- China will invest 1.5 percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP) in environmental protection during the remaining years of
this century, meaning an average of 65 billion yuan (about 7.8
billion U.S. dollars) will be spent annually on "green" projects.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta's Market Rocked by Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A violent clash between
hundreds of roadside vendors and city public order officials in
Tanah Abang Market, Central Jakarta, capital of Indonesia,
culminated Monday in the burning of two municipal buildings and
seven cars, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Around 300 traders became angry, apparently after the
authorities intervened during selling in the busy marketplace,
Seargen Suyatno from the Tanah Abang police post said.
</P>
<P>
A street vendor was dragged about six meters away to death by a
car of Jakarta's order restoration squad at 10:30 a.m. when it was
sweeping Tanah Abang.
</P>
<P>
The incident gave rise to anger among other street vendors.
They ran amok, burning the district head's office buildings and
seven cars.
</P>
<P>
Members of the squad were captured by the angry mob and were
trampled and beaten, suffering serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Some injured street vendors and order restoration officers were
taken to nearby hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The authorities blocked the roads and diverted the traffic,
causing chaos for more than four hours.
</P>
<P>
It took hundreds of police and troops, armed with iron shields,
rattan sticks and rifles, four hours to disperse the mob. Traders
in the market building and street vendors resumed business as
usual at around 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Central Jakarta Police Precinct M. Ibrahim said 11
people were arrested in connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
Central Jakarta Mayor Abdul Kahfi said the clash was probably
incited by hoodlums and the parties behind the riots would be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
Tanah Abang is the center of Jakarta's textile trade with an
estimated daily turnover of billions of rupiah.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city of Shanghai
has maintained a rapid development of its industrial sector,
offsetting the negative impact of a price-hike in raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The total output value of its industry rose 15.5 percent in
1996, while the industrial sales and exports posted an
increase of 14.8 percent and 14.3 percent respectively over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The city government took effective measures to tackle the
sluggish market, the slow rise in investment and the increasingly
difficult export sector, which has resulted in a 97.8 percent of
sale to production ratio in the local industry last year.
</P>
<P>
Exploring international and domestic markets is the driving
force behind the development of the local industry, the local
government believes.
</P>
<P>
To meet market demands, the city has developed 250,000 new
products which brought a total 60 billion yuan earnings to
Shanghai last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Shanghai strengthened its economic ties with other
parts of the country and invested 1.82 billion yuan setting up 100
new inter-regional enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Pillar industries and large companies have played a major role
in the local economic development. In 1996, The city's six pillar
sectors, namely, automobiles, telecommunications, power generation
equipment, iron and steel, petrochemicals and household electrical
 appliances, generated 185.4 billion yuan in output value, up 17.4
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts made by the city government, Shanghai
met its annual targets of completing 12 key industrial
projects and 50 key technological upgrading projects in
1996.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Panama will pay 106.3
million dollars to settle an oil debt with Venezuela, said
Venezuelan Ambassador Luis Ochoa Terna here today.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Poleto, the president of the Venezuelan Investment
Fund, will come to Panama during the first week of February to
initiate negotiations in this regard, Ochoa said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that the overdue payment of Panama's oil
debt with Venezuela has been settled and that a joint meeting will
be held in Caracas to carry out the final negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of last year, Panama's oil debt payment was
suspended when the Venezuelan Investment Fund's president
postponed his visit to this Panamanian capital.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Carlos Vallarino, Panama's deputy minister of
Planning and Economic Policy, said that the cabinet had approved
another 195 million dollars to finance the debt payment.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be transferred to Venezuela through the Banco
Nacional de Panama, the central bank of this Central American
country.

<HEADLINE> Social Crisis Threathens Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainians are dying on average
two years younger than before because of worsening pollution, the
impact of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and the country's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Society is also being affected by an ageing population,
unemployment and poor healthcare.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the government show that the country's mortality
rate is rising, resulting in a fall in the population. Official
figures say the number of deaths was 314,000 more than births
between 1991 and 1996, partly due to shortages of medicine and
drugs and skyrocketing prices.
</P>
<P>
That's led to a huge increase in the number of people affected
by disease. Over the last five years, more than 2,000 people have
contracted cholera, some 17,000 people are suffering from
diphtheria and the incidence of hepatitis and polio has also
increased.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine also has the highest number of AIDS patients and
carriers of all former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
Young people are also being affected. Teenagers and children
are increasingly falling victim to diseases such as tuberculosis
and syphilis.
</P>
<P>
Many children have no access to medical care and good
nutrition. In so-called "clean" areas, only 40 percent of children
are regarded as healthy, a figure which falls to just 27 percent
in areas affected by epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic woes have also affected the country's
social fabric. An increasing number of parents are becoming
alcoholics or drug addicts and many children are being left at
boarding schools without parental care.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government recently set up the Ministryof Youth
and Family Affairs to handle the country's social crisis. However,
experts say these problems cannot really be solved until Ukraine
lifts itself out of its economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Focus on Battery-Powered Bikes, Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China's largest industrial
city, Shanghai, plans to replace petrol-powered cycles with
battery-run models to cut down on pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai had 470,000 petrol-powered bicycles by the end of
1996," said Wu Tingman, director of the Municipal Battery-Powered
Industrial Development Center, "their exhaust gases have brought
about severe pollution to the city."
</P>
<P>
The municipal government plans to limit the number of
gas-powered vehicles to 100,000 by the end of this century as the
first step to the introduction of battery-powered bikes, according
to Wu.
</P>
<P>
A new type of nickel-hydrogen battery has been newly developed
by the Shenjian Metallurgical and Machinery Electrical
Technology Engineering Company. The battery is viewed as a
revolutionary technological breakthrough, as a suitable power
source is the key for the manufacturing of battery-powered cycles,
according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
The new battery can be quickly recharged and it causes no
pollution, with each charge enough to keep a cycle running for 40
kilometers, Wu said. The lifespan of the battery is 15,000
km., he said.
</P>
<P>
The company has already assembled cycles powered with the new
type of battery and they have been displayed at domestic and
international exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to mass produce this kind of cycles which will
sell for around 3,000 yuan or less each, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Some local experts noted that the introduction of
battery-operated cycles is the first step to the widespread
manufacture of battery-run cars.
</P>
<P>
The development of battery-powered vehicles, including
battery-powered cycles, battery-powered motorcycles and
battery-powered cars, will boost the development of other sectors
such as metallurgical, organic chemical and electronic industries,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to make 300 cycles and 100 motors equipped with
the battery by July, 1997, and by the end of this century, the
city will build 10 "concept battery-powered cars", according to
the sources.

<HEADLINE> NZ Records Worst Current Account Deficit in Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand last year
chalked up the highest balance of payments deficit in a decade,
official figures show.
</P>
<P>
Statistics NZ said in a media release received today that in
the year ending September 1996, the country's current account
deficit stood at 4.2 billion NZ dollars (about 2.9 billion U.S.
dollars), the highest since the year ending December 1987.
</P>
<P>
The current account reflects the difference between what a
country earns and what it spends.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country's current account deficit represents
4.6 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 5.1 percent
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The deficit had been on the decline after 1987, but began to
pick up again in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The latest deficit, compared with 3.9 billion NZ dollars (about
2.7 billion U.S. dollars) a year earlier, was attributed to a
higher NZ dollar, which affected the country's export. The other
big contributor was the fall in the flow of migrants and their
fund transfers to New Zealand, following the tightening of
immigration policy last year.

<HEADLINE> China's Link with Interpol Further Fastened in 1996 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Co-operation between police in
China and other countries yielded great achievements in battling
crime in 1996, China's Interpol chief Zhu Entao has said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese police carried out visits, scientific and technological
training, co-investigations of cases and joint crackdowns on crime
along with police in dozens of other countries last year, Zhu was
quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to such co-operation, a number of suspects were caught
and many cases were cracked, according to Zhu, chief
representative of the China National Bureau of the International
Criminal Police Organization (ICPO-Interpol).
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China strengthened cooperation with police
in surrounding countries to ensure security in border areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said today's world leaders deem exchanges and co-operation
in fighting crime as an important part of their countries' foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
During Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to China in
April of 1996, Chinese president Jiang Zemin and Yeltsin co-chaired
the signing ceremony of a drug-control agreement between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Then in August, China and Russia held a meeting on
strengthening cooperation in exchanging information about criminal
cases and in jointly fighting cross-border crime.
</P>
<P>
China also signed bilateral drug-control agreements with three
other countries in 1996, through which efforts to fight drug
crimes were greatly enhanced, said Zhu, who also is assistant
minister of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
During President Jiang's visit to Africa in May last year,
Public Security Minister Tao Siju, who was among Jiang's entourage,
made contacts with minister of internal affairs and helped deepen
mutual understanding and cooperation.

<P>
In the past year, Zhu said, scientific and technological
exchanges between China and other countries were boosted.
</P>
<P>
China has invited foreign counterparts to give lectures on
their practices in battling crime and in maintaining social
order. The nation also sent delegations abroad to learn about
other countries' experiences or to receive training.
</P>
<P>
In addition to bilateral cooperation, China participated in
multilateral cooperation among world police organs, he said.
</P>
<P>
In June of 1996, a Chinese delegation led by Zhu, who also is
honorary vice-president of Interpol, participated in an Interpol
regional meeting of Asia which was focused on examining
characteristics of crimes in Asia and expanding regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In October, a Chinese delegation led by Zhu attended the 65th
Interpol General Assembly in Turkey along with more than 140 other
member nations. Zhu gave a speech on trends amid today's violence,
drug-related, financial and economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
In November, the International Amphetamine-Type Stimulants
Meeting, co-sponsored by the Chinese Government and the United
Nations Drug Control Program, was held in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In December, delegations of the Interpol China National Bureau
and Hong Kong Sub-Bureau met for the 24th time, discussing
measures to better combat cross-border crimes so as to maintain
security and ensure the smooth return of Hong Kong to the
sovereignty of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and Eddie Hui Ki-on, Hong Kong's police commissioner,
reached consensus on closer ties in combating illegal entry,
cultural-relics smuggling, organized crime, drug trafficking and
economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 20 suspects wanted by Hong Kong police were caught
and returned to Hong Kong by inland police.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pledged that in 1997, China will work more closely and make
more frequent exchanges with police of other countries, with a
continued emphasis on neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prefer Mediation to Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has shown that
just 12 percent of people polled said they would choose court
action if a dispute could be solved by mediation or other
means, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The survey report said that the tendency to avoid lawsuit
results from the traditional Chinese idea of cherishing mutual
concession and the imperfect lawsuit functions of ther current
legal structure.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing based English newspaper quoted an official with
the China Social Investigation Office as saying that, China has
more than ten million People's Mediation Committees, with
mediators who deal with an annual average of six million civil
disputes, and only 500,000 civil cases a year end in court
judgements.
</P>
<P>
Survey questionnaires were sent to 1,500 people across the
country. The aim was to acquire a basic picture of Chinese
citizens' legal knowledge and their views on the operation of the
law.
</P>
<P>
The survey concluded that the positive role of mediation can
not be denied. However, negative results which harm parties'
interests may be produced if mutual understanding and concession is
overemphasized and when the basic principle of mediating in line
with the law is forgotten.
</P>
<P>
The poll found that, with the development of a market economy,
people's awareness of rights and interests has been
strengthened. About 60 percent of respondents said the most
important thing in their social lives was respecting individual
freedom and interests.
</P>
<P>
Some 65 percent of people maintained that public interests
should be given priority when it contradicts individual interests,
while 18 percent expressed the opposite view.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were considered the
most law-abiding social group by about 32 percent of respondents.
</P>
<P>
About 45 percent of those surveyed agreed that corruption and
bribery were terrible crimes that should be seriously punished,
the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Cabs Catch up with Lhasa Residents' Daily Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- People in Lhasa, the capital city
in the Himalayan region have swapped their yaks as a means of
transportation for a fleet of taxis.
</P>
<P>
Business for taxi drivers in Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, is thriving as Tibetans prepare for the New
Year of Ox, the second in the 12-year cycle of the Asian zodiac.
</P>
<P>
Taxi driver Basang waited to pick up a fare at a taxi stand in
front of the downtown Landun Department Store.
</P>
<P>
"This Tibetan New Year almost coincides with the Chinese New
Year, and both Chinese and Tibetans in the city are busy with
Spring Festival shopping," said the young man with a Lhasa
suburban accent.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Basang bought a Charlet car, the most usual type
for Chinese urban cabs, and became his own boss after resigning
from his post in a governmental institution.
</P>
<P>
"The business is on fire," he said, pointing out that he can
earn monthly more than 3,000 yuan (about 365 US dollars), over
seven times the average monthly income of common Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The fleet of Taxis shuttling through the city shows its
residents and visitors a modern flavor, with the backdrop of
mountains and unique lamaseries a reminder of the local landscape
and culture.
</P>
<P>
The director of Lhasa's Taxi Management Office, Liang Chang,
said that the city started its cab service in 1986 with only one
cab. But by the end of the second half of last year the number had
sharply increased to more than 500.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition requires that cab drivers upgrade their cars
as well as the service they offer, he said.
</P>
<P>
More drivers crowd into the world's highest markets in an area
known as the roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
Some urban residents, people from neighboring Xigaze City,
in adjacent Sichuan Province and even economically developed coastal
Zhejiang Province, profit from the business, with their
incomes ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 yuan according to different
individual efforts.
</P>
<P>
A fashionable Tibetan girl stood in Youth Street to flag
down a taxi.
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about traffic now because there are so many
cabs," she said, "And my mother enjoys taking cab, but she used to
be shy even to ride a bus in the past."

<HEADLINE> UNTAES to Open Offices Throughout Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Transitional
Administration in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) will open 23 offices
by the end of this week in the region to issue citizenship
certificates to local people.
</P>
<P>
UNTAES spokesman Philip Arnolds told a news conference Monday
in Vukvar that those who lived in the region before 1991 will be
able to get citizenship certificates, identity cards and other
papers necessary for their registration for the upcoming general
elections in Croatia slated for Autumn.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 people had so far obtained citizenship
certificates and identity cards through the UNTAES, Tanjug news
agency quoted him as said.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Slavonia region, located in northeastern Croatia
bordering Yugoslavia, is the only place still controlled by the
Serbs in Croatia. The other three Serb regions were overrun by the
Croatian government troops in 1995, which drove tens of thousands
of Serbs out of their home to Bosnia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Serb-dominated region was placed under the transitional
U.N. administration in line with the Erdut agreement signed in
November 1995 by the local Serb authority and Croatian government.
The U.N. administration will expire in July, 1997 if the Croatian
government does not allow the extension of the U.N. mandate for
another six months.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the international community's obligations after the
region comes under Croatia's rule, Arnolds said the Erdut
agreement envisaged the presence of international observers for a
number of years after the UNTAES term ends.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the return of Serb refugees to their homes in
Croatia, Arnolds said the return of Serbs to West Slavonia and
other parts of Croatia was the most difficult issue and should
primarily be the concern of the UNHCR, which has launched a pilot
project for the return of Serbs to West Slavonia and of Croats to
East Slavonia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Serbs could live anywhere in Croatia provided
they were Croatian citizens, and noted that the UNHCR, the
international community and the Erdut agreement were very clear on
that point.
</P>
<P>
About 60,000-70,000 people who lived in the region before 1991
have the right to return, he said, but added that only a hundred
people had returned to West Slavonia so far due to housing
problems.

LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Most of the three major stock
markets in Europe Monday ended the first trading session of the
week weaker with low trading volumes, depressed by another poor
opening on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London had been flat during the whole morning
before ending 6.8 points down at 4,212.0, dragged down by a weaker
Dow.
</P>
<P>
J. Sainsbury, one of Britain's major supermarket chains which
had lost 13 percent last Friday, took supermarket shares once
again lower on Monday amid fears of a price war.
</P>
<P>
On the Frankfurt market, which closed before the Dow opened,
German shares also finished slightly lower in flat trading, with
the DAX-30 index 3.71 points down at 2,994.53.
</P>
<P>
Dealers were nervous and uneasy ahead of key U.S. employment
cost data due out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Early gains on the Paris bourse, made on the back of a stronger
dollar, were largely wiped out as falls on Wall Street undermined
investor confidence, which led the CAC-40 index only 4.83 points
higher at 2,435.17 at the close.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended 6.8
points down at 4,212.0. In Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index finished

WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The White House said today a
summit meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was expected this year, but the time and
place would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The White House announced in December that Clinton and Yeltsin,
had agreed to meet in March but had not set an exact date or
venue.
</P>
<P>
As Yeltsin underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery last year
and is now recovering from pneumonia, the time of March may be
open to question.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see as we continue to work through with the Russian
government...whether that still suggests itself as a time," White
House spokesman Mike McCurry said at a regular news briefing
today.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said he expected the matter to be discussed when Vice
President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomydrin
meet early next month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We have not set a time or place for the meeting that we expect
to occur later this year between President Yeltsin and President
Clinton," McCurry added.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Police Arrest Ethnic Albanian Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Serbian police said on Monday
they had arrested the leader and some members of an ethnic
Albanian terrorist organization in Serbia's Kosovo province on
suspicion of plotting an armed rebellion.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Interior Ministry's statement said police had
arrested on Sunday in the provincial capital Pristina 32-year-old
Avni Klinaku and several other members of the clandestine national
movement for the liberation of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Klinaku became head of this terrorist organization in 1991,
and has been in hiding since 1993," official Tanjug news agency
quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
He and his followers are believed to have organized terrorist
groups for attacks on prominent individuals and vital facilities
in Kosovo and to have plotted an armed rebellion, it said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2 million population in Kosovo in southern
Serbia, with 90 percent being ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the arrested terrorists were found to
possess arms and ammunition of various calibres, plans of attack
on facilities, and other equipment for carrying out terrorist
operations.
</P>
<P>
Further investigation on the matter were going on, it added.
</P>
<P>
A strong ethnic Albanian separatist movement has been operating
in Kosovo for decades, and its leaders have unlawfully declared
Kosovo a republic.
</P>
<P>
The movement is striving to win independence of the province
from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and annex it to
neighboring Albania, and to this end resorts to terrorist attacks
on police officers and citizens in the area.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, a Pristina University Rector and his driver, were
seriously injured in a car bomb explosion in Pristina. No one has
claimed responsibility to the incident and investigation is still
under way.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A former Albanian police officer
and one other person have been arrested in Ioannina, northern
Greece for attempting to sell more than 18 kilos of cannabis to a
police officer posing as a buyer.

<HEADLINE> UNTAES to Open Offices Throughout Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Transitional
Administration in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) will open 23 offices
by the end of this week in the region to issue citizenship
certificates to local people.
</P>
<P>
UNTAES spokesman Philip Arnolds told a news conference Monday
in Vukvar that those who lived in the region before 1991 will be
able to get citizenship certificates, identity cards and other
papers necessary for their registration for the upcoming general
elections in Croatia slated for Autumn.
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 people had so far obtained citizenship
certificates and identity cards through the UNTAES, Tanjug news
agency quoted him as said.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Slavonia region, located in northeastern Croatia
bordering Yugoslavia, is the only place still controlled by the
Serbs in Croatia. The other three Serb regions were overrun by the
Croatian government troops in 1995, which drove tens of thousands
of Serbs out of their home to Bosnia and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Serb-dominated region was placed under the transitional
U.N. administration in line with the Erdut agreement signed in
November 1995 by the local Serb authority and Croatian government.
The U.N. administration will expire in July, 1997 if the Croatian
government does not allow the extension of the U.N. mandate for
another six months.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the international community's obligations after the
region comes under Croatia's rule, Arnolds said the Erdut
agreement envisaged the presence of international observers for a
number of years after the UNTAES term ends.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the return of Serb refugees to their homes in
Croatia, Arnolds said the return of Serbs to West Slavonia and
other parts of Croatia was the most difficult issue and should
primarily be the concern of the UNHCR, which has launched a pilot
project for the return of Serbs to West Slavonia and of Croats to
East Slavonia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Serbs could live anywhere in Croatia provided
thUrnal of Commerce reported here today that U.S.
chain-store retailers and mega-store operators are opening major
outlets from Indonesia to Italy. Such outlets are also known as
hypermarkets, a kind of huge department stores with spacious
parking lots,
</P>
<P>
Now household names such as Wal-Mart, The Gap and Toys 'R Us
have been migrated overseas in an accelerated pace over the last
decade, according to the report. The pace has picked up
substantially in recent years as new markets have liberalized, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Asian and Latin living standards have been elevated and the
global economy has spurred regional integration, it said.
</P>
<P>
The move abroad is doing more than adding billions of dollars
to the bottom lines of U.S. retailers, analysts say. It's also
expanding the market for competitive U.S. exporters.
</P>
<P>
Opening big malls overseas will bring profits to U.S. runners
although products on shelves are not necessarily U.S. made,
according to the report. In the process, other jobs in areas like
design and transportation are created.
</P>
<P>
Latin America has seen solid rises in consumer spending in the
past decade and and reduced barriers in markets like Brazil. And
East Asia has seen a young, newly emerging middle class and a
gradual breakdown of barriers in places like Japan.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. companies are buying their inventory overseas,
whether it's sold in an outlet in San Jose, California, or in
Santiago, Chile.
</P>
<P>
After a major restructuring in the early 1980s, J.C. Penney now
sells mostly apparel and half of its goods are sourced overseas in
80 different countries, the paper reported. The company has 1,240
stores in Latin America and 20 in Indonesia, the Philippines and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Kmart Corp., a pioneer in overseas retailing, buys products for
its foreign stores the same way it buys goods fro its 2,100 stores
in the United States, with some being sourced locally and some
imported.
</P>
<P>
Claire's Store, a Pembroke Pines, Florida, retailer with more
than 440 million U.S. dollars in annual revenue, still distributes
its goods from the United States to its nearly 200 stores in
Japan, Great Britain and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Zubak Says Muslims Fail to Close Down Mujaheddin Camps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- President of the Muslim-Croat
Federation Kresimir Zubak, a Croat, has stated that Mujaheddin
mercenaries are still active in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the independent Sarajevo magazine Slobodna Bosna
which published Monday, Zubak said he knew for certain that there
were Mujaheddin camps in Bosnia, which showed that Muslims had
failed to meet the obligation to close down all camps with foreign
combatants.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, all foreign mercenaries must leave
Bosnia one month after the peace accord was signed in December,
1995. But some Mujaheddin, who fought for the Muslim side during
the civil war, remained in Bosnia till now, posing a threat to the
NATO-led peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted the magazine as saying that Zubak
claimed he knew where the camps were located and was ready to
support his claim with documents.
</P>
<P>
But he denied the allegation that there were secret military
camps also in Croat-held territories, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
In another interview with the Zagreb daily Vjesnik Monday,
Zubak said he still believed that the Muslim's ruling Party of
Democratic Action (SDA) wanted to create an Islamic state in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, he said the SDA was not a civic party but a
religious and nationalist party.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the West, Bosnian Muslims and Croats formed
a federation in March, 1994 to fight against the Serbs. But within
the federation, the two ethnic groups have never stopped
quarreling with each other.

<HEADLINE> Israel Removes Bedouin Families In West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police today used
bulldozers to demolish five homes belonging to Jahalin Bedouins
near Ma'ale-Adummim Settlement east of Jerusalem, according to a
report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers and policemen raided the Bedouin encampment in
the morning after declaring the area a "closed military zone."
</P>
<P>
The Israelis claimed that they did so in accordance with an
Israeli High Court decision.
</P>
<P>
But the Bedouin tribesmen tried to resist the acts of
demolition. In clashes, eight Bedouins were injured after being
beaten by the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, two Jahalin families were forcibly removed to
an area adjacent to Abu Dis rubbish dump. The Israeli authorities
want to resettle the Bedouin tribe so as to clear the way for the
expansion of the Ma'ale Adummim Settlement.
</P>
<P>
Activists of Gush Shalom, Israeli Peace Bloc, gathered at the
Bedouin encampment protesting against the brutal action of the
Israeli authorities. They said in a statement that the move is one
more manifestation of the settlers' greed and expansion at the
expense of Palestinians, which threatens to destroy a new chance
of peace following the Hebron agreement signed 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening to the Jahalin is indicative of what
can happen to Palestinians who happen to be getting in the
way of the expansion of Israeli settlements," said a statement
issued by the Palestinian Center for the Study of Non-violence.

<HEADLINE> GM Truck Production Halted Because of Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Production was halted today
at a General Motors truck assembly plant in Dayton where a strike
by about 4,300 workers went into the second day.
</P>
<P>
Members of the International Union of Electrical Workers in the
GM plant voted against a three-year contract with GM and walked
off the job at midnight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
GM, the largest automaker in the world, had been negotiating
the contract with the union since last September.
</P>
<P>
The plant assembles the Chevrolet Blazer, GMC Jimmy and
Oldsmobile Bravada sport-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A union leader in the plant said that an agreement could be
reached quickly once talks resume. However, none were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
A GM spokesman said that production and maintenance workers at
the plant in this suburb of Dayton went on strike because the
company had not resolved some 800 grievances, including one over
the firing of 50 workers.
</P>
<P>
The GM spokesman said the strike should not affect other GM
plants. And production of the Blazer and Jimmy can be increased at
other GM plants.
</P>
<P>
An 18-day strike last year at two GM brake plants in Dayton
shut down many of the company's plants in Northern America.
