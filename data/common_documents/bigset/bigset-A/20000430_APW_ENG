Vietnam Marks War's End
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- From a garrison of sandbags and barbed
wire, a new Vietnam of high-rises and high-tech celebrated the 25th anniversary
of the end of the war Sunday with a colorful parade of thousands and a festival
of song and dance. An estimated 20,000 people gathered at Reunification Palace,
the centerpiece of the nationally televised celebrations that turned from a
military parade into a spring pageant of everything from floats to stilt
walkers, dragon dancers and child ballet performers. One float featured a globe
that opened up, releasing a flock of doves, symbolizing peace. The dignitaries
also included Communist Party chief Le Kha Phieu and Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai.

Thousands March For Elian in Little Havana
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tens of thousands of angry Cuban-Americans marched peacefully
through Miami's Little Havana on Saturday, protesting the raid in which armed
federal agents yanked 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from the home of relatives.
Police stayed visibly distant from the chanting demonstrators, many of whom
carried signs denouncing President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno for
taking Elian from his Miami relatives and sending him to his Cuban father. No
arrests were made during the demonstration.

Winds Drive Ariz. Forest Fire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Firefighters returned to work Saturday on a wind-driven
forest fire after sitting out the night to rest and avoid dangerous conditions.
By nightfall, authorities said crews had the blaze 10 percent contained.
However, there was no estimate for full containment because of high
temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. Dave Killebrew, a fire spokesman
for the Tonto National Forest, said, said 450 firefighters were assigned to the
5,370-acre blaze along with four airtankers and four helicopters. There were no
reports of injuries.

Mock Same-Sex Weddings Staged
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fresh from a victory that granted homosexuals
marriage-like rights in Vermont, Durant and Beach joined hundreds of other
couples Saturday on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in a bid to press even
wider acceptance for civil unions. Organizers said about 1,000 same-sex couples
exchanged rings and vows in front of friends, family and about a dozen
protesters, part of a weekend-long rally for gay, lesbian and bisexual rights
culminating in Sunday's Millennium March on the National Mall. It is the fourth
gathering on the Mall by gay and lesbian rights groups in the last 21 years.

Abu-Jamal Speaks at Antioch College
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio (AP) -- A death row inmate convicted of killing a police
officer spoke by audiotape to Antioch College's graduating class Saturday as
hundreds protested nearby, including the murder victim's widow. Students last
month invited Mumia Abu-Jamal, convicted in 1981 of killing Philadelphia
policeman Daniel Faulkner, to give the commencement address at the small private
college, about 15 miles east of Dayton. He didn't talk about his case, the death
penalty or policemen in his six-minute taped speech. Rather, he softly spoke of
the impact one person can have on the world, the topic students had requested.

Microsoft's 1st Battle Is Wall St.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. has vowed to fight the federal government's
plan to break up the company into two separate parts, a battle that will begin
not in court, but in the stock market on Monday. That's when traders return to
Wall Street, where the company's stock will be under the microscope -- offering
a key test of consumers' confidence in the company. For Microsoft, it signals
the start of a long battle. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department and 17 of the
19 states that filed antitrust complaints against Microsoft submitted a plan to
a federal judge to break the company into two new businesses.

<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Reggie Miller scored 34 points with a vintage barrage of
outside shots as the Pacers beat the Milwaukee Bucks 109-96 Saturday night to
take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-five playoff series. Miller staved off a
fired-up Milwaukee team aching for its first home playoff win in a decade.
Indiana, the Eastern Conference's top seed, can clinch the series with another
road victory in Game 4 on Monday night.

Lewis Knocks Out Grant in Round 2
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lennox Lewis made the physically biggest heavyweight fight
in history a short one Saturday night, knocking down previously unbeaten Michael
Grant four times and winning in the second round. One night after being honored
as fighter of the year for 1999, the champion from London landed a tremendous
right uppercut that knocked Grant on his back with 21 seconds left in the round.
Grant was unable to beat referee Arthur Mercante Jr.'s count of 10.

<HEADLINE> Report: AIDS Designated a Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration for the first time
has formally designated the global AIDS epidemic to be proportions
sufficient to threaten national security, The Washington Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The report in Sunday's editions said the National Security
Council has never before been involved in combating an infectious
disease, but is now directing a reassessment of government efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the direct actions taken so far was creation on Feb. 8 of
a White House interagency working group to ''develop a series of
expanded initiatives to drive the international efforts'' to combat
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The intensified effort has touched off internal disputes over
positions on trade policy and legal requirements that aid
contractors buy only American supplies, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   It said the new effort was driven by intelligence reports last
year that considered the pandemic's broadest consequences for
foreign governments and societies, particularly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Authors of one intelligence report said the consequences of AIDS
appear to have ''a particularly strong correlation with the
likelihood of state failure in partial democracies'' and held out
the prospect of ''revolutionary wars, ethnic wars, genocides and
disruptive regime transitions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post said the working group is to finish drafting its
proposals in May.

<HEADLINE> New Vietnam Marks War's End  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE ESPER, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- From a garrison of sandbags and
barbed wire, a new Vietnam of high-rises and high-tech celebrated
the 25th anniversary of the end of the war Sunday with a colorful
parade of thousands and a festival of song and dance.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 20,000 people gathered at Reunification Palace, the
centerpiece of the nationally televised celebrations that turned
from a military parade into a spring pageant of everything from
floats to stilt walkers, dragon dancers and child ballet
performers. One float featured a globe that opened up, releasing a
flock of doves, symbolizing peace.
</P>
<P>
   The palace was decorated with a larger-than life portrait of
legendary communist leader Ho Chi Minh and eight long banners
saluting the victory over the United States and its South
Vietnamese allies.
</P>
<P>
   Goose-stepping soldiers, barefooted minority groups, religious
representatives, including some in black Catholic cassocks,
rifle-toting female soldiers in black pajamas and khaki hats, and
women in a rainbow of brightly colored clothes paraded through the
palace grounds and past a reviewing stand for 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot, sunny early morning, marchers and viewers alike fanned
themselves with miniature paper red flags of North Vietnam with
gold stars in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Singers belted out patriotic songs including one proclaiming:
''We are marching to Saigon to liberate our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The men who made this day possible were there, including Gen. Vo
Nguyen Giap, the architect of victories over both the French and
Americans, and Gen. Van Tien Dung, commander of the Ho Chi Minh
Campaign that toppled the old non-communist capital of Saigon on
April 30, 1975. It was renamed Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   The dignitaries also included Communist Party chief Le Kha Phieu
and Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.
</P>
<P>
   In a keynote address, Ho Chi Minh City Mayor Vo Viet Thanh
looked back to the heroism of the war but focused mainly on the
country's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''For what Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh City can enjoy today, the
entire nation has paid 30 years of continuous fighting, the loss of
millions of human lives and the loss of the most beloved members of
millions of families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the new millennium, he outlined the goals for
the city, including a higher economic growth rate, greater
efficiency in business performance and less restrictive policies.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Vietnamese face a number of problems, including some
of their own making.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arbitrary and imperious behavior, wasteful spending,
embezzlement, bribery and other social evils, particularly the
increasingly widespread scourge of drug addictions, are sending
worrying signals of ineffective law enforcement and serious
degradation of moral and spiritual values,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The song, ''Uncle Ho Lives in the Great Victory Day,'' was the
theme for weekend ceremonies across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh City's wide boulevards were bathed in a rainbow of
the bright colors of spring -- red, blue, yellow and purple. Trees,
utility poles and street corners were festooned with the flags of
Vietnam and the Communist Party, and with placards marked in large
numbers ''30.4,'' April 30, the day Saigon fell.
</P>
<P>
   National television showed grainy black-and-white propaganda
footage of the war. Loudspeakers blared out American showtunes.
</P>
<P>
   And on television a Vietnamese performer sang ''Yesterday Once
More,'' the old Carpenters' song that was a sentimental favorite
with lonely American GIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was young, I listened to the radio waiting for my
favorite songs,'' she sang. ''When they played I'd sing along. It
made me smile. Every 'sha la la la la.' Every 'wo wo' still
shines.''
</P>
<P>
   North Vietnamese Army tanks numbered 390 and 843 crashed through
the gates of what was then known as Independence Palace and the
communists hoisted their flag at 11:30 a.m. on that fateful day a
quarter of a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was reunified and the building was renamed Reunification
Palace. It is now a museum. Ho Chi Minh died in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the palace were some of the forgotten
victims of the war -- the South Vietnamese who fought alongside the
Americans, now cast aside to the streets and ignored, languishing
in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Van Hien, 48, and Tran Van Chanh, 51, stand alongside
their cyclo pedicabs awaiting passengers in what they hope will be
a profitable day -- $10 in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care about the anniversary,'' says Hien, who was among
the tens of thousands of South Vietnamese who deserted their ranks
and fled in fear to be with their families as the communists closed
in. ''My priority is to earn a living to support my four
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Chanh, who was among the thousands sent to ''re-education
camps'' after the war, says the anniversary ''means nothing to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day means something to me,'' he says. ''I have to make
money with my cyclo. I have tried to go to the United States
several times but failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of foreign tourists, including some U.S. veterans
revisiting their battlefields, were in Vietnam. For most, the
anniversary was just a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans have wondered how the ragtag Viet Cong communist
guerrillas of the South and their North Vietnamese Army allies, won
the war against the Americans and their powerful weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Khai, the prime minister, answered that question in a ceremony
Saturday in Hanoi, the capital of reunified Vietnam, saying Ho Chi
Minh inspired the communists to fight to the last man, a resolve
that American officials could never understand.
</P>
<P>
   ''His life and example have stirred up and fostered in each and
every Vietnamese the will and resolve, 'We would rather sacrifice
all than lose the country and become enslaved,' and 'Nothing is
more precious than independence and freedom.'''
</P>
<P>
   All sides sacrificed heavily: 58,000 Americans dead, along with
1.1 million communist fighters, nearly 224,000 South Vietnamese
soldiers and about 2 million civilians, according to official
Vietnamese reports.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. veterans acknowledged the heavy price the communists
paid.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hat's off to these guys that are here,'' said Ray Winters,
a 52-year-old Marine veteran from Chatsworth, Calif., visiting the
Truong Son National Cemetery in bloody Quang Tri province.
</P>
<P>
   America's direct military intervention in Vietnam ended on Jan.
27, 1973, when Washington and Hanoi signed the Paris Peace
Agreement. While it brought an end to America's longest and most
divisive war, the fighting never stopped for the Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1975, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected
President Gerald Ford's $300 million supplementary military aid
bill for South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of South Vietnam began at about the same time with
a communist strategy that forced the South's President Nguyen Van
Thieu into tactical errors. The communists launched a surprise
attack on the little-known central highlands provincial capital of
Buon Ma Thuot, the southern anchor of South Vietnam's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Up against a larger, better-equipped foe and facing the cutoff
of American military aid, Thieu ordered his forces to abandon the
sparsely populated highlands and withdraw to what he believed to be
the more easily defended coast.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat set off a wave of panic. North Vietnamese forces
routed Saigon's troops from north to south, from the central
highlands to the coastal lowlands, with little opposition. In many
cases, the South Vietnamese fled two to three days before the
advancing communist troops arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Thieu fled the country on April 21. He said in a bitter, tearful
farewell address that the United States had broken a pledge to
intervene if North Vietnam violated the Paris Agreement and had
''led the South Vietnamese people to death.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was expressed by mobs of angry South Vietnamese
who felt betrayed and abandoned when the last remaining Americans
at the U.S. Embassy pulled out in a chaotic evacuation after a
three-hour, pre-dawn artillery attack on Tan Son Nhut Air Base.
</P>
<P>
   They fired their rifles in the air, yelling, ''We want to go,
too.'' Guards at the base's main gate tried to block the last
convoy of American buses headed for another helicopter evacuation
site. They backed off after the U.S. commander threatened to attack
with gunships flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Panicky South Vietnamese troops opened fire on each other,
knocking out two American buses that got caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of citizens threatened to overrun the U.S. Embassy in
desperate attempts to force their way onto the helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   That scene came to symbolize the war's futility. The old embassy
is but a memory now, blasted into a vacant lot by a demolition crew
two years ago. But its white walls remain, a reminder of the
chaotic pullout that remains a vivid memory for many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed though. Along with the new high-rise hotels
in Ho Chi Minh City, a new U.S. consular office sits next to the
old embassy site. There are still long lines of Vietnamese there.
</P>
<P>
   But today they wait patiently in the quiet early morning for
interviews in hopes of getting resettlement visas to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the two countries are forever intertwined.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cassell, Davis Ejected From Game 3  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Indiana's Dale Davis and Milwaukee's Sam
Cassell were ejected from Saturday night's Game 3 in the
first-round playoff series between the Pacers and the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams thought the ejections, which were caused by two
double technical fouls resulting from two brief confrontations in
the second half, were unnecessary overreactions to a physical game.
Indiana beat Milwaukee 109-96 to take a 2-1 lead in the
best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was ridiculous,'' Cassell said. ''We both got tangled up.
I guess (the officials) wanted to take control of the game, but you
don't do that at that time. You let them fight it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassell and Davis were assessed technicals for a confrontation
in the third quarter in which harsh words were exchanged but little
else. Davis appeared to shove the ball into Cassell's stomach when
Cassell was trying to take the ball out of bounds, but they were
separated by Milwaukee's Ervin Johnson before anything further
happened.
</P>
<P>
   But the two briefly confronted each other again near midcourt
with six minutes left in the game, and the resulting technicals
meant both were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think it was that big a deal,'' Cassell said. ''It
was under the basket, a wrestling match. I've seen worse in my
seven years in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what playoff basketball is about,'' said Davis, who
nearly got into a fight with Johnson in Game 1. ''We're a team
that's not going to back down from anyone, and if it gets ugly, it
gets ugly. We had a little stare-off, and that was about it. I
didn't agree with the call.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cassell pleaded with official crew chief Hugh Evans in the
resulting confusion, someone in the sellout Bradley Center crowd
then threw a giveaway T-shirt on the court. Someone else then
nearly hit referee Mark Wunderlich with a pack of gum.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's incredible to me why you would take two All-Star players
off the court when it's not necessary,'' Milwaukee coach George
Karl said. ''There was nothing done there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana already was playing without starting center Rik Smits,
who watched the game at the Pacers' hotel after being suspended for
Game 3 for throwing a vicious elbow at Johnson in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   After Cassell's second confrontation with Davis, Glenn Robinson
and Travis Best yapped at each other for nearly a minute while
their teammates separated them.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 13, Marlins 12  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eric Karros' RBI single in the bottom of the
ninth gave the Los Angeles Dodgers a 13-12 victory over Florida on
Saturday night after the Marlins rallied from eight runs down to
tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' single off Antonio Alfonseca (0-3) on a hit-and-run play
ended a wild game that saw the Dodgers go up 10-2 after three
innings, only to see the Marlins tie it on Derrek Lee's two-out,
solo homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' winning hit came after Green led off with a single and
Gary Sheffield walked.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw (1-1), who surrendered the tying home run, pitched one
inning and was credited with the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's homer, his second of the game, cost Shaw his second blown
saves in eight chances.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield hit a pair of homers and drove in five runs in his
first two at-bats as the Dodgers scored nine runs in the first two
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, whose homers were his second and third of the year, also
had a solo shot following Mike Lowell's three-run homer in the
fifth inning, when the Marlins scored seven unearned runs to narrow
the gap to 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles scored twice in the sixth to go up 12-9, then the
Marlins answered with two runs in the seventh and just missed
pulling into a tie -- Sheffield threw Lee out at the plate as Lee
tried to score from second on pinch-hitter Kevin Millar's single to
left.
</P>
<P>
   Lee went 3-for-4 and also was hit by a pitch. Lowell was 3-for-5
with four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek and Karros also homered for Los Angeles, and
Devon White went 4-for-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who sent nine men to the plate in each of the first
two innings, rocked Jesus Sanchez for eight runs on eight hits in 1
1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort allowed two Florida runs in the first, then was
victimized for the seven unearned runs. He gave up six hits, walked
two and struck out four in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's homers, his eighth and ninth, both came off Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, a former shortstop moved over to second this
season, opened the door for the Marlins to get back in the game
after they loaded the bases with one out in the fifth. His throw
sailed past shortstop Kevin Elster and into foul territory down the
left-field line as all three runners scored.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the inning, Lowell hit a three-run homer, his fifth,
and Lee followed with a solo shot, his second.
</P>
<P>
   White began their early rally with a leadoff single in the
first, and Grudzielanek followed with his second homer of the year.
Green walked, then Sheffield homered over the wall in left center.
Todd Hundley's RBI single gave Los Angeles a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Grudzielanek and Green singled with one out and
Sheffield hit a two-run homer to center. Karros then greeted
reliever Ricky Bones with his sixth homer.
</P>
<P>
   David Berg scored Florida's first run on a wild pitch by
Dreifort, then Lowell hit an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Both benches emptied in the seventh inning when Florida's
Dan Miceli threw a pitch close enough to Adrian Beltre's head,
sending Beltre sprawling. But the umpires stood between the teams,
and the players soon turned and returned to the dugouts. ... The
last time the Marlins scored at least 10 runs and lost was June 18,
1999, in an 11-10 defeat at Colorado. ... The home runs by Lowell
and Lee marked the first time this season the Marlins have hit
consecutive homers this season.

<HEADLINE> Man Dies Driving Into Lake Michigan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A man in a car with his 23-month-old
granddaughter drove through a park where a ceremony honoring
Vietnam war dead was held and into Lake Michigan Saturday, killing
both of them, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said about half a dozen divers were sent to the
scene after the car plunged into the lake. Police Inspector Leslie
Barber said police received information that the motorist was a
Vietnam veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just got to the water as we saw it sinking, so like the
trunk was still sticking out of the water,'' and part of the roof
could be seen, said Paul Treder, one of the witnesses in the area
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the man seemed to rebuff rescue efforts as the
car floated before going down in about 15 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ''They broke the windshield and I guess they swore at him to
give the child up,'' said Gene Fink.
</P>
<P>
   The man and child were pulled from the submerged car.
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. Dick Boncel said the 47-year-old man was pronounced
dead after being taken to a hospital, and the girl also died.
</P>
<P>
   Their names were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   In another area of the park, several hundred people gathered for
the ceremony at a monument to the area's Vietnam war dead.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony marked the 25th anniversary of the end of U.S.

   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox was ejected in
the seventh inning of Saturday night's game against San Diego,
apparently for something he said after the Padres' Carlos Hernandez
walked.

   With Kory DeHaan at the plate, umpire Bill Welke suddenly
motioned that someone in the Braves' dugout was ejected. A minute

<HEADLINE> Clinton Entertains the Press  </HEADLINE>
By GARRETT THEROLF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton held a press conference to
an audience of one sleeping reporter, ran after the first lady's
limousine with her lunch and played Battle Ship in the White House
Situation Room -- all in a mock video he staged for Saturday's White
House Correspondent's Dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''You like me! You really like me!'' the president said to the
laughing group of 2,600 reporters, editors, politicians and
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   In a year after impeachment, the president and the press took a
nostalgic and lighthearted look at his final months in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''In good times and the bad,'' the president mused, ''I have
actually shown up here for eight straight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton missed no opportunity to poke a little fun at political
foes and allies alike.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the possibility of John McCain joining George W.
Bush's presidential ticket, the president cracked: ''Hasn't the man
suffered enough?'' in a reference to McCain's years as a POW during
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   And in a series of photographs the president said he couldn't
believe could be true, came this: ''It's a photo of the vice
president applauding one of my policy initiatives,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also lampooned congressional Republicans and the
independent counsels office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past few months I've lost 10 pounds,'' Clinton said.
''Where did they go? Why did I not produce them to the independent
counsel? How did some of them manage to wind up on Tim Russert?''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Leno, the host of the event, turned to first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and said ''Don't worry about the tip. I've taken
care of that.'' He was referring to a recent campaign visit to an
upstate New York restaurant where Mrs. Clinton departed without
leaving a tip for the waitress who served her a meal.
</P>
<P>
   The more than three-hour dinner was also attended by a host of
politicians and celebrities, including former Democratic
presidential candidate Bill Bradley, film director Spike Lee,
actors John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, Sharon Stone, Alec Baldwin and
the cast of the NBC program ''The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the dinner, model Christie Brinkley greeted Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson with a kiss and snap shot request.

Winds Drive Ariz. Forest Fire

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Firefighters returned to work Saturday on a wind-driven
forest fire after sitting out the night to rest and avoid dangerous conditions.
By nightfall, authorities said crews had the blaze 10 percent contained.
However, there was no estimate for full containment because of high
temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. Dave Killebrew, a fire spokesman
for the Tonto National Forest, said, said 450 firefighters were assigned to the
5,370-acre blaze along with four airtankers and four helicopters. There were no
reports of injuries.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fresh from a victory that granted homosexuals

exchanged rings and vows in front of friends, family and about a dozen
protesters, part of a weekend-long rally for gay, lesbian and bisexual rights
culminating in Sunday's Millennium March on the National Mall. It is the fourth

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The San Jose Earthquakes' eight-game
home winning streak ended Saturday night in a 2-2 tie with D.C.
United on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose (2-3-2) last failed to pick up a victory at Spartan
Stadium on Aug. 7, 1999, when it lost 4-1 to Los Angeles. The
Earthquakes had outscored their first two home opponents this
season 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   The defending MLS champion United (1-4-1) saw its winless slide
extend to three games -- all in overtime. D.C. had lost 3-2 to the
MetroStars and 2-1 to the Revolution coming in.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Abdul Thompson Conteh lifted the hosts into a 2-2 tie
with 21 minutes left. Dario Brose put a corner kick in from the
left side, and it was flicked across the goalmouth on a header by
Jimmy Conrad. Conteh was able to get his leg in front of a D.C.
defender and poke the ball home.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Cerritos made it 1-0 for the Earthquakes 20 minutes into
the game with a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. tied it 1-1 in the 33rd minute, when Marco Etcheverry took
a free kick from 25 yards out and directed it just inside the right
post. Jaime Moreno gave D.C. a 2-1 lead a minute before halftime,
driving the ball into the upper right-hand corner of the net from
20 yards out.

<HEADLINE> Braves 7, Padres 4, 12 innings  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Andruw Jones hit a three-run homer with one out
in the 12th inning and John Rocker came on to earn his fifth save
as the Atlanta Braves won their 12th straight game, 7-4 over the
San Diego Padres on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jones hit a towering shot to left on a 3-1 pitch from Vicente
Palacios (0-1), then slowly walked toward first while watching his
sixth homer settle into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was heavily booed by what remained of the crowd of
49,428, and a male fan threw something at him. Whatever it was
didn't hit Rocker, and the fan was ejected. It was Rocker's first
road appearance since his two-week suspension for comments about
gays, minorities and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Furcal singled leading off the 12th and former Padres
infielder Quilvio Veres drew a one out walk, bringing up Jones.
Bruce Chen (3-0) pitched three innings for the win. He struck out
six, walked four and allowed one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' homer came four innings after the Padres' bullpen blew a
4-1 lead for Rodrigo Lopez, who shut down baseball's hottest team
for seven innings in a spectacular big league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez received two ovations and had a 4-1 lead when manager
Bruce Bochy went to the bullpen to start the eighth. Will Cunnane
gave up a double to Veras and walked Chipper Jones with one out,
and Carlos Almanzar came on and allowed Andres Galarraga's 10th
homer, a three-run shot that tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   Almanzar was booed coming off the field after the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez allowed one run on four hits, struck out five and walked
two. Despite his outstanding performance, the 24-year-old is
scheduled to be returned to the Triple-A Las Vegas Stars on Sunday
when infielder Dave Magadan is due to come off the disabled list.
Lopez was called up to start in place of Brian Boehringer, who is
on the DL but should be ready to go when the fifth spot in the
rotation comes up again.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez received a standing ovation after fanning pinch-hitter
Bobby Bonilla to strike out the side in the seventh, and another
one when Cunnane came out to start the eighth. Lopez acknowledged
the crowd from the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez had three no-decisions in three starts for Las Vegas, all
losses by the Stars. He could have held the Braves scoreless if not
for a gift run in the second inning, when center fielder Eric Owens
lost Reggie Sanders' two-out fly ball in the twilight sky, allowing
Brian Jordan to score from second to tie the game at 1. The double
ended Sanders' 0-for-34 slump.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a 4-1 lead in the fifth when Carlos Hernandez
drove in two runs with a bases-loaded ground-rule double and rookie
Kory DeHaan hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego took a 1-0 lead in the first when Owens singled in
Damian Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Braves starter John Burkett allowed four runs on eight hits in 4
1-3 innings, struck out five and walked four.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rocker was booed again when he walked from the Braves'
dugout to the bullpen after the top of the second. Before the game,
Rocker took the normal way to the visitors' bullpen before the game
rather than the undercover way he took before Friday's game when he
emerged from the Padres' bullpen and walked along the warning track
with a security guard. ... The Braves' 12-game winning streak is
one short of the club record, set in 1982 and matched in 1992. ...
Padres RF Tony Gwynn was scratched from the lineup because of a
sore left knee. ... The Padres purchased Lopez's rights from Aguila
of the Mexican Summer League in 1995 and he has split time pitching
in the Mexican League and in the Padres' farm system since. ...
Sanders left the game with a sprained left ankle suffered while
running out a grounder in the fourth. Sanders' slump was the
longest by a Braves player since Gerald Perry went 0-for-35 in
1989. ... While sitting in the dugout, Braves manager Bobby Cox was
ejected in the seventh inning, apparently for something he said
after Hernandez walked.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) --Tim Salmon homered leading off the 13th
inning to give the Anaheim Angels a 7-6 victory over the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays on Saturday night
</P>
<P>
   Salmon pulled a full-count pitch from Jeff Sparks (0-1) over the
left-field fence for the designated hitter's fifth home run. Al
Levine (1-0) pitched three scoreless innings for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   After Greg Vaughn hit his 300th home run in the ninth to give
Tampa Bay a 6-5 lead, Anaheim tied it in the bottom of the inning
on Adam Kennedy's two-out RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who took second on the throw home, tried to score on
another single by Mo Vaughn, but was thrown out on right fielder
Dave Martinez's throw.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn, in his 12th season in the majors, became the 85th
player to reach 300 homers when he lined Shigetoshi Hasegawa's
pitch to center for his eighth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay tied it at 5 in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Garret Anderson misplayed Mike DiFelice's two-out
drive into a double. Pinch-runner Tony Graffanino went to third on
Shigetoshi Hajsegawa's wild pitch, and scored when Mo Vaughn made a
fielding error at first base on Steve Cox's high hopper.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim took a 5-4 lead with a three-run fifth. After Gary
DiSarcina's one-out homer off Dave Eiland tied it at 3, Darin
Erstad singled, stole second and scored on Kennedy's double to
left-center. Mo Vaughn added an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit his fifth homer in the second inning to give
Anaheim a 1-0 lead, and Tampa Bay tied it in the fourth on Ozzie
Guillen's grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen's slow hopper with one out and the bases loaded went
under third baseman Troy Glaus' glove for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus made a good play two pitches later, gloving Miguel Cairo's
smash down the line and stepping on third to begin an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro's two-out RBI single in the fourth put the
Angels back on top 2-1. Jose Canseco gave the Devil Rays a 3-2 lead
in the fifth with a two-run homer, his fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Castilla brought the Devil Rays within a run in the sixth
with a solo homer. It was only the second homer in 64 at-bats for
Castilla, who hit 33 home runs last season for Colorado. He sat out
the first seven games of the season because of a rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   Eiland, who beat the Angels 1-0 last Sunday in Tampa Bay,
allowed eight hits and five runs in 4 1-3 innings. Angels starter
Ken Hill allowed nine hits and four runs in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Erstad's fifth-inning single was his 46th hit, one shy of
the major league record for April. Dante Bichette had 47 hits for
Colorado in April 1998. ... The Angels stole three bases, pushing
their season total to 24. ... DiSarcina's homer was only his second
in 22 months.

Microsoft Vows To Fight Gov't Plan

	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. has vowed to fight the federal government's
plan to break up the company into two separate parts, a battle that will begin
not in court, but in the stock market on Monday. That's when traders return to
Wall Street, where the company's stock will be under the microscope -- offering
a key test of consumers' confidence in the company. For Microsoft, it signals
the start of a long battle. "Monday is only the first step," said Rob Enderle,
an analyst with the Giga Information Group in San Jose, Calif. "From there,
they'll have to fight every step of the way to prevent any lack of confidence

federal agents yanked 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from the home of relatives.
Police stayed visibly distant from the chanting demonstrators, many of whom
carried signs denouncing President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno for
taking Elian from his Miami relatives and sending him to his Cuban father. No
arrests were made during the demonstration.

	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Firefighters returned to work Saturday on a wind-driven
forest fire after sitting out the night to rest and avoid dangerous conditions.
By nightfall, authorities said crews had the blaze 10 percent contained.
However, there was no estimate for full containment because of high
temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. Dave Killebrew, a fire spokesman
for the Tonto National Forest, said, said 450 firefighters were assigned to the
5,370-acre blaze along with four airtankers and four helicopters. There were no
reports of injuries.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Lennox Lewis made the physically biggest heavyweight fight
in history a short one Saturday night, knocking down previously unbeaten Michael
Grant three times before knocking him out in the second round. One night after
being honored as fighter of the year for 1999, the champion from London landed a
tremendous right uppercut that knocked Grant on his back with 21 seconds left in
the round. Grant was unable to beat referee Arthur Mercante Jr.'s count of 10.

	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Reggie Miller scored 34 points with a vintage barrage of
outside shots as the Pacers beat the Milwaukee Bucks 109-96 Saturday night to
take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-five playoff series. Miller staved off a

   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Emirates Airline said Sunday
it was ordering 10 super jumbo jets from Airbus Industrie, becoming
one of the first customers for the next-generation aircraft costing
about $12 billion to develop.

   The 600-seat aircraft has been years in the making, and the
European consortium that is building it had said it would not
develop the plane without solid demand.

   Airbus has said the company needed to have at least 30 orders
for the project to be viable. Airbus' chief competitor, Seattle,
Wash.-based Boeing has doubted that a market exists for a bigger

<HEADLINE> Mock Same-Sex Weddings Staged  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Olivia Durant waited three years to profess
her love for her partner, Sabrina Beach. Since they are not able to
legally exchange marriage vows, they thought taking part in a giant
mock wedding ceremony would be the next best thing.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a victory that granted homosexuals marriage-like
rights in Vermont, Durant and Beach joined hundreds of other
couples Saturday on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in a bid to
press even wider acceptance for civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said about 1,000 same-sex couples exchanged rings and
vows in front of friends, family and about a dozen protesters, part
of a weekend-long rally for gay, lesbian and bisexual rights
culminating in Sunday's Millennium March on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're so happy right now,'' said Durant, of Rochester, N.Y.
''But I hope someday, same-sex marriages will be legal. We've joked
about moving to Vermont because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth gathering on the Mall by gay and lesbian rights
groups in the last 21 years. It tops a busy period for activists,
who earlier this week had praise for the new law in Vermont and for
President Clinton's renewed call to Congress to pass the stagnant
Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and critics have also verbally clashed at the Supreme
Court, where on Wednesday the justices heard arguments over whether
the Boy Scouts can bar a homosexual from serving as a troop leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just like any other family. We get up, we go to work,''
said Pam Lessard, of Melbourne, Fla., who wore a white-laced veil
on her head as she waited for the ceremony to start. ''We are the
same as'' heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be an honor for members of the gay community and their
allies to stand before the Lincoln Memorial, this great American
symbol of freedom, and demand equal rights,'' said the Rev. Troy
Perry, moderator of the Universal Federation of Metropolitan
Community Churches, who performed the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Other events on Saturday included a concert featuring Garth
Brooks and Melissa Etheridge, and the unveiling of new panels to
the AIDS memorial quilt on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's event, particularly Sunday's march, have been
criticized by anti-gay groups, and gay and lesbian advocacy groups
who contend there was not enough outreach to grassroots
organizations and people of color.
</P>
<P>
   ''The march's purpose, insensitive elitism, is not our purpose.
Our purpose will not be advanced by the Millennium March on
Washington,'' said Ed Brown, co-chairman of the National
Association of Black and White Men Together.
</P>
<P>
   Six protesters carrying signs such as ''Repent or Perish'' and
''Got AIDS Yet'' taunted supporters and drew the attention of
police from across a roadway in front of the memorial. Some got
into face-to-face arguments with supporters before police separated
them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Park Police said there were no arrests in connection with
Saturday's events.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of protesters, led by Anthony Falzarano of Falls
Church, Va., tried to tell gays and lesbians of a network of
''ex-gay'' groups filled with people who realized ''they could
change.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're here today to be compassionate to homosexuals,'' said
Falzarano who said he left a gay lifestyle in 1983. ''We know what
it's like to be misunderstood. So we're here to tell any homosexual
out there it's OK not to be gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to draw 300,000 people for the march Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the same benefits that legally married couples have,''
John Catania, of New York said after exchanging vows with his
partner. ''You want the country to be better, and recognizing this
in law makes the country better.''

   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A sport-utility vehicle veered onto a
sidewalk and hit 10 people near a school fund-raising carnival,
killing a woman and her 4-year-old daughter and severing another
victim's leg.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena police Lt. Rick Aversano said the 16-year-old boy
driving the vehicle Saturday veered into the pedestrians about 3:30

   Los Angeles coroner's investigator Pam Eaker identified the
deceased victims as Sarah Karesh, 34, and her daughter Madison.

<HEADLINE> Journalist David Spanier Dies at 67  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- David Spanier, a former foreign and diplomatic
correspondent for The Times of London and an authority on gambling,
has died at 67.
</P>
<P>
   Spanier died of a stroke April 18 at a London casino.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a stockbroker, Spanier was born on April 30, 1932, in
London and was educated at the exclusive private school
Charterhouse and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he first
developed his taste for poker.
</P>
<P>
   He joined The Times in 1957, initially covering domestic news.
</P>
<P>
   An early advocate of closer relations with Europe, he became the
paper's first correspondent on the European Common Market in 1961.
His first book, ''Europe Our Europe,'' was an account of
negotiations for Britain's entry into the trading bloc.
</P>
<P>
   In its obituary, published April 20, The Times said his
appointment as diplomatic correspondent in 1974 was the culmination
of his career at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''But he had long been regarded on the paper as an intelligent
and skeptical interpreter of the international scene, particularly
as it concerned Britain's relations with, first, America and then
with Europe,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Spanier did not share the British
government's belief in the so-called ''special relationship'' with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was himself a great admirer of America and the American way
of doing things, and could see only too clearly the psychological
gulf that separated the two nations in the 1960s and 1970s,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spanier's first book on gambling, ''Total Poker,'' was published
in 1977 and well received. Other books included ''The Gambler's
Pocket Book'' (1980) and ''Easy Money: Inside the Gambler's Mind''
(1987).
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Spanier carved out a new career in broadcasting when he
joined the London news radio station LBC as diplomatic
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, fashion writer Suzy Menkes, and
their three sons.

<HEADLINE> Task Force Probes Spokane Murders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE (AP) -- The task force investigating serial killings of
women in Washington state uprooted a tree next to the home of a man
charged with one killing, and sifted soil from another site in a
search for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Spokane County sheriff's Cpl. David Reagan would not say if
investigators found anything useful in Saturday's excavations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Yates Jr., 47, has been charged with one count of
first-degree murder. But investigators say evidence also links the
47-year-old man to the deaths of as many as a dozen women in the
Spokane and Tacoma areas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, six other cases dating to 1990 are being
investigated for possible connections with Yates.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, investigators uprooted a 12-foot blue spruce tree
in an open lot next to the Yates property, Reagan said. He said
neighbors reported that Yates replanted the tree after it was
knocked over by a drunken driver.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also sifted soil from an area where neighbors said
Yates removed a hedgerow and filled in the area with new dirt,
Reagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Yates, arrested on April 18, is jailed in lieu of $1.5 million
bail. No arraignment date has been set.

<HEADLINE> Whitman and Washington, perfect together? Only rarely  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Residents of the nation's capital have seen
much of Christie Whitman over the past few weeks -- but not
advocating any national cause or weighing in on some hot-button
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they have seen her at the helm of the tall-ship A.J.
Meerwald, the Statue of Liberty in the background, in the state's
newest ''New Jersey and You, Perfect Together'' tourism commercial
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Though the subject of national attention from the moment she
became New Jersey's first female governor, Whitman has more often
avoided rather than seized the spotlight on national policy or
politics.
</P>
<P>
   That is not true of several other Republican governors who, like
Whitman, are mentioned as possible running mates for Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman opted out of the race for U.S. Senate last September,
surprising national GOP leaders who counted on her to deliver the
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to chair a
federal panel overseeing Amtrak, Whitman quit in protest of
restrictions she felt made the council unworkable -- although it has
continued to function without her.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of her colleagues, who jumped aboard the Bush for
president bandwagon early in 1999, Whitman waited until the last
minute to endorse the Texas governor. She endorsed Bush on March 4,
in Connecticut, just days before the Super Tuesday primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And during the national debate over the impeachment of President
Clinton, Whitman stuck to a wait-and-see attitude while numerous
other Republicans were calling on Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other Republican governors often mentioned as
prospective vice presidential choices have carved out national
roles in the party in addition to their jobs back home.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson is chairman of Amtrak's governing
board. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge is a spokesman on education
issues for the nation's Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Gov. John Engler became an early and prominent backer
of Bush for president, taking a hit to his own political standing
when Bush lost Michigan's primary to Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Engler and Thompson are past chairmen of the Republican
Governors Association. Pataki and Ridge are on the RGA's executive
committee. The RGA's current chairman, Gov. Frank Keating of
Oklahoma, is also mentioned as a possible Bush running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Engler and Thompson are current members of the National
Governors Association executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has been more of a rank-and-file member than a leader of
the RGA and the NGA. She currently is a member of the NGA's
Committee on Human Resources and New Economy Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's spokesman, Pete McDonough, said the New Jersey
governor has a national profile as a fundraiser for her fellow
Republicans across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's probably the most prolific Republican fundraiser among
the governors that there is,'' McDonough said. ''She just recently
came back from raising money in Texas for (Sen.) Kay Bailey
Hutchison, in Nevada for the Nevada state party, and was the
keynote speaker at Denny Hastert's big fundraiser for the year.
This was the speaker of the House, who could have any Republican
from any part of America come out, and he chose Christie Whitman.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, McDonough said Whitman will soon take on a national role
on ocean cleanup. She and Leon Panetta, the former congressman and
White House chief of staff, will co-chair a commission on oceans
for the Pew Center On Global Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
   Offering her views on a current hot issue, Whitman recently
urged the state's congressional delegation to support permanent
normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   She made a low-profile visit to Washington on April 11 to
address a group of business leaders meeting to discuss economic
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   And Republican leaders turned to Whitman to deliver their weekly
Saturday radio address on April 15, the day income taxes were due.

<HEADLINE> Limits Weighed on Bait Fish  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL TOLME, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Atlantic menhaden, a foul-tasting bait
fish ground for animal feed and squeezed for oil, is getting a lot
more scrutiny these days as federal regulators consider the first
coastwide restrictions on its catch.
</P>
<P>
   While cod, striped bass, flounder and other species found in the
supermarket have been the focus of federal regulations for years,
menhaden has gained little attention despite being the top
commercial catch in terms of tons harvested annually.
</P>
<P>
   ''The focus traditionally has been on top predators,'' said
Joseph Desfosse, the menhaden management plan coordinator for the
Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. However, ''people
don't go out and catch menhaden'' for food because of its foul
taste, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is considering regulating the fish from Maine to
Florida over concern that juvenile populations of menhaden are
dropping, which could cause future problems.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more contentious issues is how much say the menhaden
processing industry should have in the oversight of menhaden. The
industry accounts for a majority of the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public is concerned that the industry is making the
decisions about menhaden,'' Joseph Desfosse, the commission's
menhaden management plan coordinator, said after a public hearing
last month of the Atlantic Menhaden Management Board.
</P>
<P>
   The processing industry is fighting a proposal to change the
voting structure of the 16-member menhaden board to reduce industry
representation. Seven board members represent the processing
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is ''unfair and unfounded,'' said Jule Wheatly,
president of Beaufort Fisheries in Beaufort, N.C., and a present
member of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Beaufort Fisheries and Omega Protein, with a plant in Reedville,
Va., are the two largest consumers of menhaden. Their
representatives say the menhaden fishery is healthy and any steps
to reduce the catch would further hurt the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first thing they would do is throw quotas on us,'' Wheatly
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Wheatly and other industry officials presented a
letter from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that said efforts to reduce
the influence of industry representatives were driven by ''special
interests whose actual agenda is the elimination of the commercial
fishing industry.''
</P>
<P>
   But others argue the menhaden population is declining and steps
must be taken to protect the fish, a vital food source for striped
bass, bluefish and birds.
</P>
<P>
   Menhaden, which feed by filtering water, are essential to the
health of Chesapeake Bay because they lower high nutrient levels
blamed for a host of environmental problems, said James Price,
president of the Chesapeake Bay Acid Rain Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The population is at its lowest level ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial boats that scoop up massive schools of menhaden
concentrate much of their activity in Virginia's section of the
bay.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to prevent overfishing of menhaden could be voted on late
this year. Various options are being considered, from regulating
the size of the nets to limiting the size of the fish caught or
implementing seasonal restrictions, although it's possible no
action will be taken.
</P>
<P>
   A major hurdle for those considering new regulations is the lack
of comprehensive data on menhaden populations through the decades.
Most of the data comes from the commercial processors.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree that while the overall health of the species is hard
to gauge, the numbers of young menhaden -- the future spawners --
have declined. Various states from Florida to Maine have
regulations for menhaden, but no coastwide measures exist to manage
their catch and collect data.
</P>
<P>
   Menhaden have been harvested for fertilizer since Colonial times
and were caught before that by American Indians. Since 1940, more
than 18 million metric tons have been caught by fishing fleets,
according to federal data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 442 million pounds of menhaden were caught, with most
of that coming from the processing, or so-called reduction
industry, and a small percentage from the bait industry.
</P>
<P>
   The menhaden reduction plants process the fish into meal for
chicken feed, while the oil is extracted for use in cooking oil and
margarine. The interest in this omega-3 rich oil has risen in
recent years because of studies that have shown it is beneficial in
cutting the risk of heart attacks.

<HEADLINE> Activity May Keep Diabetics Alive  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Staying active increases the chances that a
person with diabetes will stay alive, a study finds.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first study to find a lower risk of death from any
cause among those who report being physically active, researchers
say. Previous research has found that exercisers have a lower risk
of developing diabetes. And, among people who have diabetes,
exercise controls conditions from weight gain to cardiovascular
disease that are common outgrowths of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is, you survive longer,'' said Dr. Ming Wei of
the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas, lead author
of the paper in Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied 1,263 men with type 2 diabetes, which
accounts for at least 90 percent of all diabetes cases in the
United States. In Type 2 diabetes, the body's cells become
resistant to insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels
and helps the sugars enter cells, where they can be used for
energy.
</P>
<P>
   The men in the study were given a thorough physical examination,
including an exercise test. Based on the results, their fitness
levels were ranked. Over an average of 12 years of followup, the
men also responded to questionnaires about their physical activity,
including walking, jogging or taking part in aerobic exercise
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Over the study period, 180 men died.
</P>
<P>
   Men in the low-fit group in the exam were 2.1 times more likely
than high-fit men to die from any cause, including heart disease, a
major cause of death among diabetics. But the overall risk of death
shrank as the level of fitness rose, so moderately fit men were
better off than unfit ones, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
   Men who reported in questionnaires that they were physically
inactive had a 70 percent greater chance of dying than did men who
reported being physically active. But self-reports are not highly
accurate, so researchers did not detail any changes in risk based
on the amount of activity that the men reported.
</P>
<P>
   The findings give doctors a new reason to recommend exercise to
diabetic patients, the report said. ''Our data suggest that the
beneficial effect of physical activity for patients with type 2
diabetes extends beyond its effect on intermediate risk factors''
such as weight control, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers did not determine what type of exercise would be
best. But Wei suspected diabetics could get the risk-reduction job
done simply by following the guidelines that the federal government
sets out for most Americans -- a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate
activity, such as a brisk walk, on most days. He cautioned that
diabetics should see their doctors before starting an exercise
program.
</P>
<P>
   The findings drew support from experts who did not work on the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is exciting information,'' said Dr. Bruce R. Zimmerman,
president of the American Diabetes Association. ''I hope it will
have an influence on many physicians who don't normally deal with
those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper had some weaknesses -- for instance, diabetics who took
insulin were not in the study -- but the findings nonetheless are
compelling, said Zimmerman, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Another doctor urged physicians to stop waiting for more
research, and to get on with encouraging patients to exercise.
''General admonishments to get more exercise are as unlikely to
work as general advice to eat less or stop smoking,'' Dr. Charles
M. Clark Jr. of the Richard Roudebush VA Medical Center in
Indianapolis wrote, in an editorial in the internal medicine
journal. ''Specific programs need to be prescribed, and follow-up
is essential.''

<HEADLINE> Girl Finds Cancer-Causing Particles  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS LEHOURITES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONWAY, Ark. (AP) -- Claire Nelson was in the seventh grade when
the thought occurred to her: Can cancer-causing particles seep into
food covered with household plastic wrap while it is being
microwaved?
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it would be easy to test,'' said Nelson, 18, a
freshman at Hendrix College.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by her discovery that no one had done extensive
research on plastic wraps before, Nelson decided to study the
effects of radiation on carcinogens. Roughly six years later, she
is receiving international accolades and meeting some of the most
influential people in the scientific field.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson had read that one of several suspected carcinogens --
di(ethylhexyl)adepate, or DEHA -- is in many plastic wraps, and that
the Food and Drug Administration had never tested whether the
carcinogen migrated into food being microwaved. That's when she got
her idea.
</P>
<P>
   She microwaved plastic wrap in virgin olive oil, hoping to find
that the carcinogens seeped into the oil. She found that, and more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tested four different kinds of plastic wraps and I found not
just the carcinogens but also xenoestrogen was migrating, and that
causes low sperm count in men and breast cancer in women,'' Nelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to that point took discipline and determination.
</P>
<P>
   At age 12, Nelson didn't have the resources to undertake her
research, and so set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had the idea, but I didn't start to work on the project
until the 10th grade,'' when the promise of an automatic A in a
science class revived it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My teacher said if we made regionals in the science fair that
we would get 10 bonus points. So I asked what we get if we make
states, and she said 30 points. Then I asked what we get if we make
internationals, and she said an automatic A,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the equipment or facilities to get the job done, she
started making phone calls. Many calls later, she got help from Jon
Wilkes, a scientist at the National Center for Toxicological
Research in Jefferson, southeast of Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes students who work with us come to us and ask for
help with science projects. In her case it was different,'' Wilkes
said. ''She had already done a fair amount of research and she had
already concluded that nobody had ever studied plastic wraps.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, by then a junior at Hall High School, at first had her
mother drive her 25 miles every couple of days from the family's
home in Little Rock to Jefferson. A year later, with her family
moved to Mississippi and she living in an apartment in Little Rock,
Nelson was making the trip by herself and balancing time between
debate team competition and cheerleading.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkes said it isn't rare for non-scientists to come up with an
idea like Nelson's, but it is rare for them to actually pursue a
way to test their theories. Wilkes and the toxicological research
center, an arm of the FDA, let her run her experiments using
government equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes she would be asleep standing up,'' Wilkes said.
''But she'd be there working -- if there was no debate or basketball
game to cheer at.''
</P>
<P>
   Her research concluded, Nelson got her A.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first year I had specific evidence but not numbers. The
second year I got the numbers,'' said Nelson, whose family
continues to live in Southaven, Miss., outside Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Her analysis found that DEHA was migrating into the oil at
between 200 parts and 500 parts per million. The FDA standard is
0.05 parts per billion. Nelson couldn't find any regulations
concerning xenoestrogen, making it difficult to know how much is
too much.
</P>
<P>
   Her findings won her the American Chemical Society's top science
prize for students while she was a junior. Last year, she was the
salutatorian at Hall and placed fourth in the International Science
and Engineering Fair in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition for her research continues as Nelson completes her
freshman year at tiny Hendrix College in Conway. Her findings were
published as a one-paragraph summary in several science journals,
and submitted to others. Nelson also appeared in an advertisement
in the March edition of Discover magazine, touting the
international science fair.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to Washington recently for the largest science
conference in the world and I got to meet Nobel Prize winners from
all over the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nelson isn't sure whether she wants to pursue a career in
science.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm undeclared right now,'' she said of choosing a major. ''I
think I might want to get into broadcast journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she has lined up a summer job at America Online
in New York, using an age-old connection to get her foot in the
door.
</P>
<P>
   ''My boyfriend's uncle got me the job,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Some Vietnam Wounds Unhealed  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- Bay Lop's family skipped the
dancing pink dragon and all the hoopla Sunday celebrating the 25th
anniversary of victory in Vietnam. As with so many others, their
war is not over.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Lop is missing. His wife last saw him in that famous photo
of 1968, shot point-blank in the head with a snubnose .38 pistol by
South Vietnamese police chief Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan. She has never
found his body.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could understand if it was the Americans, outsiders,''
Nguyen Thi Lop said in an interview, deep in a poor neighborhood of
Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. ''But a Vietnamese did this
barbaric act. How can I forgive until he is decently put to rest?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she explained, Bay Lop was guilty and proud of it. Born
Nguyen Van Lem in 1933, he fought the French with Ho Chi Minh as a
teen-ager. When captured in Saigon during the Tet Offensive, he was
a Viet Cong captain with a nom de guerre.
</P>
<P>
   ''That photograph did much to turn Americans against the war,''
she said. ''He would have been happy to see his goal achieved, a
socialist state free of foreign occupation. Now the government is
dutybound to find his remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Vietnam, however, 300,000 soldiers are still missing. The
impoverished government has few forensic tools to follow old clues.
And that is only part of Vietnam's postwar problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of Ho Chi Minh City, cameras focused on 25 couples
in traditional robes and head dress as they placed flowers on a
monument to Uncle Ho. Their mass wedding was part of official
festivities, along with a parade and outdoor concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Huynh Van Dung watched from the side, in battered shoes and a
dirty tee-shirt emblazoned, ''A little creativity...'' He seemed
glum, with few fresh ideas about how to change his future.
</P>
<P>
   He was four years old when the war ended. His father, in the
South Vietnamese army when it surrendered, disappeared in a
reeducation camp. His mother left with another man, abandoning her
son.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I have a wife and two kids of my own, with no way to
support them,'' he said. ''Sometimes I get odd jobs here and there,
but only when I'm lucky do I make more than 15,000 dong (just over
a dollar) a day.''
</P>
<P>
   His 5-year-old son won't go to school. Kindergarten costs $200
for enrollment and another six dollars each month.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Huu Co survived reeducation camp, but he emerged only 10
years ago. As a major general, once South Vietnam's minister of
defense, he was kept 15 years. Instead of communism, he found God.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a Protestant,'' he explained, talking at length about
South Vietnamese intrigues but shrugging off questions about
politics after 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I'm not going to the Sunday parade,'' he said, however,
expressing an attitude heard widely among Vietnamese from the
south. ''This is no holiday. I'm going to church.''
</P>
<P>
   At Reunification Hall, which was South Vietnam's presidential
palace until a tank crashed through its front gate on April 30,
1975, ceremonies were arranged as meticulously as the assault on
Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   The 20,000 hand-picked guests watched the parade within a high
metal fence as an apparent security measure. Sparse crowds held far
back by police saw the floats and marchers emerge. Otherwise,
Vietnam watched it on television.
</P>
<P>
   Kieu Thi Hoa, wearing a chartreuse ao dai, stood in an orderly
group with the 109 other people selected to represent the
provincial labor department.
</P>
<P>
   When asked her opinion of the day's grand events, she replied
without a pause: ''You have to ask my department chief.'' With her
boss's permission, and with him listening closely, she pronounced
herself proud and happy.
</P>
<P>
   Proud, happy people were in plentiful supply. Crowds cheered
loudest for the ''long-haired army,'' women in black-pajama
uniforms with floppy khaki hats and black-checked scarves.
</P>
<P>
   A colorful dragon bobbed and danced on 63 pairs of youthful
legs. A fake tank built atop a jeep advertised Vietnam as a
millennium destination. Speakers blared songs, including one with
four words: ''Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also plenty of people with unhealed wounds and
unsettled scores.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Thi Lop shared her husband's zeal, and he used part of
her name in devising the pseudonym, Bay Lop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a month pregnant with my son when he was killed,'' she
said. ''I didn't know it, and then some people saw his picture and
told me about it. That's when I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay Lop's daughter, Nguyen Dung Thong, was four when her father
went back underground in December 1967. She remembers him by the
portrait on the wall and a well-thumbed copy of Time magazine, with
Eddie Adams' photo of his death.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have done everything, tried everything to get any
information about where his remains might be,'' she said. As she
talked, tears streamed down her cheeks, and soon her mother was
crying, too.
</P>
<P>
   The family was resolved to keep trying, Nguyen Dung Thong said.
For her, she explained, the war would not end until she could mourn
at the grave of the father she never knew.

<HEADLINE> John Paul Canonizes Krakow Nun  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The pope welcomed throngs of hymn-singing
fellow Poles to a festive, flower-filled St. Peter's Square on
Sunday for the canonization of one of their own, proclaiming a
mystic 20th-century Krakow nun the first new saint of the Holy
Year.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who himself prayed at the tomb of Helena
Kowalska as a clandestine seminary student in Nazi-controlled
Poland, called her a ''daughter of Poland ... tightly connected to
the history of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Kowalska, Sister Faustina of the Krakow order of God's Mercy,
died of tuberculosis in 1938 on the verge of World War II at age
33, leaving behind a diary in which she recorded visions of Jesus
Christ entreating his followers to mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ''To those who remember, who were witnesses and participants of
the events of those years and of the horrible suffering that
pursued millions of men, they know well how necessary that message
of mercy was,'' John Paul told an audience that included Polish
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and representatives of the Solidarity
labor union.
</P>
<P>
   The somber message was lightened by a rain-washed spring sky and
a piazza decked with budding saplings and flowers of all hues. An
estimated 200,000 people filled the square and spilled out into the
boulevard leading to it.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul himself seemed rosy-cheeked against the spring
backdrop. Although as hymn followed hymn in the more than two-hour
ceremony, his eyes slowly folded shut, his head slumped toward his
chest, and he gave every sign of briefly nodding off in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In Poland, about 70,000 faithful watched the ceremony on
big-screen TVs at Sister Faustina's shrine outside Krakow.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Faustina claimed she saw visions of Jesus and the Virgin
Mary and experienced stigmata starting in 1931, demonstrating a
degree of mysticism with which the Vatican itself at times was
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, as Krakow archbishop in the late 1960s, initiated
efforts for her beatification. He had prayed at her grave soon
after her death, when he was secretly studying for the priesthood
despite a ban on new seminary admissions by the Nazis, who were
trying to squelch Poland's influential Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Poles know her as a patriot, with her diaries revealing
countless prayers for her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican credits her with two miracles -- healing a Baltimore,
Md., priest with heart troubles, and a woman from Stockbridge,
Mass., afflicted with what was said to be an incurable form of
lymphedema.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Fastina becomes the church's first saint of the new
millennium and the 297th of John Paul's papacy. In 22 years, John
Paul has proclaimed more than half of all the 593 saints declared
by the church in the last 500 years.

<HEADLINE> Summit Could Help S. Korea Pols  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The coming inter-Korea summit may help
President Kim Dae-jung resolve one of his most serious political
headaches at home: His rivalry with immediate predecessor and
rival, Kim Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential Blue House said Sunday that the ex-president
agreed to meet President Kim over dinner on May 9 to discuss the
historic first summit between the rival Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is set for June 12-14 in the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ''Former President Kim Young-sam is expected to provide valuable
advice on the success of the South-North summit,'' chief
presidential spokesman Park June-young said.
</P>
<P>
   The two Kims were pro-democracy partners during decades of
military governments. Their relationship soured after Kim Young-sam
joined the ruling camp in a three-party merger in 1988 and rode to
victory over his former comrade in 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Kim Dae-jung, running as an opposition candidate, was
elected president and succeeded Kim Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
   The two Kims have met only once since then and the ex-president
has since rejected all invitations by President Kim to meet with
him.
</P>
<P>
   The former president has been a harsh critic of the new
government. In the United States last week, he accused the
president of heading a dictatorship and demanded his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Young-sam claimed he laid the foundation for the historic
summit during his term in office, when he negotiated a meeting in
1994 with then-North Korean President Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
   That summit, brokered by former president Jimmy Carter, was
canceled after the death of the North Korean leader.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kim Young-sam claims his criticism of the president is
aimed at strengthening South Korea's democracy, many believe it is
based more on personal enmity.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly ashamed that under his government, South Korea was
compelled to go to the International Monetary Fund for a record $58
billion bailout, Kim has watched the economy make a dramatic
turnaround in the first two years of the new president's term.
</P>
<P>
   For President Kim, reconciliation with the ex-president is a
pressing task. In regionally based South Korean politics, Kim
Young-sam is still influential in one of the country's most
populous areas.

<HEADLINE> Trapped Ukraine Miner Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- A Ukrainian coal miner who was trapped
underground for four days died shortly after he was rescued Sunday,
a news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The miner died an hour after he was dug out of the mine, located
in Ukraine's eastern Korovohrad region, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The miner had been trapped in a shaft 450 yards underground
since Thursday, when a coal layer collapsed. Two other miners
trapped in the collapse were rescued immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Accidents occur frequently at Ukraine's 200 or so mines.
Operators don't have enough money to maintain proper conditions,
and safety rules are often ignored.
</P>
<P>
   At least 164 miners have died in job-related accidents in the
former Soviet republic this year, including 81 killed in a March 11
gas explosion deep within a shaft.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Frees 12,000 Prisoners  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAN MINH, Vietnam (AP) -- As Vietnam celebrated, Vu Thi Hong Van
marched out a prison gate Sunday in the country's biggest-ever
amnesty, heading off on a quest to reunite with the child she has
not seen in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had no contact with my daughter since I came to prison,''
said Vu, whose 1-year-old girl was placed in an orphanage after she
was jailed nearly a decade ago. ''I've been very sad here because I
haven't been able to be a good mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam freed more than 12,000 prisoners nationwide Sunday to
mark the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, which saw
the communist north take control of the U.S.-backed south.
</P>
<P>
   The mood at the Thu Duc K1 Reformation Camp, a two-hour drive
north of Ho Chi Minh City, had the festive feel of a college
graduation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 prisoners, dressed in green-and-white striped
uniforms, said goodbyes to guards and fellow inmates, and clapped
in unison at a ceremony to mark their release.
</P>
<P>
   ''This day is very important day for our country,'' said Lam
Tuyen, 34, who has spent 15 years -- his entire adult life -- in
prison on a murder conviction. ''In personal terms, I feel like I
am being born for a second time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many were smiling as they anticipated reunions with spouses and
relatives just outside the front gate. But there were also plenty
of sad stories from inmates such as Vu, 40, who knew no one was
waiting for her.
</P>
<P>
   Vu was sentenced to 17 years for throwing acid on her husband.
She claimed he was cheating on her. After the incident, her husband
placed their 1-year-old daughter Ngoc in an orphanage, then
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Vu's friends have said they believe Ngoc is in Ho Chi Minh City,
but she doesn't know the name or location of the children's home.
Her most immediate priority was to find a friend to stay with so
she can begin what shaped up to be a difficult search.
</P>
<P>
   Prison authorities selected Vu to give a sort of graduation
address to the other assembled inmates in a sweltering hall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had been betrayed in my marriage and I committed the crime
of attacking my husband in a moment when I lost self-control,'' she
said. ''I came here with shame and unhappiness, and the management
board has helped me quite a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for her departure, several friends donated a
little money. Vu trained as a seamstress in prison, and the outfits
she made for herself were stuffed into a plastic bag that held all
her belongings.
</P>
<P>
   She put on a wide-brimmed white hat, walked out the gate and
past a crush of visitors greeting the freshly released prisoners,
and toward a bus that would take her to Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I find my daughter,'' Vu said, ''the first thing I want
to say to her is, 'Please forgive me.'''

<HEADLINE> New provision with seat belt law begins May 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Drivers who have spent the last 15 years
ignoring the state's seat belt law, listen up: The chance of
getting hit with a $20 fine is growing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, police officers throughout New Jersey will have the
authority to stop drivers who are not wearing seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, officers issued summonses only after stopping
drivers for other reasons -- such as speeding -- and found them or
their front-seat passengers without seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking a very big step in reducing the death and
disability caused by motor-vehicle accidents in New Jersey,'' said
Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, a sponsor of the measure
Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law in January. ''This isn't
about punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Conaway, who is a doctor, said the change also will benefit
children, who are the most vulnerable to injury in automobile
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''By enforcing that requirement, we know the percentage of
adults who wear seat belts will go up, but more importantly, the
number of children will also go up,'' Conaway said.
</P>
<P>
   The Seat Belt Safety Coalition of New Jersey has said the
state's 62 percent compliance rate for seat belt use in the state
falls below the national average of 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Conaway said the council's statistics show children are belted
in only 20 percent of the time when adults they ride with are not.
That figure rises to about 90 percent when adults wear their seat
belts, Conaway said.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA New Jersey Automobile Club reports that 60 percent of
children killed in automobile accidents weren't wearing seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   The safety coalition predicts the greater enforcement will save
up to 50 lives and prevent nearly 2,900 serious injuries per year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must be once a week that I have to tell a family member
that someone died because they weren't wearing a seat belt,'' Dr.
Jennifer Wailer, a trauma physician and chairwoman of the seat belt
coalition, told The Press of Atlantic City in Sunday's editions.
''I can tell you it's very tiring, because this is preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey chapter of the National Motorists Association
opposed the change, arguing that it would be difficult to enforce
and that the number of traffic deaths on New Jersey roads reached a
20-year low in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The current fine of $20 will remain unchanged and offenders will
not be subject to Division of Motor Vehicles points.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Road Rage Victim Clings to Life  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jeremy Grimes spends hours staring through the
glass of a children's intensive-care unit, at the tubes twisting
out of his 2-year-old son's tiny body.
</P>
<P>
   ''You couldn't ask for a better baby,'' he says in the waiting
room during a rare pause in his vigil. ''He's innocent. He loves
his mommy, loves his daddy. He loved everybody, even a complete
stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   A complete stranger fired the bullet that left Anthony clinging
to life.
</P>
<P>
   Grimes was driving his family home for Easter when his
18-wheeler and a car tried to merge into the same lane on
Interstate 20 west of Atlanta, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The car's driver relented but later pulled even with Grimes --
and pointed a gun at him as he passed. About 20 miles later, as
Grimes was preparing to exit at a truck stop, the man fired into
the tractor-trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony was sleeping. The bullet ripped through his shoulder and
the side of his face.
</P>
<P>
   Road rage -- random violence committed by infuriated drivers -- is
becoming more common each year in traffic-choked cities like
Atlanta, where commuters travel farther on average than any other
city in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It happens most often not in daily rush-hour snarls, when
drivers expect frustration, but in moderate traffic. Road-rage
incidents climb at the end of the week and in the spring and
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony was shot just before 9 p.m. on a Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Grimes remembers: His wife, panicked, calling out
to the boy. His other son, 4-year-old Joshua, screaming: ''Pull
over! Pull over!''
</P>
<P>
   Blood everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a public plea for witnesses to come forward, Grimes wondered
aloud last week how anyone could live with himself after randomly
shooting a 2-year-old. What could have been going through the
shooter's head?
</P>
<P>
   But the split-second decisions made by angry drivers confound
rational thought, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the problem -- nothing goes through their head,'' said
Jerry Rubenstein, who studies road rage and teaches psychiatry at
the University of Rochester in New York. ''People go from feeling
to action. The only choices are fight or flight.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Automobile Association's most recent road-rage
study, in 1996, counted an average of nearly 1,500 incidents each
year. AAA has recorded baseball bats, burritos and folding maps as
instruments of road rage, hurled at other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it can be wielded as a weapon, people will use it,'' said
David Willis, who heads AAA's Foundation for Traffic Safety. ''It's
all too easy to lose control in a moment of madness.''
</P>
<P>
   By far, guns remain the weapon of choice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Road rage frustrates law enforcement because it is impulsive,
random, anonymous and often committed by noncriminals, Rubenstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost anyone can relate to the microsecond of blind anger on a
highway that leads to wheel clenching, horn blowing and -- for
drivers driven over the edge -- violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''In that moment, what they're shooting at isn't a person but an
object,'' Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In young Anthony's shooting, investigators can say for sure only
that the gunman was white and that his car was red and had four
doors. They are fairly sure the car was a Ford but have no other
certainties -- much less a tag number. They have heard from only one
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the family is considering hiring a private
investigator, hoping that someone saw who shot Anthony. Doctors
last week gave the boy a 50-50 shot at survival. If he makes it, he
will need major reconstructive surgery to repair his face.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't deserve any of this,'' said Linda Long, Anthony's
grandmother. ''The worst thing he ever did in his life was to not
pick up his toys.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Scalia Focuses on Tradition  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To his admirers, Antonin Scalia is the Supreme
Court justice who emphasizes the intersection of morality and the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a doctor's lawyer was explaining to the court why
Nebraska's ban on ''partial birth'' abortions serves no
constitutionally legitimate purpose when his primary inquisitor cut
him off.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state could have been concerned about rendering society
callous to infanticide ... the horror of seeing a live human
creature outside the womb dismembered,'' Scalia suggested, his tone
approaching exasperation. ''Can't that be a valid societal
interest?''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, as the court heard arguments over the Boy Scouts'
ban on homosexuals, Scalia quickly abandoned arcane legal
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think that homosexuality is immoral,'' he told a lawyer.
So why must the Scouts accept as a leader ''someone who embodies a
contradiction of their message?''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative views of Scalia, the Supreme Court's most
colorful character in black robes, often reflect a passion for what
his supporters call traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important for him to remind us that morality
cannot be divorced from the law,'' said lawyer Jay Sekulow of the
American Center for Law and Justice, an advocacy group founded by
television preacher Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice Scalia acknowledges an intersection between law and
morality,'' he said. ''It's more pronounced now because of the
cases the court has this term -- the partial-birth abortion and Boy
Scouts cases, the grandparents' rights case, the school prayer case
are all examples.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's eight other members also talk and write about the
link between law and morality, but not as forcefully or
consistently as the voluble 64-year-old colleague they call
''Nino.''
</P>
<P>
   When appointed to the nation's highest court by President Reagan
in 1986, Scalia already had a reputation as one of the nation's
most brilliant and conservative federal jurists. The reputation
grows.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when the court reaffirmed the core of its 1973 decision
in Roe vs. Wade -- that women have a constitutional right to end
their pregnancies -- Scalia said no such right exists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I reach that conclusion not because of anything so exalted as
my views concerning the concept of existence, of meaning, of the
universe and the mystery of life,'' he wrote. ''Rather, I reach it
... because of two simple facts: the Constitution says absolutely
nothing about it and the long-standing American traditions of
American society have permitted (abortion) to be legally
proscribed.''
</P>
<P>
   When the court said in 1996 that the all-male Virginia Military
Institute must admit women or give up its state funding, there was
a lone dissenter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is precisely VMI's attachment to such old-fashioned
concepts as manly honor that has made it, and the system it
represents, the target of those who today succeed in abolishing
public single-sex education,'' Scalia wrote.
</P>
<P>
   When the court that same year ruled that Colorado and other
states cannot bar local gay-rights ordinances, Scalia wrote for the
three dissenters. He defended the ''reasonable effort to preserve
traditional American moral values,'' and said courts should not
take sides in the ''culture war'' over society's acceptance of
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin Chemerinsky, a University of Southern California law
professor who disagrees with many of Scalia's legal opinions,
criticized his judicial approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''The irony is he professes that judges shouldn't be making
moral judgments, and he as much as any justice in American history
is all about articulating moral judgments,'' Chemerinsky said.
''They play a key role in his conservative moral agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   More willing than most other justices to leave the ivory tower,
Scalia has not been shy about discussing his religion. A devout
Catholic -- one of his nine children, son Paul, is a priest -- he has
urged Christians to stand up for their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are fools for Christ's sake,'' Scalia said, echoing the
apostle Paul, in a speech to the Christian Legal Society at
Mississippi College's School of Law in Jackson. ''We must pray for
the courage to endure the scorn of the sophisticated world.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other justices, Stephen G. Breyer and Clarence Thomas, also
have spoken in public recently about their religious faith, once a
rarity for Supreme Court members.

Cops Seek Safest Ways To Seize Kids   
By DAVID BRISCOE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police agencies, which rarely take children
with a show of force, say they cannot recall anything like the
Immigration and Naturalization Service operation that removed
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez from his relatives' home using an armed
assault team.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials regularly face the decision of how and
when to use guns to take innocent kids into custody. While few
officers openly criticize the capture of Elian at gunpoint, they
always look for nonviolent options.
</P>
<P>
   Local police, who handle dangerous domestic disputes daily,
avoid either a show of force or use of force whenever they can.
Most of the time, they don't have to go in with guns drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you've got is a child with a warrant out on him, and when
is the next time that that is going to happen?'' asked Lt. Lester
Bell, head of a county Crimes Against Children unit in Georgia.
Federal agents used an alien arrest warrant that declared Elian
''in violation of the immigration laws'' and a search warrant to
enter the Miami house and remove the 6-year-old on April 21.
</P>
<P>
   Even immigration agents, who pursue illegal aliens of all ages,
have never had to use such force to take a child, acknowledged
spokeswoman Maria Cardona.
</P>
<P>
   ''We serve search warrants all the time, but it's the first time
we've had to serve a search warrant to relatives who have remained
unwilling to abide by INS instructions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cardona said, the agency has enforcement agents around
the country ready to stage a similar raid if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of the action was cited by family members and others
in accusing Attorney General Janet Reno of risking the boy's life
to appease Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration denies that. Polls show most American
cheer the return of the boy to his father. And children's rights
groups applaud both the result and the method.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need Janet Reno to go into a thousand homes this week,''
said David L. Levy of the Children's Rights Council. ''Elian is but
the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela S. Stuart-Mills, director of Parental Alienation Syndrome
Research Foundation, said she has witnessed abduction cases where
authorities faced armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely, if ever, has the nation witnessed live, recorded, or
in still photographs the taking of a child with such force as the
Miami operation.
</P>
<P>
   Even with real-life police shows nightly taking viewers along in
patrol cars, the image of a little boy inches from the barrel of a
fearsome automatic rifle still shocked the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 years, the nationally syndicated TV show ''COPS'' has
never shown a child taken at gunpoint from an adult, its producers
say. COPS cameras have never gone with immigration agents, but they
have followed local police in several U.S. cities, as well as
Russia, Britain and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But the show does catch children in criminal circumstances. In a
recent episode, an officer finds two toddlers outside a motel room
door, their grandmother asleep inside.
</P>
<P>
   In such child neglect cases, adults rarely battle police to keep
the kids.
</P>
<P>
   But kidnappers, hijackers, robbers, rapists and violent parents
often use guns, and police face a hard choice.
</P>
<P>
   Some are reluctant to discuss possible tactics, and others don't
want to appear critical of the INS. Asked how Seattle police would
remove a child from a home in a custody case, spokesman Clem Benton
said, ''We're not going to touch that one ... We're not going to
criticize other agencies or offer any kind of comment in that
area.''
</P>
<P>
   But police officials willing to describe their operations, said
they nearly always talk first.
</P>
<P>
   In Cobb County, Ga., officers are not likely to call ahead but
wouldn't come in the middle of the night, said Bell, the children's
crime unit commander.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled an unpublicized case four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had an individual belonging to a paramilitary group. He had
his house fenced, with dogs, and was not sending his kids to school
and was feeding them only once a day. We had to go in and get those
kids,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Five officers were sent in -- two in plainclothes, three in
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ended up talking him into letting us in,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all such confrontations end peacefully. Eighteen children
were among the 80 people killed in what the government calls a mass
suicide of fire and gunfire after the FBI lobbed tear gas into the
Branch Davidian cult compound in Waco, Texas, seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of a deranged parent killing his or her children,
usually followed by a suicide, are more common than stories of
police putting childrens' lives in danger in custody cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wagner, deputy district attorney for California's Orange
County, said he could recall no SWAT-style raid to pick up a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our investigators are armed but usually carry their weapons
underneath their clothing. They select the amount of force
necessary to do the job and make sure no one is hurt,'' Wagner
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, police spokesman Pat Camden doesn't recall anything
similar to the Elian incident, and the force has no specially
trained unit for child recovery.
</P>
<P>
   If such a mission were necessary, ''what we would end up using
is our hostage, barricade and terrorist teams,'' said Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments reveal little about such units, but they are
basically paramilitary-style outfits, with special training. In
Chicago that training doesn't include anything like going into a
house and snatching a kid at gunpoint, said Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most dangerous cases involving children are
kidnappings, handled by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But even the FBI has no child rescue unit, said Chicago bureau
spokesman Ross Rice. Kidnappings for ransom are now rare in
America, he said. Most involve adults and drugs and don't lead to
the need to break into a house to recover a child.

<HEADLINE> St. Paul To Display Snoopy Statues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The dog days of summer will take on a new
meaning this year when St. Paul displays at least 50 Snoopy statues
as a temporary tribute to the late Charles Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, the ''Peanuts'' cartoonist who died in February, was
born in Minneapolis and grew up in the Twin Cities area.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-tall statues will be decorated by invited artists at
RiverCentre June 10-11. After four months on display, they will be
auctioned, with proceeds going toward a permanent downtown statue
showing a collection of ''Peanuts'' characters.
</P>
<P>
   To be selected for the program, artists must attend a workshop
May 9 where the process and details of the program will be
explained. The artists chosen will receive a $1,000 honorarium.
</P>
<P>
   Like the plan itself, all designs must be approved by Creative
Associates, the business arm of Schulz's estate, and United Media,
owner of the comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are hoping the summerlong event, called ''Peanuts
on Parade,'' will attract tourists from around the nation and the
world.

<HEADLINE> Dancer Flatley Gives to Local School  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALOS HEIGHTS, Ill. (AP) -- Michael Flatley took a break from the
European tour of his latest dance extravaganza to drop into his old
neighborhood with a check for $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Flatley, creator and star of ''Lord of the Dance,'' donated the
money Friday to Elim Christian School, which serves students with
developmental disabilities, including Flatley's 14-year-old niece.
Flatley grew up in nearby Oak Lawn, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   He came in from Germany, where the sold-out tour of ''Feet of
Flames'' was touring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love this school,'' Flatley said, as his niece stood by
during a check presentation ceremony. ''They've done such a
marvelous job taking care of my niece ... That's worth all the
money in the world to see her smiling and being very content in her
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The money will go toward a $3 million project to expand and
renovate a house where some of the students, including his niece,
live.

million.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, 320 pieces of furniture, silver, china and other

<HEADLINE> Sen. Set for Guns, Vouchers Showdown  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Democrats, angry that gun trigger locks
and other safety measures remain stalled in juvenile justice
legislation, now have a new vehicle big and popular enough to push
their cause for weeks: education.
</P>
<P>
   And, as debate begins Monday, federal school aid programs may
get caught in the cross hairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't separate safety and security in schools from the
issue of the availability and the accessibility of guns,'' Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said in an interview. ''The public
understands that school violence prevention is a complex issue. The
American people are increasingly demanding that we take action.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the two sides set up ''war rooms'' in the Capitol
Building to highlight their differences on who should control $20
billion in federal K-12 grants. The Democrats replicated a
classroom with student desks and chairs to hold interviews and
Internet chats that coincide with President Clinton's Midwestern
schools tour, promoting class-size reduction and after-school
funding. Republicans planned online chats and events to tout the
flexibility they say they're giving parents and schools with
voucher proposals and block grants.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a clear difference between us on who should set the
priorities; people are going to want to know both sides,'' said
Joseph Karpinski, a spokesman for Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt.,
chairman of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions
Committee. Jeffords is bringing the main proposal to his colleagues
and must oversee the debate. Kennedy is the leading Democrat on the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would hope it could stay a pure debate on education,''
Karpinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he and others will be united in making gun-control
proposals, adding that guns used in the Columbine slayings were
acquired by the teen gunmen through loopholes in laws governing gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you talk about security and safety in schools, most of us
have historically looked at smaller class sizes, after-school
programs, and better trained teachers, but part of this whole thing
is having schools free from easy accessibility to guns,'' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   House lawmakers will soon consider a school safety bill without
trigger-lock requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have long tried to attach gun control to other bills,
but they weren't successful until the 1999 renewal of federal
grants to states for juvenile delinquency programs. However, the
House and Senate plans failed to match: a Senate-passed bill set a
72-hour background check on gun-show sales and a House bill shrank
the wait to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference committee has been assigned to
reconcile differences; normally when there are such differences on
complex legislation, members and their advisers meet privately to
work out a compromise. But politics intensified disagreements.
Democrats unhappy with the pace of negotiations have demanded that
House and Senate negotiators meet openly -- hoping the public glare
will prod them into action.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans have a wide enough gulf to
bridge in rewriting the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,
which helps schools pay for programs ranging from boosting poor
children's grades and test scores to training their teachers. It's
the first time a Republican-led Congress has had a crack at the
34-year old law -- often criticized for failing its mission to
properly educate the nation' poorest kids. Individual plans to
change the bill range from ensuring girls take as many math classes
as boys to restocking library shelves with books published after
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent shootings at The National Zoo here, gun debate
is likely to intensify.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrat leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters
Thursday that, ''We have no choice but to revisit the question on
other bills. Especially given the relationship between guns and
schools these days, I think it's a natural assumption that one
could make that there could be some amendments which will be
offered.''
</P>
<P>
   Focus on guns, observers say, will shortchange education -- and
any hope for either party to craft a voter-friendly message on the
popular election issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's certainly a mistake,'' said Darcy Olsen, who analyzes
education policy for the Cato Institute, a Libertarian think tank.
''It raises eyebrows anytime you try to pass legislation on one
topic under the guise of another. That compromises both gun policy
and education policy.''

Hei-Kyung Hong Adds Luster Met Opera   
An AP Entertainment Review, 
By MIKE SILVERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It didn't seem possible that the Metropolitan
Opera could improve on last season's dazzling revival of Handel's
''Giulio Cesare.'' Then the company unveiled its secret weapon:
Hei-Kyung Hong.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean-born soprano, though hardly a newcomer to the Met,
gave a breakthrough performance Friday night as Cleopatra. The part
of the manipulative, vain and ultimately passionate and loving
Egyptian queen -- portrayed by Handel in a series of eight marvelous
and difficult arias -- gave Hong a chance to demonstrate a vocal and
emotional range she has rarely had an opportunity to display in her
16 seasons at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Her exquisite phrasing and meltingly lovely high notes were
known quantities from past performances in such roles as Liu in
Puccini's ''Turandot'' and Mimi in ''La Boheme.'' But as an actress
she had always seemed subdued. Here she showed a fine comic touch
in the early scenes as the conniving Cleopatra, and depths of
feeling as the queen falls desperately in love with Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   Hong's high notes may not be as pristine nor her ornamentations
as precise as those of other sopranos who have sung the part here,
but her Cleopatra is a major achievement and marks her emergence to
stardom after years in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Her Caesar for the night was mezzo Jennifer Larmore, who sang
the part last season and has also partnered Hong on several recent
recordings and in concerts. Larmore commands nothing but admiration
for her commitment to the stalwart character and her astonishing
execution of the role's daunting coloratura.
</P>
<P>
   Also back from last year were countertenor David Daniels and
mezzo Stephanie Blythe (her formidable voice seems to have grown
even more potent!) who again turned the Act 1 farewell between
mother and son into a show-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   Another countertenor, Brian Asawa, performed well as Cleopatra's
slimy brother, Ptolemy. John Nelson conducted the orchestra with
such verve and nuance that it helped take one's mind off John
Copley's overstuffed production.

Hei-Kyung Hong Adds Luster to Opera   
An AP Entertainment Review, 
By MIKE SILVERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It didn't seem possible that the Metropolitan
Opera could improve on last season's dazzling revival of Handel's
''Giulio Cesare.'' Then the company unveiled its secret weapon:
Hei-Kyung Hong.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean-born soprano, though hardly a newcomer to the Met,
gave a breakthrough performance Friday night as Cleopatra. The part
of the manipulative, vain and ultimately passionate and loving
Egyptian queen -- portrayed by Handel in a series of eight marvelous
and difficult arias -- gave Hong a chance to demonstrate a vocal and
emotional range she has rarely had an opportunity to display in her
16 seasons at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Her exquisite phrasing and meltingly lovely high notes were
known quantities from past performances in such roles as Liu in
Puccini's ''Turandot'' and Mimi in ''La Boheme.'' But as an actress
she had always seemed subdued. Here she showed a fine comic touch
in the early scenes as the conniving Cleopatra, and depths of
feeling as the queen falls desperately in love with Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   Hong's high notes may not be as pristine nor her ornamentations
as precise as those of other sopranos who have sung the part here,
but her Cleopatra is a major achievement and marks her emergence to
stardom after years in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Her Caesar for the night was mezzo Jennifer Larmore, who sang
the part last season and has also partnered Hong on several recent
recordings and in concerts. Larmore commands nothing but admiration
for her commitment to the stalwart character and her astonishing
execution of the role's daunting coloratura.
</P>
<P>
   Also back from last year were countertenor David Daniels and
mezzo Stephanie Blythe (her formidable voice seems to have grown
even more potent!) who again turned the Act 1 farewell between
mother and son into a show-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   Another countertenor, Brian Asawa, performed well as Cleopatra's
slimy brother, Ptolemy. John Nelson conducted the orchestra with
such verve and nuance that it helped take one's mind off John
Copley's overstuffed production.

<HEADLINE> Rutgers' mascot Lord Nelson retires after 22 years  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- The horse who nearly cost Rutgers
university a football game was honored for his 22 years of service
to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Nelson, a 26-year-old quarter horse, was retired from
active duty with the university's mounted patrol service in
January. On Saturday, that retirement became official during a
ceremony at Cook College's Ag Field Day when the horse's scuffed
saddle was replaced with a monogrammed wool saddle blanket.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 football game against Army at Giants Stadium, Lord
Nelson galloped onto the field just after Rutgers had scored a
touchdown in the fourth quarter that put the Scarlet Knights ahead
16-14.
</P>
<P>
   The ball had just been placed for the point-after try when the
horse -- and its costumed rider -- arrived on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers took a 15-yard penalty for ''unsportsmanlike conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows the story of Lord Nelson,'' freshman Erin
Winzorek, a member of the student mounted patrol, told The
Star-Ledger of Newark for Sunday's editions. ''When you walk into
the barn, it's one of the first things you hear.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rutgers professor of equine science Karen Malinowski, who
bought the horse for the university in 1978 for $900, said the
steed's behavior was out of character.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't his fault,'' she said. ''The horse doesn't just go,
someone rides and directs it.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Malinowski bought the horse back to give to her
boyfriend, Tom Mannos, who is now boarding Lord Nelson at a farm in
Freehold.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Rebels Seek Jaffna Boost  </HEADLINE>
By DILIP GANGULY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Jaffna doesn't look like a place worth
dying for.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 years of war, most homes in Sri Lanka's second biggest
city are marred by bullet holes. There are landmines in the school
playgrounds. Food and power are scarce. The city is surrounded by
miles of dry, flat landscape.
</P>
<P>
   But retaking Jaffna from the government would be a huge morale
boost for ethnic Tamil rebels who have mounted an advance toward
the city that in four months has so far left more than 1,380 dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no great economic or geographical significance of
Jaffna. But psychologically it is the center of Eelam,'' says
Dharmalingam Siddharthan, a parliament member of the Tamil minority
speaking of his people's ancient homeland.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam win back their
former capital after five years of government control, it could
wreck chances for peace talks and an autonomy proposal put forward
by the Sri Lankan president.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are poised 15 miles from the city, preparing for a
final offensive, following an April 21-22 battle that captured a
strategic highway connecting the Jaffna peninsula to the mainland
and sent more than 10,000 government forces into retreat.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Tigers claimed another major victory, saying they
had captured a key army base at Pallai, on the route to Jaffna, as
well as surrounding villages in heavy fighting. The army denied the
rebel claim, saying fighting continued.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels now control the main land route to Jaffna, making it
difficult for the government to supply its 40,000 troops and nearly
500,000 civilians living in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting some of the fiercest fighting ever in this island
nation the size of West Virginia, the government has rushed to buy
more advanced artillery.
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga made a final call for
negotiations, but the Tigers were silent, making clear they intend
to try to take the city.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed, the peace talks, which Norway has been trying
to broker, could be among the casualties. While the Tamils may be
more willing to negotiate if they held a position of strength, the
majority Sinhalese in the south would likely turn against talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attitude of the people in the south who are agitating
against a dialogue will be further strengthened. They might even
get violent against Tamils,'' said S.T. Hettige, a social scientist
and professor at Colombo University.
</P>
<P>
   ''Military defeats have a symbolic meaning and such a defeat
would lead the sides to become further polarized,'' Hettige said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger victory at Jaffna would mean the revival of a de facto
Tamil nation, and would ruin Kumaratunga's strategy of sidelining
the rebels while appealing to mainstream Tamils with a proposal to
grant them autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   She was hoping that August elections would strengthen her
Peoples' Alliance party's one-seat majority in the 224-member
Parliament so she could push through the autonomy package.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels say they are fighting for the rights of 3.2 million
Tamils, who complain of widespread discrimination at the hands of
the country's 15.4 million Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers still command loyalty among some Tamils, but have
alienated many with revenge killings and assassinations of
politicians. If they take over Jaffna, there could be a bloodbath
of Tamils who sided with the government during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffna is already plagued by the side effects of war: divided
families, high prices and sudden bursts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 400 years, Jaffna was a base of sea pirates preying
on Portuguese ships. It became a Portuguese, then a Dutch
possession, and finally part of Britain's tea-producing colony of
Ceylon in 1795.
</P>
<P>
   When the British left Sri Lanka in 1948, Jaffna was a vibrant
city. But tens of thousands of Tamils have since migrated to more
than a dozen countries to escape the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil uprising, led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, 45, began in
Jaffna in 1983. From 1990-95, the Tigers ran a virtually
independent state in the 1,000 square mile Jaffna peninsula on the
northern tip of the island. They had their own police, civil
administration, jails, visa system, courts and even a small navy.
</P>
<P>
   But a 50-day army offensive in 1995 pushed the rebels into the
jungles further south, where they reverted to traditional guerrilla
tactics, including bomb attacks and assassinations in the Sinhalese
heartland and the capital, Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   In a steady offensive beginning in November, the rebels scored a
string of victories, with 10 government outposts falling in
succession and hundreds of soldiers deserting.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects them to back away from their prize now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jaffna is the center of Tamil culture and civilization,'' said
parliament member R. Sambandan, a Tamil. ''It also produced most of
the Tamil leaders (and) was historically a Tamil kingdom.''

<HEADLINE> Africa Group Sorry for Slave Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Officials from the West African nation
Benin apologized during a ceremony here for their country's role in
once selling fellow Africans by the millions to white slave
traders.
</P>
<P>
   The group is making several stops in Virginia and Washington,
D.C., to publicize President Mathieu Kerekou's recent apologies for
his country's participation in the slave trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cry for forgiveness and reconciliation,'' said Luc
Gnacadja, minister of environment and housing for Benin. ''The
slave trade is a shame, and we do repent for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Benin, a county of 4.7 million people, was called Dahomey in the
17th century, when it was a major supplier of slaves for white
exporters shipping from what was called the Slave Coast. Some
accounts say Dahomey rounded up more than 3 million people for sale
to slave traders.
</P>
<P>
   Gnacadja spoke Saturday at a James River dock where, before the
Civil War, slaves were shipped into Richmond, unloaded and marched
across a bridge to downtown holding pens to await auction. The city
is developing their trail as a monument.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony also included an ''acknowledgment that slavery was
wrong'' by several speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Barbour, commander of the Virginia Division of the
Sons of Confederate Veterans, told those gathered that while his
group is proud of its heritage, it deplores slavery.

<HEADLINE> Arrests After Azerbaijan Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) -- A leading opposition group said Sunday
that 200 people were arrested and 60 wounded in a protest that saw
police with batons violently disperse about 1,000 demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   The Azerbaijani Popular Front said in a statement that 15 of its
members, including several leaders, were arrested during the
protest on Saturday. It said criminal cases have been opened
against three of the arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders held the rally in downtown Baku to demand
that this fall's parliamentary elections be free of fraud or
government intimidation. Authorities refused to sanction it, saying
they could hold a demonstration on the city's outskirts instead.
</P>
<P>
   But demonstrators ignored the order, and hundreds broke through
police lines around the central Fizuli Square. Their ranks swelled
and police wielding shields and batons beat them back. An
Associated Press reporter at the rally saw three people sprawled on
the road, their heads smeared with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 46 people were detained and 34 policemen wounded in
the clashes, which lasted for much of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan's authoritarian President Geidar Aliev has been
criticized by international human rights groups for cracking down
on opposition and independent media in the former Soviet republic.
The 1998 vote in which he won re-election was boycotted by the
opposition and called undemocratic by foreign observers.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Khatami Activist Jailed in Iran  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- The head of Iran's largest reformist student
group was jailed Sunday in a widening crackdown by hard-liners, who
reportedly are also seeking to remove two top pro-reform Cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Afshari, head of the Office for Fostering Unity, was sent
into detention after several hours of questioning by the
Revolutionary Court in Tehran, said officials of the student group,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if Afshari was charged with any crime. Judicial
officials were not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives in the Islamic clerical regime have over the past
two week closed down 16 newspapers, arrested two journalists and
questioned numerous reform activists in a backlash to preserve
their power against the increasingly strong pro-democracy movement.
</P>
<P>
   Newpapers reported Sunday that the outgoing parliament, which is
controlled by hard-liners, has summoned Culture Minister Ataollah
Mohajerani and Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari, both
leading supporters of reform, to face impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The student leader Afshari and two newspaper editors -- all
staunch allies of popular President Mohammad Khatami -- were
questioned by the court about their presence at a conference in
Berlin, Germany, earlier this month, at which slogans criticizing
Iran's religious government were chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The editors -- Ezzatollah Sahabi of Iran-e-Farda magazine and
Hamid-Reza Jalaipour of the Asr-e-Azadegan daily -- were freed after
their interrogation. Both of their publications have been banned.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, Jalaipour said the court told him that his
participation at the Berlin conference ''was an act against Iran's
security and that I had propagated against the Islamic Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jalaipour said the men had tried to defend the ongoing reforms
at the conference, but were attacked by anti-government Iranians in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a strange situation. Abroad, we are attacked by
anti-revolutionaries as agents of the Islamic establishment in
Iran, and at home they attack us as agents of the enemies,''
Jalaipour told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the same court arrested two women reformists for
attending the Berlin conference. A third woman activist, Jamileh
Kadivar, the wife of Culture Minister Mohajerani, has been asked to
appear in court on Monday for questioning, Jalaipour said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohajerani has allowed the pro-democracy press to flourish since
Khatami's 1997 election and narrowly survived an impeachment vote
last year. Lari became Interior Minister after his predecessor,
Abdollah Nouri, was impeached by hard-liners three years ago. Nouri
is now in jail, serving a five-year sentence on charges of
religious dissent.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately known when the impeachment process
against Mohajerani and Lari will begin.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners' actions are seen as an assault of some of the
main bases of support for Khatami, who has worked to loosen the
strict Islamic limitations on political and social life. Khatami
allies wrested control of the parliament from hard-liners with an
overwhelming victory in February elections.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, in his strongest reaction yet to the hard-liners,
Khatami insisted that his reforms were unstoppable. Khatami also
rebutted charges that the reformists were anti-Islamic and
foreign-inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers fear that the conservative clergy is trying to
instigate violence as a pretext for bringing troops into the
streets and declaring a state of emergency so as to delay the
opening of the new parliament on May 27.

<HEADLINE> State's highest court official calls for end to traffic ticket pleadeals  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey's top court administrator has
outlawed plea bargains in traffic cases, bringing an end to a
long-standing practice in which prosecutors agree to drop the
initial charges. In exchange, motorists plead guilty to a lesser
offense that carries a steeper fine but no driving points.
</P>
<P>
   In letters dated April 24, Judge Richard J. Williams, acting
administrative director of Administrative Office of the Courts,
wrote that the ban -- which has the backing of Passaic and Bergen
county prosecutors -- was a question of judicial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plea agreement process must be conducted strictly in
accordance with the rules,'' he told assigment judges.
</P>
<P>
   Local prosecutors, police and public defenders don't disagree,
but have warned that without the plea bargains, more motorists will
choose to go to trial, creating gridlock and chaos in municipal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Christopher ''Kip'' Bateman, R-Somerset, who is also
the Bridgewater prosecutor, told The Star-Ledger of Newark for
Sunday's editions that the move ''has the potential of bringing the
municipal court system to a halt.''
</P>
<P>
   Municipal Court Judge John Blunt, who handles cases in five
Bergen County towns, told The Record of Hackensack that pleas are
given in up to half the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Without the plea bargains, he said, ''this would almost
quadruple the caseload of trials.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry and some law enforcement officials
supported the ban, saying deals allowed unsafe drivers to continue
their habits without consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ''Proper enforcement of the motor vehicle law can only benefit
citizens,'' said Sgt. James Rhoades, a spokesman for the Passaic
City police department.
</P>
<P>
   State officials privately welcomed the ban, because downgraded
offenses bring the state less money from traffic fines and
surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   The number of speeding tickets registered with the Department of
Motor Vehicles dropped from 300,728 in 1995 to 268,786 last year --
with a corresponding revenue drop.
</P>
<P>
   But many court and law enforcement officials were ambivalent
about the change, saying that while the system is open to some
abuse, strict enforcement may punish drivers more harshly than
their offense warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Caserta, vice president of the Passaic County Bar
Association, acknowledged that the ban on pleas was legally
accurate, but questioned its necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of rules that are not enforced to the letter
of the law,'' Caserta said. ''This is a minor thing, and who is
complaining? No one.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Crisis Worsens With Economy  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco auctions have been
disappointing. Its tourism industry is badly ailing. The United
Nations warns of a potential food shortage in a country already
suffering 50 percent unemployment and 70 percent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The often-violent occupations of white-owned farms has plunged
Zimbabwe deeper into political crisis. Now international efforts to
resolve the crisis are deadlocked -- making it unclear when or if
the country can pull out of its freefall.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a national economic standpoint, it bodes very badly,''
said Scott Taylor, a professor of African politics at Smith College
in Massachusetts. ''You are scaring away investment dollars. You
are scaring off tourist dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations food agency warned Friday that the crisis on
many of Zimbabwe's commercial farms threatens the country's food
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is ... growing concern that if the violence continues,
there will be a serious drop in food production and supply,
jeopardizing national food security,'' U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization said in a release Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco auctions started this week. But little of the crop,
Zimbabwe's main hard currency earner, was delivered to the auction
floor. Tourism, another hard currency earner, has also plunged with
the recent violence.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the hard currency the country does earn is going to fund
the deployment of 11,000 troops backing embattled President Laurent
Kabila in the Congo civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition accuses President Robert Mugabe of organizing
farm occupations, which are reputedly led by veterans of Zimbabwe's
independence war, to boost the dwindling support for his ZANU-PF
party ahead of a parliamentary election that must be held by
August.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ruling party's objective is to simply make sure that it
wins the election,'' said Norma Kriger, a visiting political
science professor at Goucher College in Baltimore, Md., who has
studied Zimbabwe's war veterans. ''If the war veterans continue
with their tactics, there can't be a free and fair election, and
ZANU-PF will win through intimidation and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   At a rally Sunday, Chenjerai Hunzvi, the militant leader of the
National Liberation War Veterans Association, dismissed allegations
of a link to the elections as ''utter rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It has nothing to do with the elections. It has to do with the
fair distribution of land among Zimbabweans. To say that Mugabe is
using the war veterans, that is utter nonsense,'' said Hunzvi, who
wore a T-shirt emblazoned with Mugabe's picture and the slogan:
''Vote Mugabe.''
</P>
<P>
   Squatters, who now hold more than 1,000 farms, began occupying
the lands in February just days after the defeat of a
constitutional referendum put forward by Mugabe that would have
allowed the state to seize white-owned farms for redistribution
without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party-dominated parliament passed a farm seizure law
anyway, and on Saturday officials announced that Mugabe plans to
invoke special powers to seize and redistribute white-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after land reform talks between
Zimbabwean and British officials in London that many hoped could
resolve the crisis ended in a stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe says that Britain, as Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler,
has an obligation to fund land reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Britain refuses to follow through on its pledge to give $57
million for land reform unless Zimbabwe ends the violence, stops
the occupations and holds free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''This cannot be the way to solve the genuine problems of land
reform,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   At least 13 people -- mostly farmers, farm workers and opposition
members -- have been killed since the occupations started. The
violence continues despite repeated agreements between
representatives of the farmers and the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe has the resources to rebound from its crisis, said
Robert Rotberg, professor of political science at Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zimbabwe has an enormously capable entrepreneurial class. It
has the best educated population on the African continent per
capita,'' he said. ''It's got everything going for it except good
governance.''

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Competition Trial To Begin  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The future of newspaper competition in the
city will be shaped in federal court this week as the Hearst Corp.
defends its purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle and the
subsidized transfer of the San Francisco Examiner to a local
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit by Clint Reilly, a former mayoral candidate and
unsuccessful bidder for the Examiner, contends the Chronicle
purchase was rigged and that the Examiner's transfer is a sham,
designed to give Hearst a local newspaper monopoly after more than
a century of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The trial begins Monday and is scheduled to last all week.
</P>
<P>
   All three publishers -- Hearst, the Chronicle Publishing Co., and
Ted Fang, owner of a free local newspaper group and prospective
publisher of the Examiner -- say their transactions will promote
competition, not destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department found no antitrust violations in the
sale and approved the dissolution of the joint operating agreement
under which the Chronicle and Examiner have been published since
1965. The agreement, which combines business operations but keeps
editorial staffs separate, was scheduled to run through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, who is presiding over the
non-jury trial, issued a restraining order against the Chronicle
sale March 30, a day before it was to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the purpose of the federal law that authorized the
joint operating agreement -- to keep foundering newspapers afloat --
would not be served if the transactions that ended the JOA were
designed to let only one paper survive.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst announced its $660 million purchase of the Chronicle, the
second-largest newspaper in California and 12th-largest in the
nation last August. Hearst said it would sell or close the
Examiner, one of the largest remaining afternoon papers, after
120-years of Hearst ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said its agents later contacted more than 80 prospective
buyers and found no one willing to pay for the money-losing
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   But Fang, publisher of the Independent newspaper and Asian Week,
agreed to assume ownership and accept a $66 million subsidy over
three years. He said he plans to switch the afternoon Examiner to
morning publication in August and compete for San Francisco readers
with the Chronicle, which has more than four times the Examiner's
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly argued in court papers that Hearst used the joint
operating agreement to exclude other potential buyers of the
Chronicle, who would have had to assume the larger paper's JOA
obligation to split profits with the Examiner through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he offered to take over the Examiner if he got a
$200 million subsidy over six years -- $50 million less than the
amount needed for a competitive newspaper, according to experts he
consulted.
</P>
<P>
   Fang's company, ExIn LLC, countered that Fang and his family
have revived eight failed newspapers and can do the same for the
Examiner. Hearst argued that the fate of the Examiner is legally
irrelevant to its purchase of the Chronicle.

<HEADLINE> Unlikely Chief for Vieques Activists  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- They call him ''The Gringo,'' but
with affection.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many protesters trying to evict the U.S. Navy from its
bombing range on Vieques Island, Massachusetts native Robert Rabin
-- a de facto spokesman for the movement -- is considered something
of a Puerto Rican patriot.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's as much a Vieques native as any of us by now,'' Vieques
protester William Dick Otero said of the man whose walrus mustache
and bushy explosion of hair have become a fixture on Puerto Rican
TV screens. ''He's a perfect leader, and we have accepted him as
one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   A 46-year-old native of Everett, Mass., Rabin studied Spanish at
the University of Massachusetts and taught history at a high school
before coming to Vieques in 1980 for three weeks of research on a
master's thesis on government expropriation of Latin American
lands.
</P>
<P>
   Fascinated by the Puerto Rican island of 9,400 people and its
uneasy relationship with the Navy, which purchased two-thirds of
Vieques 60 years ago, he soon returned, got a job teaching social
studies at a local high school and joined the anti-Navy cause. He
never finished his thesis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I overstayed a little,'' Rabin jokes now. Twenty years later,
he is married to a Puerto Rican and is director of the Vieques
history museum, housed in a former Spanish fortress.
</P>
<P>
   When security guard David Sanes Rodriguez was killed in an
accidental bombing inside the Navy's training ground last year,
Rabin helped set up a protest camp outside the main gate to the
range. He remains one of its most dedicated caretakers -- bringing
in food, organizing rallies, greeting visitors from abroad and
giving interviews to an endless stream of reporters from Puerto
Rico and the U.S. mainland.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities reportedly were planning a raid this week to
arrest the activists and allow the Navy to reclaim its prime
live-fire Atlantic training ground. The protesters are blocking
implementation of an agreement by President Clinton and Puerto Rico
Gov. Pedro Rossello to order the Navy out of Vieques by May 2003 if
island residents vote in a referendum to expel them. Until the
vote, expected next year, the Navy can resume limited exercises
without explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin has been at the center of clashes with Navy authorities at
the range. At one point, he led protesters in chaining the gates
shut, forcing Navy security guards to toss supplies and food over
the fence until the two sides reached a compromise on whom
protesters would allow to enter. Last week, he and other protesters
scuffled with guards who tried to bring in a vehicle full of
off-island contractors.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, he presided over a weekly protest rally and
led 80 people in chants of ''Vieques, yes! Navy, no!''
</P>
<P>
   It's a role that has put Rabin at odds with local supporters of
the Navy, some of them fellow U.S. transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what he's doing is infantile,'' said Helen Greenblatt,
a longtime Vieques resident from Boston who employed Rabin at her
inn as a handyman. ''He's very intelligent and he should be using
it to do some good here instead of writing 'Navy go home' on the
beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among Navy opponents, not everyone has welcomed Rabin's
participation. Some grumble about the frequent television coverage
his protest camp gets compared to the more remote -- and dangerous --
protest camps deep inside the bomb-littered Navy range. As he
comforted a sister of Sanes after a recent service commemorating
the guard's death, Rabin was confronted by a protester shouting,
''Out with all Americans!''
</P>
<P>
   Others suspect he's a U.S. infiltrator.
</P>
<P>
   ''People suspect me, and they should. It would be unreasonable
for them not to be suspicious of an American like me,'' Rabin said.
''I just tell people that I must be the slowest undercover agent in
the world, since I've been here 20 years and still haven't cracked
the case.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Health Report Positive  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rudolph Giuliani's campaign manager expects his
candidate to stay in the U.S. Senate race because his prostate
cancer has not spread.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not only my hope, but my expectation, that he will run,''
Bruce Teitelbaum told ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''Hopefully he'll pick a
course of treatment that will give him a cure, a complete cure and
then we'll be able to move forth aggressively, with a winning
campaign. That's our hope, and I know the mayor shares my
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Sunday that he, too, sees the
Republican mayor of New York staying in the race against first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm confident that he will be back,'' McCain told ABC's ''This
Week.'' ''The odds are overwhelming that he'll be fine and that he
will be very active and I believe he'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has offered to campaign for Giuliani while the mayor
meets with doctors. But McCain said he's sure Giuliani, who was
playing golf Sunday with his son, will be campaigning again soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very confident he'll be on the trail soon and he'll win
and he won't need any of us,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the mayor won't make a decision on cancer
treatment or on the campaign for 10 days to two weeks. That will
take up important campaign and fund-raising time before the state
Republican convention in Buffalo on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stayed away from any reference to the mayor in a speech
Sunday to a Catholic organization of union electricians. She
criticized the tax cut favored by GOP presidential candidate George
W. Bush, but she left Giuliani -- whom she's bashed in the past on
the tax issue -- out of her attack.
</P>
<P>
   She also did not mention the mayor when she told the audience,
''This election season, it is not enough just to compare what the
candidates say, or who looks good on TV, or who has the fastest
response to the question, but instead to get below the surface and
think very seriously, 'Are the policies going to help or hurt my
family?'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been criticized for failing to comment immediately
on news developments, while Giuliani is often more forthcoming with
his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts predicted that the first lady would tone
down her rhetoric against the mayor because it would be unseemly to
attack him now that he has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post in Sunday's editions released a poll that
identified Gov. George Pataki as the ''best choice'' among
Republicans to take on Clinton if Giuliani should drop out. U.S.
Rep. Rick Lazio, who put his Senate campaign on hold to make way
for Giuliani, was a distant second.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Vietnam Hinders Trade  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some American political leaders who served
during the Vietnam War said Sunday that, 25 years after the war's
end, Vietnam has not flourished economically in part because
Vietnamese leaders have hindered free trade with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's government tentatively approved a bilateral trade
agreement with the United States last summer but officials have
held off signing a final deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The leadership backed off,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
speaking on CBS' ''Face the Nation.'' ''They have a million and a
half citizens entering the work force every year now and they are
not creating those jobs, and that's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   The pact would bring an estimated $800 million in trade to
Vietnam. But it also would put Vietnam's inefficient state-owned
industries -- most already running in the red -- in direct
competition with powerful U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Pete Peterson, also a Vietnam
veteran, said there was a surge of interest and investment in
Southeast Asia in recent years in anticipation that the Vietnamese
would move ahead with reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, they have stalled out, and what you see now is
the energy of the residual investments and you're not getting quite
as much activity in Vietnam as you could you have. That's the real
sad piece of this,'' Peterson told ''Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he believes U.S. and other foreign investment is
declining in Vietnam as a result, and Peterson added that the
Vietnamese government should act quickly to stem the tide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're waiting from the Vietnamese a word, a signal that
they're prepared to sign the agreement. America is ready to sign it
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at the Vietnam War Memorial, dozens of Vietnamese
children who were evacuated and brought to the United States held a
tearful reunion in honor of the 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, who were adopted by American families, were part
of various airlifts out of Vietnam. In the waning days of the war,
Operation Babylift was authorized by President Ford to evacuate
some 70,000 Vietnamese orphans, many fathered by American GIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remember a lot of what we went through,'' said adoptee
Jonathan Shipler. ''Part of this reunion is a healing process for
that and a reconnection, an enrichment for us, which I think we
will take with us the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, McCain raised the ire of some Vietnamese
officials when he said the wrong side won. He defended that
position Sunday and said he has held that view for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thousands of executions, the millions who went to
re-education camps, the millions who left on boats, clearly
indicate that bad things happened after the communists won,''
McCain told ABC's ''This Week With Sam Donaldson And Cokie
Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, who has been a strong advocate of normalized
diplomatic relations with Vietnam, added that he wants ''to move
forward. I don't look back. I made my peace with Vietnam. I want to
continue this process of reconciliation and healing.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, two other Vietnam veterans in the Senate, Max Cleland,
D-Ga., and Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said Sunday that although they
believe the U.S. government's strategy in fighting the war was
wrong, Southeast Asia is better off today for the United States
having fought there.
</P>
<P>
   ''If America had not made a stand and made that commitment,
would Southeast Asia look different today? Of course, it would,''
Hagel said. ''Would it look far worse than the opportunities of
emerging democracies and economies and freedom today? Of course, it
would.''

<HEADLINE> Top-Ranking Citadel Woman Demoted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The Citadel's top-ranking female cadet,
one of the first women to attend the school, has been demoted over
her reaction to being targeted by a mess hall prank.
</P>
<P>
   Petra Lovetinska went from cadet major and battalion executive
officer to senior private and received 20 demerits. She also was
ordered to do 40 marching tours in the barracks. Each tour is 50
minutes, at a pace of 120 steps per minute, while carrying a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Lovetinska, who graduates May 13, was targeted by the prank
called ''wiping out the shoes,'' said Citadel spokeswoman Heather
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The prank -- part of the 154-year-old military school's tradition
-- goes like this: An upperclassman tells a freshman cadet, called a
knob, to crawl under the table and pour condiments such as ketchup
or salad dressing on an upperclassman's shoes without getting
caught.
</P>
<P>
   Success wins the knob the admiration of classmates, commanding
officers and other upperclassmen. Failure typically results in a
pitcher of tea being poured on the knob.
</P>
<P>
   What got Lovetinska in trouble is the way she reacted, Anderson
said. She grabbed the knob, a male cadet, and wiped her shoes on
his trousers.
</P>
<P>
   The commandant of cadets, Brig. Gen. Emory Mace, issued the
punishment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lovetinska, one of the first four women to attend The Citadel in
1996 after the school dropped its all-male admissions policy, has
done well at the school. Lovetinska has consistently made the
dean's list. She was the first female cadet major. And in March,
Lovetinska received The Citadel's highest honor, the Palmetto
Medal.
</P>
<P>
   But Lovetinska was punished as any other cadet charged with
gross poor judgment, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Disciplinary matters generally are kept secret. But Lovetinska
gave school officials permission to discuss the situation with The
(Charleston) Post and Courier.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone message left Sunday at Lovetinska's residence by The
Associated Press was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Lovetinska cannot regain her rank, but Citadel policy will allow
her to wear her cadet major stripes -- the highest rank she attained
-- on her uniform during graduation.
</P>
<P>
   The knob who put what was thought to be French salad dressing on
Lovetinska's shoes April 20 and the upperclassman who asked him to
do it were not disciplined.

<HEADLINE> Israel Fortifying Lebanese Border  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli government ministers worked on plans
Sunday for the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, while workers
were busy expanding the army's fortifications on the northern
border.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian contractors, meanwhile, have toured the frontier with
Lebanon to prepare for construction of a new electronic border
fence.
</P>
<P>
   In their discussions with the security Cabinet, Israeli generals
have warned that attacks by Lebanese guerrillas may continue after
Israel's pullout from its self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   They say that Israeli civilians living near the border could be
in danger after the withdrawal, which is to take place by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Their predictions have drawn accusations of scare mongering, but
one minister, himself a retired general, said the generals were
only doing their job by presenting worst-case scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army presents the tough scenarios, because it is
responsible for providing a response to them if they happen,'' said
Sports and Culture Minister Matan Vilnai, a former deputy chief of
staff. ''It can't say afterward: 'I didn't anticipate this.' It has
to prepare for these eventualities now,'' he told army radio.
</P>
<P>
   The army took civilian contractors on a tour of the northern
frontier on Thursday, and in a few days they will begin moving the
border fence back to the position it held before Israeli forces
entered Lebanon in 1982, said a military official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic fence was moved northward, in most cases only a
few yards, to make the border easier to defend against
infiltrators. Now the contractors will have to move about 25 miles
of fence southward, while the remaining 50 miles of fence will be
repaired or replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Vilnai conceded that the old border, a 1923 colonial boundary
that is the only internationally recognized boundary between Israel
and Lebanon, may be less suitable for Israel's military needs. But
he said the withdrawal from Lebanese territory must be complete, so
that neither the guerrillas nor their Syrian backers will have any
legal grounds for continuing their attacks. ''We cannot leave the
other side any pretext,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are already expanding army positions inside the border
to accommodate troops once they withdraw from Lebanon. Lookout
posts will be set up atop hills on the Israeli side of the border
to replace outposts inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, about 50 new army positions of all sizes will be
erected along the border.
</P>
<P>
   The army has not yet decided whether to blow up its outposts
across the border or hand them over to UNIFIL, the United Nations
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen told Israel last week it has to
withdraw to the international border and to clear or mark
minefields it laid on the Lebanese side of the border. Sunday, he
briefed Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the planned withdrawal
from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat told reporters he was working to ensure the safety of an
estimated 350,000 Palestinians living in refugee camps in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Boss Gets $40M Severance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- The toy company that makes Barbie may
be struggling financially, but its former boss isn't. She just
received a nearly $40 million severance package.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mattel Inc. chief executive Jill Barad was given $26.4
million in cash -- five times her base salary plus maximum bonuses,
the company disclosed Friday. Barad resigned in February after
Mattel reported a steep fourth-quarter loss, capping a string of
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel also agreed to waive the balance of a $3 million home
loan, forgive another $4.2 million loan and pay $3.3 million in
state and federal assessments on those transactions, the company
said in its annual proxy statement to the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Barad, 46, also will receive $709,000 a year for life in
retirement benefits
</P>
<P>
   Mattel spokesman Glenn Bozarth said Sunday the company was not
commenting on the package.
</P>
<P>
   However, big companies defend such packages as necessary to
attract top-talent to high-risk CEO jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts earlier this month, interim
chief executive Ronald Loeb defended Barad's severance package.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've acted very ethically in doing what we did,'' he said.
''Our real focus was getting on with business and getting as many
diversions as possible behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Barad resigned in February after three years as the company's
chief executive. In a 21-year career at Mattel she helped build
Barbie from a $320-million U.S. doll business in 1985 to a
$2-billion global brand by 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But in her final year the company went into a tailspin, partly
due to $300 million in losses incurred last year by Learning Co.,
the creator of ''Carmen Sandiego'' and other children's software.

Fussy Vanya Makes for Showy Chekhov   
An AP Entertainment Review, 
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Anton Chekhov's ''Uncle Vanya'' may be a comedy,
but it's not a knockabout farce, something Derek Jacobi appears to
have forgotten in his overly fussy and showy performance now on
view at Broadway's Brooks Atkinson Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi's Vanya is a preening peacock of a man, a strange bird
who seems to be standing outside this uneven Roundabout Theater
Company revival and commenting on it.
</P>
<P>
   The English actor is giving one of those all-knowing
performances that is long on technique but more than a little short
of any emotional connection to his character or the play.
</P>
<P>
   And emotion -- lots of it -- bubbles right under the surface in
''Uncle Vanya,'' with people never saying what they really think or
feel until it is too late.
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Mayer apparently has given everyone his
blessing to do what they please. There are several remarkable
actors here, so that laissez-faire attitude isn't all bad, but any
sense of consistency evaporates very early in the first act.
</P>
<P>
   Vanya represents the epitome of the wasted life, a man who has
looked after his brother-in-law's country estate for the last 25
years with little recognition and less money. Even after his
sister's death, Vanya continues to work there, kept company by his
mother and helped in his chores by a forlorn niece, Sonya.
</P>
<P>
   The brother-in-law, a pedantic scholar, is totally not grateful
or aware of Vanya's desperate condition. Brian Murray plays the
role with delightful comic obtuseness, a rare instance where the
comedy illuminates a character in this production.
</P>
<P>
   Vanya is not alone in his feelings of unfulfillment. There's
Astrov, a weary country doctor whose aimless existence is
interrupted by very few things. Tending the trees on his small
estate is one. Doting on the old scholar's new -- and much younger --
wife, Elena, is another. Vanya likes her, too, which sets up a
subtle competition between the two men for her affection.
</P>
<P>
   As the cynical physician who loses his heart to this unavailable
woman, Roger Rees gives the evening's most satisfying performance.
He lifts the play out of comedy into the realm of heartbreak,
particularly in the scene where he shyly romances Elena. Rees plays
it with a tentativeness that is most touching -- and believable.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Linney's Elena is an enigma, pretty but not registering
very high on the fascination scale, which leads one to wonder why
the doctor and Vanya are fussing about her.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are several affecting portraits among the supporting
players, particularly Amy Ryan as the lonely, spinterish Sonya and
Anne Pitoniak as the old Nurse, one of those Chekhovian symbols of
common sense who outlasts everybody else. David Patrick Kelly is
saddled with a one-joke part, a fawning tenant farmer forever in
the scholar's debt, and the laughs about his obsequiousness run out
long before the play does.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one can't fault Mike Poulton's adaptation. His version of
''Uncle Vanya'' serves Chekhov well. It's a modern, muscular
translation that never sounds stilted or academic.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Tony Walton's massive settings, surrounded by birch
trees, are properly gloomy, particularly a decaying front porch.
</P>
<P>
   For all the laughs that precede the final curtain, ''Uncle
Vanya'' should leave the audience with a sense of sadness, of what
might have been. Instead, the feeling at the Brooks Atkinson is one
of relief -- to finally have escaped the more than melancholy
musings of some very unhappy people.

<HEADLINE> France Cops Crack Illegal Work Ring  </HEADLINE>
By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Police have dismantled an illegal work ring that
brought deaf foreigners to France and forced them to peddle
trinkets to restaurant patrons for practically no pay, judicial
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people were arrested throughout France, including six
Ukrainians placed under investigation and jailed late Saturday. The
Ukrainians are suspected of organizing the secret operation and
hiring foreigners without working papers, judicial sources said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged ringleaders, who were also deaf, are thought to have
lured hundreds of people from Eastern Europe to France, promising
them papers and a job.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were forced to sell key chains and lighters to
diners in restaurants, going from table to table with notes
explaining their disability.
</P>
<P>
   Their work earned the leaders $275,000 a month. Police, who
dismantled the ring Friday, said the workers were living in
miserable conditions and were barely paid.
</P>
<P>
   A similar case came to light in 1997 in the United States. An
exploitation ring in New York and other cities had been earning one
million dollars a year from deaf Mexican immigrants forced to sell
cheap trinkets in subways.
</P>
<P>
   After four victims fled and notified authorities, police found
57 people living as virtual prisoners in two New York apartments.
Smaller operations were broken up in Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ringleaders, most of them also deaf, pleaded guilty to
crimes ranging from criminal conspiracy to immigrant smuggling and
enslavement.

<HEADLINE> Peru To Vote for President May 28  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The runoff vote between Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori, who is seeking an unprecedented third term, and
challenger Alejandro Toledo will take place on May 28, the National
Election Board said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The board announced the date after formally receiving final
returns from the April 9 first round election that confirmed
neither candidate received the majority required for victory.
</P>
<P>
   According to those results, Fujimori fell just shy of a majority
with 49.87 percent of the vote, to 40.24 percent for Toledo, a
54-year-old U.S.-trained economist.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, the two candidates announced an agreement to hold
an unprecedented public debate on a date yet to be set.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has threatened to withdraw from the second round of
balloting unless ''effective measures'' are taken to ensure that
irregularities benefiting Fujimori reported in the first round did
not occur again.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's chief spokesman, Jose Ferrero, on Sunday said the
withdrawal is still a possibility, ''unless conditions are changed
in a substantial manner.'' He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   But Peru's Ombudsman, Jorge Santibanez, said the May 28 date set
by the Board does not allow enough time to make the changes
necessary to ensure a clean vote. He suggested the election should
have been set for June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has angrily denied accusations of foul play, but some
international monitors have supported the Toledo camp's claims.
Adding to the scrutiny, U.S. President Bill Clinton last week
signed a congressional resolution warning that Peru could face
political and economic sanctions if electoral irregularities
persist.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's influential Roman Catholic Church on Saturday called for
a fair vote ''for the sake of the well-being of the Peruvian
people.''

<HEADLINE> Denmark Ruling Party Endorses Euro  </HEADLINE>
By JAN M. OLSEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ODENSE, Denmark (AP) -- The ruling Social Democratic Party
overwhelmingly endorsed the European Union's common currency Sunday
and urged Danish voters to adopt the euro in the national
referendum set for Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''Denmark should be there where the decisions are taken. Denmark
will make a difference. Our voice must be heard. Say 'yes' on
September 28. It's best for Denmark,'' the party said in a
statement at an extraordinary congress on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The 486-15 vote capped a daylong debate that included 54
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest threat against our welfare system are the
speculators on the world's money markets who will throw themselves
at us'' if we reject the euro, Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen
told fellow party members. ''Our best insurance against this is
adopting the common currency.''
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as the euro, which debuted Jan. 4, 1999, hit a
new low against the dollar of 90.30 cents in London midday trading
Friday before rebounding somewhat. The weakened currency has
prompted fears of inflation that could hamper economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Leading conservative politicians in Germany on Sunday called for
a summit on the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Ruettgers, the Christian Democratic Union's top
candidate for governor in North-Rhine Westphalia state elections
May 14, told the Hamburg-based Welt am Sonntag for Sunday's edition
that the issue could not wait until a mid-June meeting of economic
and finance ministers of the 11 euro nations in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Danish voters traditionally have been lukewarm EU supporters and
opinion polls over the past months have shown the two sides are
neck-and-neck.
</P>
<P>
   Ivar Noergaard, a former government member who in 1972
negotiated Denmark's membership in the 15-member bloc and who today
rejects the euro, voiced opponents' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fear that the forces working for a tighter integration will
use a 'yes' to go for an even further integration,'' Noergaard
said. Others fear Denmark would lose its sovereignty in the much
larger EU group.
</P>
<P>
   However, most Social Democrats at Sunday's meeting had a
different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ''Within 10 years, nearly all European countries will be member
of the EU.... That is a fantastic perspective with peace,
solidarity, security and welfare development. The common currency
is the pivot of that development,'' said Torben Lund.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross: Mongolia Faces Disaster  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Mongolians are depleting critical food stocks
months before the summer harvest as more of their herds, weakened
by drought and snowstorms, die off, the Red Cross warned.
</P>
<P>
   Already more than 2.2 million cows, horses, camels, sheep and
other livestock have died since the severe and early storms began
last year, the Red Cross reported Saturday. In a month's time, at
the start of the summer growing season, the number of dead animals
will more than double to 5 million, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Rural Mongolians depend on their herds for food and wool, and
use the animals to sell or barter for needed goods. The devastation
of the herds has kept families from buying extra food in the lean
months leading up to the harvest at summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of Mongolia's 2.7 million people are now facing a
period of uncertainty over food supplies, the aid group said in a
statement. Staff who visited one badly affected area were told that
herders had already consumed their summer supplies of dried meat.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst hit areas, the group said, government statistics
show more than three-quarters of the herds have died.
</P>
<P>
   A Red Cross relief effort has delivered 215 tons of wheat, rice
and millet to 2,600 households and distributed 600 pairs of boots.
By the end of May, it hopes to have distributed food to 6,300
households, or 35,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Mongolia's latest troubles began last summer with drought and a
rodent infestation that reduced ground fodder for animals. The
worst winter snowstorms in 30 years then covered over what little
the herds had for forage. Animal carcasses now litter the bleak
Mongolian steppe.
</P>
<P>
   Mongolian government agencies have begun a program to remove the
carcasses and inform people on how to prevent an outbreak of
diseases from the rotting corpses, the Red Cross said. Other
government programs will try to kill rodents and provide animals to
families which have lost entire herds.

<HEADLINE> US Jets Bomb Iraq Air-Defense System  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. warplanes bombed an Iraqi
air-defense system Sunday after being fired on in the northern
no-fly zone, the U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi forces fired anti-aircraft artillery from a site near
Bashiqah, 250 miles north of Baghdad, according to a statement from
the Germany-based U.S. European Command.
</P>
<P>
   All allied planes left the area safely, it added. There was no
immediate reaction from Iraqi authorities concerning damage.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British planes have been patrolling no-fly zones in
north and south Iraq since shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to
protect Kurdish and Shiite populations from the forces of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam, who says the zones violate Iraq's territorial integrity,
has been challenging the patrols since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. jets patrol the zone from Incirlik airbase in southern
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Gang Officer Killed in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Two anti-gang police officers were
fired upon during a late-night patrol, killing one and wounding his
partner and a pregnant woman in a nearby house, authorities said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no warning,'' Sgt. Steve Filippini said. ''One or
more suspects opened fire on them, striking them as they sat in
their police car.''
</P>
<P>
   Police searched a nine-square block area but had no suspects,
Police Chief Jerome E. Lance said Sunday. He was cautious when
asked if it was an ambush.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are categorizing it as is our officers were both shot
at in an unusual situation,'' Lance said. ''It's difficult to call
it an ambush because there were some other factors in this case
that I can't reveal at this time that may cause it not to have been
specifically an ambush of those officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Daryle Black, 33, died from his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Rick Delfin, 41, was hospitalized in good condition
Saturday. He suffered a leg wound and was hit in the head by
fragments.
</P>
<P>
   A 45-year-old woman who is seven months' pregnant was listed in
good condition after a bullet struck her after entering her home,
Lance said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance said the officers were driving in a marked patrol car when
the car was raked by gunfire. Delfin drove away and radioed for
help. The two officers did not fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, police using dogs and a helicopter fanned out over a
9-square-block area in the port city of 500,000 residents south of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Lance said he could not make any connection between the attack
and Friday's fatal shooting of a man by a Long Beach police
officer.

<HEADLINE> Fraud Allegations Mar Thailand Vote  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW PENNINGTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- New allegations of vote-buying arose
Sunday after Thailand reran fraud-marred elections for 78 Senate
seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Election Commission said it received more than 500 reports
of fraud nationwide in polling conducted Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the cheating did seem less flagrant than in the initial
polls March 4, the commission said it might have to call yet
another round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is prepared to support another round of
elections,'' Interior Minister Banyat Bantadtan was quoted as
saying in The Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   At least 39 candidates who had won disputed victories the first
time around were victorious again, according to returns submitted
to the commission. Results were still pending for 10 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's new vote was necessary after the commission approved
only 122 of the 200 winners from the first round because of fraud
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Vote counting was expected to drag into Monday, and it could
take weeks for the commission to sift through the fraud reports.
Victors deemed to have cheated a second time will be disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Implementing strict new electoral rules is a voyage into the
unknown for the Election Commission, whose decisions could
represent important precedents in the political development of
Thailand, one of the most democratic nations in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Senate cannot convene until all seats are
filled, there are concerns that Thailand could still be without an
upper house when Parliament sits again in June.
</P>
<P>
   March's balloting was conducted under a new constitution
allowing the upper house of parliament to be directly elected for
the first time. It brought a number of respected social activists
and academics into the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Winners suspected of fraud included relatives of prominent
politicians and influential executives. Their fortunes were mixed
in Saturday's voting.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling advocate Chatchuval Kongudom took more votes than the
last time in initial returns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy that I made a comeback. This should prove that
the votes I received the last time really came from the people,''
he was quoted as saying in The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the wife of the interior minister, who recently
resigned in the face of charges that he lied about his wealth,
lost.
</P>
<P>
   This replay drew fewer voters. The commission said that in the
23 provinces where counting was complete, average turnout was about
50 percent. That's down from 72 percent nationwide in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can see that with less people coming out to exercise their
right, it is easier for candidates to manipulate voters,'' said
Saiyud Kerdpol, chief of the Thai branch of the Asian Network for
Free Elections.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Some Reporters Soften Stories  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four in 10 journalists say they have purposely
avoided newsworthy stories or softened the tone of stories to
benefit the interests of their own news organizations, according to
a new poll on the media.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest cause for this is market pressure that causes news
organizations to avoid stories considered too boring or too
complicated, according to the poll by the Pew Research Center for
the People &AMP; the Press, done with the Columbia Journalism Review.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was taken of 206 reporters and 81 news executives
included 150 from local news outlets and 137 from national news
organizations was taken Feb. 8 through March 21 and had an error
margin of plus or minus 7 percentage points for the entire sample,
larger for subgroups.
</P>
<P>
   About a third said they avoided stories at least sometimes to
avoid harming the financial interests of their own news
organization or embarrassing an advertiser, though few said it was
''commonplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm impressed with the third who admitted that it's
happened,'' said Peter Prichard, president of the Freedom Forum and
a former editor-in-chief of USA Today newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   While the increase of media mergers has raised concerns about
media independence, Richard Oppel, president of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, said the problem may be more
perception than reality.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're probably more immunized in big operations than the
smaller ones,'' said Oppel, editor of the Austin (Texas)
American-Statesman, who offered journalists worried about such
conflicts some simple advice:
</P>
<P>
   ''Journalists ought to ignore all that stuff,'' he said, ''and
chase the story.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq UN Program Said Challenging  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The new head of the U.N. humanitarian
program in Iraq said Sunday he had a ''challenging task'' ahead in
ensuring basic supplies reach all Iraqis suffering from shortages
after nearly 10 years of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Tun Myat will take up his post Monday, filling the vacancy left
when Hans Van Sponeck quit last year in protest against the
continuing sanctions. Sponeck's predecessor, Denis Halliday, also
quit saying he did not want to be associated with the adverse
impact of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But Myat dismissed criticism that the U.N. program was not
meeting the needs of Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters on arrival in Baghdad, the Myanmar native
said the program ''was not established to supply Iraqis with all
their needs. The program was meant to meet the humanitarian needs
of the Iraqi population, not the totality of needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Myat, 58, is to serve as the humanitarian coordinator for the
so-called ''oil-for-food program,'' which was set up in 1996 to
provide relief from the sanctions imposed following Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The program allows Iraq to sell oil to buy food
and other humanitarian goods under U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Myat acknowledged that Iraqis would be able to meet their full
needs only when the sanctions were lifted. ''But my mandate is
simply to ensure that the relief food ... gets adequately
distributed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a beautiful job. It is a very challenging task,'' he
said, adding that his job was ''not to enforce sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, which Iraq blames for the deaths of more than a
million people, cannot be lifted until the U.N. Security Council
certifies that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction. That
certification has become a remote possibility with Iraq refusing to
allow U.N. weapons inspectors into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq demands the sanctions be lifted unconditionally, saying it
has fulfilled all the U.N. resolutions, including the one on
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Myat, whose previous U.N. post was as director of external
relations at the World Food Program, said he expected to have a
good working relationship with the Iraqi authorities.

<HEADLINE> Marine Mammal Eludes Rescuers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAGNOLIA SPRINGS, Ala. (AP) -- A wayward bottlenose dolphin died
before a team of 25 marine biology experts and volunteers could
continue their attempts to return it to salt water and save its
life, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The male mammal, nicknamed Finnegan by wildlife experts, had
delighted boaters and those living on the Magnolia River since
January, gobbling up fish tossed in by people.
</P>
<P>
   It was found dead Saturday on the south shore of the river,
surprising experts who had seen it frolicking a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no idea this thing was this close to death,'' said
Gerald Regan, a biologist at Mobile's Spring Hill College and
coordinator of the Alabama chapter of the Marine Mammal Stranding
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe Finnegan likely followed freshwater fish or
another dolphin eight miles up the river from Weeks Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But the dolphin wouldn't go back under the Magnolia River
Bridge, perhaps seeing its support pilings as a barrier, said Bob
McCormack, interpretive coordinator at Weeks Bay National Estuarine
Research Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Hoggard, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries
Service in Pascagoula, Miss., had urged the public to stop playing
with the dolphin and feeding it. ''That's part of the reason why
it's staying up here.''

<HEADLINE> Okla. Tornado Photo Recovery Begins  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS MULLEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL CITY, Okla. (AP) -- Like refugees, they drifted across the
wind-blown Plains -- photographs that floated free from houses
turned inside-out by tornadoes in central Oklahoma last May.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a year later, about 15,000 lost, mud-frosted photos have
found their way to a computer lab at a school where graphic design
students gingerly pick through them, tossing away the unsalvageable
ones.
</P>
<P>
   To the identifiable pictures, though, the students assign
numbers and place into sealed plastic bags, to be organized into
binders later -- and, maybe, to be reunited with the people whose
memories they represent.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs are as random and cryptic as the people in them:
a '60s era beach party shot from too far away; a frowning woman
wearing a T-shirt and two black eyes, the word ''beating'' written
on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look through them, probably 90 percent of them are
things people love: their first child, their grandparents, their
family members, maybe even some that were lost (in the
tornadoes),'' said Kenn Bird, an Oklahoma City-based photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Bird was one of thousands who pitched in to help tornado victims
rebuild their lives after the May 3 tornadoes, which killed 44
people and injured 700 more when they swept through Oklahoma,
leveling entire neighborhoods and causing an estimated $1 billion
in damage.
</P>
<P>
   As Bird worked loading food for the recovery effort, he noticed
something: photographs, thousands of them, scattering in the
Oklahoma breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were blowing all over the fields, so I ran out there and
started gathering them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, Bird was overseeing a network of collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day he was a guest speaker at a computer graphic design
class at Del City Metro Tech, a public vocational education school,
and mentioned the picture recovery effort. Soon, the students were
sorting and cataloguing the snapshots.
</P>
<P>
   The computer lab where the class meets has become the unofficial
headquarters of the Photo OK Project.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Standridge and her sister-in-law, Gina Standridge, spent a
recent Saturday scouring the electronic catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a bunch of pictures of my mother that are about all I
have left of her,'' said Gina Standridge. ''The tornado just sucked
them out. I don't know why everyone who lost something wouldn't
come to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Shawna Wilson gazes at a computer screen
looking for baby pictures of her and her husband, John.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost most of the stuff in our attic, but we kept a good
deal of our photos in books that were trapped in a cabinet,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Bohlander, a classroom assistant at Metro Tech, said about
90 percent of the people find at least one photo. He said a couple
recently came in and got 70 photos that belonged to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a woman who found a photo of her husband holding up
a string of fish and it was the only photo she had of him after the
tornado. When she found it, she just burst out in tears,''
Bohlander said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Metro Tech semester is coming to an end, so Bird will
have to look elsewhere to keep the effort going.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't found anybody to take the process on, but I'm sure
someone will step up to the plate,'' Bird said. ''If not, then
they'll remain here at my place and I'll take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the photographs keep coming in -- from farmers in
eastern Oklahoma who pick them from fields, from Boy Scout troops
and other people who find them huddled against fences or skittering
down sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The insurance company will pay for a new house or car,'' Bird
said. ''A lot of people have had these photos for generations.
Those are the things that are really treasured.''

<HEADLINE> French Group Attacks Globalization  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen on Sunday
attacked the European Union and declared globalization ''enemy No.
1'' during a speech closing the National Front party's annual
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is evident that globalization and its Trojan horse, federal
Europe, are pushing for the death of France,'' Le Pen said at the
end of the weekend-long conference, which aimed to boost party
confidence despite a recent plunge in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery 71-year-old, re-elected party leader on Saturday, also
attacked immigration, information technology and crime during his
hour-and-a-half speech.
</P>
<P>
   The National Front on Monday plans to hold its traditional May
Day march in Paris, stopping at the city's gilded statue of Joan of
Arc, the symbol of French nationalism that has become the party's
patron saint.
</P>
<P>
   During the conference, Le Pen predicted a strong comeback for
the movement, which has been weakened by an internal split in late
1998. On Saturday, Le Pen admitted that the party had recently lost
a fourth of its members.
</P>
<P>
   Before the recent slump, the National Front consistently won
about 15 percent of the vote in national elections.
</P>
<P>
   The party has blamed immigrants -- particularly from North Africa
-- for France's high unemployment and urban violence. As a result,
it has been accused widely of racism and anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen has headed the group since its founding in 1972. He has
been banned from holding public office for a year after a court in
November upheld his conviction for assaulting a Socialist
politician.

<HEADLINE> Israel Bombing Model Syria Airports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli air force has trained its pilots by
having them bomb life-sized models of Syrian airfields, even as the
two nations have struggled to resuscitate peace talks, an air force
publication reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The mock Syrian air bases constructed in southern Israel include
runways, outdated Skyhawk fighter jets and underground hangars,
according to a report in the Internet edition of the
Hebrew-language Air Force Mouthpiece, a journal published by the
Israeli military.
</P>
<P>
   The report details a day in February -- soon after Israeli-Syrian
peace talks broke off -- when pilots flew F-15 fighter jets in the
Negev desert over an air base model located northeast of Damascus.
The airfield is one of two mock Syrian airfields, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first stage, as always, will be locating the target,'' an
officer identified as Capt. Amir told recruits. ''The target: A
Syrian airfield.''
</P>
<P>
   The air force commanders reportedly planned the training despite
efforts to renew negotiations between Israel and Syria, which have
been at a state of war since Israel's founding in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ''The media continued to report on the negotiations,'' the
report said. ''Despite this, the commanders insisted, and, a few
hours later, we attacked a (model) Syrian airport.''
</P>
<P>
   In the report, an air force official identified as Major Shlomi
said the training would greatly aid the air force in case of an
actual attack.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down in January over Syria's
demand that Israel return the entire Golan Heights, which it
captured in 1967. Israel insists on retaining sovereignty over the
shores of the Sea of Galilee, arguing that the entire freshwater
lake is on Israel's side of the international border.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has promised that by July it will withdraw its troops
from Lebanon, where Syria is the main power broker. Israel has said
that if Lebanese guerrillas attack its northern border after the
withdrawal, it will retaliate harshly, raising concerns about an
escalation in violence throughout the region.

<HEADLINE> New program helps police spot auto accident and insurance fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Police across New Jersey are getting new
tools in the battle against auto accident fraud and uninsured
drivers, problems that add to already hefty insurance rates for
honest motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The state Office of Insurance Fraud Prosecutor last week sent
every New Jersey police department and county prosecutor's office a
training video, wallet cards listing classic ''M.O.'s'' and other
printed material to help officers spot staged accidents and forged
insurance cards.
</P>
<P>
   Those crimes ''can cost citizens of New Jersey plenty,'' State
Insurance Fraud Prosecutor Edward M. Neafsey tells officers during
the training video.
</P>
<P>
   Neafsey also notes an estimated 10 percent of New Jersey
motorists -- or 400,000 people -- drive without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''This number affects everyone who legitimately pays for auto
insurance,'' he said. ''I'm asking for your help in catching
potential insurance violators.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11-minute video depicts a state trooper who, after pulling
over a female motorist for speeding, has a police dispatcher call
the insurance company on her insurance card and learns it is a
fake. The woman admits she bought the phony card for $50 from an
acquaintance in a bar.
</P>
<P>
   In a second segment, after previously planning the scenario, one
driver has rear-ended another and passengers in both vehicles
complain of injuries despite minor vehicle damage. They all tell a
trooper that they will see their own doctors rather than getting
checked immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Neafsey advises officers in such situations to question people
separately to catch discrepancies in their stories, get
identification from everyone involved and do a thorough
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Local police officers stand on the front line in detecting
many types of insurance fraud,'' Neafsey says. ''Their actions can
strongly impact the quality of ensuing investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, insurance companies have detected a number of
large rings operating in different parts of the state that staged
accidents to collect settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, for example, Allstate Insurance Co. filed a
lawsuit in Camden County against participants in a 172-person ring
that allegedly staged more than 100 fraudulent crashes over two
years. The same day, the company sued 89 people in Morris County it
accused of participating in staged accidents in Perth Amboy.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Allstate last July sued 67 doctors, businesses
and individuals accused of participating in a huge insurance fraud
ring that cost the company more than $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Such rings typically use ''runners'' paid $400 to $800 to stage
auto accidents and fake neck and back injuries. Chiropractic
clinics in the ring then bill several insurance companies for the
same treatment or file false claims for treatment that never
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Along with tips about how to interview accident participants,
printed materials in the antifraud kits tell officers to note
whenever damage is minor or nonexistent, when the injuries victims
claim aren't consistent with the area of the impact, whether the
vehicles have prior damage or are old, and whether they think the
accident looks staged.
</P>
<P>
   The kit also points out common mistakes on forged insurance
cards and includes a 30-page list of insurance companies, their
subsidiaries and contact numbers so dispatchers can verify that
coverage is current.
</P>
<P>
   ''Working together with local police departments can be an
important tool in the statewide effort to combat insurance fraud,''
said Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. ''The more resources we
can provide in this fight, the better chances we have of making a
real difference.''

<HEADLINE> Part-Time Employees Common in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- With Japan's economy stuck in its deepest rut in
decades, employers who used to guarantee jobs for life are now
turning more to part-time workers to cut costs, a report said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   During the fiscal year that ended March 31, companies surveyed
by the Labor Ministry said they employed 1 percent fewer full-time
workers but 3 percent more part-time workers than they did the
previous year, quasi-public broadcaster NHK reported.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight year the number of full-timers on the
payrolls of Japanese companies fell, and the straight ninth year
the number of part-timers rose, NHK said.
</P>
<P>
   Recession has put pressure on employers in the world's
second-largest economy to trim their payrolls and give up the
custom of guaranteeing workers a job for life.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Ministry compiled the data by surveying 33,000
enterprises with five or more employees, it said.
</P>
<P>
   NHK did not give a margin of error or other details about the
survey. No one was available at the Labor Ministry to comment
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> German Conservatives Call for Summit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- Alarmed with the euro's steady loss in
value, leading conservative politicians in Germany called for a
summit on the 11-nation currency and demanded government
intervention to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was adopted on Jan. 1, 1999, the euro has dropped more
than 25 percent against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The currency's weakness should dominate the EU summit scheduled
for mid-June in Portugal, several German politicians said,
according to the Hamburg-based Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democratic Union's top candidate for governor of
North-Rhine Westphalia told the paper that a meeting of economic
and finance ministers from the 11 euro nations was needed sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe that this has time to wait until June,''
Juergen Ruettgers said.
</P>
<P>
   Bavarian Finance Minister Kurt Faltlhauser said the slump in the
euro -- which fell in value to a record low of 90.3 cents in London
trading midday Friday -- ''was proof of the inability of European
members states to reform'' economically.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament faction leader Friedrich Merz and Governor Roland
Koch of Hesse state both blamed the euro's weakness on the failure
of the main euro nations -- France, Germany and Italy -- to
coordinate economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Those nations must show ''that they are willing to push through
the unavoidable reforms in their countries,'' Merz said.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder defended his policies, saying on
ZDF television that ''this money is stable, because there is a
stable economy behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic indicators in Germany and other euro nations were
''better than ever before in the past 10 to 15 years,'' said
Schroeder, of the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Parting with fellow conservatives, former deputy economics
minister Otto Schlecht agreed with the centrist chancellor, telling
Bild am Sonntag newspaper he also wasn't worried about the euro's
resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ''The core stability of the euro is great,'' said Schlecht, now
chairman of the Ludwig-Erhard Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was down, he said, only because it was overvalued at
$1.18 when it debuted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Schlecht said he expected the U.S. economic boom
would slow down over the year, while Europe's economy would
strengthen, drawing investors back to the euro.

<HEADLINE> Actors Set For Rallies Over Contract  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actors in television and radio commercials
prepared Sunday for a strike against advertisers after contract
talks broke down over pay issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television &AMP;
Radio Artists plans to strike Monday, with rallies scheduled in Los
Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Chicago, said SAG spokesman
Greg Krizman.
</P>
<P>
   The unions represent 135,000 actors who work in commercials. The
boards of both unions voted in April to walk off the job.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is pay structures for network and cable commercials.
Associations representing advertisers want to scrap a decades-old
system that pays actors each time a commercial airs on network TV.
In its place would be a flat-rate system similar to the existing
one for cable commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The unions want to expand the pay-per-play method to cable ads.
</P>
<P>
   No new negotiations are scheduled between advertisers and the
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Ad agencies say they stockpiled commercials in anticipation of a
strike and will run existing ads longer. They also say they will
produce new commercials using non-union actors or union members
willing to work under the agencies' terms.

<HEADLINE> Man Run Down After Eyeing Female  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINGTON, La. (AP) -- A woman infuriated after her husband
looked at another woman during church Sunday tried to run him down
with her car three times and succeeded on the final attempt,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Sedonia Renee Martin, 22, was booked on an attempted murder
charge after sheriff's deputies interviewed churchgoers who saw
Tushaun Jamel Thompson get hit by the car, said St. Tammany
sheriff's spokesman James Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began when Martin apparently caught her husband
looking at another woman during services at St. James Baptist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   The couple fought when church services ended and while getting
into a car. Witnesses told police Thompson left and walked down the
street, where Martin tried to hit him twice with the car, Hartman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson jumped out of the way both times, but the third time,
stood in the middle of the street with his arms crossed, Hartman
said. Martin hit him head-on, and he went flying, Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 24, was treated at a hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   Martin told police she accidentally hit her husband with the car
while driving away after he called her a name and tried to punch
her through the window.

<HEADLINE> Report: AIDS Designated a Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials Sunday
defended their decision to classify AIDS as a threat to national
security -- a designation aimed at garnering more attention and
funding toward combating the disease worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Thurman, director of the White House Office of National
AIDS Policy, said AIDS has become such an epidemic that, in years
to come, it threatens to destabilize nations and the economies of
whole continents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to respond to this because we've never seen a crisis
like HIV and AIDS globally,'' Thurman said. ''We're beginning to
understand that this epidemic, not only has health implications,
but has implications as a fundamental development issue, an
economic issue and a stability and security issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, in an appearance earlier in
the day, said he does not believe AIDS is a national security
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess this is just the president trying to make an appeal
to, you know, certain groups,'' Lott, R-Miss., told ''Fox News
Sunday.'' ''I don't view that as a national security threat, not to
our national security interests, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman countered that a report earlier this year from the
National Intelligence Council indicates that the disease is
''sweeping the globe,'' posing a crisis in Africa today and
threatening India and newly independent nations of the former
Soviet Union in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the logistical expertise that the national security
community brings, with the diplomatic expertise that is necessary
to sort of pave the road for leaders around the world to respond to
this epidemic, this gives us a whole new ability to respond to AIDS
like we would respond to any other international threat,'' Thurman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in raising the status of AIDS, has creating an
interagency working group. The Clinton administration has
designated about $325 million to fighting the disease worldwide
this year, most of it going to Africa, and the president wants an
additional $100 million for fiscal 2001, Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   She said a large focus of the effort would be on finding a
vaccine.

<HEADLINE> Penny Hardaway Has Strong Playoff  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway has quieted his doubters. A
triple-double in 47 minutes on the court in Phoenix's crucial third
playoff game against San Antonio will do that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in one of the worst positions a player can be in,''
Hardaway said. ''I was labeled a selfish player, a coach killer, a
complainer, and that was never me. For it all to turn around the
way it has, it's just a blessing from God.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hardaway left Orlando, he seemed far from the spectacular
player who burst into the league just a few years earlier. He was
accused of engineering the firing of coach Brian Hill and hastening
the retirement of Hill's successor, Chuck Daly.
</P>
<P>
   As the big-name player on the only big-league team in town,
Hardaway felt unappreciated and over-criticized, and responded with
some sniping of his own.
</P>
<P>
   After getting a new seven-year, $86 million contract in a
sign-and-trade deal, Hardaway came to Phoenix and looked forward to
no longer being ''the man.'' Jason Kidd had that role. But when
Kidd went down with a broken ankle, the pressure was on Hardaway
again. He responded with some of the strongest play in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down the whole stretch for them he's carried the load,'' San
Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. ''He's been an inspiration for
them and a source of great play in a lot of ways for them --
rebounding, scoring, assists. He's played the all-around game for
them. He's done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Suns' 101-94 victory in Game 3 Saturday, Hardaway had 17
points, 13 assists and 12 rebounds -- his first playoff
triple-double -- while sitting out just one minute of the game. In
the series, he's averaged 17.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists
and 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His penetration to the basket cleared the way for his old
Memphis schoolyard opponent, Todd Day, to score 16 points in the
fourth quarter Saturday as the Suns took a 2-1 lead in the
best-of-five series against the defending NBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix can advance past the opening round for the first time in
five years with a homecourt victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Included in Hardaway's performance was a slam-dunk over David
Robinson, two baseline drives to the hoop in the fourth quarter and
a slick assist to Cliff Robinson for what proved to be the
game-clinching basket.
</P>
<P>
   ''Watching the game film, he played even better,'' teammate
Kevin Johnson said. ''There were so many plays, little things, that
he did out there on the court that go unnoticed. They don't show up
in the box score but it takes so much pressure off of everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway feels he's better than he was in his all-NBA days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had more explosiveness in those days, but I'm definitely a
better basketball player now, understanding how the game goes after
seven years in this league,'' Hardaway said. ''That's what's really
carried me over right now because I don't have the same athletic
ability that I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Phoenix's starting point guard Randy Livingston played
only four ineffective minutes in Game 3, coach Scott Skiles said he
probably wouldn't move Johnson into Livingston's spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not hung up on the starting lineup and the guys aren't
either,'' Skiles said. ''There's a lot bigger issues right now, and
that's us winning the game. I don't know that it matters either
way. It's something we may talk about or think about, but I would
doubt it. More than likely we'll stay the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd continues to work out with the team trainer in his recovery
from a broken ankle, but Skiles doesn't expect him to play Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, meanwhile, were fielding the usual questions Sunday
about Tim Duncan's availability for what could be their final game
of the season. Duncan, who missed the last four regular-season
games and all three playoff games with torn cartilage in his left
knee, said he is improving daily but has no idea if he will play
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will be entirely medical and will have nothing to
do with the Spurs' dire situation, Duncan and Popovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to go out there when I feel good,'' Duncan said. ''I
want to be on the floor but I don't want to be on the floor and
hurt myself and hurt them not being up to par. I want to be out
there and be able to help the team, not hold us back.''

   Jose Rosado (2-2) went 5 2-3 innings and was replaced by Jose
Santiago after a 50-minute rain delay. Rosado gave up two runs on
five hits, with three walks and four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago struck out five batters in 2 1-3 innings. Ricky
Bottalico pitched the ninth for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the second, Gil Meche (0-3) hit Randa with a
pitch and then Quinn hit a 3-2 delivery for his fourth home run.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez hit a sacrifice fly in the third. The Mariners
tied it at 2 on an RBI grounder in the fifth by Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon reached on a fielder's choice in the fifth and went
to second with his league-leading 11th stolen base. With two outs,
Damon scored from third on a bunt single by Mike Sweeney, who had
three hits. Dye made it 4-2 with an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hit his fifth home run with two out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Meche gave up four runs and six hits in five innings. He walked
three and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mariners (13-10) had a winning April for just the
seventh time in their history. ... After getting swept in three
games in Seattle last week, the Royals took two of three from the
Mariners. ... Royals 2B Carlos Febles made a fine play in the
seventh. With John Olerud on first and two out, Jay Buhner hit a
hard smash straight at him. He knocked the ball down, then went to
his knees and tossed to shortstop Jeff Reboulet for the force. ...
The Mariners turned four double plays.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Liner Hits Reef, Evacuated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) -- An American-owned cruise liner
with 99 passengers on board ran aground off the Solomon Islands
after hitting a reef in the Pacific Ocean, the ship's owner said
Monday. Nobody was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lomax, president of Society Expeditions, which runs the
World Discoverer out of Seattle, told New Zealand's National Radio
the ship struck an uncharted coral reef 20 miles north of the
Solomon's capital of Honiara on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The captain thought it was necessary to take the vessel and
run it up onto the beach so as to safely evacuate the passengers
and the crew members,'' Lomax said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ship is in that position right now.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no panic during the evacuation of the stricken vessel,
a double-hulled ship which has been used for cruises in Antarctic
waters.
</P>
<P>
   All 99 passengers were taken ashore on the World Discoverer's
lifeboats ''very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   A local excursion ship picked up the passengers and crew from a
small island where the World Discoverer had beached and took them
to Honiara, Lomax said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All passengers and a majority of the crew are in hotels at
this time waiting for Society Expeditions to make arrangements to
return them to their home cities.''
</P>
<P>
   There passengers included 47 Americans, 44 Germans and eight
Britons, Lomax said. The company had surveyors on the way to the
scene to assess damage to the World Discoverer.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is on the beach for the most part, but her stern is
floating,'' Lomax said, adding that no oil, gasoline or other
pollutants had escaped the hull into the water.

<HEADLINE> Honduras 2, U.S. 1  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Honduras, which nearly dropped out of the
Olympic qualifying tournament before it began, beat the United
States 2-1 Sunday to win the event.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had already qualified for the Sydney Games by winning
in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   While it was a sensational weekend for the Hondurans, who beat
Mexico in a shootout to get to the final, it was a disappointing
ending for the Americans. Following a 4-0 wipeout of Guatemala in
the semifinals, they seemed primed to win the CONCACAF regional
crown.
</P>
<P>
   But the under-23 U.S. team -- rules require all players in
Olympic qualifying to be under 23 years of age -- showed some
inexperience. After taking an early 1-0 lead, they generally were
outplayed by the Central Americans, particularly in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras' players protested a lack of payment for the tournament
and almost didn't attend. When the Honduras federation promised the
payments were forthcoming, the players came to Hershey -- and
promptly lost 3-0 to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   They finally got their payments, then went on to stun the highly
regarded Mexicans in the semis before knocking off the hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Honduras' goals were by Oscar David Suazo. The winner,
in the 56th minute, came off a smart play down the left sideline by
Julio Cesar Suazo. He kept the ball inbounds, then beat the U.S.
defense to make a long pass to Oscar David Suazo. His diving header
eluded a flatfooted Tim Howard in front of the U.S. net.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans never really came close to tying it.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams attacked aggressively in a wide-open first half. The
Americans had the best of the early play, then the Hondurans took
control for a long stretch. Late in the half, the United States
twice came close to scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Wolff, who has been an offensive force throughout the
tournament, got the United States in front in the 12th minute.
Wolff sent a header off a head pass from Danny Califf into the left
side of the net. The Americans were helped by a misplaced clearing
header by Luis Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Brien's header was headed off the goal line by Julio
Cesar Suazo moments later, and goalkeeper Noel Valladares made a
sensational sliding leg save on DeMarcus Beasley in the 19th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Central Americans came alive on offense. Three
times, Honduras forwards got clear enough for dangerous shots, but
they shot high or wide. Finally, in the 29th minute, Maynor Suazo
fed Oscar David Suazo 15 yards from the net and his right-footed
shot beat Howard to the far corner.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first goal surrendered in the tournament by the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 4, Astros 3  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jeromy Burnitz's two-out double in the ninth
scored Marquis Grissom and gave the Milwaukee Brewers a 4-3 victory
over the Houston Astros on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom drew a one-out pinch-hit walk and after James Mouton
flied out, Mark Loretta singled off Houston reliever Doug Henry
(0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz smacked Henry's second pitch to deep center. Roger
Cedeno, playing exceptionally shallow, was a step too slow as
Burnitz's hit bounced on the warning track, chasing Grissom home.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, who lost the first two games of the series by a
combined 17-3, won for just the third time in 13 games. Geoff
Jenkins tied the game 3-3 in the sixth with a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong bullpen outing and six solid innings from starter
Jason Bere carried the Brewers. Ray King and David Weathers (2-0)
pitched 2 2-3 innings of scoreless relief.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the teams combined for 23 walks in a 10-3 Astros
victory, the stray pitches were directed at the batters instead.
Three batters were hit in a series of retaliations, and the benches
and dugouts cleared in the sixth inning, though no fights broke
out.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo hit a three-run homer in the second inning off
Bere, who walked five batters but mostly stayed out of trouble. He
lasted six innings for a Milwaukee staff desperate for a decent
start after consecutive short outings from Jaime Navarro and
Everett Stull.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins tied the game in the sixth with a 425-foot blast over
the outfield bleachers in right, his ninth homer of the season.
Houston starter Shane Reynolds allowed just two singles in the
first five innings before Jenkins' blast, which nearly cleared the
chain-link fence separating County Stadium from Miller Park.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble nearly started in the third inning when Bere hit Hidalgo
with a pitch squarely between the numbers on his back. It was
Hidalgo's first at-bat since his homer.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, Reynolds, one of the game's best
control pitchers, threw behind Loretta on a 2-2 count and then
plunked Burnitz.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches after Jenkins' tying homer three innings later,
Reynolds nearly hit Charlie Hayes, who stepped toward the mound and
exchanged words as both dugouts and bullpens emptied. There were no
punches or ejections, and Reynolds then walked Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros threatened in the top of the ninth when Cedeno and
Ken Caminiti singled and stole bases against Weathers. But Lance
Berkman, in his first game since being recalled from Triple-A New
Orleans, flied out to center to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jenkins threw out Houston catcher Tony Eusebio at the plate
to end the second inning. It was his fourth outfield assist this
season. ... Slumping Milwaukee third baseman Jose Hernandez was
bumped to eighth in the order. Hernandez, who signed a three-year,
$10 million contract before the season, was hitting .181 with one
homer and six RBIs before going 0-for-3 with a walk and a
strikeout. ... Juan Acevedo made his Brewers debut and walked two
batters in 1-3 inning of work. He missed the season's first four
weeks while rehabilitating from a variety of minor injuries,
including excessive nosebleeds.

<HEADLINE> MacFarms Macadamia Nut Grower Sold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- The world's largest grower of
macadamia nuts has changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Soup Co. said Friday it has sold MacFarms of Hawaii to
Blue Diamond Growers, a cooperative owned by California nut
producers, for an undisclosed price.
</P>
<P>
   The sale includes 3,900 acres of macadamia orchards and a
processing plant in South Kona on the island of Hawaii. MacFarms
also buys nuts from 600 independent growers.
</P>
<P>
   MacFarms President Rick Vidgen said the deal makes sense because
Sacramento-based Blue Diamond is an agricultural company, whereas
Campbell Soup is a manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Diamond represents nearly 4,000 growers, and has had a
distribution pact with MacFarms for 20 years, Vidgen said.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative is the world's largest tree nut company,
marketing almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios and macadamia nuts to
nearly 100 global markets, Blue Diamond and Campbell Soup officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vidgen said the sale will not affect MacFarms' 250 employees,
most of whom are seasonal workers.
</P>
<P>
   MacFarms reported sales of $30 million in the fiscal year that
ended last July.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 94, Trail Blazers 87  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Terrell Brandon scored 28 points and shut
down Damon Stoudamire as the Minnesota Timberwolves staved off
elimination with a 94-87 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon helped hold Stoudamire, his pal from their hometown of
Portland, to two free throws, 14 points below his playoff average.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett, who has just two triple-doubles in five NBA
seasons, had his second triple-double in a week with 23 points, 12
rebounds and 10 assists as the Wolves pulled to 2-1 in the
best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 is Tuesday night at Target Center.
</P>
<P>
   Only four teams have overcome a 2-0 deficit since 1984, when the
league adopted the best-of-five format for the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Playing just their second home game in three weeks, the Wolves
did what they couldn't do in Portland: stifle Scottie Pippen (16
points), execute down the stretch and curb their mistakes against
the more experienced Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for just 13 turnovers, setting an NBA playoff
record.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Smith scored 22 points for the Blazers, who hit their
first 17 free throws. When they finally missed, Brian Grant got his
own rebound with a chance for Portland to cut its 80-77 deficit
</P>
<P>
   But Grant committed an offensive foul with just under five
minutes left and the Wolves would never relinquish their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Smith made two free throws and Anthony Peeler (13 points)
stole the ball and scored on the break for an 84-77 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Arvydas Sabonis hit a wide-open 3-pointer to cut it to 84-80
with 3:18 left, but the Blazers could get no closer and Brandon hit
all six of his free throws in the final 28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis finished with 17 points and Rasheed Wallace had 15.
</P>
<P>
   Portland trailed by seven at halftime but tied it at 68 heading
into the fourth quarter behind 10 points from Pippen and eight from
Sabonis, each of whom had a quiet first half.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, limited to six points in the first half, burned Malik
Sealy repeatedly in the third quarter, and Sabonis, just 1-for-3
from the field in the first half, found his shooting touch.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett hit a 3-pointer that gave Minnesota a 47-40 halftime
lead and restored some of the Wolves' morale after the Blazers had
whittled a nine-point deficit to four.
</P>
<P>
   After consecutive baskets by Garnett gave the Timberwolves a
39-30 lead, the Trail Blazers hit six free throws, Sabonis swished
a hook before taking a seat with his third foul and Wallace scored
inside to pull Portland to 44-40.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves led 24-20 after one quarter, and half their points
came from Brandon, who rarely goes to the hoop but who even had a
nifty drive in which he slipped past three defenders for a layup
that brought the sellout crowd of 19,006 to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   At times in the first half, Smith, who hyperextended his right
knee in Game 2, matched up with Wallace, moving Garnett over to
small forward to try to curb Pippen, who had schooled rookie Wally
Szczerbiak and veterans Sealy and Peeler for 49 points in the first
two games in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen didn't score any points against Garnett.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Minnesota had seven turnovers and Portland six. The old
playoff mark for fewest turnovers was 15 set by Chicago and the
Lakers in 1991. ... The previous five games between the teams were
decided by four points or less. ... One of the loudest ovations
came when a fan hit a halfcourt shot between quarters, giving all
ticket-holders a free large pizza. ... Target Center is site of the
June 28 NBA draft, and although the host Wolves don't own a
first-round pick, Minnesotans Joel Przybilla and Khalid El-Amin
have made tickets to the event a hot item. ... The Blazers' 12-man
playoff roster has 603 games of playoff experience to the Wolves'
196.

<HEADLINE> Pippig Runs First Race Since Ban  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LeBLANC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEDHAM, Mass. -- Uta Pippig, running for the first time since her
drug ban expired April 23, finished third Sunday in a 10K race won
by Pauline Konga of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just so happy I can run again,'' said Pippig, a three-time
winner of the Boston Marathon. ''So many people said 'hello' and
'welcome back.' It was actually kind of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippig finished the James Joyce Ramble 10K in 34 minutes, 33
seconds, more than a minute behind the winner. Konga set a course
record in the women's division in 33:10.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my first time to run this course,'' Konga said. ''It's
a good course. I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simion Karori of Kenya won the men's division in 30:22 in a
6.2-mile race featuring some 3,000 runners in a race offering
$30,000 in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Pippig fought severe menstrual problems to rally
to a Boston Marathon victory in one of the most riveting moments of
her career.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the German runner tested positive for high
levels of testosterone and was banned from racing for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pippig lives most of the year in Boulder, Colo. At the time of
her positive drug test in 1998, Pippig was still a German citizen.
German track authorities said there was no doubt she was using
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The runner appealed, contending the testosterone abnormalities
were caused by a medicine for a viral infection. Her explanation
was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   She has since become a U.S. citizen. The switch wasn't in time
to qualify for the Sydney Olympics this year, but she isn't ruling
out a run in next year's Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could imagine that I could run it, but I leave it up to my
manager,'' Pippig said Sunday. ''Obviously, it's always nice to run
in Boston. It's a fun marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sustaining her through the two-year ban was her passion for her
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''What keeps me always going is I love running. It's part of my
identity. It's so easy, you're out in nature. You stay in as good
shape as you can,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The James Joyce theme was conceived by founder Martin Hanley 17
years ago. He wanted an Irish-literary gimmick and was reading
''Finnegans Wake'' at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The race features actors in period costumes reciting passages
from Joyce's modernist masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   All proceeds from the race are donated to the Dana Farber Cancer
Institute.

<HEADLINE> Masai Tribesman Graduates College  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISONBURG, Va. (AP) -- Moses Sakuda was just a child when
missionaries Denny and Jeanne Grindall traveled through his remote
Kenyan village teaching the word of God and the importance of
education.
</P>
<P>
   They persuaded members of the Masai tribe to send their children
to school. Sakuda was among the first to go.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, some 30 years later, Sakuda graduated from Eastern
Mennonite University in Harrisonburg with a Master's of Divinity
degree and a Master's of Art in Education.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to study for a doctorate in business administration,
then return to Kenya to help his people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the answer to our prayers,'' Denny Grindall, now 85, said
at the graduation. ''This is such a thrill to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Masai more than any of the 40-some tribal groups in Kenya
had managed to remain outside the mainstream of modern development,
living in rural isolation and maintaining cattle until the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Grindalls first arrived in the village of
Olosho-Oibor, about two hours southwest of Nairobi, and introduced
dams and agriculture to the Masai people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Masai really had a desire to change. They just needed
someone to show them how to do it,'' Grindall said. ''They were
stunned to see me get down in a ditch to help them build a dam.
They said many white men had passed through the village telling
them things, but none stopped to help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grindalls helped Sakuda enroll in a missionary school in the
town of Kajaido, about a four-hour drive from the village. He later
attended a teacher's college near Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Sakuda traveled to the United States as part of an
exchange program, and two years later he enrolled at Eastern
Mennonite University.
</P>
<P>
   The culture he entered couldn't have been more different from
the one in which he was raised.
</P>
<P>
   When he tried to get a U.S. driver's license, he was asked for a
record of his age -- but the Masai, like many tribal groups, don't
keep copious records of events. All Sakuda's mother remembered is
that she was pregnant during a major drought in Kenya, perhaps
around 1968. The office used that date and put down June 1, since
his height was 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   In Masai culture, males are instead classed in three age groups:
boys, warriors and elders. Traditionally, boys had to kill a male
lion to become warriors, something Sakuda did when he was about 13.
</P>
<P>
   Sakuda said having his family with him at his graduation Sunday
was the happiest moment in his life since that day.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my tradition, you are never supposed to see a man shed
tears, but when they called my name I couldn't help the tears from
rolling out of my eyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Wenger Shenk, interim seminary dean at Eastern Mennonite,
praised Sakuda's efforts, saying he had crossed very different
cultures with admirable grace while staying faithful to his own
story and people.
</P>
<P>
   Sakuda's mother and about a dozen other Masai sold some of their
cattle to raise money for airline tickets to attend the graduation
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   For his mother, Ruth Nasibku Sakuda, it was the first time she
had left her village, and for many of the others, the first time
they had experienced electricity or running water -- something
Sakuda hopes to help his village develop when he returns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am overwhelmed with God's doing,'' Ruth Sakuda, who speaks
the Masai Sudanic language, said through a translator. ''If it
weren't for the missionaries, Moses would not be where he is today.
This is the fruit of their work.''

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sacramento Kings assistant coach Pete
Carril was resting comfortably in a hospital Sunday, recovering
from a minor heart attack that struck the former Princeton coach
before practice a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Carril, 69, told team officials he was not feeling well Saturday
morning before the team practiced for Sunday's playoff game against

   ''Pete Carril was taken to Sutter Hospital with chest pains,
which were subsequently diagnosed as the early stages of a minor
heart attack,'' team physician Jeff Tanji said. ''Several
diagnostic tests were taken. He is in stable condition and is
expected to return home early next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Carril, a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, joined the
Kings as an assistant coach before the 1996-97 season. He coached
in college for 30 years, most notably at Princeton.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers may not have enough
healthy bodies to play Charlotte, let alone close out the Hornets
in their first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson, already hobbled by a broken left toe and inflamed
right elbow, sustained a chip fracture in his right ankle in Game 3
Friday and is questionable for Game 4 Monday night, though he says
he will play. Eric Snow missed Friday's 81-76 victory with a chip
fracture in his right ankle and his status will be a game-time
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers lead the best-of-five series 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to figure out who is playing first and go from
there,'' said Aaron McKie, who started in place of Snow on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson was injured when David Wesley of the Hornets stepped on
his foot during the third quarter of Friday's game. He practiced
Saturday but experienced pain and swelling throughout the day
before calling the team physician and trainer late Saturday night.
Iverson was sent to the emergency room at a Philadelphia hospital
where X-rays revealed the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never even thought about it, but I knew something was
wrong,'' Iverson said after the team practiced without him Sunday.
''The only way I won't play is if they amputate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson said the same thing about his inflamed elbow before
scoring 40 points as the Sixers won Game 1 in Charlotte. He said
his elbow bothers him more than his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never had this many injuries in my life,'' he said. ''I can
deal with it, maybe it will help me down line.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson has struggled since Game 1, shooting 14-of-48.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it does bother me, you will never know it because I don't
make excuses,'' Iverson said.
</P>
<P>
   With Iverson and the entire offense struggling, the Sixers
relied on defense to beat Charlotte in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   McKie shut down Eddie Jones, holding him to 18 points, including
1-of-8 shooting in the second half. George Lynch and Toni Kukoc
combined to hold Anthony Mason without a field goal and Theo
Ratliff and Tyrone Hill held Derrick Coleman and Elden Campbell to
25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are really getting physical with us,'' Charlotte coach
Paul Silas said. ''They're just doing whatever's necessary, going
over our backs and doing whatever they have to do to get at the
basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixers coach Larry Brown expects things to be different Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Mason is a great player and you won't see him go
0-for-7 again and Derrick won't take limited shots,'' Brown said.
''We need depth in our big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill wants the Sixers' frontcourt to be a threat on offense as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big guys have to step up and score more in the paint and
make it easier for the guards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Philadelphia split two games against Orlando then came
home to beat the Magic twice to win the first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been there before and we know what it takes,'' Hill
said. ''We're still upset about Game 2. We should've won this
series. We don't want to take it back to Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow's injury is considered more severe than Iverson's because
he injured the front of his ankle while Iverson hurt the inside
portion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what else can happen, but Allen wants to play,''
Brown said. ''Obviously, if we don't have Allen or Eric, that would
be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow said he can walk without pain and feels closer to playing,
but doesn't want to hurt the team by playing if he's not ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to wait and see. If I can't pick up their full-court
pressure and don't do those things, I won't play,'' Snow said. ''I
have confidence in our guys. I don't want to hurt our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson says winning Game 4 is important because it allows the
Sixers time to heal before opening the Eastern Conference
semifinals this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't feel any more pressure. They have to win in our
house,'' Iverson said.

<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A mob in northern Guatemala stoned to
death a Japanese tourist and his tour's bus driver, believing the
group had come to the village to steal children.
</P>
<P>
   Tetsuo Yamahiro, 40, was beaten to death by a mob of 500 people
Saturday while visiting the popular tourist village of Todos Santos
Cuchuman, 95 miles northwest of Guatemala City, near the Mexican
border.
</P>
<P>
   The mob, armed with sticks and stones, also beat to death the
tour's bus driver Edgar Castellanos, 35. Rumors have spread in the
village that foreigners have come to the area to steal children,
said Faustino Sanchez, spokesman for the Guatemala National Police.
</P>
<P>
   The mob then doused the driver's body in gasoline and cremated
him in front of the horrified visitors, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 Japanese tourists were in the group and three suffered
minor injuries. Two Guatemalan police officers who attempted to
stop the lynching also were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The group arrived early in the morning to see the village's
colorful Saturday market, a regular stop for tourists. They started
taking pictures of the brightly dressed indigenous children, which
the villagers believed meant they were planning to steal them,
Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, American tourist June Diane Weinstock was beaten into a
coma in the village of San Cristobal by a mob that suspected her of
trying to steal a baby. She is now in a Fairbanks nursing home.

<HEADLINE> Mets 14, Rockies 11  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Edgardo Alfonzo went 4-for-5 with four RBIs, and
Todd Zeile capped a successful weekend at Coors Field with his
first homer of the season as the New York Mets beat the Colorado
Rockies 14-11 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, who came into the series hitting .254, went 8-for-15 with
seven RBIs in three games to raise his average to .302. Alfonzo,
Melvin Mora and Todd Pratt also homered for the Mets, who have won
13 of 17.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin hit his first career grand slam off Mets reliever
Dennis Cook to cap a six-run eighth that cut New York's lead to
11-9. Goodwin also had a sacrifice fly and finished with a
career-high five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter (2-0) gave up six runs -- five earned -- and eight hits
in seven innings to win for the first time since the Mets home
opener. It was also the left-hander's first victory in four starts
at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   After tying a nine-inning team record with 23 hits Saturday, the
Mets were more efficient Sunday as they scored seven runs on
homers, including two off Rockies starter Brian Bohanon (0-3).
</P>
<P>
   Zeile doubled and scored on a sacrifice fly by Mora in the
second, and the Mets made it 5-0 when the pair hit two-run homers
in the fourth. Mora had been 1-for-14 against lefties before
connecting off Bohanon, who has not won since last Sept. 10 -- a
span of nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies pulled to 5-2 on Goodwin's sacrifice fly in the
fifth, but Pratt hit a solo homer off Giovanni Carrara in the
sixth, and Alfonzo had an RBI single as part of a three-run
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo, who added a two-run homer in the eighth, went 10-for-13
and scored seven runs in the three games and has reached base in 25
of his last 35 plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored three times in the ninth on a wild pitch by Jose
Jimenez, and RBI singles by Alfonzo and Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shumpert hit a two-run homer off Armando Benitez in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mets C Mike Piazza was available to pinch-hit Sunday, two
days after suffering a bruised right wrist and hyperextended right
elbow. Piazza has not thrown a ball or swung a bat since leaving
Friday night's game against Colorado but said ''I feel pretty
close.'' ... LHP Bill Pulsipher was scheduled to join the Mets when
they open a four-game series Monday in San Francisco. Pulsipher or
Pat Mahomes will start Game 1 against the Giants. ... Colorado's
starters have a 9.56 ERA in 10 home games. ... The Rockies
purchased Carrara's contract from Triple-A Colorado Springs and
optioned RHP Rick Croushore to the same club. ... Colorado (11-14)
finished under .500 in April for the third straight season. ...
Mets SS Rey Ordonez committed his sixth error of the season. He had
four errors in 640 chances all of last year. ... Todd Helton's four
walks tied a Colorado record.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Carter To Have Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Cris
Carter was scheduled to have minor surgery Monday to remove bone
spurs from his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Before minicamp opened Friday, Carter underwent an MRI on his
ankle, having complained of soreness while training recently in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Although coach Dennis Green advised Carter not to participate in
minicamp, the veteran receiver said Saturday he felt compelled to
do so because of the circumstances, including the new starting
status of quarterback Daunte Culpepper.
</P>
<P>
   ''I needed to be out there,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   When he woke up Saturday morning, Carter said, he was extremely
sore, and he decided to have his ankle repaired before training
camp. Although he injured his right ankle during the Pro Bowl,
Carter said it wasn't the same injury, adding that he has been
coping with these symptoms for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just something that's been going on for a number of
years, (and) they're finally just going to take care of it,'' he
said. ''I got a couple of bone spurs. Couple of floating particles
in there that get lodged in the joints, and they're giving me some
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   After surgery, Carter might have to wear a splint for a few
days. But he should be able to start rehabilitating in Florida
rather quickly. Within a couple of weeks, Carter should be able to
run at half-speed, and he's expected to return to full speed well
before training camp, which begins July 23.

<HEADLINE> Despite horror stories, psychiatric hospital has supporters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Nearly 124 years after it opened as the
Lunatic Asylum at Morristown, Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital
has been ordered shut down once staff can place the patients in
other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gov. Christie Whitman's order to close the state
hospital comes after a scathing report that called Greystone unsafe
and inhumane, the hospital has some supporters among patients,
their relatives and longtime staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Closing Greystone is only going to hinder me,'' said Tony
Grossi, a recovering drug addict with schizophrenia and manic
depression who has been there a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought with four or five more years of being here I would
be able to handle being on my own,'' Grossi, 48, told The Record of
Hackensack for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   William Eckert of Pequannock, whose 45-year-old son has been in
and out of Greystone for two decades, said he's ''quite
frightened'' about his son's future.
</P>
<P>
   ''My son is safer at Greystone than if he was out walking the
streets,'' Eckert, a member of the Morris County Mental Health
Advisory Board, told the Star-Ledger of Newark. ''You know what
happens to many of the people released to group homes. Oh, it all
sounds great. But eventually, they end up back on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jared Alford, a 16-year state hospital system worker, said
Greystone has done ''really good things.'' He recalled a chance
meeting with a former Greystone patient in Newark last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came right up to me, proud. 'I'm still making it on the
outside,' he told me. You don't know how that makes me feel,''
Alford told the Star-Ledger. ''He is one of a lot of patients who I
bonded with and who bonded with me -- and who saw me as someone they
could trust.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said they would volunteer to help demolish the
antiquated facility.
</P>
<P>
   Count Bill Proll among them. The 33-year-old was admitted to
Greystone last fall after a suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in hell there,'' he said. ''It was right out of a movie
-- screaming, people banging off walls, workers showering us in
groups ...
</P>
<P>
   ''People were urinating on the floor, and others were lying in
it. You had some staff there who would pick on these sick people,
ordering them to do things, until they finally went off,'' Proll
told the Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Lopez-Capobianco of Linden, whose father was a Greystone
patient several times in the 1990s before moving to another
psychiatric hospital, called Greystone ''a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You've just got to tear it down and get rid of everything up
there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration is still deciding how to replace the
hospital and where to place its 613 patients. Many will be moved to
group homes and other community-based centers over the next three
years, while the chronically ill patients likely will end up in a
smaller hospital the state will build on Greystone's grounds or
elsewhere in northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Greystone will be the fourth large state mental hospital closed
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Maxine Steinberg was a program coordinator there for 26 years
until she retired in 1998; she now heads a volunteer group at
Greystone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember when 7,000 patients lived there. God, the staff was
twice that -- and the buildings were still beautiful,'' Steinberg
told the Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   She said the staff is now too overburdened to keep providing
extras, such as getting a cake and candles for patient birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've heard politicians talk of closing it before. I'll believe
it when I see it,'' Steinberg said. ''But if someone's got to be
blamed, blame the state -- the people who cut the funding -- not the
staff. We never gave up on the patients.''

<HEADLINE> Angels 5, Devil Rays 2  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Kent Bottenfield pitched seven steady
innings, and Darin Erstad completed a major league record April
with his 47th and 48th hits of the month as the Anaheim Angels beat
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 5-2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield (2-3) went seven innings and struck out nine. He
allowed five hits, including Vinny Castilla's two-run homer in the
seventh that trimmed Anaheim's lead to three runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' right-hander struck out Gerald Williams and Greg
Vaughn all three times he faced them.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, who singled twice and drove in a run, eclipsed the
record of 47 hits in April, set by Colorado's Dante Bichette in
1998. Erstad finished the month with a .449 batting average
(48-for-107).
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, Tim Salmon and Orlando Palmeiro each had RBI singles
off Steve Trachsel (1-2) in the opening inning as the Angels moved
in front to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus hit a solo homer off Trachsel in the fourth, his
seventh. Erstad's RBI single made it 5-0 in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel also struck out nine, equaling his career high, in
seven innings. He gave up five runs and nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   He settled down after a rocky start, giving up four consecutive
singles to the Angels their first time up. The first three batters,
Erstad, Adam Kennedy and Vaughn, all scored.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield had not faced the Devil Rays before, nor had
Trachsel pitched against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Devil Rays placed RHP Jim Mecir on the 15-day DL with
tightness in his right biceps muscle and recalled RHP Bryan Rekar
from Triple-A Durham. ... Trachsel graduated from Troy High in
Fullerton, just minutes from Anaheim Stadium and, as a free agent
last winter, expressed a desire to join the Angels. ... The Angels
sent RHP Lou Pote to Triple-A Edmonton and recalled LHP Mike Holtz.
... Scott Schoeneweis' 4-0 record means he's off to the fastest
start by an Angels pitcher since Terry Clark began 5-0 in 1988.
Schoeneweis has one no decision. Clark won all his first five
games. The club's best start ever by a pitcher is 5-0, shared by
Clark and five other former Angels.

<HEADLINE> O's Celebrate Ripken's 3,000th Hit  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Fifteen days later, the Baltimore Orioles
staged an appropriate celebration for Cal Ripken's 3,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken became the 24th member of the 3,000-hit club on April 15
in Minnesota. He received a warm ovation in his first home game
after that, as the Orioles ceremoniously dropped the numbers
3-0-0-0 on the warehouse beyond the right field wall.
</P>
<P>
   But the team saved the best stuff for Sunday afternoon before
the Orioles' game against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute tribute included two other members of the
exclusive 3,000 club, Eddie Murray and Dave Winfield. Jim Palmer,
the Orioles' starting pitcher when Ripken got his first hit on Aug.
16, 1981, was also on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave up around 3,000 hits, so I guess that's why I'm here,''
Palmer told the sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's entire family was seated along the third-base line as
the third baseman received gifts from the team. The prized piece
was a rack that contained the bats of the other six players who
have 3,000 hits and 400 career homers. Murray and Winfield added
their bats on the spot as part of the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ''This man has touched everybody's heart here in Baltimore.
Thanks Cal, and congratulations,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've been a credit to the game. It's been my pleasure
playing against you all these years and with you in several
All-Star games,'' Winfield told Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken said, ''Secretly, I was hoping 3,000 would come here. It
just didn't happen. But 3,001 was pretty good, though.''
</P>
<P>
   That hit, delivered in the ninth inning on April 19, provided
the Orioles with a victory over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a storybook career,'' Ripken said. ''The ending
hasn't quite been written yet, but I'm hopeful it includes another
trip to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration ended with Winfield, Murray and Ripken standing
side by side, each throwing a ceremonial first pitch.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Suspect Said Anti-Immigrant  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY BAIR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The man arrested in a killing spree that left
three immigrants, a Jewish woman and a black man dead had a history
of mental illness and irrational fears that he was being watched, a
former friend and his attorney said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police searching the home where Richard Scott Baumhammers, 34,
lived prior to Friday's attacks also found a three-page manifesto
indicating he was trying to form a political party opposed to
immigration, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which included Baumhammers' signature as
''chairman'' of The Free Market Party, advocated the rights of
European Americans and denounced Third World immigration, according
to a prosecution source whom the newspaper didn't name.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what I saw and from what I read, it seemed to advocate
violence,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Manko, a spokesman for District Attorney Stephen Zappala
Jr., said Sunday he had no comment on the Post-Gazette report that
Baumhammers had been trying to recruit members for an
anti-immigrant party just days before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators reconstructing Friday's trail of death believe
Baumhammers walked into his neighbor's house and fatally shot Anita
Gordon, 63, a Jewish interior designer. They believe he then drove
to her synagogue and fired at the front doors.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Baumhammers also shot up the doors of another
synagogue, shot and wounded one man and killed another at an Indian
grocery, killed a Vietnamese delivery driver and a Chinese manager
at a restaurant, and gunned down a black man at a suburban karate
school. Officers eventually cornered him about 20 miles from the
first attack.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers has been charged in one death, that of 22-year-old
karate student Garry Lee. More charges are expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers' attorney, William Difenderfer, said Sunday that his
client has a history of mental illness, though he wouldn't
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is way too early to say anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A neurologist who had befriended Baumhammers in an Internet chat
group about the eastern European country of Latvia, where
Baumhammers' parents were born, and had traveled with him, said
Baumhammers often expressed paranoid ideas and sometimes believed
he was being followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the things he said were just so outlandish,'' Dr.
George Naruns said Sunday from his home in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He said Baumhammers would come across as normal in one
conversation and express strange ideas in the next. He also
appeared to have personality problems including ''braggadocio''
that made people uneasy and may have interfered with his attempts
to get a job and make friends.
</P>
<P>
   But Naruns said he never saw Baumhammers enraged.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sad thing is that if he could have gotten some counseling
or some help, he could have dealt with some of these minor issues
before they turned into all of this,'' Naruns said.
</P>
<P>
   Naruns said he started keeping a ''polite distance'' from
Baumhammers 2{ years ago after he heard from other friends that
Baumhammers had been critical of him.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more recent conversations between the two, he said
Baumhammers said he had applied for a job with an accounting firm
in Latvia.
</P>
<P>
   Baumhammers was trained in immigration law, but he hadn't
practiced in recent years. He listed his parents' address for his
business, Baumhammers Law Firm. Police said he made frequent trips
to Europe, particularly Latvia.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Lee Rothman told the Post-Gazette he met Saturday with
the suspect, who was being kept under suicide watch at Beaver
County Jail. He said that Baumhammers had been treated since 1993
for an unspecified mental disorder and that Baumhammers had
voluntarily admitted himself to a psychiatric ward at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, about 700 people gathered at a Hindu temple to
remember Anil Thakur, 31, one of the men gunned down at the Indian
grocery in Carnegie. The other man, Sandip Patel, 25, remained
hospitalized Sunday in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Indian community stands strongly united in condemning this
violence,'' said Vinod Shah, the chairman of the Hindu Jain Temple
in Monroeville. ''We cannot forget our belief in nonviolence.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Criticizes Bush Foreign Policy  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore dismissed George W. Bush's
foreign policy thinking as ''noticeably blank,'' casting his
Republican presidential rival Sunday as a puppet of ''right wing''
ideologues such as Sen. Jesse Helms and dangerously fixated on the
Cold War past.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the International Press Institute's conference
of foreign journalists, Gore issued a broadside against Bush, the
Texas governor, on everything from Russia and China to arms control
and nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore dismissed Bush's foreign policy as lacking on 21st century
national security challenges such as terrorism, narcotics
trafficking, the global environment and international family
planning, for which Gore supports additional U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's foreign
policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and
inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan
isolationism of the Republican congressional leadership,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, Bush's top foreign policy adviser, shot back
that the speech lacked credibility, ''somewhat typical of the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He has this tendency to say that he's going to do one thing
and in fact he's ... done another for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has pledged to make the rejected Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty the first measure he submits to the Senate if elected,
chafed at last week's declaration by Helms, R-N.C. -- ''out of overt
distaste for the president,'' Gore said -- that he will block any
new arms control pacts until a new president is inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is negotiating a START III weapons pact with
Russia and hoping to adjust the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
to allow for a limited U.S. missile defense system to protect
against attacks from rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Governor Bush were to inherit from us an arms control
agreement so clearly in the best interests of the American people,
is Senator Helms the last word?'' Gore asked.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Bush for promising to heighten the threshold for
or American intervention in overseas crises and get involved only
where there is a direct U.S. interest. The Bush campaign, on the
other hand, says Clinton-Gore foreign policy has been haphazard and
incoherent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush dangerously fixates on the Cold War past when
speaking of the use of force. He suggests that he would not
intervene to relieve even the brutal repression of ethnic cleansing
and genocide,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must reject the new isolationism that says, don't help
anywhere because we cannot help everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice countered, ''If what the vice president is saying is that
the post-Cold War mission of American armed forces is to just
intervene in other people's civil wars because we might be able to
help, I think that's a headline.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech in Boston's historic Old South Meeting Place, built
by the Puritans in 1729, was the latest in a series by Gore in
which he paints Bush as lacking the experience and knowledge to be
an effective president and world leader. Bush rebuts that argument
with an emphasis on character.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, several dozen demonstrators protested U.S. military aid
to Colombia with posters saying Gore had ''blood on his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   On Russia, Gore defended his hands-on diplomacy, which Bush has
criticized as solicitous and for turning a blind eye to building
corruption in Moscow, and said Bush wrongly viewed Russia and China
as America's enemies instead of as ''vital partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore lashed out at supporters of the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act, legislation backed by Bush to establish closer military ties
with Taiwan, saying they were ''blind to its consequences: a sharp
deterioration in the security of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said Gore had wrongly characterized Bush's view of Russia
and China.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has not said that Russia and China should be
enemies; in fact he has said that China is a competitor and we
should reach out to Russia,'' she said. ''It is very much like the
vice president to distort (Bush's) record.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
slammed Gore as ''the invisible man'' in the administration's push
for permanent normal trade status for China, an aim of Republican
congressional leaders as well, Gore said in his speech, ''I will
continue to press the Congress to support it this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended himself in an interview on CNN's ''Late Edition,''
saying he has been making speeches and ''making calls on a regular
basis'' to round up support.
</P>
<P>
   To gain the widest possible audience for his foreign policy
offensive, Gore offered interviews to all the TV networks and won a
Page One story in Sunday's New York Times by leaking his speech to
the newspaper a day ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans another foreign policy address -- an area where he
believes Bush is particularly vulnerable -- at the West Point
military academy commencement.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, on CNN, Gore said he would consider retired Gen.
Colin Powell for a spot in a Gore administration. While ruling out
running for vice president, Powell has said he would consider an
appointed position in the next administration.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 7, Marlins 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Dodgers opened the vault and
paid Kevin Brown and Shawn Green a combined $189 million for days
just like this.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed a run and three hits over seven innings and Green
homered twice as the Dodgers completed a three-game sweep of the
Florida Marlins with a 7-1 victory on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield also homered and Eric Karros drove in three runs
with a pair of singles as Florida dropped its fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who helped lead the Marlins to the World Series in 1997,
struck out seven, walked three and surrendered his only run in the
seventh on Derrek Lee's fourth homer and third in two days.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander, who tied a career high with 18 victories last
season after signing a seven-year, $105 million contract that made
him the highest-paid player in baseball history, was making his
first start at Dodger Stadium this season. The team spent the first
two weeks on the road, allowing construction crews extra time to
revovate the 39-year-old ballpark, and Brown (2-1) was on the
disabled list during the first homestand because of a broken pinky
on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who blew an eight-run lead Saturday night before
beating the Marlins 13-12, built a 3-0 margin in the first three
innings against Alex Fernandez (3-3). The right-hander was charged
with five runs and seven hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez surrendered Sheffield's 10th homer with two out in the
first inning and Green's fourth home run just three pitches later.
Karros singled home the third run after single by Mark Grudzielanek
and a walk to Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Green, in the first year of a six-year, $84 million contract,
made it 5-0 in the fifth with his fifth home run after another
single by Grudzielanek -- who was 3-for-4 with a ground-rule double.
The two-homer game was Green's fourth of his career and first since
July 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dodgers catchers have failed to throw out a runner on any
of 20 stolen base attempts this season. Chad Kreuter is 0-for-4 and
Todd Hundley 0-for-16, after retiring only 23 of 129 would-be base
stealers last season. ... The Dodgers, who were 2-7 against Florida
last season, had split their 70 meetings with the Marlins prior to
this weekend's sweep. ... Matt Herges had yet to allow a run this
season in 15 innings spanning 10 appearances. The scoreless streak
is the longest by a Dodgers reliever since June 1998, when Antonio
Osuna pitched 16 2-3 consecutive scoreless innings. ... The
Marlins, who have the first overall pick in the June 5 draft, have
only one of their eight No. 1 picks on their current 25-man roster
-- right fielder Mark Kotsay (1996). ... The Marlins' game-tying
rally from eight runs down in Saturday's 13-12 loss matched the
biggest comeback in the team's nine-year history. They overcame an
8-0 deficit on Sept. 2, 1995 at Houston, only to lose 10-8.

<HEADLINE> Kids Coming Through For NJ Devils  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- While Martin Brodeur and Scott
Stevens have been outstanding, one of the big reasons the New
Jersey Devils have played so well in the playoffs is their rookies,
and we're not talking about Scott Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, who led NHL rookies in points and is the top candidate
for rookie of the year honors, is struggling compared to center
John Madden and defensemen Colin White and Brian Rafalski.
</P>
<P>
   White scored the only goal, Madden helped kill off a crucial
four-minute high-sticking penalty in the third period and Rafalski
spent most of the night helping Stevens shut down Toronto's top
line as the Devils evened their best-of-seven series with the Maple
Leafs on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Games 3 and 4 of the second-round Eastern Conference series will
be played at the Continental Airlines Arena on Monday and
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are all fitting perfectly into the playoffs for us,''
left wing Patrik Elias said after the Devils practiced Sunday.
''Whitey is a tough guy who works hard. He's surprised me. He's
played well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mads does his jobs well and plays hard, and Ralfy, he's got a
lot of experience even though this is his first year here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the playoffs started, the three rookies all made major
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   White, a late season recall from Albany of the AHL, not only has
played a physical, tough game on defense, he also has a plus-3
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Rafalski, who has been Stevens' defensive partner all season,
also is plus-3. He has two assists and one goal, the game winner in
Game 3 of the opening-round sweep against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Madden, who tied a record with six short-handed goals in the
regular season, has helped the Devils kill off 23 of 24
short-handed situations. He's a plus-2 for the playoffs with one of
his two assists coming on a goal by Scott Niedermayer during a
two-man disadvantage in Game 2 against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez has been the biggest surprise, with the surprise being his
lack of play and production. Although he had the game-winning goal
in the series opener against Florida, his playing time has
diminished. He's minus-1 in six playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson nearly scratched him Saturday night because
he has not been skating well. He played just 12 shifts and 9
minutes, 34 seconds on Saturday, but Robinson said he skated
better.
</P>
<P>
   ''To tell you the truth, as long as the team wins, there is
nothing to be down about,'' Gomez said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rafalski, who played four years in Sweden and Finland before
joining New Jersey this season, said it isn't hard to fit into the
Devils system because everyone has a role.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know what we need to do,'' Rafalski said. ''There
hasn't been much change coming to the playoffs. Mad Dog (Madden) is
still killing off penalties and it seems his playing time has
increased playing against the top lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still playing with Scotty, and Whitey has been solid. I
guess the only thing is Gomer (Gomez) has been struggling a bit. He
may be a little tighter, but I'm sure he'll adjust and he'll do
better as we play more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gomez, the Maple Leafs have struggled generating offense
against Brodeur, taking just 41 shots in two games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to get the pace up and make it more end to end,''
center Mats Sundin said. ''We won't win the series this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sundin, Steve Thomas and Jonas Hoglund combined for 10 goals
against Ottawa in the first round. The line has not scored against
the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our game is a creative, flowing game through the neutral zone
and they're not allowing us to do that,'' said Thomas, a former
Devils player. ''We worked on a few things in practice to try and
combat that.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 2, Indians 1  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pedro's still perfect against the Indians. And
perfectly despised by them.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, who has owned Cleveland's soul the past two
years, remained unbeaten against the Indians on Sunday by taking a
shutout into the eighth before being ejected for hitting Roberto
Alomar in Boston's 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (5-0) won his 13th straight decision -- including two in
the postseason -- and has won 11 of his last 12 starts. He allowed
four hits, walked three, struck out 10 -- including Travis Fryman
three times -- and baffled the Indians once again.
</P>
<P>
   Including the postseason, Martinez is 7-0 against Cleveland with
a 1.62 ERA in 78 innings. He beat the Indians in Game 5 of the
division series last year, getting off the trainer's table with a
bad back to pitch six hitless innings of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Cleveland's frustration led to two brief bench-clearing
incidents, the second prompted by Martinez drilling Alomar with his
first pitch in the bottom of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Martinez twice came high and tight to Einar
Diaz, once knocking the Indians catcher down. Diaz stared out at
the mound before getting back in the batter's box but continued to
give Martinez dirty looks after striking out.
</P>
<P>
   When Jose Offerman came up in Boston's eighth, Charles Nagy
(1-4) hit him in the side and both benches and dugouts emptied.
Martinez remained in the dugout during most of the exchange but
finally came out after several of the Indians, including reliever
Scott Kamieniecki, waved for Martinez to come onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez chose to keep a safe distance, but he was in the middle
of things moments later when he drilled Alomar in the right
buttock. Alomar walked toward the mound carrying his bat but after
flipping it away, he tried to go after Martinez before being
grabbed by Boston catcher Jason Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   Again the two teams met in the middle of the infield, but
perhaps in light of the stiff suspensions given to the Detroit
Tigers and Chicago White Sox last week, decided not to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was the only player ejected, and was booed as he walked
slowly to the Boston dugout. Martinez hadn't been tossed from a
game since Sept. 24, 1996, when he was with Montreal and had a
reputation for throwing at batters.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar eventually got to third and David Justice got to second
with two outs off Derek Lowe, but Fryman grounded out to third.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe finished for his fifth save. He allowed a solo homer in the
ninth to Richie Sexson, snapping a 32 at-bat hitless string for the
Indians against Lowe in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley homered and Trot Nixon had an RBI groundout as the
Red Sox avoided a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy allowed two runs and six hits in eight innings. Nagy's
career record against Boston dropped to 10-2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kenny Lofton, who is batting .440 (12-for-29) against
Martinez, was placed on the 15-day DL Sunday with a strained biceps
muscle. Jacob Cruz went on the 60-day DL with a torn anterior
cruciate ligament in his left leg. Cruz is expected to miss the
rest of the year. ... Martinez has 57 career double-digit strikeout
games. Nolan Ryan is the career leader with 215. ... Jolbert
Cabrera, recalled before the game, got a loud ovation following an
11-pitch at-bat in the third.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Vet Crashes, Kills Self  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A man who crashed his car into Lake Michigan,
killing himself and his young granddaughter, was a Vietnam veteran
who had planned to attend a lakefront ceremony marking the 25th
anniversary of the fall of Saigon, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old driver, Christopher Tyler, had physical and
mental health problems and left his home in a rage Saturday
afternoon, according to police and a Milwaukee County medical
examiner's report. The child was identified as 23-month-old
Tashiaunna Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was intending to go down to the lakefront for ceremonies
commemorating the end of the war,'' said police Capt. Joseph M.
Purpero.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonies had ended by the time witnesses saw Tyler speed
through a boat storage area at the Milwaukee Community Sailing
Center and plunge into the lake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the medical examiner's report, Tyler's wife said he
suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. She also told
investigators that he had been drinking and smoking marijuana, and
that he was talking about how society had been taken over by evil
and children were suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators said Tyler held the child to his chest when
the vehicle sank, and witnesses said he seemed to rebuff rescue
efforts by two boaters as the car floated before submerging in 15
feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ''One guy was driving the boat, the other guy got off of the
boat onto the hood of the car and started pounding on the
windshield,'' witness John Couillard said.
</P>
<P>
   The man used an oar to break through and tried to get the child,
Couillard said, but finally had to jump back on his boat as the car
started sinking.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said about half a dozen divers later pulled the two
from the submerged car. They were pronounced dead at a hospital.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Rondell White hit a sacrifice
fly in the ninth inning to lead the Montreal Expos to a 4-3 victory
over the San Francisco Giants on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lost for the seventh time in their first eight games
at new Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Tracy and Peter Bergeron each singled with one out in the
ninth off John Johnstone (2-2). White, who hadn't started the last
three games because of a bone bruise in his left knee, hit a drive
to deep left field that scored Tracy without a throw.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Strickland (2-0) pitched a perfect eighth for the win, and
Ugueth Urbina got three outs for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds hit his 10th homer of the season for the Giants, a
solo shot that put San Francisco up 3-2 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barrett's first home run of the season tied the game at
3 in the seventh. The Expos nearly went ahead later that inning
when Vladimir Guerrero tripled with one out for his first hit in
the series.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee Stevens was walked intentionally, Aaron Fultz relieved
Giants starter Joe Nathan and got pinch-hitter Orlando Cabrera to
pop out. John Johnstone then got Chris Widger to ground out to end
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Carl Pavano allowed three runs -- two earned -- and
five hits and five walks. He struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan allowed three runs -- two earned -- and four hits in 7 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Aurilia scored on a throwing error and Marvin Benard hit a
sacrifice fly to give the Giants a 2-1 lead in the second. Nathan's
sacrifice bunt turned into a single and Pavano threw the ball away
at first, allowing Aurilia to score from second.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro's infield grounder scored Peter Bergeron to put
Montreal on top 1-0 in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Widger had an RBI double in the fourth to tie the game at 2 for
the Expos.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Pavano's five walks marked the first time all season the
Expos have walked more than three batters in a game. ... Bonds has
hit 10 or more homers in the month of April just twice in his
career. He hit 11 in 1996. ... Expos closer Ugueth Urbina' 109
saves tie him with Mel Rojas for second on the career list for
Montreal. ... Barrett was 1-for-19 on the road before hitting his
home run. ... The Giants suffered their first losing April since an
8-12 record in 1991. ... San Francisco has been outscored 79-58
from the fifth inning on this year. ... Nathan has allowed five
earned runs in 23 2-3 innings (1.90 ERA) lifetime against the
Expos.

<HEADLINE> Wood To Start Tuesday Vs. Astros  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Start breaking out the K signs, Chicago Cubs
fans.
</P>
<P>
   After missing all of last season, Kerry Wood will make his
return to the majors Tuesday night against the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good about it. I'm excited about it,'' Wood said Sunday
afternoon. ''I'm sure I'll have some nerves going. The first inning
of every game I've pitched so far I've had a little butterflies, so
I don't expect anything to change from that aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully I can settle down after the first hitter, calm down
and get in the groove.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 NL Rookie of the Year hasn't pitched in a major league
game since Oct. 3, 1998, Game 3 of the first-round playoffs against
the Braves. He blew out his elbow in spring training last year, and
had ''Tommy John'' reconstructive elbow surgery last April.
</P>
<P>
   He's made three strong rehabilitation starts this spring,
throwing 90 mph-plus and gradually working in his breaking pitches.
He now has a four-pitch repertoire -- a fastball, two sliders and a
changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been waiting for the opportunity to write him down on my
lineup card for a long time,'' Cubs manager Don Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood was on track to return last week, but he developed an
annoying little blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand.
The blister is fine, Wood said. New skin is already forming, and it
shouldn't affect his mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   As for the elbow, it's fine, Wood said. No pain, no problems,
just like he's been saying since spring training. In fact, if he'd
had his way, he'd have been in the rotation long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs have been cautious with their phenom's recovery
program all along.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm 12{ months into this thing,'' he said. ''Another day isn't
going to matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor decided to pitch Wood on Tuesday even though it's a night
game. But the forecast Tuesday calls for a warm, sunny day, with
temperatures in the mid- to high 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's going to have to pitch in a night game sooner or later.
We might as well go ahead and do that,'' Baylor said. ''The weather
supposedly is 65 or so. We can get by with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood doesn't care when he pitches. Just so long as he gets the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever he wanted to give me the ball I'm going to take it
and go out there,'' he said. ''I'm looking forward to getting back
out there. Day game, night game -- doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Cubs are equally excited to have Wood back. The
22-year-old has something special in his right arm, and pitchers
like him don't come around too often.
</P>
<P>
   He's got a presence on the mound that intimidates opponents and
energizes his teammates. When he came up his rookie year, he was
hailed as the next Roger Clemens and Nolan Ryan, right down to his
Texas roots.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Kerry, you know that day you've got a chance to play
behind a no-hitter,'' teammate Mark Grace said. ''And he's such a
great kid, too. His presence is not only on the field, it's in the
clubhouse. His ability will lift the other pitchers' mental frame
of mind. 'Hey, I want to go out there and do well like him.'
</P>
<P>
   ''No, they're not going to have the stuff Kerry's going to
throw, but it can elevate you to a higher level as a pitcher when
you can feed off of someone in your rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood was making just his fifth career start when he tied a major
league record with 20 strikeouts May 6, 1998. The opponent? None
other than the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day he faced us, he was awesome,'' said Cubs shortstop
Ricky Gutierrez, who was with the Astros in May 1998 and got the
Astros' only hit off Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be glad to be on his side instead of the opposing side,''
Gutierrez added, smiling. ''I already had that treatment a couple
of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That he's facing the Astros so close to the anniversary of his
20-strikeout game isn't lost on Wood. But when he takes the mound
Tuesday, he won't be thinking about what he did in 1998, 1999 or
any other year.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be thinking about this year, that game and what he needs
to do to get the Cubs a win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to forget who it was against,'' he said. ''But
it's not going to be weighing on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood struck out 13 in his next start, setting a major league
record for strikeouts in back-to-back, nine inning games. He
finished his rookie season 13-6 with a 3.40 ERA and 233 strikeouts,
despite missing the last month of the season with elbow problems.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's been gone a year, the expectations haven't lessened
any. He's still being compared to the pitching greats, and fans
will expect big things every time he takes the mound.
</P>
<P>
   That might be a lot to take for a young pitcher, but Wood isn't
fazed by it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't worry about expectations. I'm not big into that,'' he
said. ''I go out and do my job and let everybody else make the
expectations.''

Philippine Forces Attempt Rebel Capture
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine forces sprayed tear gas into a
tunnel complex Sunday in an attempt to capture Muslim extremists and rescue 27
hostages, mainly children, officials said. However, the Abu Sayyaf rebels seen
fleeing into the tunnel apparently escaped, military officials said. The rebels
said they fled to the jungle with all their captives, mainly children seized
from two schools on March 20. The rebels are accused of numerous kidnappings and
other attacks in southern Mindanao and demand the release of three terrorists
from U.S. jails, including Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 bombing of New
York's World Trade Center.

McCain: Vietnam Hinders Trade
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some American political leaders who served during the
Vietnam War said today that, 25 years after the war's end, Vietnam has not
flourished economically in part because Vietnamese leaders have hindered free
trade with the United States. Vietnam approved a bilateral trade agreement with
the United States last summer but officials held off signing a final deal.
''They have a million and a half citizens entering the work force every year now
and they are not creating those jobs, and that's unfortunate,'' Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., told CBS. The pact would bring an estimated $800 million in
trade to Vietnam.

Israeli-Palestinian Talks Resume

<P>
   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Israeli-Palestinian peace talks resumed Sunday in this
Red Sea resort amid bitter Palestinian protests over the disclosure that Israel
intends to build 174 new homes in a Jewish settlement on the West Bank. A
trust-building gesture planned by Prime Minister Ehud Barak -- handing over Arab
suburbs of Jerusalem to the Palestinians -- was in doubt as hawkish Israeli
Cabinet ministers said they would oppose it. Barak had hoped the handover would
show that Israel is serious about the talks. The negotiations are aimed at
achieving a framework for a permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinians.

Top-Ranking Citadel Woman Demoted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The Citadel's top-ranking female cadet, one of the
first women to attend the school, has been demoted over her reaction to being
targeted by a mess hall prank. Petra Lovetinska went from cadet major and
battalion executive officer to senior private and received 20 demerits. She also
was ordered to do 40 marching tours in the barracks. The prank goes like this:
An upperclassman tells a freshman cadet, called a knob, to crawl under the table
and pour condiments such as ketchup or salad dressing on an upperclassman's
shoes without getting caught. Lovetinska grabbed the knob, a male cadet, and
wiped her shoes on his trousers, leading to her demotion.

Orthodox Christians Celebrate Easter

   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Orthodox Christians across the world observed their
Easter Sunday with signs of reconciliation between Greece and Turkey, calls for
peace in Kosovo, and a service in the remains of a church destroyed by war in
Chechnya's capital, Grozny. Serbs celebrated in an unusually joyful mood in a
16th-century monastery outside the Kosovar capital, Pristina, where U.N. chief
administrator Bernard Kouchner joined worshippers. Bus-loads of Greeks filled
the patriarchate on the shore of Istanbul's Golden Horn, and joined in a
candlelit procession led by Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world's 200
million Orthodox Christians.

Microsoft Faces First Battle on Wall St.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s battle against the federal government's
plan to break up the company into two separate parts won't begin in a courtroom,
but in the stock market tomorrow. Says one analyst, ''They'll have to fight
every step of the way to prevent any lack of confidence from turning into a
downward spiral while they fight this thing.'' On Friday, the U.S. Justice
Department and 17 of the 19 states that filed antitrust complaints against
Microsoft submitted a plan to a federal judge to break the company into two new
businesses. Microsoft, which reorganized itself along similar lines last year,
has vowed to fight on.

Red Sox Defeat Indians 2-1

   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pedro Martinez remained unbeaten against the Cleveland
Indians today by taking a shutout into the eighth before being ejected for
hitting Roberto Alomar in Boston's 2-1 victory. Martinez (5-0) won his 13th
straight decision -- including two in the postseason -- and has won 11 of his
last 12 starts. He allowed four hits, walked three, struck out 10 -- including
Travis Fryman three times -- and baffled the Indians once again. Including the
postseason, Martinez is 7-0 against Cleveland with a 1.62 ERA in 78 innings. He
beat the Indians in Game 5 of the division series last year, getting off the
trainer's table with a bad back to pitch six hitless innings of relief.

<HEADLINE> Archbishop of Canterbury in S.Sudan  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- The spiritual leader of Anglican
Christians preached for peace Sunday during a visit to southern
Sudan to swear in a new archbishop for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey spoke at the enthronement
of the Anglican Archbishop of Sudan, the Most Rev. Joseph Marona.
Filling the post was delayed for two years by Sudan's civil war in
which Christians and animists are fighting the Muslim-dominated
government for more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe there is any reason either here in Sudan or
anywhere else in the world for Christians and Muslims to commit
violence against one another,'' Carey said in his sermon in the
southern city of Juba, according to a statement released by his
office.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million people have died in fighting and
accompanying famines since rebels in the south took up arms in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is every reason to hold one another's faith in the
deepest respect, and even more reason to discover common ground
upon which together you can contribute to the peace process here,''
Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suffering, the poverty, the effects of war do not
differentiate between religions. All the people of this beautiful
country are suffering and all deserve peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Gada Zakharia, governor of Equatoria province of which
Juba is the capital, welcomed Carey's visit, telling The Associated
Press by telephone that ''it shows an achievement for peace from
inside Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey flew to Juba, 550 miles south of Khartoum, from Khartoum
earlier Sunday. He is on a four-day visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he discussed the effects of the war with senior
Sudanese officials. He also toured a camp on Khartoum's outskirts
for war refugees, where he led a brief prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Lambeth Palace, the archbishop's office, said earlier that Carey
is carrying a strong message of support and encouragement for the
minority Christians who form 16 percent of Sudan's 29 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   It is Carey's third visit to Sudan since he became head of the
Anglican church in 1991. On previous visits Carey had condemned
discrimination against Sudan's Christian communities.

Poul Hartling
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Poul Hartling, Denmark's former prime
minister who later became U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
received the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the organization,
died Sunday, Danish radio reported. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling became high commissioner in 1978 and held the
Geneva-based office during two consecutive periods to 1985. During
his terms, he dealt mainly with refugees from Vietnam, Ethiopia and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the U.N. commission won the Nobel Peace Prize and
Hartling made the trip to Oslo, Norway, to receive the award.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling, a Lutheran priest, also received Pakistan's Nishan
award in recognition of his efforts to mobilize humanitarian
assistance for the Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling was a Liberal Party foreign minister from 1968 to 1971,
then he became prime minister in a minority Cabinet in 1973 after
general elections. Following that vote, the number of parties in
parliament doubled to 10 after the main parties split, leading to a
period with political turmoil, weak minority governments and
frequent elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling, who later described his time as prime minister as
''horrible,'' quit Danish politics in 1978 to head the UNHCR
office.
Toon Hermans
</P>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Toon Hermans, a melancholic Dutch
cabaret artist who made audiences roar with laughter as he
privately pondered the depths of human existence, died April 23 of
a heart attack. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Hermans will be remembered in the Dutch cabaret world as a
consummate one-man entertainer who was a master of intelligent
one-liners and humorous ballads.
</P>
<P>
   But he also had a deeply philosophical side, which intensified
after the 1990 death of his wife of 40 years, Rietje. He was
fascinated by the philosophy of Zen Buddhism, the contemplations of
German philosopher Arthur Shopenhauer and the lyric verse of German
poet Rainer Maria Rilke.
Evelyn Graham Irons
</P>
<P>
   BREWSTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Evelyn Graham Irons, a war correspondent
believed to be the first female journalist to reach Hitler's
retreat at Berchtesgaden at the end of World War II, died April 3.
She was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Irons was also renowned for her tangled romance with novelist
and poet Vita Sackville-West in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Somerville College, Oxford, Irons began
working as a journalist for London's The Daily Mail, and later for
The Evening Standard. At the outbreak of World War II, Irons became
a war correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   She later crossed the Rhine with Charles De Gaulle, and
accompanied French troops through Germany and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   When Irons was an editor at the Daily Mail, she met
Sackville-West in 1931. Their romance lasted for two years, until
Irons met and fell in love with another woman, Joy McSweeney. The
two remained companions until McSweeney's death in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The love poems that Sackville-West wrote in 1931 as part of her
''Collected Poems,'' are addressed to Irons. The pair remained
close friends and corresponded until Sackville-West died in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Irons moved to New York in 1952. She became the New York bureau
chief of The Sunday Times of London at the end of the 1950s.
Raul Rettig
</P>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Raul Rettig, a lawyer who led an official
investigation into atrocities committed during Gen. Augusto
Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship, died Sunday of a heart attack. He
was 91.
</P>
<P>
   During a political career than spanned seven decades, Rettig was
a Cabinet member, ambassador, congressman and senator, but he is
best remembered for heading up the commission that produced the
official report on human rights abuses by the Pinochet regime.
</P>
<P>
   A fiery public speaker and a respected attorney, Rettig was
credited across the political spectrum as having done a balanced
job in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's final report established that at least 3,197
people were killed for political reasons or disappeared during the
Pinochet regime.
David Spanier
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- David Spanier, a former foreign and diplomatic
correspondent for The Times of London and an authority on gambling,
died of a stroke April 18 at a London casino. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Spanier joined The Times in 1957, initially covering domestic
news.
</P>
<P>
   An early advocate of closer relations with Europe, he became the
paper's first correspondent on the European Common Market in 1961.
His first book, ''Europe Our Europe,'' was an account of
negotiations for Britain's entry into the trading bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said his appointment as diplomatic correspondent in
1974 was the culmination of his career at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Spanier's first book on gambling, ''Total Poker,'' was published
in 1977 and well received. Other books included ''The Gambler's
Pocket Book'' (1980) and ''Easy Money: Inside the Gambler's Mind''
(1987).
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Spanier carved out a new career in broadcasting when he
joined the London news radio station LBC as diplomatic
correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, fashion writer Suzy Menkes, and
their three sons.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's
campaign for U.S. Senate has received a $30,000 contribution from
the most unlikely of sources: the law firm of former independent
counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Recent campaign filings show that 33 attorneys and one legal
assistant at the firm of Kirkland &AMP; Ellis donated a total of
$32,250 to Clinton's campaign at the beginning of the year, The
Journal News reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Lindbloom, a partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, who went to
high school with the first lady in the 1960s, donated $2,000 to
Clinton's campaign, the maximum amount allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Hillary would be a wonderful senator,'' Lindbloom told
The Journal News. ''I'm an Illinois girl who moved to New York. She
can do it too.''
</P>
<P>
   No one from Kirkland &AMP; Ellis contributed to the campaign of
Clinton's opponent, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland &AMP; Ellis employ 635 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Starr joined Kirkland &AMP; Ellis in 1993 after serving as solicitor
general in former President George Bush's administration. He served
as a full partner at the firm until he went on leave in 1998, when
his independent counsel investigation turned to the President
Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is currently on leave from the firm and is writing a book
about his time as independent counsel

<HEADLINE> Angels Place Jason Dickson On DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Angels right-hander Jason Dickson was
placed on the 15-day disabled list Sunday with a strained muscle in
his left hip.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson, 2-2 with a 4.73 ERA in five starts this season, had to
leave his last start, Friday against Tampa Bay, in the second
inning because of pain in his hip.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are purchasing the contract of right-hander Eric
Weaver from Triple-A Edmonton. Weaver was 0-0 with a 3.52 ERA in 7
2-3 innings of relief at Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, the Angels sent reliever Lou Pote to Edmonton and
recalled Mike Holtz. Pote, a right-hander, appeared in 11 games for
Anaheim, gave up six earned runs in 11 1-3 innings and did not
record a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed Holtz was 0-1 with a 10.80 ERA and allowed six
earned runs in five innings during six appearances at Edmonton. He
was 2-3 with an 8.06 ERA in 28 games for Anaheim last season.

<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Owen Nolan, whose six goals and eight points in
the first round led San Jose to a stunning upset of top-seeded St.
Louis, was scratched Sunday from Game 2 of the Sharks' second-round
series.
</P>
<P>
   The team didn't specify Nolan's injury, but the right wing was
hit in the foot by a slap shot in Game 7 against the Blues. Nolan
also missed four of the last five regular-season games with a
shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan was in obvious pain during a 4-0 loss Friday night to the
defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars, taking only four shots
and often getting knocked face-first onto the ice. He was limping
following practice on Saturday, but insisted he would play in Game
2.
</P>
<P>
   He scored five of his team-record 44 goals this season against
Dallas and Nolan's 84 points were also a franchise best.

<HEADLINE> Violent Clash in Dominican Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH NESMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Bodyguards for the
leading presidential candidate shot and killed a governing party
official and another man in what the opposition said was
self-defense during an assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The most violent confrontation yet in the campaign was an
indication of rising tensions and the high stakes involved in May
16 elections in this Caribbean nation of eight million people.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party said someone shot
at the car of its presidential candidate, Hipolito Mejia, on
Saturday night and that his security guards returned fire, killing
two men.
</P>
<P>
   But President Leonel Fernandez's Dominican Liberation Party said
the security guards shot first.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting took place in Moca, 90 miles from the capital, as
Mejia's car was passing in front of the house of Luis Terrero Gil,
41, a local official of the Liberation Party.
</P>
<P>
   Terrero, the director of the National Center for Science and
Art, was killed, as was Rafael Penalo, 29, who was on the street in
front of the house along with other supporters of the Liberation
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Javier Garcia, Liberation Party campaign manager,
denied anybody shot at Mejia's car and said the killings were ''a
premeditated assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Terrero was on the patio when the shooting erupted,
killing Penalo, who was on the street in front of the house. Garcia
charged that members of the opposition party then invaded the
house, killed Terrero and beat up his wife and a son.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Party, in a statement released on Sunday,
blamed the incident on the governing Liberation Party. The
opposition said Liberation Party followers shot at Mejia's car and
threw rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the confusion, it was thought that this was an attempt
against the presidential candidate, so the members of the security
force proceeded to remove him from the area,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were investigating the incident and declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia is a left-leaning politician who has threatened, if he
wins, to prosecute leading members of the government for alleged
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Government supporters fear a Mejia victory could derail and
reverse the great economic strides made by the current
administration, which has overseen a 50 percent expansion in the
Dominican economy through privatizing state companies and
streamlining bureaucracy to encourage international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Mejia leading with 40 to 50 percent of
the vote, with rest divided between the two other candidates --
Danilo Medina of the Liberation Party and former President Joaquin
Balaguer of the Social Christian Reformist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, the current president, is barred by law for running
for another term.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Threat Designation Defended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials Sunday
defended their decision to classify AIDS as a threat to national
security -- a designation aimed at garnering more attention and
funding toward combating the disease worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Thurman, director of the White House Office of National
AIDS Policy, said AIDS has become such an epidemic that, in years
to come, it threatens to destabilize nations and the economies of
whole continents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to respond to this because we've never seen a crisis
like HIV and AIDS globally,'' Thurman said. ''We're beginning to
understand that this epidemic, not only has health implications,
but has implications as a fundamental development issue, an
economic issue and a stability and security issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, in an appearance earlier in
the day, said he does not believe AIDS is a national security
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess this is just the president trying to make an appeal
to, you know, certain groups,'' Lott, R-Miss., told ''Fox News
Sunday.'' ''I don't view that as a national security threat, not to
our national security interests, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman countered that a report earlier this year from the
National Intelligence Council indicates that the disease is
''sweeping the globe,'' posing a crisis in Africa today and
threatening India and newly independent nations of the former
Soviet Union in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the logistical expertise that the national security
community brings, with the diplomatic expertise that is necessary
to sort of pave the road for leaders around the world to respond to
this epidemic, this gives us a whole new ability to respond to AIDS
like we would respond to any other international threat,'' Thurman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in raising the status of AIDS, has creating an
interagency working group. The Clinton administration has
designated about $325 million to fighting the disease worldwide
this year, most of it going to Africa, and the president wants an
additional $100 million for fiscal 2001, Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   She said a large focus of the effort would be on finding a
vaccine.

Russia Releases 31 Former Rebels
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia (AP) -- Russia released 31 former rebels from a detention
camp in northern Chechnya on Sunday as part of its efforts to win wider popular
support in the republic, an official said. At the same time, the military has
stepped up its bombing campaign in southern Chechnya, where most of the rebels
are concentrated. Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya following weeks of
airstrikes in September, after Chechnya-based Islamic militants invaded
neighboring Dagestan in August. The rebels also are blamed in a series of
apartment bombings in Russia that killed about 300 people in September.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of gays and supporters marched today
on the Capitol, transforming the National Mall into a sea of multicolored flags
and joining hands in a show of unity they hope will transform recent victories
into wider protections for homosexuals. In a crowd dotted with openly gay
celebrities, the marchers celebrated a week of victories that included passage
of a new law in Vermont giving gays marriage-like rights and a renewed plea by
President Clinton's for a federal Hate Crimes Prevention Act. But demonstrators
vowed not to rest until same-sex couples get equal rights in all 50 states.

Top-Ranking Citadel Woman Demoted

   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- The Citadel's top-ranking female cadet, one of the
first women to attend the school, has been demoted over her reaction to being
targeted by a mess hall prank. Petra Lovetinska went from cadet major and
battalion executive officer to senior private and received 20 demerits. She also
was ordered to do 40 marching tours in the barracks. The prank goes like this:
An upperclassman tells a freshman cadet, called a knob, to crawl under the table
and pour condiments such as ketchup or salad dressing on an upperclassman's
shoes without getting caught. Lovetinska grabbed the knob, a male cadet, and
wiped her shoes on his trousers, leading to her demotion.

Red Sox Defeat Indians 2-1
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Pedro Martinez remained unbeaten against the Cleveland
Indians today by taking a shutout into the eighth before being ejected for
hitting Roberto Alomar in Boston's 2-1 victory. Martinez (5-0) won his 13th
straight decision -- including two in the postseason -- and has won 11 of his
last 12 starts. He allowed four hits, walked three, struck out 10 -- including
Travis Fryman three times -- and baffled the Indians once again. Including the
postseason, Martinez is 7-0 against Cleveland with a 1.62 ERA in 78 innings. He
beat the Indians in Game 5 of the division series last year, getting off the
trainer's table with a bad back to pitch six hitless innings of relief.

<HEADLINE> Gustafson Wins Chick-fil-A Golf  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Ga. (AP) -- Sophie Gustafson made a 4-foot birdie
putt on the 18th hole to clinch her first victory on the LPGA Tour,
a one-shot triumph Sunday over Kelly Robbins and Amy Fruhwirth at
the Chick-fil-A Charity Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb, who had won four of her five events this year and
finished second in the other, began the day three shots off the
lead and couldn't make up the deficit -- even though the three
players in front of her to start the round were a combined 10 over
on the front nine in near-perfect scoring conditions at Eagle's
Landing Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Webb finished with a 1-under-par 71 for the final round but was
two shots behind Gustafson's 10-under 206 total. Gustafson rallied
for a 72 Sunday after appearing on the verge of a major collapse,
standing at four over through seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That showed how much courage she has,'' said Webb, who tied
for fourth. ''She clawed her way back into the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson, a native of Sweden who suffers from a severe speech
impediment, rebounded from a double bogey at No. 7 to put together
a string of five birdies in six holes beginning at No. 9. But, in a
display that epitomized the erratic play of all the contenders, she
nearly gave away the tournament with bogeys at 15 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson made a testy 3-footer to save par at 17 before going
to the final hole knowing a birdie would clinch her first LPGA
victory. Her second shot sailed into the bunker alongside the
green, but she escaped the sand with a brilliant shot that rolled
just left of the flag and spun to a halt four feet away.
</P>
<P>
   With her auburn hair glimmering in the sunlight, Gustafson
calmly made the putt and claimed the $135,000 winner's check in the
tournament she led after all three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice that I was able to come back and finish strong,''
said Gustafson, struggling to get the words out.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony on the 18th green, tournament host Nancy Lopez
presented Gustafson with the crystal trophy and spoke on behalf of
the winner to thousands of fans clustered in front of the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her English is not quite as good as she'd like it to be,''
Lopez said. ''I'm going to talk for her and tell you some of the
things she wants to say you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez joked that Gustafson ''must have stopped breathing'' as
she closed in on her first victory in the United States. Gustafson
finally took the microphone and, in halting, dramatic fashion, told
the crowd, ''Thank you.'' Then, she handed the microphone back to
the host and whispered in her ear.
</P>
<P>
   ''She also wants to thank her caddy, Chuck (Hoersch), for doing
such a great job,'' Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a sunny day with temperatures in the upper-70s and
virtually no wind, a star-studded field with 46 of the tour's top
50 money-winners took turns making one bad shot after another.
</P>
<P>
   Gustafson sliced her tee shot out of bounds at 3, then her
playing partner, Laura Davies, did the same at the par-3 4th.
Michelle McGann, who began the day two shots off the lead, had a
quadruple-bogey at 8, putting her tee shot into the woods and
whiffing twice after her second shot landed on a steep bank,
disappearing in the high grass.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, six shots behind Gustafson at the beginning of the
round, was tied for the lead going to the par-5 hole, the easiest
on the course. But she hooked her tee shot into the water and had
to scramble for a par.
</P>
<P>
   Even though her 5-under 67 was the best score among the leaders,
her 207 total wasn't good enough to hold off Gustafson.
</P>
<P>
   Fruhwirth was leading at the turn but her tee shot at 10 plopped
into the same pond that would later ruin Robbins' day. The result
was a double-bogey, too much to overcome even though she birdied
the final two holes for a 70 in the round and a 207 overall.
</P>
<P>
   In her worst finish of the year, Webb was in three-way tie with
Sherri Steinhauer and Lorie Kane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I needed a 66 to win and I was pressing too early,''
said Webb, who became so frustrated at one point that she threw her
ball in a creek. ''It learned a good lesson today: don't set a
score, just play the course.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: Lopez, in her first year as the official host, shot a 73
in the final round for a 221 total -- 15 shots behind the winner.
... Defending champion Rachel Heatherington briefly got on the
leaderboard and finished with a 68, putting her eight shots behind
Gustafson. ... McGann, seeking her first victory since 1997,
struggled to a 76 and wound up six shots off the lead. Davies, tied
with McGann for second at the beginning of the round, wasn't much
better with a 74.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Sunday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
White Sox-Tigers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox set a major league record for runs in
April with 181, topping the previous mark of 180 by the 1998 Texas
Rangers. ... SS Jose Valentin has 10 errors after committing two --
one throwing and one fielding -- in the seventh inning. ... 3B Greg
Norton was 5-for-9 in the three-game series at Detroit. ... Chris
Singleton's RBI single in the eighth snapped an 0-for-11 slump.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: RHP Todd Jones made his 400th career appearance. ...
Half of Deivi Cruz's 16 hits have gone for extra bases, including
an RBI double Sunday. ... Juan Gonzalez broke an 0-for-12 skid with
a 12th-inning single. ... A large sign on the side of a church near
Comerica Park asks fans to ''Pray Here For The Tigers.''
Red Sox-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The possibility of being fined or suspended probably had
something to do with the Red Sox and Indians electing not to turn
Sunday's incidents into a full-scale brawl. But Pedro Martinez said
nothing will ever stop a pitcher from hitting an opposing batter
once a teammate gets hit. ''It's part of the game. Every time
somebody gets drilled we're going to retaliate,'' he said.
''Baseball is so old. Baseball has been like this forever. We are a
team. We play as a team. We fight as a team. We go down as a team
and we win as a team. Forget about the fines or whatever. We're
going to do what we have to do.'' ... Derek Lowe earned his fifth
save of the season but finally gave up a hit against the Indians.
Before Richie Sexson's homer in the ninth, Cleveland hitters were
0-for-32 against the right-hander in the regular season. Since the
start of the '99 season, the Indians are just 2-for-40 against
Lowe. ... Free-swinging shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who struck out
just 39 times all of last year, fanned twice. That happened five
times in '99.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: The most perplexing thing during Sunday's incident
for Cleveland manager Charlie Manuel was that Martinez would still
throw at Roberto Alomar in the eighth inning despite being warned.
''Here's a guy pitching a shutout and he knows he's going to get
thrown out because the umpires had warned both managers and he
still does it. I can't figure that out.'' ... Martinez's attitude
rubs a lot of players the wrong way and he uses that to his
advantage. ''He knows he's good,'' said Indians first baseman/DH
Richie Sexson. ''The bad thing is that you can't go up there and
say, 'I'm going to crush him.''' ... Cleveland's relievers had a
superb series against Boston, combining for 5 1-3 shutout innings
while retiring 16 of 20 batters.
Rangers-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: David Segui is 11-for-20 in his last five games. ...
Texas is 3-10 when committing an error and 6-5 otherwise. ... Seven
of Chad Curtis' last 10 hits have been for extra bases. ... The
Rangers played without Rafael Palmeiro, who is hampered by a
hamstring strain.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Albert Belle was at DH for the third time in four
games Sunday, but manager Mike Hargrove said, ''I don't anticipate
this becoming a trend, at all.'' ... Mike Bordick finished the
month with a team-record 29 RBIs in April. ... The Orioles'
nine-game home winning streak, longest since 1998, ended with their
8-4 loss to Texas. ... Baltimore went 14-10 in April compared to
6-16 a year ago.
Blue Jays-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: John Frascatore made his 12th relief appearance in 26
games for the Jays, second high on the club (Pedro Borbon has 13).
... Rookie Dewayne Wise struck out all three times he faced Roger
Clemens. ... The Blue Jays wound up losing two of three in New York
but still have split in the first six games between the two teams
after going 2-10 last season. Toronto's starters are 10-13.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Derek Jeter has reached base in 22 of the first 23
games and has hit safely in 20. ... The Yankees are 15-8, the
second most wins in April under Joe Torre. New York went 17-6 in
1998 on its way to 114 wins. ... Roger Clemens has 3,352 career
strikeouts. ... With 249 career wins, Clemens is now chasing Bob
Gibson (251) who ranks 38th all-time in victories. ... Clemens is
41-19 in April. ... Paul O'Neill has hit in 10 of last 12 games.
... Shane Spencer has 12 RBIs on only 16 hits with a .222 batting
average. ... Bernie Williams drove in 24 runs in 23 games in April.
Mariners-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Manager Lou Piniella has been fighting a cold for
several days. ''I'm not feeling very good right now. But it will
get better,'' he said. ... Mark McLemore surprised everybody in the
ninth when he tried to steal third base. He was thrown out easily,
which went a long way toward helping the Royals snuff out the
rally. ''It was stupid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: New owner David Glass and his family will be
officially welcomed by fans in on-field ceremonies May 7 prior to
the game with Chicago. ... The Royals seem to be re-igniting fan
interest. After 11 home games, they were averaging 21,405. After 11
games last year, they were averaging 15,634.
Athletics-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Pitcher Kevin Appier was placed on the DL with a
strained right forearm, retroactive to April 25. Manager Art Howe
said Appier may be out for longer than the next 10 days. ''That's
at best, it's going to be a couple of weeks,'' Howe said. ... Luis
Vizcaino was recalled from Triple-A Sacramento to replace Appier on
the roster. ... Howe said he's satisfied with the Athletics' 12-13
record, considering that three players are on the DL. ''The key is
hanging in there, staying close until we get fully manned,'' Howe
said. In addition to Appier, second baseman Randy Velarde and first
baseman John Jaha are on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins have had six consecutive quality starts by
their own pitchers, but are 3-3 in those games. ... Doug
Mientkiewicz, last year's everyday first baseman, is hitting .244
with one homer, 12 RBIs and 15 strikeouts in 23 games at Triple-A
Salt Lake. GM Terry Ryan said Mientkiewicz isn't taking his
demotion as a punishment. ''He's off to a slow start,'' Ryan said.
''It's not because he's sulking. He's working hard.'' ... The Twins
only need a fifth starter twice in the next 17 days and Ryan said
he's not sure rookie and Rule V draftee Johan Santana will get the
assignment. Ryan didn't say whether Jason Ryan (no relation), who
is 2-0 with a 3.00 ERA in Salt Lake will be called up.
Devil Rays-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays placed RHP Jim Mecir on the DL Sunday
with tightness in his right biceps muscle and recalled RHP Bryan
Rekar from his rehabilitation assignment at Triple-A Durham. ...
Sunday's starter against the Angels, Steve Trachsel, graduated from
Troy High in Fullerton, just minutes from Anaheim Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels sent RHP Lou Pote to Triple-A Edmonton and
recalled LHP Mike Holtz. ... Scott Schoeneweis' 4-0 record means
he's off to the fastest start by an Angels pitcher since Terry
Clark began 5-0 in 1988. Schoeneweis has no decision in one of his
games; Clark won all his first five games. The club's best start
ever by a pitcher is 5-0, shared by six former Angels.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Diamondbacks-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Lost in Randy Johnson's pitching feats are his
offensive accomplishments. Johnson, who spent 10 of the last 12
seasons in Seattle, has a four-game hitting streak going. His
two-run single Sunday gave him three RBIs -- two less than the
earned runs he's given up this year. ''He doesn't like to be
embarrassed on the field,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter said.
''He knows, over the course of the season, the little things he can
do on the field will help him and help the team.'' ... Greg
Colbrunn reached base in nine consecutive plate appearances during
the series with Chicago, setting a team record. The previous record
was seven straight. ... After recording only three saves in the
first 22 years of his career, Mike Morgan has four this season.
''It's a different role, but I like it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Ismael Valdes, on the DL since March 20 with tendinitis
in his right shoulder, will make his first start Thursday. ''I feel
good, great and I'm ready to go,'' he said. ''You don't want to
have those kind of setbacks, but you want to take care of things
first, and I feel that is what I did.'' Valdes made one rehab
start, allowing two runs -- one earned -- and three hits in five
innings Saturday for Class-A Daytona. He also struck out five and
walked three in the 7-2 victory. ... Sammy Sosa was ejected in the
ninth inning when he looked at home plate umpire Bill Miller and
drew a line in the dirt after striking out on a questionable called
strike. Replays showed the pitch was about six inches outside the
plate. ''That pitch was a ball. If it would have been a strike, I
would have gone right there,'' he said. ''When it is a strike I
have no problem with that. I don't want to embarrass anybody, but
that's how I feel.'' ... Eric Young extended his hitting streak to
eight games with a leadoff single in the eighth.
Cardinals-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: St. Louis 3B Fernando Tatis, who strained his groin
in Saturday's 7-6 victory, is expected to be out at least two
weeks. The Cardinals have yet to make a roster move. ... Tatis'
career-high 13-game hitting streak was snapped Saturday. ... The
Cardinals return home for a three-game series against Pittsburgh
starting Tuesday then play nine straight on the road.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: The Phillies begin a three-game series against
Cincinnati on Tuesday. It will be the only time Ken Griffey Jr.
plays at Veterans Stadium this season. In his honor, all fans with
Junior in their name will receive a free ticket to any of the
games. ... Reliever Amaury Telemaco was designated for assignment
following Saturday's game when Curt Schilling was activated. ...
Injured closer Mike Jackson is scheduled to resume throwing
Tuesday. Jackson hasn't thrown since April 18.
Reds-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: OF Deion Sanders has agreed to a 10-day
rehabilitation assignment extension at Triple-A Louisville through
May 11. ... The Reds, the majors' best road team last season, are
7-5 on the road. ... Denny Neagle, the former Pirates pitcher who
starts Monday night, is 23-14 in Three Rivers Stadium. ... Ken
Griffey Jr. has at least one RBI in his last four games.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: After surrendering a relatively low five homers in
11 games, the Pirates yielded two in two innings Sunday to the
Reds' Ken Griffey Jr. and Juan Castro. ... Brian Giles is 7-for-18
(.389) with a homer and five RBIs since moving from third to fourth
in the batting order. ... Wil Cordero, in a 2-for-25 slump that has
dropped his average to .182, took the day off Sunday. ... John
Vander Wal was 2-for-3 and is batting .333 (9-for-27) as a position
player. He is hitting .429 (3-for-7) with two homers as a
pinch-hitter.
Astros-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: The Astros already have seen what manager Larry Dierker
considers the best of Kerry Wood, who makes his 2000 season debut
against Houston on Tuesday. ''One of the two or three most
memorable games of my career was watching him, from our dugout,
strike out 20,'' Dierker said. ''Even in subsequent games that year
(1998), we never touched him, so facing him again at Wrigley would
definitely be memorable.'' ... Craig Biggio had an interesting line
in Saturday's boxscore. It read 0-3-0-0 in the 10-3 Houston
victory. He walked three times, was hit twice and scored three
runs.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers, off to an 8-15 start, released P Jaime
Navarro after he refused an assignment to Triple-A Indianapolis.
Navarro (0-5, 12.54 ERA) has a $5 million guaranteed contract. ...
Milwaukee also purchased the contract of LHP Ray King from
Indianapolis and activated Juan Acevedo from the DL. To make room
on the roster, the Brewers also designated reliever Matt Williams
((0-0, 7.00 ERA) for assignment. ... More roster moves are
forthcoming due to the anticipated return of C Henry Blanco from
the DL and pitchers Jamey Wright and John Snyder, both of whom are
at extended spring training.
Mets-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Catcher Mike Piazza missed his second straight game
with a bruised right wrist and hyperextended right elbow but was
available to pinch-hit in an emergency. Piazza plans to take
batting practice and play long toss Monday. He has not thrown a
ball or swung a bat since leaving Friday's game against Colorado,
but he said he is close to returning. ''I'm feeling better. They
would like to shut me down one more day and err on the side of
safety.'' ... LHP Bill Pulsipher, who has battled anxiety problems
since injuring his elbow in 1995, was scheduled to start Monday
against the Giants. The Mets put Pulsipher on a heart monitor after
he collapsed in a bathroom during spring training. ''If he get too
worked up and that results in a bad performance, we'll try to make
whatever adjustments possible,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ...
SS Rey Ordonez committed his sixth error of the season. He had four
errors in 640 chances all of last year. ... For the second straight
game, every Mets starter had at least one hit.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Before Sunday's game, the Rockies purchased the
contract of RHP Giovanni Carrara from Triple-A Colorado Springs and
optioned RHP Rick Croushore to the same club. Croushore had been
pitching in middle relief, and the Rockies want him to get a chance
to start in the minors. Carrara, a non-roster invitee at spring
training, has pitched in 33 major league games, but none since 1997
with the Cincinnati Reds. He was 3-0 with a 2.35 ERA in four stats
at Triple-A. .... The Rockies (11-14) finished under .500 in April
for the third straight season. ... Todd Helton walked four times to
tie a team record. ... Neifi Perez's last six hits have been for
extra bases, but he is 4-for-30 with runners in scoring position.
Expos-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Carl Pavano's five walks marked the first time all
season the Expos have walked more than three batters in a game. ...
The Expos starting rotation has walked just 39 batters in 140 1-3
innings. ... Closer Ugueth Urbina moved into a tie with Mel Rojas
(109) for second on the all-time Montreal saves list. ... 3B
Michael Barrett was 1-for-19 on the road before hitting a home run
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: OF Ellis Burks was held out of Sunday's game with
a mild quadriceps strain in his left foot. He's doubtful for
Monday's game against the Mets. ... OF Barry Bonds has hit 10 or
more homers in the month of April just twice in his career. He hit
11 in 1996, and hit his 10th this year on Sunday. Bonds has hit six
of the Giants' 11 homers at Pacific Bell Park and all seven of his
hits at home have been for extra bases. ... The Giants had their
first losing April since an 8-12 record in 1991. ... San Francisco
has been outscored 79-59 from the fifth inning on this year.
Marlins-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: The Marlins, who have the first overall pick in the
June 5 draft, have only one of their eight No. 1 picks on their
current 25-man roster -- right fielder Mark Kotsay (1996). The only
other No. 1 picks to have played for them are pitcher Marc Valdes
(1993), infielder Josh Booty (1994) and catcher Charles Johnson
(1992). ... The Marlins' game-tying rally from eight runs down in
Saturday's 13-12 loss matched the biggest comeback in the team's
nine-year history. They overcame an 8-0 deficit on Sept. 2, 1995 at
Houston, only to lose 10-8. ... Reliever Dan Micelli retired his
first batter in 12 of his 13 appearances and has stranded all seven
baserunners he has inherited.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Dodgers catchers have failed to prevent opponents
from stealing a base in all 20 attempts this season. Todd Hundley
was 0-for-16, after retiring only 23 of 129 would-be base stealers
last season. ... Matt Herges has yet to allow a run this season in
15 innings spanning 10 appearances. The scoreless streak is the
longest by a Dodgers reliever since June 1998, when Antonio Osuna
pitched 16 2-3 consecutive scoreless innings. ... Orel Hershiser's
one-inning relief appearance on Saturday night represented his
first for the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium since Oct. 6, 1985, against
Cincinnati. ... Only five NL players have been with their
respective teams longer than 10th-year first baseman Eric Karros --
San Diego's Tony Gwynn (19 seasons), Cincinnati's Barry Larkin
(15), Atlanta's Tom Glavine (14), Chicago's Mark Grace (13) and
Houston's Craig Biggio (13).
Braves-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Andres Galarraga matched the club record for April
homers with his 10th on Saturday, a three-run shot in the eighth
inning that tied the game 4-4. The Braves went on to win 7-4 on
Andruw Jones' three-run shot in the 12th. Ryan Klesko, now with the
Padres, set the Braves' mark with 10 April homers in 1996 and
Galarraga matched it in 1998. ... LF Reggie Sanders is listed as
day-to-day after spraining his right ankle Saturday running out a
grounder. Trenidad Hubbard got the start Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Reliever Carlos Almanzar has struggled after getting
off to a fast start. He gave up only one run and three hits over 11
2-3 innings in his first nine appearances for a 0.77 ERA, but has
allowed eight runs and eight hits over four innings in his last
four appearances to see his ERA shoot to 5.17. After Will Cunnane
put two on in the eighth inning Saturday night, Almanzar allowed
Andres Galarraga's three-run homer, blowing a 4-1 lead for Rodrigo
Lopez, who was making his big league debut.

<HEADLINE> Padres Put Tony Gwynn On DL  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Tony Gwynn was put on the 15-day disabled list
on Sunday with a sore left knee that's contributed to his
unfathomable .186 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres star, a lifetime .339 hitter, thinks the
rest will help the inflammation settle down, but acknowledged that
the knee might bother him all season.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, who turns 40 on May 9, has had fluid drained from the
knee at least five times since spring training, most recently on
Thursday after playing on the artificial turf in Pittsburgh on
Tuesday and Wednesday. The longest stretch he's been able to play
was five straight starts on the last road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn has had five surgeries on the knee throughout his career
and with most of the cartilage gone, the joint is pretty much bone
on bone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, this is the only thing they could do,'' Gwynn said
before Sunday night's game against Atlanta. ''I can't keep going
out there for two days, have it swell up on me, drain it, come
back, have it swell up on me. Maybe this will calm it down.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too hard on them,'' he said, motioning toward manager
Bruce Bochy's office, ''and too hard on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn started only 11 of the Padres' first 24 games and appeared
twice as a pinch-hitter. He was hit on the right elbow in the
season opener on April 3 and missed the next three games, then had
the knee flare up on him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't do what I need do,'' said Gwynn, an eight-time NL
batting champion who started the season with 3,067 hits, 18th on
the career list. ''I'm not able to sit on my back leg, and when I
can't do that, I'm screwed. And I can't run. It makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn has only 8 hits in 43 at-bats, with three doubles and
seven RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn said his knee was calm coming into the season, but now
he's wondering if it'll bother him all year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it's just the fact
that it keeps coming back so quickly,'' Gwynn said. ''We've talked
about surgery, but what are they going to fix? Let's just let it
calm down and we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres activated infielder Dave Magadan, who had been on the
DL since April 11 with a strained right elbow. He is 0-for-4,
having appeared exclusively as a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres had anticipated sending rookie right-hander Rodrigo
Lopez back to Triple-A Las Vegas to make room for Magadan, but now
he'll stay up.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez was brilliant in his major league debut Saturday night,
holding the Braves to four hits and one run in seven innings. He
left with a 4-1 lead, but the bullpen allowed the Braves to tie it
in the eighth on Andres Galarraga's three-run homer. Atlanta won
7-4 on Andruw Jones' three-run homer in the 12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Lopez had been called up to start in place of
Brian Boehringer, who's on the DL with a strained right shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Brush fires wreak havoc in N.J.  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- High winds fanned brush fires in northern,
central and southern New Jersey Sunday, snarling traffic, halting
rail and bus service, and threatening several homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious of about 16 fires statewide occurred at about
1:30 p.m. in Jersey City near the Conrail yards, where a
three-alarm fire quickly spread to dry vegetation and jumped the NJ
Transit railroad tracks, forcing them to be shut down for more than
four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The fire also forced the closure of busy routes 1 and 9 in the
area, and spread to a nearby lumber yard and a bus company, both of
which were fully engulfed in flames by late afternoon, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze burned about three square miles, and threatened
businesses on heavily traveled Tonnelle Avenue, Police Sgt. Edgar
Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, a water main break in the area shortly
after the fire began made it difficult to get enough water to the
blaze, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got real low pressure because of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters using long relay teams of pumper trucks and hoses
struggled to pump water from hydrants to the remote area in the
Hudson County meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, but firefighters said they
anticipated a prolonged operation, with heavy smoke expected for
about 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fire burned right through the railroad tracks, and once
they go, they burn for hours,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters from several surrounding communities also were
called in to help battle the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The fire forced the suspension of service on NJ Transit's main
Bergen County line until 5:45 p.m., and delayed bus service into
Manhattan by about an hour and a half, spokeswoman Kelly Stewart
Maer said. NJ Transit replaced train service with buses between
Harmon Cove and Hoboken, and honored train tickets on the buses.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, a large forest fire broke out in
Millville, Cumberland County, where more than 350 acres of the
Peaslee Wildlife Management Area were ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   As of 7:30 p.m., firefighters still had not contained the blaze,
which had shifted direction several times with changing winds, said
Bert Plante, the state Forest Fire Service's assistant warden.
</P>
<P>
   But he said winds had died down considerably, and firefighters
hoped to declare the fire under control by about 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time the winds shifts to the north, it shifts it toward
route 49, and there's numerous houses and businesses there, so
there's great concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 firefighters from the forest fire service and 11
volunteer fire companies battled the fire from the ground, while a
helicopter and three airplanes dropped water on it from above.
</P>
<P>
   The fire jumped Estell Manor Road several times, but crews were
able to keep it away from buildings, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Observation towers measured northwest winds in the area at about
30 m.p.h., with higher gusts. Coupled with low humidity of less
than 30 percent, conditions were ideal for brush and forest fires,
Plante said.
</P>
<P>
   At about 3:30 p.m., a fire broke out in a salt marsh area in Old
Bridge, Middlesex County, Plante said. The fire, in the area of
Joseph Court, was near the scene of a similar fire Saturday that
burned 30 acres of marshland in Sayreville, Plante said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reeds that grow along Raritan Bay dry out and get very
flammable, and that makes it very difficult once they catch fire,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another brush fire broke out along the Garden State Parkway near
Exit 100 in Tinton Falls at about 8 p.m. Firefighters from Tinton
Falls, Wall Township and Neptune responded and had it extinguished
within an hour.

<HEADLINE> Kings 99, Lakers 91  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal lost his shooting
touch. Kobe Bryant was slowed by foul trouble. And, suddenly, the
mighty Los Angeles Lakers were not invincible.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber had 29 points and the Sacramento bench finally came
alive, sparking an 18-4 run in the fourth quarter, as the Kings
defeated the Lakers 99-91 Sunday to stay alive in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won the first two games by comfortable margins in Los
Angeles. Game 4 in the best-of-five series is Tuesday night at
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 21 points and 17 rebounds, but went 8-for-22 from the
field and 5-for-14 from the foul line. Bryant, who picked up his
fourth foul early in the third period, had 16 of his 35 points in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Stojakovic had 19 points and Tony Delk added 11 as the
Kings' self-proclaimed ''Bench Mob,'' which had little success in
the first two games of the series, outscored the Lakers' reserves
34-11.
</P>
<P>
   Delk played most of the fourth quarter instead of Jason
Williams, who scored 10 points but made several poor passes early
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings still face a harrowing task as they try to upset the
best team in the NBA this season. Only 12 teams have rallied to win
a series after trailing 2-0, and none since the Houston Rockets in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario is familiar for the Lakers. In each of the previous
three seasons, Los Angeles has won the first two games of its
first-round series, then lost Game 3 and wrapped up the series in
four games.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento opened the fourth quarter with a 7-1 run, taking its
first lead of the game on a 3-pointer by Stojakovic with 9:43
remaining after Delk twice kept the possession alive with offensive
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's dunk and two baskets by Bryant gave Los Angeles a 78-73
lead, but the Kings replied with a 14-0 run that included another
3-pointer by Stojakovic, a windmill dunk by Webber and Vlade
Divac's block of a layup by O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   After Glen Rice scored for Los Angeles to end the run, Delk and
Webber scored baskets to give Sacramento a 91-80 lead with 3:18
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 51-46 at halftime, the Lakers used a 9-0 run -- including
a 360-degree spinning layup by Bryant and Rice's 3-pointer -- to
take a 64-54 lead early in the third period. The Kings pulled
within a point late in the period, but trailed 71-66 going into the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings missed 11 of their first 13 shots and fell behind 15-7
midway through the first period. A three-point play by Rice gave
the Lakers a 27-17 lead late in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings hit eight of their next 11 shots, responding with a
13-3 run and tying the game at 30-30 on a jumper by Stojakovic, but
the Lakers answered with a 9-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   A three-point play by O'Neal, following a turnover by Williams
on an errant behind-the-back pass, made it 44-36. The Lakers, led
by O'Neal's 15 points and 12 rebounds, held a five-point halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Kings assistant coach Pete Carril was resting comfortably
in a hospital Sunday, recovering from a minor heart attack a day
earlier. ... Sacramento reserve forward Tyrone Corbin sprained his
left knee while colliding with teammate Jon Barry in the second
quarter and did not return. ... The Kings improved to 3-8 on NBC
this season and postseason.

31 Former Chechen Rebels Released
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia (AP) -- Russia released 31 former rebels from a prison
camp in Northern Chechnya Sunday as part of its efforts to win wider support in
the republic, an official said. The releases fell under an amnesty order that
said rebels not found guilty of serious crimes would be freed if they gave up
their weapons. The government has issued several such orders in recent months.
The release Sunday was the first reported large-scale freeing of prisoners, and
indicated a switch in tactics in the Russians' attempt to gain some public
backing in Chechnya.

plea by President Clinton's for a federal act to reduce hate crimes. President
Clinton spoke via videotape to what was the first gay rights march on Washington

   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- In a rare intervention, police arrested the leader

officials said Sunday, but squatters staged other attacks elsewhere. In a sign
the often violent takeovers of 1,000 white-owned farms might ease, a national
leader of the squatters said he would travel around the country to cool the
standoff and ensure that planting could begin within three days. The leader,
Chenjerai Hunzvi -- who heads a group of independence war veterans who have

Friday they had reached an agreement that would stop violence and allow farming

Policy, said AIDS has become such an epidemic that, in years to come, it

Majority Leader Trent Lott, in an appearance earlier in the day, said he does

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Jerry Izenberg, a sports columnist for The
Star-Ledger of Newark, has been selected to receive the Red Smith
Award for sports journalism from former winners and past presidents
of the Associated Press Sports Editors.
</P>
<P>
   Izenberg, 69, also will be inducted into the National
Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what's so nice about it?'' Izenberg said. ''It's nice
to get them both in the same year. This means a tremendous amount
to me.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it came to the English language, Red probably more than
anyone else gave the world an education it didn't deserve,'' he
said. ''He taught me simply by reading him that every word ought to
be measured, every word ought to have a purpose. A little bit of
that rubbed off on me by osmosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous winners of the Red Smith Award, presented every year
since 1981, include sportswriting greats such as Jim Murray,
Shirley Povich, Furman Bisher, Dave Anderson and Bud Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Izenberg will accept the award at the annual Red Smith luncheon
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Izenberg, a graduate of Rutgers-Newark, has written nine books,
more than 500 magazine articles and helped produce 35 television
documentaries. He also is president of Newark Project Pride, a

<HEADLINE> Buffett Dismisses Health Rumors  </HEADLINE>
By JOE RUFF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said
Sunday he is in fine health and nothing happened that should have
triggered rumors earlier this year that he was seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about Buffett's health were circulated on Internet chat
rooms in February, including postings that he had been admitted to
an Omaha hospital.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Berkshire Hathaway, issued a statement that month
saying all rumors about Buffett's health were ''100 percent
false.'' A company spokesman at the time declined to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Sunday, the 69-year-old Buffett said he did
not know how the stories got started, but they irritated him
because his company does not like to respond to rumors about
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't like to be put in a position where what any idiot
can put on the Internet determines our corporate policy,'' Buffett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors about his health grew until they could not be ignored,
Buffett said. ''I really wanted to see it end before I got
buried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett said he rarely gets sick and he has been hospitalized
twice since he was 9 years old. He said the hospitalizations
happened some time ago and they were not serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last year, I can't remember a cold,'' Buffett said.
</P>
<P>
   In the annual report Berkshire issued in March, Buffett said two
positions would be created in the event of his death: one to handle
investments and the other for operations. Buffett said he had two
people in mind to fill those posts, and both work for Berkshire.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett answered questions for nearly three hours Sunday, one
day after answering five hours of queries from stockholders at
Berkshire's annual meeting. He later threw out the first pitch at

<HEADLINE> Orthodox Christians Celebrate Easter  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Orthodox Christians across the world
observed their Easter Sunday with signs of reconciliation between
Greece and Turkey, calls for peace in Kosovo, and a service in the
remains of a church destroyed by war in Chechnya's capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs celebrated in an unusually joyful mood in a 16th-century
monastery outside the Kosovar capital, Pristina, where U.N. chief
administrator Bernard Kouchner joined worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a day when we should think about reconciliation,''
Kouchner said, referring to the need to end hostilities, now mostly
directed against ethnic Serbs, that have plagued the region even
after the arrival of international peacekeepers and the U.N.
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner cracked eggs according to an old custom with a crowd of
Serbs after the service.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Kosovo, Easter 2000 was a stark reminder of what
warfare and its consequences have done to the Serbian province. At
the 13th century monastery in Pec, a town 45 miles west of
Pristina, just 50 people, including 10 Serbs from surrounding
villages and Italian peacekeepers, attended the service.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was terribly sad,'' said Jovan Culibrk, a monk from the
adjoining republic of Montenegro, ''like having an empty cathedral
in Canterbury.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally hundreds would have attended, but the area's Serbian
population has almost entirely fled, fearing revenge attacks from
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In Montenegro, political divisions split the Orthodox faithful,
who attended two separate Easter services, held in Podgorica by the
rival Serbian Orthodox and Montenegrin Orthodox churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Orthodox Church traditionally covers both Serbia and
Montenegro, the two republics that make up what is left of the
Yugoslav federation. Orthodox faithful who support breaking the
political tie with Serbia have rallied to the Montenegrin church.
</P>
<P>
   A clear sign of reconciliation was seen in Istanbul, where a
larger than usual crowd of Greeks -- attracted by the recent warming
in relations between traditional rivals Greece and Turkey -- came to
hear Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I proclaim the resurrection
of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Bus-loads of Greeks filled the patriarchate on the shore of
Istanbul's Golden Horn, and joined in a candlelit procession led by
Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the world's 200 million
Orthodox Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone calls us brothers. They are very friendly,'' said
Katerina Despotidou from the Greek town of Naoussa, who was making
her first visit to Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Easter, celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, is
observed by the world's 200 million Orthodox on Sunday. Roman
Catholics and Protestants celebrated Easter last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, families gathered on sidewalks and in parks to eat
the traditional Easter meal of roast lamb. The leader of Greece's
Orthodox Church, Archbishop Christodoulos, said Easter gave Greeks
an opportunity to renew their faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''The resurrection is not a subject of scientific
investigation,'' he declared. ''It is lived through faith built on
the individual's relationship with Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cyprus -- where divisions between Greeks and Muslim Turks
remain raw -- political and religious leaders called for the
reunification of the divided island.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of Chechnya's devastated capital, Grozny, about 100
people gathered in the remains of a church destroyed in fighting
with Russia that began in 1994, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Priests conducting the service came from outside Grozny. The
church's leaders had been either kidnapped or killed during the
conflict and several years of lawlessness in the breakaway Russian
republic, ITAR-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin attended services in St.
Petersburg in the morning, then flew to the Black Sea resort of
Sochi to celebrate Monday's May Day holiday, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Christianity has seen a major revival in Russia since
the 1991 Soviet collapse. Attending church services on major
holidays like Easter and Christmas has also become a ritual for
many Russian leaders.

<HEADLINE> Several Tornadoes Strike Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELBERT, Texas (AP) -- At least three tornadoes touched down
Sunday in west Texas, including one that flattened a cotton gin,
barns, several businesses and mobile homes here.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths were immediately reported in the town of 150 people,
which is about 50 miles southwest of Wichita Falls, said Tina
Kavecki, a dispatcher with the Throckmorton County Sheriff's
Office. The tornado hit around 5:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of tornadoes in Young County, one south
of Olney and another near South Bend. There were no immediate
reports of death or damage from those tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy weather formed along the leading edge of a warm front
that pushed eastward through the state. Along with the tornadoes,
the storms dropped golf ball- to tennis ball-sized hail.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, a wave of storms brought heavy rains to the
southwestern and central parts of the state Sunday. Emergency crews
responded to reports of stranded motorists in Oklahoma City and
house fires started by lightening.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Remembered in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
By CADONNA M. PEYTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ester Wilhelm Tepper watched as her mother
and brother were executed at a concentration camp in Poland during
World War II. But she is not bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sad but I am proud,'' Tepper said Sunday. She was among
the thousand who gathered at Pan Pacific Park to honor the six
million Jews killed during the Holocaust. ''I survived. Hitler did
not kill all the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, who proclaimed April 30 through May 7 as ''Days
of Remembrance,'' was at the ceremony along with former U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane J. Kirkpatrick and state
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our mission is simple,'' Davis said. ''It is to remember and
make sure nothing as atrocious or horrible ever happens on the face
of this earth again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tepper, 68, of Beverly Hills, proudly labels herself as a
Holocaust survivor. She was 7 years old when she saw her mother and
14-year-old brother shot to death by guards at the camp in the
Polish city of Radomsko.
</P>
<P>
   Left alone, she was forced to pose as a Christian in order to
avoid execution.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a miracle I survived,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A miracle indeed, said 77-year-old Ella Buchinger.
</P>
<P>
   It was June 1944 when Buchinger, then 21, was taken to a camp in
Germany with three of her sisters. She worked in an ammunitions
factory as slave labor, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She was released after 10 months but never saw her parents or
sisters again.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said stories like those need to be told and remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 20th century has passed and soon much, if not all, of the
living memories will pass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was held near the Los Angeles Holocaust Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The monument, dedicated in 1992, is the only memorial of its
kind in Southern California. It features six 18-foot columns of
polished black granite, surrounded by walls with the names of some
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Atop each of the triangular columns, a ''Flame of Memory'' was
lit. They were to burn for 24 hours in remembrance of Yom Hashoah,
the international day to remember the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only by remembering can we deal with the horrible crimes and
make sure they never are repeated,'' Kirkpatrick said.

<HEADLINE> Uranium Plant Records Said Erased  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The operators of uranium processing
plants in Paducah and Piketon, Ohio, erased hundreds of safety and
environmental problems from computer records without proper
government approval, a newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy had required plant operators to track
their progress toward correcting problems, but more than one-fourth
of such records at both plants were deleted without DOE clearance
in 1993, according to documents obtained by The Courier-Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, after a three-year investigation,
reconstructed the erased items from computer archives and paper
records and concluded the deletions were inappropriate. DOE also
found that nearly half the problems either had not been fixed or
should have been referred to other agencies before being erased.
</P>
<P>
   The erased items included government and operator findings of a
lax attitude toward safety by first-line supervisors, inconsistent
investigations of accidents, health and safety violations by both
management and rank-and-file workers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Enrichment Corp., which now leases and
operates both plants, was ordered to fix some of the remaining
uncorrected problems, but it was not fined, nor were the plants
shut down at any time, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is investigating the erasures as part of
its broader probe into allegations of fraud by contractors at the
Paducah plant.
</P>
<P>
   USEC spokeswoman Elizabeth Stuckle said that while the safety
items were ''deleted from the tracking system,'' they were ''never
deleted from existence.''
</P>
<P>
   In memos to the Energy Department, USEC also has said it had the
right to erase certain items without permission and that the
findings it deleted did not have a significant impact on the
plants' safety.

AIDS Threat Designation Defended
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In An effort to gain more attention and funding for the
disease, Clinton administration officials defended their decision to classify
AIDS as a threat to national security. Sandy Thurman, director of the White
House Office of National AIDS Policy, said AIDS has become such an epidemic
that, in years to come, it threatens to destabilize nations and the economies of
whole continents. The White House is creating an interagency working group. The
Clinton administration has designated about $325 million to fighting the disease
worldwide this year, most of it going to Africa.

<HEADLINE> Attempt To Save Dolphin Fails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAGNOLIA SPRINGS, Ala. (AP) -- A wayward bottlenose dolphin died
before a team of 25 marine biology experts and volunteers could
continue their attempts to return it to salt water and save its
life, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The male mammal, nicknamed Finnegan by wildlife experts, had
delighted boaters and those living on the Magnolia River since
January, gobbling up fish tossed in by people.
</P>
<P>
   It was found dead Saturday on the south shore of the river,
surprising experts who had seen it frolicking a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no idea this thing was this close to death,'' said
Gerald Regan, a biologist at Mobile's Spring Hill College and
coordinator of the Alabama chapter of the Marine Mammal Stranding
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe Finnegan likely followed freshwater fish or
another dolphin eight miles up the river from Weeks Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But the dolphin wouldn't go back under the Magnolia River
Bridge, perhaps seeing its support pilings as a barrier, said Bob
McCormack, interpretive coordinator at Weeks Bay National Estuarine
Research Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Hoggard, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries
Service in Pascagoula, Miss., had urged the public to stop playing
with the dolphin and feeding it. ''That's part of the reason why
it's staying up here.''

<HEADLINE> Former Danish Prime Minister Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Poul Hartling, Denmark's former prime
minister who later became U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and
received the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the organization,
died Sunday, Danish radio reported. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling became high commissioner in 1978 and held the
Geneva-based office during two consecutive periods to 1985. During
his terms, he dealt mainly with refugees from Vietnam, Ethiopia and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, UNHCR won the Nobel Peace Prize and Hartling made the
trip to Oslo, Norway, to receive the award.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling, a Lutheran priest, also received Pakistan's Nishan
award in recognition of his efforts to mobilize humanitarian
assistance for the Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling was a Liberal Party foreign minister from 1968 to 1971,
then he became prime minister in a minority Cabinet in 1973 after
general elections. Following that vote, the number of parties in
parliament doubled to 10 after the main parties split, leading to a
period with political turmoil, weak minority governments and
frequent elections.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time came the three-fold hike in world oil
prices, and Denmark's economic situation grew worse throughout
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Early elections were held in 1975 which Hartling's Liberal Party
won, but he was not able to form a new government because of a
fragmented parliament. His government was dismissed and then
replaced by a Social Democratic Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling, who later described his time as prime minister as
''horrible,'' quit Danish politics in 1978 to head the UNHCR
office.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Copenhagen in 1914, he studied theology at the
University of Copenhagen and graduated in 1939. He was a practicing
Lutheran priest in the Danish capital from 1945 to 1955. He was
first elected to the Danish parliament in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Hartling wrote several books on Danish politics and on the
Lutheran church in Denmark. He also wrote about working for the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Hartling married physician Elsebeth Kirkemann with whom
he had four children.

<HEADLINE> Archbishop of Canterbury in Sudan  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMED OSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- The spiritual leader of Anglican
Christians preached for peace Sunday during a visit to southern
Sudan to swear in a new archbishop for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey spoke at the enthronement
of the Anglican Archbishop of Sudan, the Most Rev. Joseph Marona.
Filling the post was delayed for two years by Sudan's civil war in
which Christians and animists are fighting the Muslim-dominated
government for more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe there is any reason either here in Sudan or
anywhere else in the world for Christians and Muslims to commit
violence against one another,'' Carey said in his sermon in the
southern city of Juba, according to a statement released by his
office.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2 million people have died in fighting and
accompanying famines since rebels in the south took up arms in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is every reason to hold one another's faith in the
deepest respect, and even more reason to discover common ground
upon which together you can contribute to the peace process here,''
Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suffering, the poverty, the effects of war do not
differentiate between religions. All the people of this beautiful
country are suffering and all deserve peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Gada Zakharia, governor of Equatoria province of which
Juba is the capital, welcomed Carey's visit, telling The Associated
Press by telephone that ''it shows an achievement for peace from
inside Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey flew to Juba, 550 miles south of Khartoum, from Khartoum
earlier Sunday. He is on a four-day visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he discussed the effects of the war with senior
Sudanese officials. He also toured a camp on Khartoum's outskirts
for war refugees, where he led a brief prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Lambeth Palace, the archbishop's office, said earlier that Carey
is carrying a strong message of support and encouragement for the
minority Christians who form 16 percent of Sudan's 29 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   It is Carey's third visit to Sudan since he became head of the
Anglican church in 1991. On previous visits Carey had condemned
discrimination against Sudan's Christian communities.

<HEADLINE> New Vietnam Marks War's End  </HEADLINE>
By DENIS D. GRAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) -- Vietnam celebrated its stunning
victory over the world's No. 1 superpower 25 years ago with a
remarkably unwarlike parade Sunday and hopes it can battle its way
out of poverty in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Aging architects of that victory over the United States and its
South Vietnamese allies saluted as thousands of soldiers, students,
women in flowing ao dais -- the traditional tunic and trousers -- and
barefooted mountain tribespeople filed past on the grounds of the
Reunification Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The day belonged to a man who died three decades ago,
independence hero Ho Chi Minh, whose three-story portrait hung from
the palace facade. But the mood was more akin to a springtime
festival than a remembrance of war.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest weapons to be seen were assault rifles, and most
units marched without them. Patriotic songs like ''Uncle Ho Lives
in the Great Victory Day,'' alternated with lilting, dance-like
numbers during the 1{-hour parade.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vietnam looks back to the future,'' a headline in the official
English-language Vietnam News said.
</P>
<P>
   Also marking the anniversary were the release of more than
12,000 prisoners, including convicted murderers, in the country's
biggest-ever amnesty and a mass wedding of 25 couples at a downtown
park.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's only speech, Ho Chi Minh City mayor Vo Viet Thanh
focused on economic problems in Vietnam, among the world's poorest
nations with an average yearly per capita income of $370.
</P>
<P>
   A higher economic growth rate, elimination of corruption and
less restrictive policies, Thanh said, were among the city's goals
in the 21st century. He stressed that ''every favorable condition''
would be afforded foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   With some 20,000 people gathered on the palace grounds, Thanh
recalled the war that ended April 30, 1975, when tanks 390 and 843
smashed through the gates of what was then known as Independence
Palace and communist soldiers hoisted their flag atop the building.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of the city, then called Saigon, was the last act of a
tragic drama which saw two halves of the country, South and North
Vietnam, locked in fratricidal combat and the unleashing of
American war technology on a rural society.
</P>
<P>
   ''For what Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh City can enjoy today, the
entire nation has paid 30 years of continuous fighting, the loss of
millions of human lives and the loss of the most beloved members of
millions of families,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy because on this day our country was
reunified,'' said Huynh Ngoc Thi, a lovely 25-year-old woman
dressed in a jungle-green uniform who rode atop a replica of tank
843. Her grandfather died fighting the French colonialists, said
the recreation park employee, but like more than half of Vietnam's
76 million people, she was born after 1975 and has no memory of
war.
</P>
<P>
   However, many on the palace grounds did. They included uniformed
veterans with rows of medals jangling on their chests and members
of a wartime women's underground unit. Now wrinkled and
gray-haired, some of those in attendance said they spent years of
their youth in South Vietnamese prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dignitaries on the reviewing stand were 88-year-old
Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, dubbed the ''Red Napoleon,'' who successfully
led North Vietnamese forces against both the French and Americans,
and Gen. Van Tien Dung, commander of the final offensive against
South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Bai Thi Lien, a 45-year-old woman who served in an engineering
unit on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, came several hundred miles to be at
the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have seen many changes over the last 25 years. There have
been many difficulties. But things are getting better and better,''
she said. Lien spent three years on the trail, a communist lifeline
that funneled troops and supplies from North Vietnam to
battlefields in the south.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on Vietnam's foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty has been considerably reduced, the once-famine prone
country is now one of the world's top rice exporters and its
relative isolation from the world's financial and economic systems
served as a shield from the worst of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But basic reforms have been slow, corruption is rife and foreign
investment has dropped dramatically with many companies fed up by
ever-changing, largely unfavorable regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Along with just Laos, China, North Korea and Cuba, Vietnam
clings to a one-party communist rule which allows little dissent or
public participation in decision-making -- something reflected in
Sunday's celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a people's parade, with the palace grounds
off-limits to the general public and the surrounding streets
cordoned off by police. Only a scattering of Vietnamese and foreign
tourists were allowed through the security barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found many things familiar to us from the old East
Germany,'' said Ischlar Smolny, a young German tourist from what
was once East Berlin. ''Like there, 90 percent of this ceremony was
for and by the government.''
</P>
<P>
   But her companion, Christel Thoms, added: ''The atmosphere here
is much lighter and very friendly. There it was hard. People were
not even allowed to smile.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Expected To Endorse Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said Sunday he will endorse
George W. Bush even if they don't agree on campaign finance reform,
as he expects, when they meet next week.
</P>
<P>
   Overhauling federal campaign finance laws was the signature
issue of McCain's now suspended campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination. Bush opposes some proposed reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said that discord would not preclude an endorsement
of Bush, the all-but-declared GOP presidential nominee, since the
two agree on other areas in need of change, including Social
Security, the military, education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on CBS's ''Face the Nation'' whether he can
''enthusiastically endorse'' the Texas governor absent an agreement
on campaign finance reform, McCain, R-Ariz., said he could.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I didn't, I would be litmus testing him, and I don't think
that's appropriate for me to do,'' McCain said. ''But I believe he
has begun to and is continuing to pursue a reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The May 9 meeting in Pittsburgh between the two former rivals
was nearly scrapped last week in a dispute over the agenda. McCain
also was miffed that Bush planned to ask him whether he would
consider running as vice president. McCain repeatedly has said he
doesn't want the job.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on three Sunday talk shows, McCain said he has asked
to be left off the list of possible vice presidential candidates
being drawn up by former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who is
spearheading Bush's search for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also appeared on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' which originated
from a library at the vice president's official residence because
of a live interview with Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore asked to speak with McCain after the senator's taping and
they discussed campaign finance reform and foreign affairs as they
walked the grounds of the Naval Observatory, said McCain spokesman
Todd Harris.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Consumer Privacy Boost  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   YPSILANTI, Mich. (AP) -- American consumers run too many risks as
they unwittingly divulge growing amounts of personal and financial
information, President Clinton said Sunday as he proposed reforms
in the way banks, insurers and other corporations share information
about their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one should have to worry that the results of their latest
physical exam could deny them a home mortgage or a credit card,''
Clinton said during a commencement address at Eastern Michigan
University.
</P>
<P>
   ''A bank is not just a bank,'' in today's fast-changing
financial services industry, Clinton said. There are downsides to
the interconnected web of corporations and services that make many
daily tasks easier for many consumers, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this information age we can't let new opportunities erode
old, fundamental rights,'' Clinton said. ''We can't let
breakthroughs in technology break down the walls of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would, in many cases, require a company to tell
customers it was going to share sensitive consumer information such
as medical and insurance records, or lists of what people buy and
where they buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would also give consumers the option not to have that
information shared, and give consumers a new right to review their
credit reports for errors.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which stands little chance of passage in Congress this
election year, includes protections Clinton supported in the past
and which he said were lacking in banking reforms passed last year
after more than a decade of wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   The banking law, which Clinton signed in November, makes it
easier for financial firms to merge and use economies of scale to
lower costs on products such as checking accounts, insurance
policies and brokerage services.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including much of the financial services industry
and some congressional Republicans, say Clinton's new proposal
undermines last year's legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said adding additional consumer controls would prevent
securities, banking and insurance firms from creating less
expensive financial services for customers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House labeled the new proposals a Clinton-Gore plan,
and the vice president hopes to make a campaign issue of further
consumer protection in the fast-changing world of financial
information. GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush has not taken
a position on the Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls chart a growing concern among Americans
that they must divulge too much information to too many anonymous
institutions. At the same time, Americans are eagerly using the new
kinds of services that many of those institutions offer, such as
buying and banking online.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to more than 1,300 graduates at Eastern Michigan,
a public university just outside Detroit. Clinton plans two more
commencements addresses this spring, his last as president.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, Clinton was the headliner at a fund-raising dinner
for the Detroit-area National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. The event, which organizers said drew about 9,000
people, also honored Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., for his civil
rights work and legislative career.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton ticked off a list of accomplishments
during his administration, such as lower crime rates and the
booming economy, and called on Congress to pass gun control
legislation and vote on his languishing judicial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The president was particularly pointed in criticizing the Senate
for delaying the judicial votes, including some who have waited for
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to appointing judges, the United States Senate
is not doing what it ought to be doing, especially when it comes to
women and minority appointees,'' Clinton said. ''Vote them up or
down. Let us know how you stand.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Releases 31 Former Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VLADIKAVKAZ, Russia (AP) -- Russia released 31 former rebels from
a detention camp in northern Chechnya on Sunday as part of its
efforts to win wider popular support in the republic, an official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The releases fell under an amnesty order that said rebels not
found guilty of serious crimes would be freed if they gave up their
weapons. The government has issued several such orders in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goodwill action has a favorable influence on the general
situation in Chechnya and eases the social situation,'' said
Russia's prosecutor general in Chechnya, Vladimir Kravchenko,
according to ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a young man understands his mistake and returns to his
family, the family and other people think that the authorities are
humane and just.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has rounded up hundreds of rebels and other
suspects, confining them in interrogation centers where there have
been accusations of widespread brutality and mistreatment by
guards.
</P>
<P>
   The release Sunday was the first reported large-scale freeing of
prisoners, and indicated a switch in tactics in the Russians'
attempt to win some public backing in Chechnya. Kravchenko said 105
rebels had been set free under the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have never reported how many people have been
arrested since federal forces moved into Chechnya in the fall, but
reports suggest hundreds have been rounded up.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the military has stepped up its bombing
campaign in southern Chechnya, where most of the rebels are
concentrated. Su-24 bombers and Su-25 attack jets had flown 24
combat missions since Saturday, the military command's service
said. Mi-24 helicopter gunships made more than 40 flights to
provide air cover for ground troops, the service told the Interfax
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The press service said the airstrikes were also aimed at rebel
groups near the Georgian border in the south and along the border
with the Russian republic of Dagestan in the east of Chechnya.
Russian leaders have claimed several times that the rebels are
planning to push across those borders.
</P>
<P>
   The press service claimed that 50 insurgents had been killed in
the raids and that 12 rebel strongholds were destroyed. There was
no way to verify the reports; both sides have repeatedly
exaggerated claims.
</P>
<P>
   Militants attacked several Russian police stations and
checkpoints overnight, ITAR-Tass said. A spokesman at the Russian
Interior Ministry for Chechnya said rebel attacks were becoming
more frequent to test the Russian forces' reaction before the May
Day holiday Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya following weeks of
airstrikes in September, after Chechnya-based Islamic militants
invaded neighboring Dagestan in August. The rebels also are blamed
in a series of apartment bombings in Russia that killed about 300
people in September.

<HEADLINE> Stars 1, Sharks 0  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Ed Belfour is proving that his phenomenal
goaltending in last year's playoffs was no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour posted his second straight shutout and third this
postseason, making a first-period goal by Mike Modano hold up as
the Dallas Stars beat the San Jose Sharks 1-0 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour was at his best in the final minute when a power play
and an empty net gave San Jose a 6-on-4 skating advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 10 seconds, he made a kick save up close and snared
a long shot by Gary Suter with his glove, bringing 17,001 fans to
their feet with chants of ''Ed-die! Ed-die!'' He kicked away
another Suter shot with 17 seconds left, then the Sharks' last two
attempts went wide of the goal. Belfour will carry a scoreless
streak of 138 minutes, 53 seconds into Game 3 of the best-of-seven
series Tuesday night at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks' scoring drought can be traced to the injuries
hampering leading scorer Owen Nolan. Problems with his foot and-or
shoulder kept him out of this game and made him ineffective in the
opening 4-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   How important is he? Nolan scored 20 percent of San Jose's goals
in the regular season, then upped that to 30 percent (six of 20) in
the first round as the eighth-seeded Sharks upset No. 1 seed St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose won that series by splitting the first two games on the
road. This time, the Sharks go home still seeking their first goal
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has won seven straight postseason games at Reunion Arena
dating to last season. He's allowed just five goals and had four
shutouts in that span. He has 10 career playoff shutouts; these are
his first consecutive.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour made 19 saves Sunday night -- one more than in Game 1 --
but every one was crucial because Dallas couldn't get a second shot
past Steve Shields despite many good opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The puck not going in usually had more to do with Dallas missing
than Shields making a play, such as Jere Lehtinen hitting a post
and Brett Hull sticking the puck in the side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   On the goal, Shields stopped a long slap shot from Hull, but
allowed a long rebound into open ice. Modano beat two Sharks to the
puck and fired it past a diving Shields, who finished with 17
saves.
</P>
<P>
   Modano is playing at as high of a level this postseason as
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   He has a team-best four goals and points in six straight games.
Modano has been the fastest skater, even while double-shifting, and
he plays key roles on both specialty teams.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of impact Nolan usually has. He was replaced by
Alexander Korolyuk, a healthy scratch the previous three games.
Korolyuk was rarely a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The referees let both teams go full throttle. There were no
penalties called in the first period, and none late in the third
period when two skirmishes broke out on one play.

<HEADLINE> Sheppards Challenging Verdict  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS J. SHEERAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The jury verdict rejecting the claim that Dr.
Sam Sheppard was wrongfully imprisoned for killing his wife in 1954
will be challenged, the Sheppard family's lead attorney said Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, a jury unanimously rejected the wrongful
imprisonment claim filed in the case that helped inspire ''The
Fugitive'' TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ''People from all around the country have questioned this
verdict,'' said Terry Gilbert, who represented Sheppard's son, Sam
Reese Sheppard, in the unsuccessful civil lawsuit against the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said he would file a motion on Monday asking Cuyahoga
County Common Pleas Court Judge Ron Suster to set aside the verdict
or, as an alternative, grant another trial. Suster presided at the
civil trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William Mason said the Sheppard side
had gotten a fair chance to present its case and predicted the
verdict would stand. ''I think we've tried this case for the last
time,'' Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said the verdict would be challenged on several issues,
including Gilbert's claims that the jury, which deliberated three
hours, ruled too hastily, and that the complicated case should have
been heard by a judge, not a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Sheppard was bludgeoned in her bed early on July 4,
1954, at the family's suburban Bay Village home on Lake Erie. Her
son, then just 7 years old, slept through the killing in his room
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard claimed he was sleeping downstairs at the time of the
murder and awoke to his wife's cries. He ran to help her but was
knocked unconscious by a bushy-haired intruder, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard was convicted and spent 10 years in prison. The U.S.
Supreme Court overturned the verdict, ruling the trial judge failed
to shield jurors and witnesses from the crush of negative media
reports about the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard was acquitted at a retrial in 1966. He died four years
later.

<HEADLINE> Camilla Parker Bowles Snubbed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Camilla Parker Bowles, long time companion of
Prince Charles, has been left off the guest list for the Queen
Mother's 100th birthday party, the Daily Mail newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The royal family has planned a June 21 party at Windsor Castle
to jointly celebrate the birthdays of the Queen Mother, Princess
Margaret, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong support from some members of the royal family,
Queen Elizabeth II continues to hold misgivings about Parker Bowles
and the long term consequences of her relationship with Prince
Charles, according to an unnamed Buckingham Palace source quoted by
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to snub Parker Bowles has left Prince Charles
''resigned and disappointed,'' the Daily Mail added.
</P>
<P>
   A palace spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The queen and Parker Bowles have yet to meet publicly, although
Prince Charles and his mistress have repeatedly been photographed
since the two made a carefully choreographed appearance outside the
Ritz Hotel last year.
</P>
<P>
   June 21 also marks Prince William's 18th birthday, however he is
writing a school exam the following day and is not expected to
attend the celebration.

<P>
   ABOARD AIR FORCE TWO (AP) -- In his most extensive public
comments yet on his top-secret search for a running mate, Vice
President Al Gore said Sunday he is looking for someone unlike
himself and hasn't ruled out tapping a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's most unlikely, I don't want to mislead you,'' Gore said.
''But I don't completely rule it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked about the possibility during a discussion with
reporters about bipartisanship -- the campaign theme these days of
Republican rival George W. Bush -- in which Gore said, ''My natural
instincts are to reach out and create bipartisan coalitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has insisted on keeping silent about who will be No. 2 out
of deference, he's said, to the candidates who will be vetted by
former secretary of state Warren Christopher, who is heading up
Gore's search.
</P>
<P>
   But on a campaign flight from Boston to Washington, Gore, who
ventured into the press cabin to trumpet his meeting with
Republican Sen. John McCain earlier in the day, entertained an
expansive musing about what he's looking for in a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is forcing himself to get past what he called a
''natural tendency in human nature'' to seek out someone like
himself and he disagreed with grumblers in political circles who
say the pool of obvious Democratic candidates -- particularly
minorities and women -- is pretty shallow.
</P>
<P>
   ''You ask the question is the person the best person to take
over as president would that become necessary,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He discounted speculation that his choice would be affected by
who Bush selects as a running mate. The Republicans National
Convention where Bush and his running mate will be nominated comes
two weeks before the Democrats convene on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conventions are so close together that whether or not (my
choice) is announced, it will be effectively made before then,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the process, Gore said he has spoken with Christopher on
how to proceed but ''I have not given him a list of names.''
</P>
<P>
   Would McCain turn up on that list? ''He will be supporting
Bush,'' Gore replied. ''That's no surprise to anybody but that
doesn't mean he and I can't work together'' on campaign finance
reform and other issues.

   ABOARD AIR FORCE TWO (AP) -- Embarrassing moment? Al Gore's got
advice for you.

<P>
   After comedian Jay Leno aired at Saturday night's White House
Correspondents Dinner secretly filmed footage of CNN's Wolf Blitzer
dancing in the center of a circle of young women, Gore joked on

</P>
<P>
   ''When you have something bad to get out, you need to do it
quickly and, you know, face up to it, put your spin on it and get
it behind you.''
</P>

furor, Gore quipped that he would have handled the dance
differently. ''I said five months ago I would -- and at every moment
in between.''

<HEADLINE> NAACP Wants S.C. King Bill Vetoed  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The NAACP, fighting to bring the
Confederate flag down from the South Carolina Statehouse, has asked
Gov. Jim Hodges to veto a bill that would create a Martin Luther
King Jr. holiday alongside one honoring the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're against tying the two together,'' said James Gallman,
president of the state National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. ''And the people we're talking too are also against
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges plans a major ceremony Monday -- planting a tree grown
from a seedling from Selma, Ala. -- to honor the King holiday. South
Carolina was the last state in the nation to create a day for the
slain civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   Gallman had a letter delivered to Hodges on Saturday. Hodges was
not at home to receive it, Gallman said, but the two have since
talked about the NAACP's position.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges' spokesman, Morton Brilliant, said Sunday night that the
governor ''too would have preferred a clean bill'' without the
Confederate holiday attachment.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's a ''choice between all or nothing,'' Brilliant said.
''He'll take something.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislature approved the King Holiday bill in April after a
bitter fight in the Republican-controlled House. The bill failed on
its first try and was sent back to committee after lawmakers
attached amendments that protected Confederate monuments and
proclaimed the Confederate flag is not a racist symbol.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes recognition of Confederate Memorial Day
on May 10 as an official state holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the MLK debate, lawmakers have struggled with the
NAACP's call to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse
dome. The Senate has passed a bill that would set a square banner
at an existing monument on the north side of the Statehouse that
honors Confederate soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The House is set to debate a bill similar to the Senate measure.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP, which has enacted an economic boycott of the state
since Jan. 1, is against the Senate's flag proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the flag is a symbol of racism and slavery.
Supporters say it honors Southern heritage.

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young, the 38-year-old two-time
NFL MVP recovering from a series of concussions, is still trying to
decide whether to resume his football career.
</P>
<P>
   Young, speaking publicly for the first time since returning from
a six-week around-the-world honeymoon that followed his March 14
wedding to Barbara Graham, said Sunday he still wants to play but
his final decision will be based on a lot of factors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the juices flow,'' the quarterback said as he watched
the 49ers on Sunday go through the final day of their weekend
minicamp. ''But I've got to decide. It's a complex issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Young suffered a concussion Sept. 27 and missed the last 13
games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Mariucci said Young called him Saturday night and
told him he planned to stop by team headquarters for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was great to see him. I think he enjoyed being out there,
too,'' Mariucci said. ''Players were like, 'Should I ask for his
autograph or not? They had never seen Steve Young before.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he hasn't been formally cleared by team doctors, Young,
who sustained at least four concussions in three years, said he has
examined by independent doctors and passed a clinical test showing
his brain patterns are back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've done some very extensive testing outside of just
imaging. I wanted to do everything I could to make sure.
Clinically, it's been fantastic,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he wanted to come to camp to see some of his
teammates, meet new players and just get reacquainted with
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't talked to hardly anybody since I got married,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he had a conversation with general manager Bill Walsh
on Thursday and in the coming days, the two plan to meet again,
along with Mariucci and Young's agent, Leigh Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the team is in a different place and needs
leadership,'' Young said, trying to make a case for retaining a
veteran influence. ''Just being out there for half an hour, you can
see the team is devoid of veteran leadership save a couple guys.''
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 106 players attending the team's minicamp were
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has indicated the club needs a full-scale rebuilding and
that the 49ers at the very least must be prepared to go on without
Young and possibly receiver Jerry Rice, who has balked at the
salary-cap pressed team's demands that he take a pay cut. However,
Rice said on the first day of camp that he's optimistic a deal can
be worked out that's satisfactory to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Bill of all people has the opinion that he doesn't
want Jerry and I flopping around the last few years of our careers,
you know what I mean?'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   But Young said one of the things he talked to Walsh about was
the ability of Rice and himself to help educate the team's new
players on the so-called ''49ers way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''One scenario has Jerry and I kind of finishing our careers and
leading and showing really a boatload of players, if not more, what
the 49ers' mystique is all about,'' Young said. ''And helping kind
of bridge the past and the future. Otherwise, there's not a
question that this team is in a way different place than it's ever
been in my memory or anybody's memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Young declined to address the possibility of playing elsewhere --
Denver and Seattle both have been mentioned as possible
destinations should he and the 49ers go their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   He also had little to say about how he would fit in playing on
what could be a bad team again after years of success that included
a 1994 Super Bowl title.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the philosophical questions that I'm going to be
brooding over the next couple weeks, and I think with the team,''
Young said. ''What I really want to focus on in the next couple of
months is figure out a place where it's positive for both.''

AIDS Said Risk To National Security
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The director of the White House Office of National AIDS
Policy said today AIDS has become such an epidemic that, in years to come, it
threatens to destabilize nations and the economies of whole continents. The
White House, in raising the status of AIDS, is creating an interagency working
group. The Clinton administration has designated about $325 million to fighting
the disease worldwide this year, most of it going to Africa, and the president
wants an additional $100 million for fiscal 2001, officials said.

McCain Expected To Endorse Bush
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain said today he will endorse George W. Bush
even if they don't agree on campaign finance reform, as he expects, when they
meet next week. Overhauling federal campaign finance laws was the signature
issue of McCain's now suspended campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination. Bush opposes some proposed reforms. But McCain said that discord
would not preclude an endorsement of Bush, the all-but-declared GOP presidential
nominee, since the two agree on other areas in need of change, including Social
Security, the military, education and health care.

Sheppards Challenging Verdict
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The jury verdict rejecting the claim that Dr. Sam Sheppard
was wrongfully imprisoned for killing his wife in 1954 will be challenged, the
Sheppard family's lead attorney said tonight. On April 12, a jury unanimously
rejected the wrongful imprisonment claim filed in the case that helped inspire
''The Fugitive'' TV series. Gilbert said he would file a motion on Monday asking
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Ron Suster to set aside the verdict or,
as an alternative, grant another trial. Suster presided at the civil trial.
Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William Mason said the Sheppard side had gotten a
fair chance to present its case and predicted the verdict would stand.

Uranium Plant Records Said Erased
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The operators of uranium processing plants in Paducah
and Piketon, Ohio, erased hundreds of safety and environmental problems from
computer records without proper government approval, a newspaper reported today.
The Department of Energy had required plant operators to track their progress
toward correcting problems, but more than one-fourth of such records at both
plants were deleted without DOE clearance in 1993, according to documents
obtained by The Courier-Journal. The Justice Department is investigating the
erasures as part of its broader probe into allegations of fraud by contractors
at the Paducah plant.

   ELBERT, Texas (AP) -- At least three tornadoes touched down today in west
Texas, including one that flattened a cotton gin, barns, several businesses and
mobile homes here. No deaths were immediately reported in the town of 150
people, which is about 50 miles southwest of Wichita Falls, said Tina Kavecki, a
dispatcher with the Throckmorton County Sheriff's Office. The tornado hit around
5:45 p.m. There were also reports of tornadoes in Young County, one south of
Olney and another near South Bend. There were no immediate reports of death or
damage from those tornadoes.

Stars Edge Sharks 1-0
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Ed Belfour posted his second straight shutout and third this
postseason, making a first-period goal by Mike Modano hold up as the Dallas
Stars beat the San Jose Sharks 1-0 tonight. Belfour was at his best in the final
minute when a power play and an empty net gave San Jose a 6-on-4 skating
advantage. Belfour made 19 saves -- one more than in Game 1 -- but every one was
crucial because Dallas couldn't get a second shot past Steve Shields despite
many good opportunities. The Sharks' scoring drought can be traced to the
injuries hampering leading scorer Owen Nolan. Problems with his foot and-or
shoulder kept him out of this game and made him ineffective in the opening 4-0
loss.

<HEADLINE> Braves 7, Padres 4  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves tied the club record with
their 13th straight win and Tom Glavine improved to 5-0 by holding
San Diego to three hits in eight innings in a 7-4 victory Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez hit a go-ahead, two-run single to chase winless
Padres ace Sterling Hitchcock and Trenidad Hubbard hit a three-run
homer to cap the five-run eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine shook off a homer by Eric Owens leading off the fourth.
The only other hits he allowed were singles to Carlos Hernandez and
rookie Kory DeHaan. Glavine struck out eight and walked two. The
left-hander was coming off a three-hit, 1-0 win over Kevin Brown
and the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine is 8-0 in nine starts since Sept. 27. The only
no-decision in that string came in his first start of the season on
April 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves matched the team record for consecutive wins set in
1982 and matched in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 1, Andruw Jones opened the eighth by
reaching on third baseman Phil Nevin's throwing error, which drew
first baseman Ryan Klesko off the bag. Chipper Jones walked and
Brian Jordan was intentionally walked with one out to load the
bases and bring up Lopez. Lopez hit a 1-2 pitch between short and
third to give the Braves a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock (0-3) clenched his teeth and jumped up and down in
frustration. The Padres had lost each of Hitchcock's previous five
starts by one run. The left-hander allowed five runs, four earned,
on six hits in 7 1-3 innings, struck out 10 and walked five.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Almanzar came on and allowed Hubbard's first homer, to
left. It was the third straight game in which he gave up a
three-run homer. Jordan connected Friday night and Andres Galarraga
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan added an RBI single in the ninth. San Diego scored three
runs in the bottom of the inning on Klesko's two-run double and
Bret Boone's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Owens' homer ended Glavine's string of 18 consecutive scoreless
innings. Owens drove a full-count pitch an estimated 426 feet deep
into the seats in left-center field, his first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tied it in the fifth thanks to speedy 19-year-old
rookie Rafael Furcal. He singled, stole second and took third on
catcher Hernandez's throwing error, and scored on Quilvio Veras'
single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: When Braves left-handed reliever Bruce Chen jogged in from
the bullpen Saturday night, many in the crowd starting to boo,
mistaking him for John Rocker, who's also a lefty. ''I was more
focused on the hitter, just going right after these guys,'' Chen
said. ''I didn't even listen to the boos.'' Chen pitched three
innings and got the decision, and Rocker, who was booed the entire
time he was on the mound, got his fifth save. ... The Padres
completed the toughest April schedule in the big leagues, playing
16 of their 25 games against the four 1999 playoff teams. The
Padres went 9-7 against the New York Mets, Arizona Diamondbacks,
Houston Astros and the Braves.
