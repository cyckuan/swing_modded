<HEADLINE> Saints Take Trophy Winner Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The rap against Heisman Trophy winner Ricky  
Williams might have been Master P. Or, it might have been that the 
Indianapolis Colts really liked Edgerrin James better. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the reason, the leading rusher in NCAA Division I  
history was at the center of the biggest surprise in Saturday's NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams knew he wouldn't be the No. 1 pick, but never expected  
to be the second running back chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what happened, though, when the Colts went for James with  
the fourth pick, allowing the New Orleans Saints to trade away all 
their draft choices -- and a few in 2000 -- to Washington in order to 
move up and select Williams with the No. 5 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of a shock to be the second running back, but I'm  
glad to go to the New Orleans Saints,'' said a subdued Williams, 
clearly stunned the Colts passed on him. ``It's flattering to know 
the Saints made a deal like they did. Now, I hope I can justify 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colts president Bill Polian said he went with James because of  
his receiving ability, adding that possible contract problems with 
Williams' negotiator, Leland Hardy of No Limit Sports, had nothing 
to do with the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	After Williams signed with Master P earlier this year, the  
rapper gave up control of the company, and Hardy became the chief 
financial officer. No Limit Sports has no major football players as 
clients, according to Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It basically was a tie with James and Ricky Williams, but  
Edgerrin's ability in the passing game was (the difference),'' 
Polian said. ``Signability had absolutely nothing to do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But quarterback Akili Smith, a longtime friend of Williams who  
went to Cincinnati with the third overall pick, had a different 
take. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sitting next to (former coach) Marty Schottenheimer, and  
heard him say something about the owner of the Colts thought 
signing Ricky might be tough to do because of his agent Master P,'' 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the 5-foot-10 3-4, 236-pounder who ran for a record  
6,279 yards at Texas, wasn't buying the agent rap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it had anything to do with it at all,'' Williams  
said. ``I was prepared to go fourth because of the deal that the 
Colts had made. I was kind of set back a little bit, kind of thrown 
off when they took Edgerrin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the Colts traded Marshall Faulk, a three-time  
Pro Bowl running back, to the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also endured weeks of questioning about his weight -- up  
over 245 at one point -- and his appearance -- he wears dreadlocks, 
has several tattoos and a pierced tongue. He said he's relieved now 
that he knows where he'll be playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's even more relief knowing I'm going to play  
where they don't care about the way I look,'' Williams said. ``I 
can be myself and be very comfortable in New Orleans, hopefully 
thrive there, also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardy, who spent a good deal of time talking to Master P and the  
Saints via cellphone, said he believes contract negotiations will 
go smoothly. Asked about Williams being a tough sign, he said: 
``I'm not buying that at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I entered a pact with Terry O'Neil of the Saints on April 7 or  
8 that all negotiations must take place on the golf course. So I 
would say the contract situation will work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, Hardy had Williams on the cellphone talking  
with Saints coach Mike Ditka, and they were off to the airport for 
a trip to New Orleans.

<HEADLINE> Stars' Hatcher Suspended 7 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NHL suspended Dallas Stars defenseman Derian  
Hatcher for seven games on Saturday, for leaving his feet to hit 
Phoenix Coyotes center Jeremy Roenick and inflicting a multiple jaw 
fracture on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher served his first game during Saturday's 2-0 loss to  
Phoenix and will miss Sunday's game against the Avalanche in 
Colorado, as well as the Stars' first five playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher's suspension is the longest in playoff history since  
Maurice (Rocket) Richard was suspended, after punching a linesmen 
in March 1955, for the final three games of the regular season and 
the entire playoffs. New York Rangers center Adam Graves was 
suspended for four games in the 1992 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that Mr. Hatcher intended to deliver a blow to the  
head of Mr. Roenick by leaving his feet immediately prior to the 
hit,'' said Colin Campbell, the NHL's director of hockey 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``As well, the severity of the injury to Mr. Roenick was  
considered as was the fact that Mr. Hatcher has been suspended by 
the league on previous occasions, most recently last September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher was suspended for four games in September for  
cross-checking St. Louis Blues' defenseman Chris Pronger. Hatcher 
will forfeit $90,731 of his salary to the NHL players' emergency 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very severe penalty,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said  
after his team's 2-0 loss Saturday at Phoenix. ``Both teams suffer. 
We're missing our captain, our leader, one of our best players. 
Derian has to take responsibility for what he did. And we're going 
to have to work through it in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick was discharged from the hospital Saturday and met with  
reporters during the game, although his jaw was badly swollen and 
his broken right thumb bandaged from a slash by Stars defenseman 
Craig Ludwig right before Hatcher's hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say what's fair or unfair,'' Roenick said about  
Hatcher's suspension. ``My opinion is I can't play in the playoffs, 
so I don't see why he should get to play in the playoffs. That's 
why I hope they get knocked out in the first round.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Clinton Scandals Hurt Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public weariness with the Clinton  
administration's ethical problems may be hampering Vice President 
Al Gore's efforts to build support for his presidential campaign, a 
poll released Saturday suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gore campaign adviser said it was too early to gauge the  
impact of the vice president's close ties to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since September 1997, when Gore was at the  
center of a controversy about campaign fund raising, his favorable 
ratings slipped below 50 percent in the poll by the Pew Research 
Center for the People &AMP; the Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The new poll indicated 47 percent of the public has a favorable  
view of Gore, while 43 percent say their view of the Democratic 
front-runner for 2000 is unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also indicated Gore needs to gain strength among women  
and independents, two important groups in his bid for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths of all respondents questioned said they were tired  
of problems associated with the Clinton administration. Of the 
independents who said they were tired of the administration's 
problems, almost two-thirds, 63 percent, favored Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush, the Republican front-runner, over Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in New Hampshire, Gore told reporters: ``The country  
wants to move on to a discussion of the future and not dwell on the 
past. I have condemned the president's personal mistakes. He is my 
friend, but what he did was wrong. I think they understand that I 
am a different person who has been part of a team that produced an 
economic recovery and the economic progress that we have had in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course people are tired of scandals,'' said Mark Penn, a  
pollster who advises Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't ask, 'Are you tired of the Republican right  
wing?''' he said. ``Our analysis is that the vice president is 
starting out where all vice presidents start out, where (Richard) 
Nixon started out, where (George) Bush started out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn said it is too early to analyze the effects of the Clinton  
presidency on Gore's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, the Clinton factor will be positive,''  
said Penn, who also conducts polls for the president. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Clinton-Gore administration will get credit for  
producing a prosperous economy and making many other changes 
beneficial to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pew poll, women preferred Bush over Gore by a margin of  
52 percent to 42 percent. In January of 1996, Clinton led 
Republican nominee Bob Dole by almost 20 percentage points among 
women. Independents, a key swing group in the 2000 election, 
favored Bush over Gore by almost a 2-1 margin, according to the 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	When people were asked to give a one-word description of the  
vice president, the top response was ``boring.'' In a Pew poll in 
September 1996, the word mentioned most often was ``intelligent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, it's very, very early,'' said Pew survey  
director Greg Flemming. ``But Gore's got a lot of work to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was supported by 54 percent, and Gore had 41 percent.  
Former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, another Republican in 
the race, led Gore 52 percent to 42 percent. But polls taken this 
early before an election often don't forecast the eventual winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,786 adults was taken March 24-30 and has an error  
margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Medical Errors Outrage Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) -- Instead of fixing a 74-year-old man's  
heart problem, surgeons removed part of his right lung. Then they 
gave the 84-year-old with the lung problem heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's not all.  
</P>
<P>
	Eight hours later, as the misidentified patients were receiving  
post-op transfusions, the hospital staff realized their error. 
Fortunately, the patients both had the same type blood -- or else 
the transfusions might have killed them, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Few cases of medical bungling in Japan have received as much  
publicity -- or generated so much outrage -- as this one at the 
Yokohama City University Hospital earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many experts, however, say there is little being done to address  
the underlying problems: overworked doctors and a dangerously 
cavalier attitude toward the quality of care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients are treated like machine parts on a conveyer belt.  
Doctors often don't care about each patient, they don't even 
remember their faces,'' said Makoto Kondo, a radiologist at Keio 
University Hospital, one of the best medical facilities in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the botched surgeries in this city just south of Tokyo  
were revealed in January, Japan's media has focused the national 
spotlight on similar, and at times worse, mistakes around the 
country: 
</P>
<P>
	--In February, a 58-year-old housewife died after a nurse  
accidentally injected her with disinfectant instead of blood 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	--Also in February, a 61-year-old housewife went into shock after  
receiving transfusions of the wrong blood type. 
</P>
<P>
	--In March, a 7-year-old boy had to undergo an operation to  
remove part of a surgical instrument mistakenly left inside his 
skull. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say fatigue from chronic overwork contributes to such  
errors. And with advanced technology and the increasingly complex 
array of medications, a simple mistake like a wrong syringe can 
easily kill a patient. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics of the medical status quo in Japan say such problems  
would not be so bad if more was done to supervise the quality of 
doctors' performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical records, for example, are usually off-limits to  
patients. Doctors need not even renew their licenses. And rarely 
are mistakes made public -- officials at the Yokohama hospital only 
acknowledged theirs after a national newspaper reported them. 
</P>
<P>
	Shunya Ito, a member of Medio, a civil group investigating  
malpractice, said the medical community's treatment of patients 
reflects its hierarchical structure -- with patients on the lowest 
rung. 
</P>
<P>
	``We patients feel so intimidated that it's even difficult to  
ask doctors any questions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ito's 72-year-old father died six years ago at a hospital an  
hour after beginning to receive an intravenous injection containing 
potassium. Ito sued, and had medical experts saying the injection 
may have contributed to his father's death. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital denied any wrongdoing, and Ito lost the suit.  
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the medical community say hospitals are often  
too concerned with protecting their own reputations -- at times 
resorting to illegal means. 
</P>
<P>
	Shigemi Oshida, professor of forensic medicine at Nihon  
University of Medicine, said hospitals routinely destroy evidence 
of operating room foul-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japanese hospitals haven't tried to learn from mistakes,'' he  
said. ``And by covering up, they fail to share valuable lessons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the secrecy and difficulty in obtaining documents,  
victims of hospital mistakes are rarely able to take legal action. 
But according to the latest Supreme Court statistics, more are 
willing to try. Malpractice suits have nearly doubled to 2,700 in 
1998 from 1,508 cases 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shamed into action, the government has formed an investigative  
panel and is expected to announce its recommendations later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were shocked,'' said Tatsuya Aoki, an official at the  
Health and Welfare Ministry's department of health policy. ``The 
Yokohama case suggested this is a universal problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staff at the Yokohama hospital, meanwhile, are taking more care  
to clearly identify their patients and to double-check blood types 
before giving transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned an important lesson,'' said hospital spokesman  
Nobuo Uchida. ``Next time we make a mistake, there will be no 
future for our hospital.''

<HEADLINE> Rapids 2, Wizards 1, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Wolde Harris tied the game in regulation and then  
scored in the shootout to help the Colorado Rapids to a 2-1 victory 
over winless Kansas City on Saturday night in the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris converted a penalty kick in the 69th minute to tie the  
score 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado (2-2) earned the penalty kick after Wizards defender  
Uche Okafor was whistled for a handball as he deflected a cross 
that Harris was lining up for a side volley. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris was one of three Rapids to score in the shootout, while  
Colorado goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann stopped three of the Wizards' 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rapids defender Matt McKeon score the deciding goal and Joey  
DiGiamarino also converted. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Brown and Vicente Figueroa had shootout goals for Kansas  
City (0-5). 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards scored in the 30th minute when Alexi Lalas converted  
the rebound of a shot by Brown. Former Rapids midfielder Chris 
Henderson assisted on the play.

<HEADLINE> Work Begins for Oklahoma City Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The peaceful, grassy lawn has been ripped  
away, replaced by raw dirt and construction machines as crews begin 
building a permanent memorial park on the site where a bomb killed 
168 people in the Murrah Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, relatives of some of the victims will gather to  
observe the fourth anniversary of the disaster, their last such 
observance before the park is completed next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors ``can begin to see what it's going to become and how  
powerful it's going to become,'' said Kari Ferguson, spokeswoman 
for the Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation. ``I think it 
will forever draw people from around the world who want to learn 
more about that moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Kaufman visited last week, coming all the way from San  
Antonio, and said it wouldn't his last trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll come back and see it, see what the actual memorial is  
like,'' he said quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is on schedule and on budget, and should be finished  
in time for the fifth anniversary on April 19, 2000, organizers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is to make sure they never forget,'' said Ms.  
Ferguson. ``We don't need to forget the lessons we learned that day 
or the lessons we've learned every day since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A huge truck bomb blew up at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, at the  
curb right outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. A third 
of the nine-story building was blown away or collapsed into a pile 
of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, what was left of the building was torn down, and the lawn  
was planted to cover the scars until the permanent memorial could 
take its place. 
</P>
<P>
	A chain-link fence surrounding the site became a spontaneous  
memorial as visitors tied on mementos: baseball caps, key chain 
charms, hair ribbons, bracelets, small children's toys -- often just 
any object they happened to have at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``They leave their memories to be a part of it, and I guess  
that's what makes it special,'' said Stuart Earnest, who lives a 
block from the site and lost friends in the blast. ``People who 
don't have a clue share their emotions and sympathy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers periodically collect the offerings, which become part  
of a growing archive of artifacts from the bombing. Ms. Ferguson 
said about 40,000 items have been removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The fence has been moved back to make room for the construction,  
and sections of it were emptied of mementos again last week to make 
room for new offerings on Monday's anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ferguson said about $19.7 million of the estimated $29.1  
million cost of the memorial has been raised. The money will pay 
for the park, a museum that is projected to open in 2000, and 
offices for the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	A feature of the park will be the Survivor Tree, an elm that  
survived the blast and has become a symbol to survivors. To protect 
its extensive root system from the construction, volunteers 
hand-dug 100 holes for concrete piers that will support an elevated 
deck and walkway around the tree. 
</P>
<P>
	A forester also is working with construction workers.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's the best-taken care of tree in the world, I promise,''  
Ms. Ferguson said.

<HEADLINE> Andretti's Luck Still Bad in CART </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Another week, another race and the bad  
luck continues for Michael Andretti. 
</P>
<P>
	The former CART champion will start a disappointing 13th Sunday  
in the 27-car field for the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, the 
third of 20 races in the open-wheel series. 
</P>
<P>
	Making it all the more frustrating for Andretti was the fact  
that what might have been his fastest lap was aborted when 
Newman-Haas Racing teammate Christian Fittipaldi brought out a red 
flag on the tight 1.824-mile, 11-turn downtown street circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Christian's engine stopped and the red flag came out, we  
were going for it,'' said Andretti, who heads into the 85-lap race 
trailing series leader Greg Moore by eight points. ``I was pumped 
and the pressure was on since it was the last part of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have qualified in the top six and had a better shot  
at winning. I really want to keep the momentum going in our third 
race, but it's pretty tough starting 13th. We're just going to have 
to play with the hand we're dealt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first two races this season, Andretti finished second and  
fifth. But his efforts were hampered in each of those events by 
problems in the pits.

	 *GIL'S TRACK:* It's going to be a little harder for Gil de  
Ferran to have the Long Beach race wrested from his grip this year. 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran has led 177 of the past 315 laps at Long Beach and has  
lost it in a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he led 100 of 105 laps, but lost to Jimmy Vasser when  
an exhaust hose came off in the final laps. In 1997, de Ferran led 
26 laps, but an accident while running second ended his race and 
left the victory to Alex Zanardi. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanardi, now driving in Formula One, repeated after de Ferran  
overcame an early flat tire and led with 14 laps to go only to be 
sidelined by a broken transmission. 
</P>
<P>
	De Ferran, who had qualified fifth or better in each of his four  
previous starts here, came back from a poor first-day qualifying 
effort to take the seventh position on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today went much better,'' said de Ferran, whose car is the  
fastest on Goodyears and the only one on that tire in the top 18. 
``Yesterday, we were fighting for grip. But we put our heads 
together last night and managed to improve the car a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Firestone-shod cars dominating, the next fastest Goodyear  
driver was Tarso Marques, making his second start as Team Penske's 
substitute for the injured Al Unser Jr. He was 19th. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GORDON GETS IN:* After his Friday qualifying speed was  
disallowed because of a technical violation, Robby Gordon had to 
rely on Saturday's session to get into the race. No problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, driving the same Toyota-powered Reynard, ran a lap of  
104.776, good for the 21st starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this all comes down to is time ... how much quality time  
you can spend getting your car right,'' said Gordon, who became an 
owner-driver over the winter and had virtually no time to test his 
new cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially, you can call this our second day of winter  
testing because this is only the second day we've ever run this car 
on a road course,'' he said. ``Things are so incredibly competitive 
out here, it's essential that you get the most out of each and 
every session on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's definitely more left in the car. But it sure would've  
been nice to work on the things that needed working on out on the 
track today.''

<HEADLINE> Kentucky's Couch is Top Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns began the Draft of the  
Quarterbacks today by selecting Kentucky's Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, who left school after his junior season, reached a  
contract agreement with the expansion team hours before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In selecting Couch, the Browns -- awarded a franchise by the NFL  
after the original Browns moved to Baltimore -- opened what was 
expected to be a first-round run on quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch posed for photographs with Browns owner Al Lerner while,  
in a makeshift Dawg Pound in the balcony, fans dressed in Browns 
jerseys chanted ``Here we go, Brownies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He displayed so much character and poise,'' Browns president  
Carmen Policy said. ``He's such a solid human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia continued the fancy with passers by selecting  
Donovan McNabb of Syracuse. McNabb, a three-time Big East Offensive 
Player of Year, joins a team whose projected starting quarterback 
is longtime third-stringer Doug Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't meet with the approval of the Eagles fans on hand  
who wanted the team to select Ricky Williams of Texas. For much of 
the hour before the pick, they shouted, ``We Want Ricky!'' and they 
booed loudly when McNabb's name was called. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1971, the first three selections were  
quarterbacks after Cincinnati took Akili Smith of Oregon. Although 
Smith was a starter for just one college season, his arm strength 
and athletic ability impressed the Bengals, who already have four 
quarterbacks on their roster. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, the top three selections were Jim Plunkett by the  
Patriots, Archie Manning by the Saints and Dan Pastorini by the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest shock of the draft -- and the biggest surprise in  
many years -- came on the fourth selection. Indianapolis traded star 
running back Marshall Faulk to St. Louis on Thursday, seemingly 
clearing the way to take Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Colts instead went for another running back, junior  
Edgerrin James of Miami, whose spectacular performance in the 
season finale against UCLA brought him to prominence. The stunned 
crowd let out a gasp when James' name was announced by commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We liked both backs ... but basically we feel Edgerrin gives  
us a little more with what we want to do with our offense,'' Colts 
coach Jim Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams went with the next pick -- to New Orleans. The Saints,  
who previously offered all of their 1999 picks to Cleveland for the 
top overall spot to get Williams, dealt with Washington moments 
after the Colts' stunner. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Ditka, sporting a big grin and an even bigger cigar  
after selecting college football's career rushing leader, traded a 
first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh picks this year and 
a first- and third-rounder in 2000 to the Redskins to get Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the kid. He's what we really need,'' Ditka said. ``He  
gives us what Walter Payton gave us in Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great,'' Williams said. ``I was down there last week,  
and they said, `If we draft you, we can go home and hit the golf 
course.' I'm excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams, looking for a big-play receiver to go with Faulk out  
of the backfield, grabbed Torry Holt of North Carolina State. Then 
Washington jumped right back up to No. 7 overall, sending to 
Chicago the first-rounder acquired from the Saints (12th overall), 
and the third-rounder obtained from New Orleans. The Redskins also 
included their own fourth- and fifth-rounders, plus a third-round 
selection in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Redskins -- and the audience -- caught their breath,  
they selected cornerback-wide receiver-kick returner Champ Bailey 
of Georgia. Bailey was the player Washington hoped to get at the 
No. 5 overall slot, so general manager Charley Casserly showed he 
knows how to play the draft-day-trade game superbly. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was the first defensive player selected, although he is  
versatile enough to line up at wideout, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona went for a deep threat to help QB Jake Plummer, taking  
David Boston of Ohio State. Detroit grabbed Chris Claiborne of 
Southern California, rated the top linebacker. Claiborne can play 
inside and out and was the Butkus Award winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris McAlister, whose father James played in the NFL, was taken  
by Baltimore. If the cornerback starts, the Ravens could move Rod 
Woodson to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth quarterback was selected by Minnesota with the 11th  
overall pick, Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida, who had the 
largest contingent of family and friends on hand. That group roared 
when Culpepper was called. 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper joins a team that had the best record in the league  
last season but whose starting quarterback, Randall Cunningham, 
turned 36 three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears added to the quarterback run by taking left-hander  
Cade McNown of UCLA, whose arm strength has been questioned. 
McNown, who beat out Couch for the All-America team, is a winner, 
though -- several scouts have compared him to Jim McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
	That made for five quarterbacks in the first dozen picks.  
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh, desperate for a wideout, might have reached a bit in  
taking Troy Edwards of Louisiana Tech. Edwards had great numbers, 
including 21 passes 405 yards and three touchdowns vs. Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City, which took tackle Victor Riley a year ago, went for  
another offensive lineman, BYU tackle John Tait. He was the first 
blocker chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay, which was interested in both Culpepper and McNown,  
settled for defensive tackle Anthony McFarland of LSU, who will 
make a nice sidekick for Warren Sapp. 
</P>
<P>
	Another defensive player, All-American end-linebacker Jevon  
Kearse of Florida, went 16th overall to Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> Two Drown After Boat Is Swamped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOORE HAVEN, Fla. (AP) -- Two men drowned after their small  
fishing boat was swamped by the wake of passing cabin cruisers, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said none of the four people aboard the 15-foot bass  
boat were wearing life jackets during their Friday afternoon ride 
in the Caloosahatchee River, near Lake Okeechobee. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat's owner, Cleveland Burkett, 65, had taken three  
passengers out for an impromptu trip after noticing his craft was 
sitting crooked on its trailer, said Jim Huffstodt, a spokesman for 
Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The wakes from the two passing crafts threw the group into the  
river, where Burkett and passenger James Isenberg, 57, drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	Burkett's wife and Isenberg's fiancee were unhurt and were able  
to swim to shore. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple was engaged to be married on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have interviewed the captain of one of the passing  
boats but have not identified the other craft. 
</P>
<P>
	The river is part of the Intracoastal Waterway connecting Fort  
Myers to Stuart.

<HEADLINE> Utah Mulls Shooting Circumstances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A mentally ill man's shooting rampage at  
the Mormon Family History Library has left health officials, law 
enforcement and the gunman's son arguing over whether the tragedy 
could have been averted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so terrible, so shocking and it could have easily been  
prevented,'' said Alex Babarin, 48. 
</P>
<P>
	His 71-year-old father, Sergei Babarin, walked into the library  
Thursday and opened fire, killing two people and wounding four 
before police killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	While Alex Babarin said Friday that the mental health system  
should have been more attentive, Salt Lake County mental health 
officials said they did everything they legally could. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Police Chief Ruben Ortega pushed for new laws to keep  
guns out of the hands of certain mentally ill people. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is ludicrous. It's happening too much all over the  
country and innocent people are dying,'' Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief focused on loopholes in parts of the 1994 Brady bill,  
which prohibits the sale of guns to those who have been declared 
mentally incompetent. Ortega said the problem is that few of Utah's 
100,000 people diagnosed with mental illness meet a threshold 
required by law, which essentially requires a person to be a clear 
and imminent danger to himself or others. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega wants psychiatrists to be required to report to the state  
Department of Public Safety the names of people diagnosed with any 
one of a list of particular mental illnesses. Gun dealers would 
then be barred from selling to anyone on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so doable and it makes so much sense,'' Ortega said.  
``We can work out the law to give the doctors and patients 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Alex Babarin said that law wouldn't have deterred his  
paranoid father's murderous impulses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could just take a car and run people down,'' Babarin said  
</P>
<P>
	Babarin said he fought to get his father committed for nearly a  
year. Just two days before the shooting, his father accused him of 
spying and being out to get him -- the same charges he leveled 
against his wife, his neighbors, even people passing in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	But his illness went untreated because he also feared doctors  
and refused to take the medication prescribed to him, calling it 
poison. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks Sergei Babarin had said television coverage of  
the NATO attack in Kosovo reminded him of his wartime youth, and 
his son thinks that might have spurred Thursday's deadly attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been easily prevented, just by taking him for a  
few days or a few weeks at the hospital, start him taking 
medicine,'' Babarin said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Valley Mental Health center did not admit him because  
doctors there did not diagnose him with schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Stevens, Valley's clinical director, said the  
hospital could not declare him incompetent for fear of violating 
his civil rights, which demand an involuntary patient show an 
imminent threat of endangering himself or others. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was determined that Babarin would be admitted if he  
showed further signs of danger.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Elder Protection Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton outlined proposals today to  
``investigate, prosecute and punish'' people who abuse older 
Americans in nursing homes and to deny telephone service to 
telemarketers who prey on the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, which go to Congress next month, also target  
people who defraud health care plans at an annual cost to taxpayers 
of billions of dollars. The president is pushing tougher penalties 
for those who steal from pensions and retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In his weekly radio address, Clinton said violent crime is at  
its lowest level in 25 years, and ``for elderly Americans who once 
locked themselves into their homes in fear, the falling crime rate 
is a godsend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, however, ``the greatest threat that many older Americans  
face is not a criminal armed with a gun but a telemarketer armed 
with a deceptive rap. And our most defenseless seniors, those who 
are sick or disabled and living in nursing homes, cannot lock the 
door against abuse and neglect by people paid to care for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telemarketers bilk Americans of an estimated $40 billion a year,  
Clinton said, and more than half the victims of are over 50 years 
old. ``That's like a fraud tax aimed directly at senior citizens,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants to give the Justice Department authority to seek a  
court order to withdraw telephone service from any number proved to 
have been used in telemarketing fraud. Federal law now permits 
numbers to be blocked only when they are used for illegal gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	As for care of the elderly, the president is proposing prison  
sentences of up to 10 years for individuals and fines for nursing 
home chains of up to $2 million for each home where residents are 
neglected or abused. No federal criminal penalties now exist for 
such activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``When one out of four nursing homes in America does not provide  
quality care to their residents, and when people living in 
substandard nursing homes have as much fear from abuse and neglect 
as they do from the diseases of old age, we must do more,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal permits the Justice Department to seek court orders  
to stop nursing homes from mistreating patients. The plan also 
protects whistle-blowers who tell officials about wrongdoing in 
nursing homes.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Knows How Gretzky Feels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As the ambassador for the sport he still loves,  
Michael Jordan knows better than anyone what Wayne Gretzky is 
experiencing as ``The Great One'' gets ready to leave hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see that he made the choice he felt comfortable  
with. A lot of people probably wanted to see him play but only he 
knows and I understand that truly,'' Jordan said Saturday night 
before he watched, of all things, a hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months after his retirement from basketball, Jordan  
visited his old Bulls locker room for the first time. He was at the 
United Center to be interviewed about Gretzky and later to watch 
Chris Chelios, the former Blackhawks captain, return to the United 
Center for the first time with the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief but wide-ranging interview in the corridor, Jordan  
said he is still interested in purchasing part of the Charlotte 
Hornets, was not surprised that the Los Angeles Lakers released his 
former teammate Dennis Rodman and had no problem with someone using 
his old locker, which now sits empty. 
</P>
<P>
	He is an acquaintance and occasional golf partner of Gretzky.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there are challenges out there and Wayne will find  
some of those in business or whatever opportunity you may find,'' 
Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said walking back into the locker room where he once  
dressed was not a traumatic experience. But he sounded 
philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a lot of memories, but it's always a great pleasure to  
come back,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately it was not to get dressed or anything to that  
nature. I'm here to watch a hockey game, but I mean that's where my 
life is going. I'm coming back to watch other things instead of 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's old locker was boarded shut earlier in the season but  
now just sits empty. The team that still calls itself the Bulls 
struggles nearly every night just to score 70 points, a far cry 
from the one that won six NBA championships in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``People can use it (the locker), I don't have a problem with  
that, it doesn't bother me,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the past. It's a whole new era and things are going to  
happen, things are going to change. They have to rebuild and get 
themselves back to the goal that we set. We set high standards and 
it's going to be a challenge for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said he was aware that earlier this month the Bulls set  
an NBA record by scoring just 49 points, the lowest output since 
the inception of the shot clock in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was pretty ugly. I think I can do better than that,''  
said the man who scored at least 50 points in a game 38 times 
during his career. 
</P>
<P>
	On purchasing part of the Hornets, Jordan said:  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still in conversation, still evaluating the opportunity.  
There is nothing that I can report at this time. There is some 
interest. It's only just from an economical standpoint and I will 
evaluate it. Until I feel like it's appropriate for me to make an 
announcement, I won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers finally got fed up with Rodman's antics, being late  
for practices and pretty much living by his own set of rules -- as 
he often did while helping the Bulls win three titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few people can deal with Dennis. We did a good job with  
that. I don't know if there's anybody else out there that can deal 
with him,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He carries a lot of baggage.''

<HEADLINE> Smith Looks To Match Up With Couch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Sipe and Anderson. Bernie and Boomer. Couch  
and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio's pro football rivalry has a new set of bookend  
quarterbacks, and the one headed to Cincinnati is looking forward 
to it with a little vengeance at heart. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cleveland decided to make Tim Couch the top pick in the NFL  
draft Saturday, Akili Smith went to the Cincinnati Bengals with the 
third choice and immediately talked about proving the Browns wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals passed up a tempting offer from New Orleans -- all of  
the Saints' picks this year, their No. 1 picks in 2000 and 2001 and 
a second-rounder in 2002 to trade down -- because they wanted Smith 
so badly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have gone a long time here trying to solve our quarterback  
problem,'' general manager Mike Brown said. ``I am convinced that 
is our principle problem. We've got to get it resolved at some 
point on a satisfactory basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith wasn't surprised that he wound up with Cincinnati and he  
wasn't happy at how the process unfolded. He had hoped to beat out 
Couch for the No. 1 pick and didn't like how the Browns handled the 
process -- he felt they used him as leverage in negotiations with 
Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We play those guys twice a year. That's going to motivate me a  
lot,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf were scrutinized  
side-by-side as rookies, Smith and Couch can expect attention that 
will be even more intense because of their cities' proximity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be a rivalry that's going to go on for a long time  
with them being in the same division and me and him battling for 
the No. 1 pick all the way through,'' Smith said. ``We're going to 
be competing for the rest of our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals hope so. After racking up twice as many losses as  
wins in the 1990s while going through 10 quarterbacks, Brown 
decided he had to pass on the Saints' offer to get passer No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints, who chose 12th overall, called Brown on Saturday and  
made an offer so good that he fawned over it after rejecting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They offered and they offered very generously,'' Brown said.  
``It was hard to turn down, but we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no guarantee to get another quarterback at the No.  
12 spot and that was the big factor,'' coach Bruce Coslet said. 
``It was a very attractive deal. It was a hard decision to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saints coach Mike Ditka understood. The Saints eventually swung  
a deal with Washington to get running back Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how people could have turned us down,'' Ditka  
said. ``But if you've got a guy you want, no deal's good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They turned down a lot of picks for the future of the  
Cincinnati Bengals to get me,'' Smith said. ``So it becomes a 
burden on me to respond to something like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals went through four quarterbacks last season while  
finishing 3-13 for the fourth time in the '90s. Smith's arrival 
means that Neil O'Donnell's days with the Bengals are over. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown told O'Donnell he will be released as early as next week.  
Jeff Blake is the starter for now, but Smith hopes to displace him 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith doesn't lack confidence. He admires Randall Cunningham and  
John Elway and compared himself to them on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Randall a lot because of his mobility and I like John  
Elway because his release is kind of like mine,'' Smith said. ``So 
I'd like to say you put John Elway's arm on Cunningham, that's kind 
of what you're getting in me.''

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Prepares for Final Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The years flew by, the game changed, but the buildings were  
always packed for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
	So it will be one final time Sunday when Wayne Gretzky steps  
onto the ice at Madison Square Garden, a tired warrior at age 38, 
yet somehow still looking like the skinny kid who won the heart of 
one sport and two nations skating in a sweater that always seemed a 
few sizes too big. 
</P>
<P>
	The pulse of the world's most famous arena will be pounding like  
the grand old building has rocked only a few times in its storied 
history. And over the same glassy surface where he spun so much 
magic for three decades now, Gretzky will perform his grandest 
illusion. He will make himself disappear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been encouraging people to smile and be upbeat,'' he said  
Friday, already dreading the moment when he sits at his 
dressing-room stall and unlaces his skates for the last time. 
``That will be tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, it can't be any tougher than the burden Gretzky carried  
on those slim shoulders ever since he was a 10-year-old. He was 
already a legend in his native Canada by then, only 4-foot-4 and 70 
pounds, yet saddled with the knowledge that he carried the most 
elusive of gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same way that people on this side of the border would  
clamor for a glimpse of Tiger Woods two decades later, hockey fans 
lined the rinks in small towns across Ontario to see the prodigy 
who scored 378 goals in a single season for the Nedrofsky Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was driving home after a loss one day that his father tried  
to instill the lesson the son would never forget. In as soothing a 
tone as he could manage, Walter Gretzky looked over at Wayne in the 
passenger seat and said, ``You can't be like anyone else anymore. 
For you, there can never, ever be a bad game again. Every game now, 
everyone will expect a miracle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wonder of Gretzky, the quality that lifted him above his  
game and into the sporting pantheon where only names like Jordan 
and Ali and Ruth reside, is that he was equal to the task. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years that followed, he would fashion those miracles in  
the biggest moments, in the crucible of a Stanley Cup, or in the 
smallest, on a dreary winter night in a regular-season game 
rendered almost meaningless by a drawn-out schedule. He would 
fashion them in the most spectacular way imaginable, with a spin 
move that left defenders clutching at his shadow, or in the 
subtlest, by bouncing a pass to himself off the side of the net in 
one moment and then delivering the puck to the stick of an 
onrushing teammate in the next. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what the situation demanded, Gretzky found a way to  
produce them shift after shift, night after night, until they 
filled up page after page in the National Hockey League record 
book. He strung them together with such regularity that any time 
you took your eyes off him, even for just a moment, you did so at 
your own risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of him like Michael Jordan,'' said Bobby Orr,  
Gretzky's first rival for hockey's title of best-ever. ``No matter 
how many times I watched him play, he never did disappoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Echoed Gordie Howe, whom Gretzky idolized as a kid and  
supplanted as an adult. ``That's what I'll miss most. Every time 
you saw him, he came up with something astonishing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like everyone else, Howe had no problem recalling his favorite  
Gretzky moment. Some might cull theirs from among the four Stanley 
Cup series Gretzky dominated when he played in Edmonton during his 
prime, pulling the strings for hockey's most terrorizing offense 
like an aloof, master puppeteer. Others name the last game of the 
Stanley Cup final he lost to the Canadiens while playing for the 
overmatched Los Angeles Kings in 1993, when it took the entire 
Montreal team to wrest the outcome from Gretzky's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe, interestingly, settled on neither. Instead, he chose a  
memory more recent and much more concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
	``His last shift at the All-Star Game this year in Tampa,'' Howe  
said without hesitation. ``They should make a film of that and show 
it to anybody who wants to know how hockey is supposed to be 
played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, finally, may be the thing that we remember most about  
Gretzky's leavetaking. He says his goodbye not at the top of his 
game and not with the perfect ending -- a shot that wins him a final 
Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gretzky leaves with peace of mind, knowing that on any given  
night, he could still summon up the miracles that made the rinks 
inside the cold, corrugated steel sheds of his youth rock like they 
were Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to go out like Michael Jordan did, but it's  
not a perfect world. ... It's not going to happen that way, not 
this year,'' he said. ``But it is nice to be able to say people do 
want me to play more.''

<HEADLINE> Filling Needs at the NFL Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- How NFL teams filled their needs with their  
first selections in Saturday's draft: 
</P>
<P>
	1, CLEVELAND -- When you're starting a franchise, you look for a  
franchise quarterback. That's an NFL axiom the Browns heeded wisely 
by taking TIM COUCH, QB, KENTUCKY. Couch might sit behind Ty Detmer 
for his rookie year, but not long beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	2, PHILADELPHIA -- A playmaker with the ability to get outside  
while operating behind a mediocre offensive line? Try DONOVAN 
McNABB, QB, SYRACUSE. The Eagles did, hoping to boost an offense 
that scored 161 points last year. 
</P>
<P>
	3, CINCINNATI -- The Bengals already had four quarterbacks on the  
roster, but weren't enamored of any of them. So AKILI SMITH, QB, 
OREGON, was the choice. He has the strongest arm of any passing 
prospect, and will have decent weapons to work with. 
</P>
<P>
	4, INDIANAPOLIS -- EDGERRIN JAMES, RB, MIAMI, FLA., isn't Ricky  
Williams. The Colts apparently believe he is a better receiver, and 
after dealing away Marshall Faulk, they need a running back who can 
catch the ball as an outlet for Peyton Manning. 
</P>
<P>
	But James had only one outstanding season in college. Williams  
is the NCAA Division I career rushing leader. 
</P>
<P>
	5, NEW ORLEANS -- Mike Ditka would have offered the Superdome for  
RICKY WILLIAMS, RB, TEXAS, if ``Da Coach'' owned it. Instead, he 
traded six picks this year and two next year with Washington to 
move up seven spots. That's an incredible price to pay for a guy 
Ditka compares with Walter Payton. He'd better be. 
</P>
<P>
	6, ST. LOUIS -- The Rams bolstered their draft when they traded  
for Marshall Faulk on Thursday. They further upgraded a dreary 
offense with TORRY HOLT, WR, NORTH CAROLINA STATE. Now if anyone 
can find Isaac Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
	7, WASHINGTON -- For a team in ownership limbo, the Redskins did  
a spectacular job. They gained seven picks over two years, and 
still wound up with the guy they wanted, CHAMP BAILEY, CB, GEORGIA. 
Washington is aging at cornerback and also occasionally can use 
Bailey at receiver. He'll run back kicks, too. A superb pick for 
what they need. 
</P>
<P>
	8, ARIZONA -- The Cardinals are building a nice offense and Jake  
Plummer will love throwing to DAVID BOSTON, WR, OHIO STATE. Boston 
also brings a bit of attitude to go with his skills getting open 
deep and should provide balance to Rob Moore and Frank Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	9, DETROIT -- The Lions weren't expecting CHRIS CLAIBORNE, LB,  
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, to slip this far. The All-American, who can 
play inside and outside, should fill a need on the outside and 
start immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	10, BALTIMORE -- Even though they took a cornerback first last  
season (Duane Starks), the Ravens couldn't resist CHRIS McALISTER, 
CB, ARIZONA. He'll free aging Rod Woodson to move to safety and 
also will return kicks. Look for some big plays from McAlister 
right away. 
</P>
<P>
	11, MINNESOTA -- The Vikings really wanted McAlister after losing  
Corey Fuller as a free agent. Instead, in the Draft of the 
Quarterbacks, they opted to groom one behind Randall Cunningham. 
DAUNTE CULPEPPER, QB, CENTRAL FLORIDA, is a bit raw and untested on 
the highest level. But this team has time on its side. 
</P>
<P>
	12, CHICAGO -- The run on quarterbacks continued as the Bears  
went for CADE McNOWN, QB, UCLA. Very productive, even though he 
doesn't fit the prototype NFL quarterback, McNown could be the 
first of this crop to actually start as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	13, PITTSBURGH -- A bit of reach here? TROY EDWARDS, WR, LOUSIANA  
TECH, was highly productive on a lower level and projected as a 
late first-rounder. But after allowing Yancey Thigpen and Charles 
Johnson to slip away as free agents, the Steelers were desperate 
enough to gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	14, KANSAS CITY -- For the second straight year, the Chiefs  
tended to their offensive line. JOHN TAIT, T, BYU, was the first 
blocker selected and could slide in opposite last year's No. 1, 
Victor Riley, who started as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	15, TAMPA BAY -- Warren Sapp must be smiling from ear to ear. By  
taking ANTHONY McFARLAND, DT, LSU, the Bucs solidified their 
defensive line and enhanced Sapp's impact. With none of the touted 
QBs available, Tampa decided to fill a minor need on defense with a 
top-rank player. 
</P>
<P>
	16, TENNESSEE -- The Titans wanted a defensive lineman or  
linebacker. They are especially weak at DE, and JEVON KEARSE, 
DE-LB, FLORIDA, fit nicely. Kearse is more likely to have an impact 
rushing the passer, a weakness in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	17, NEW ENGLAND -- After losing Dave Wohlabaugh to free agency,  
the Patriots had a chasm at center. They filled it drafting DAMIEN 
WOODY, C, BOSTON COLLEGE, but why move up three spots in a trade 
for someone who probably would have been there at No. 20? 
</P>
<P>
	18, OAKLAND -- The defense has lots of needs, but another primary  
one was offensive tackle. MATT STINCHCOMB, T, GEORGIA, an 
All-American who needs to get stronger, but is smart and tenacious. 
Should be a starter in '99. 
</P>
<P>
	19, NEW YORK GIANTS -- The recent history of picks from Notre  
Dame has been spotty. The Giants, who have struggled with 
first-rounders (Dave Brown, Tyrone Wheatley, Thomas Lewis), really 
stretched for LUKE PETITGOUT, T, NOTRE DAME. They have a need at 
right tackle, where Petitgout plays, but some scouts projected him 
for the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	20, DALLAS -- With Leon Lett's status very shaky, the Cowboys  
opted to address the defensive line. In EBENEZER EKUBAN, DE, NORTH 
CAROLINA, they get a quick sackmaster who isn't the run-stopper 
Lett is, but can learn. Dallas moved up two spots to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	21, ARIZONA -- With speedy David Boston on hand, the Cardinals  
could look for bulk. A left tackle was the most pressing need, and 
they got L.J. SHELTON, T, EASTERN MICHIGAN. He'll get a chance to 
start right off. 
</P>
<P>
	22, SEATTLE -- After two trades downward, the Seahawks finally  
got going and bolstered their defensive line with LAMAR KING, DE, 
SAGINAW VALLEY. There's no major need here, but the wideouts and 
cornerbacks who were attractive already were gone. 
</P>
<P>
	23, BUFFALO -- One of the few totally expected picks in the round  
was ANTOINE WINFIELD, CB, OHIO STATE. A hard-hitter who is a bit 
small, Winfield easily could start, but certainly will work in the 
nickel package covering slot receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	24, SAN FRANCISCO -- The 49ers moved up three spots, dealing with  
Miami to get a shot at REGGIE McGREW, DT, FLORIDA. Clearly worried 
about Bryant Young's return from a severe leg injury, the Niners 
believe McGrew will plug gaps against the run. 
</P>
<P>
	25, GREEN BAY -- The Packers have taken some hits in the  
secondary, and to compete with the Vikings in the NFC Central, they 
must upgrade safety and cornerback. ANTWAN EDWARDS, S, CLEMSON, 
will allow Darren Sharper to move to cornerback. Edwards moves 
well, but needs work on tackling. 
</P>
<P>
	26, JACKSONVILLE -- Another good need pick. The Jaguars have few  
weaknesses, but their pass coverage is mediocre. They also wanted a 
good man-to-man guy and FERNANDO BRYANT, CB, ALABAMA, can handle 
that. But he also needs outside motivation. 
</P>
<P>
	27, DETROIT -- On a pick from Miami, the Lions filled another  
need -- did they ever -- with 380-pound AARON GIBSON, T-G, Wisconsin. 
Barry Sanders and Charlie Batch certainly don't mind having a 
road-grader like that. 
</P>
<P>
	28, NEW ENGLAND -- The Parcells pick. This is the last choice the  
Jets owed the Patriots, and it was used to take a big name whose 
game sagged in 1998: ANDY KATZENMOYER, LB, OHIO STATE. With Todd 
Collins gone, he might have to move outside. He won't displace Ted 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	29, MINNESOTA -- After their success with Randy Moss, the Vikings  
are unafraid of problem players. So they went for DIMITRIUS 
UNDERWOOD, DE, MICHIGAN STATE. He missed the season with an ankle 
injury and needs to mature. 
</P>
<P>
	30, ATLANTA -- The Falcons did well by getting PATRICK KERNEY,  
DE, VIRGINIA. A former lacrosse player, he brings intelligence and 
dedication and should enhance an already solid pass rush. But 
should they have gone after a wide receiver, an even bigger need? 
</P>
<P>
	31, DENVER -- From national champion to Super Bowl champion. Not  
bad for AL WILSON, LB, TENNESSEE. Eventually, Bill Romanowski must 
be replaced and Wilson, if he can stay healthy, should be the guy. 
</P>
<P>
	34, CAROLINA -- The lightest offensive lineman at the NFL Combine  
at 291 pounds, CHRIS TERRY, T, GEORGIA, isn't as good as college 
teammate Stinchcomb. He's a bit inexperienced, but Panthers need 
him to start. 
</P>
<P>
	39, MIAMI -- On a pick obtained from the Lions, Jimmy Johnson got  
a second-tier running back in JAMES JOHNSON, RB, MISSISSIPPI STATE. 
He isn't a breakaway threat, but is powerful and can catch. 
</P>
<P>
	57, NEW YORK JETS -- With a hole at guard, the Jets were anxious  
about RANDY THOMAS, G, MISSISSIPPI STATE, lasting this far. He did, 
and he could find himself starting in September. 
</P>
<P>
	60, SAN DIEGO -- Punishment for the Ryan Leaf trade meant no  
picks until the end of the second round. The choice, JERMAINE 
FAZANDE, FB, Oklahoma, was one of those reaches Bobby Beathard is 
known for.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Got Start in Indianapolis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A typical teen-ager? That's how one former  
Indianapolis Racers teammate remembers young Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was nothing typical about the hockey skills the  
teen-age phenom brought with him when he started his major league 
career more than 20 years ago. Then 17 years old, Gretzky played 
only a handful of games in Indianapolis, but it was there, in 
Market Square Arena, where he embarked on a path that made him the 
best player in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Great One'' announced his retirement on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``You could see the talent. But the only thing lacking when he  
was here was a little maturity. He was a typical teen-ager,'' 
former Racers teammate Ken Block recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	It all began in 1978, when Canadian businessman Nelson  
Skalbania, the owner of the Racers, plucked the Ontario teen out of 
the junior leagues, signed him to a personal services contract and 
brought him to Indianapolis to play in the now-defunct World Hockey 
Association, a rival of the dominant NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Gretzky was the youngest athlete playing a major  
league sport in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was no man-child. He was a 17-year-old kid, physically, in  
maturity, everything, with obviously a lot of athletic skill,'' 
said Al Karlander, another former teammate in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who had scored 70 goals and 182 points in 64 games for  
the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds the previous season, was like a 
``diamond in the rough'' who just needed some polish, Block said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky moved in with a family in suburban Carmel and enrolled  
at Broad Ripple High School. He was accepted by the Racers and by 
the community, although no one realized he was a 
superstar-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no hard feelings, that he didn't pay his dues,''  
Karlander said. ``At that time in the WHA, there were a lot of 
18-year-olds, a lot of kids that had come out of the juniors that 
were just a year older. Every day you saw improvement. Every day 
you could see him understanding the game more, finding openings, 
finding lanes, finding opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing that was very different about him was he found  
open ice and found it in a different place than anybody else had. 
When you have open ice, you have time, and when you have time, you 
make good things happen if you're as skilled and gifted as he is,'' 
Karlander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing for the Racers, Gretzky scored his first two  
professional goals on Oct. 20, 1978, against the Edmonton Oilers. 
But his stay in Indianapolis was short. The team was struggling, on 
the ice and financially, and after just three goals and six points 
in eight games, he was traded to Edmonton, along with Peter 
Driscoll and Eddie Mio, for cash and future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he came in, it was obvious he was going to do  
something,'' Driscoll recalled. ``He had that ability to read the 
ice like nobody we had ever seen before. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all felt it was going to be nice to watch this kid grow up.  
He was pleasant, polite, showed a lot of respect for the veterans 
that were around. He's just been a first-class act from start to 
finish,'' said Driscoll, who played two more seasons with the 
Oilers and now is facility manager for a Carmel racquet club. 
</P>
<P>
	Karlander, who works for a Carmel mortgage company with Block,  
called the Oilers' acquisition of Gretzky ``probably the best 
bargain in pro sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My memory is when Gretzky went to Edmonton, Nelson Skalbania  
received $750,000, but $500,000 was selling the NHL rights he had 
in Edmonton (to Peter Pocklington), so Gretzky was basically sold 
for $200,000 and Eddie Mio and Peter Driscoll were sold for, like, 
$25,000 each,'' Karlander said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as he went to Edmonton, you could see the maturity  
kind of come because he had a better cast of players around him,'' 
Block recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky scored 43 goals and 104 points in 72 games for Edmonton  
that season and was named the WHA rookie of the year. The next 
year, the Oilers -- and Gretzky -- came into the NHL in a merger that 
also brought in the Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg 
Jets. Since then, the Whalers have moved to Carolina, the Nordiques 
to Colorado and the Jets to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky has moved, too. Now with the New York Rangers, he has  
894 goals and 1,962 assists in 1,486 games. His last game will be 
on Sunday, when the Rangers close out their season against the 
Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you tear his skills apart, he's not a very physical guy at  
all, he's not very big, there are so many players that skate better 
than he does, there are players that shoot the puck better than he 
does,'' Block said. ``But when you put the whole package together, 
and the fact that he was always one step ahead of everybody in his 
thinking, that's what made him great. His anticipation was uncanny. 
It's just like he knew where the puck was going all the time.''

<HEADLINE>  US Destroyer Bears Churchill's Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATH, Maine (AP) -- A U.S. Navy destroyer was launched Saturday  
bearing the name of former British prime minister Sir Winston 
Churchill -- an honor rarely afforded foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Lady Soames, the former British leader's only living child,  
joined U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, British Defense 
Minister George Robertson and other Churchill relatives to watch 
the 505-foot warship Winston S. Churchill slide down a greased ramp 
at the Bath Iron Works into the Kennebec River. 
</P>
<P>
	``The naming of this ship is very special and stands out in a  
class of its own,'' said Soames, 76, the youngest of his five 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told a crowd of about 6,500 that Churchill ``gave the  
world hope in the darkest hours and helped shape the world that we 
know today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two peace activists, a man and a woman, were arrested after  
attempting to shout down Cohen and Maine Gov. Angus King during 
each of their remarks. They were released charged with disorderly 
conduct and released. About 55 people outside demonstrated for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill served as Britain's fiery prime minister from 1940 to  
1945 and from 1951 to 1955. He vowed during the early days of World 
War II that his country would never fall to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be,'' he told

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves Sign Guard Robinson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Guard James ``Hollywood'' Robinson has signed  
a contract to play with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the rest of 
the season, the team announced Saturday. Terms were not immediately 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wolves had signed Robinson to back-to-back 10-day contracts  
after the Los Angeles Clippers released him March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored a season-high 15 points in Friday night's 89-75  
victory over Vancouver and had a season-high seven assists against 
Houston in Monday's 95-90 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Robinson's second stint with the Timberwolves. He spent  
the 1996-97 season with Minnesota after the Wolves acquired him 
from Portland in the Isaiah Rider trade in July 1996. He left 
Minnesota to sign a free-agent contract with the Clippers in August 
1997.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Spruces Up for NATO Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An army of civil servants, corporate  
volunteers, federal planners and law enforcement officers is 
mobilizing to help the nation's capital prepare as host of its 
largest gathering of world leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization returns for  
three days to the city where President Truman and the leaders of a 
handful of other nations created NATO in 1949. The now-19 NATO 
nations will be joined by officials from 25 eastern and central 
European partner countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity to showcase Washington, D.C. as a  
beautiful city,'' said Mayor Anthony Williams. ``We're also the 
co-host with the president and the first lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event, with some 40 heads of government, 2,500 to 3,000  
media and 1,700 dignitaries, is a huge logistical challenge, said 
Dana Shelley, spokeswoman for the NATO 50th Summit Host Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor has ordered a massive cleanup of areas of the city  
that don't normally appear on postcards. Vacant lots are being 
fenced, graffiti wiped out, trees trimmed and streets swept. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for foreign delegations to arrive at Ronald Reagan  
National and Dulles airports in Virginia and the 
Baltimore-Washington International Airport and Andrews Air Force 
Base in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means cleaning our gateways - Georgia Avenue, New York  
Avenue - the ways that people come into our city, and then cleaning 
the neighborhoods around them,'' said Kay McGrath, a special 
assistant to the mayor. ``What one weekend does is, it helps you 
reposition the District of Columbia into its rightful position as 
the capital of the free world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City officials see it as a prime opportunity to market  
Washington's prestige addresses -- the Capitol Hill area, portions 
of New York and Pennsylvania avenues -- in a continuing effort to 
spur economic revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen law enforcement agencies, including the Secret  
Service, FBI, Metropolitan Police Department and National Park 
Service Police, will provide security. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers will be prepared for unrest. ``It would be  
un-American not to have at least some demonstrators,'' said Richard 
Socarides, chief operating officer for summit organizers, 
explaining that a specific area will be designated for protesters 
granted permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for areas where summit events are planned, streets will  
be open and vendors will be allowed to remain, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have rolling street closures,'' as motorcades for the  
40 heads of state move through, said Cmdr. Michael Radzilowski, 
head of the city police department's Special Operations Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington, D.C. is a tough town for traffic anyway, and  
moving these folks around is a tough task for us,'' said Maj. 
General Joseph Garrett, the vice director of the NATO summit 
planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers from Fort Eustis, Va., are being brought in to drive  
shuttle buses and cars for dignitaries. In addition, most 
government offices near summit sites will be closed Friday to 
reduce traffic. About half the 180,000 area federal employees and 
7,500 district government workers will receive the day off with 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's subway will travel through, but not stop, at the  
Federal Triangle subway stop near the main summit site, the Ronald 
Reagan International Trade Center downtown.

<HEADLINE> Kiwi May Fly Again Under FAA Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Kiwi International Air Lines, awash in debt  
and without planes or permission to fly, reached a deal with 
federal regulators that could get it off the ground again, the 
airline said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement with the Federal Aviation Administration is the  
latest time that the 7-year-old airline bounced back when its 
demise seemed assured. 
</P>
<P>
	Newark-based Kiwi was to appeal the FAA's revocation of its  
flight certification on Tuesday before the National Transportation 
Safety Board. That hearing is now off. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, without warning, pulled Kiwi's license on March 24,  
saying the carrier was unable to fly its six-city schedule safely. 
Thousands of travelers, some already at airports, were left without 
flights or reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi laid off nearly all of its 500 workers and surrendered its  
four leased jets, but won permission from a bankruptcy judge to 
keep a skeleton staff in place to press its appeal of the 
revocation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the FAA changed the revocation to a  
suspension and will assess no fines or penalties, Kiwi spokesman 
Rob Kulat said. The suspension could last up to four months while 
the FAA completes a review, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very pleased to have reached an understanding with the  
FAA and to begin the process of the airline's reorganization,'' 
Charles Stanziale, Kiwi's trustee, said in a statement issued 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac said Kiwi would be allowed to  
reapply for certification. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would have to prove to us they can operate in a safe and  
efficient manner,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charles C. Edwards, a Baltimore surgeon who had been the  
airline's chairman until Stanziale was appointed to oversee its 
assets on April 1, called the settlement a ``wonderful 
vindication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how strained it ever became financially, never was  
one shortcut made in maintenance or safety,'' Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives Kiwi another chance to attract someone to rescue  
it from bankruptcy, and provide cash so it can lease some jets and 
rehire workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Am Airways, a former commercial airliner that flies charters  
out of Portsmouth, N.H., offered to buy Kiwi last month for $3 
million. But that plan collapsed when Kiwi could not immediately 
restore its flight certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	Before being grounded, Kiwi served Newark; Miami, Orlando and  
Palm Beach, Fla.; and San Juan and Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the mid-90s, Kiwi had 1,200 workers, and they  
owned a controlling share of the airline, which boasted 15 leased 
jets.

<HEADLINE>  US Destroyer Bears Churchill's Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATH, Maine (AP) -- A U.S. Navy destroyer was launched Saturday  
bearing the name of former British prime minister Sir Winston 
Churchill -- an honor rarely afforded foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	Lady Soames, the former British leader's only living child,  
joined U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, British Defense 
Minister George Robertson and other Churchill relatives to watch 
the 505-foot warship Winston S. Churchill slide down a greased ramp 
at the Bath Iron Works into the Kennebec River. 
</P>
<P>
	``The naming of this ship is very special and stands out in a  
class of its own,'' said Soames, 76, the youngest of his five 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told a crowd of about 6,500 that Churchill ``gave the  
world hope in the darkest hours and helped shape the world that we 
know today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two peace activists, a man and a woman, were arrested after  
attempting to shout down Cohen and Maine Gov. Angus King during 
each of their remarks. They were released charged with disorderly 
conduct and released. About 55 people outside demonstrated for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill served as Britain's fiery prime minister from 1940 to  
1945 and from 1951 to 1955. He vowed during the early days of World 
War II that his country would never fall to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be,'' he told  
the House of Commons while the specter of German invasion loomed. 
``We shall fight on beaches, on landing grounds, fields, in streets 
and on the hills. We shall never surrender.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $950 million vessel will weigh more than 8,000 tons when  
fully loaded and delivered to the Navy. Advanced radar enables the 
Arleigh Burke-class destroyer to simultaneously wage battle with 
planes, ships and submarines. 
</P>
<P>
	The warship's arsenal will include Tomahawk cruise missiles,  
Harpoon missiles and torpedoes. It is built to withstand chemical 
attacks and is capable of speeds up to 30 knots. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixteen other U.S. ships have been named after foreign heroes,  
five for Britons. None are in active service. 
</P>
<P>
	Churchill, however, was declared an honorary U.S. citizen in  
1963, two years before his death. His mother was American. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain named an attack submarine in honor of Churchill 20 years  
ago. The vessel was removed from service in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Signs Top Pick Legwand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Nashville Predators signed their  
first-ever draft pick, center David Legwand, to a contract on 
Saturday and planned to put him in the lineup against the New 
Jersey Devils Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Legwand, selected second overall in the 1998 draft, played in  
three preseason games with the Predators before he was returned to 
the OHL's Plymouth Whalers. The Whalers were knocked out of the OHL 
playoffs on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 180-pound Detroit native led the Whalers with 54  
goals and 51 assists in 59 games. He was named the OHL's rookie of 
the year and MVP after the 1997-98 season.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gives Reno OK on Aliens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- President Clinton on Saturday gave Attorney  
General Janet Reno authority to maintain custody of illegal aliens 
found in boats off the Northern Mariana Islands, easing worries in 
Guam that they would seek asylum there. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred illegal aliens from China have been apprehended  
in recent months in waters off Guam, drawing a complaint that they 
would seek asylum in U.S. territories. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president's directive would allow captured illegal  
aliens to be held in the Northern Marianas, which is outside the 
U.S. immigration area and where asylum would not be available, 
according to Leland Bettis, an aide to Guam Gov. Carl Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's memo specifically mentioned a ``stateless  
vessel'' located west of the Northern Marianas and identified by 
U.S. authorities on or about April 12. That vessel apparently has 
since moved to Tinian, a Northern Mariana island near Saipan, 
Bettis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials on nearby Guam believe the vessel departed from China  
with nationals who paid organized crime lords in an effort to gain 
American citizenship. Several such vessels have grounded off Guam 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's action was prompted by a letter sent Tuesday by  
Gutierrez, outlining ``a crisis triggered by an escalating mass 
influx of aliens from the People's Republic of China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The governor asked for federal assistance in dealing with the  
problem. Since January, 480 illegal Chinese immigrants have been 
apprehended in waters off Guam, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a vessel grounded on a reef off Guam and authorities  
arrested about 70 Chinese nationals on shore. On Friday, 105 
Chinese aliens arrived on a boat, Bettis said. 
</P>
<P>
	At present, more than 350 illegal aliens are housed in Guam's  
already overcrowded prison, comprising nearly 50 percent of the 
prison population, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez said he won't release the illegal aliens into the  
community because they are of unknown character and no information 
is known about their background. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was also worried that the aliens would be manipulated  
by organized crime, and that tuberculosis and hepatitis B cases 
have been found among them. 
</P>
<P>
	Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are  
U.S. territories located about 3,700 miles southwest of Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> Rodman's Future May Be in Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Being fired by the Los Angeles Lakers after  
only 23 games doesn't mean Dennis Rodman is washed up in another 
part of town -- Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial forward could easily rebound in Tinseltown  
because he's been in the spotlight for so long, says Sherrie 
Spillane, a Los Angeles talent agent who specializes in turning 
shame into fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's hardly out of a spotlight. He'll get another job,'' said  
Spillane, who has represented clients such as Joey Buttafuoco, 
Tanya Harding and John Wayne Bobbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television movies would pick Rodman up in an instant,'' she  
said Friday. ``He could have a job with them this afternoon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is,'' she asked, ``will he show up?''  
</P>
<P>
	Good question. He lost his job with the Lakers on Thursday after  
showing up late -- or not at all -- for practices. His odd behavior 
also included a four-game disappearance from the team for 
``personal reasons'' -- during which he was spotted gambling in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	He already has one offer in Los Angeles -- a liaison to rap  
artists. 
</P>
<P>
	Beverly Hills-based Death Row Records, the label for such  
rappers as the late Tupac Shakur, has offered him a job in their 
artist relations department, spokeswoman Trece Tiburcio said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would love to have Dennis be a part of our company,'' she  
told The Associated Press. ``We have had contact with his agency. 
Our artists seem to relate to Dennis. It would be a perfect 
match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if that falls through?  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe wrestling,'' laughed Willie Blair as he swept a sidewalk  
Friday at a downtown YMCA. ``I mean, I love Rodman, but he just 
seemed like he was bored. Maybe he won too many championships. He 
has just done it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrestling, though, may not want him.  
</P>
<P>
	The Worm has already battled foes in the ring such as Karl  
Malone and Hulk Hogan. But last year, he sued World Championship 
Wrestling, saying he was owed millions of dollars from his matches. 
</P>
<P>
	One place he won't show up is in advertisements for Carl's Jr.  
fast-food chain. It had twice benched the player's commercial for 
their Super Star hamburger, citing his bad behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurants began re-broadcasting the 2-year-old commercials  
only two weeks ago, saying Rodman's ``local player'' status in Los 
Angeles had once again made him marketable. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday, officials from the chain's parent company,  
Anaheim-based CKE Restaurants Inc., said no more commercials would 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that he is no longer a Laker, we don't have the desire to  
use the commercial again,'' said spokeswoman Suzi Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has so far not speculated on his plans. But he has said  
the Lakers made him a scapegoat for the team's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his supporters agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	Wanda Vazquez, a Lakers fan visiting from Boston, said anybody  
who wants to work with Rodman should tolerate his quirks. 
</P>
<P>
	``People like him. They like his hair, they like watching him,''  
she said in the lobby of the Bonaventure Hotel. ``He brought life 
to the team and he fits in well, if you let him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone will miss Rodman, it will likely be headline writers  
who marked his firing with phrases like ``Late Worm Gets Hook,'' 
``Lakers De-Wormed'' and ``Lakers, Rodman divorce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around Chicago, where he won three championship rings with the  
Bulls, the headline in the Daily Southtown of suburban Tinley Park 
read ``Lakers to Rodman: No shoes, no socks, no practice -- and no 
more patience.''

<HEADLINE> Rams' Faulk Says He'll Hold Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Newly acquired St. Louis Rams running back  
Marshall Faulk said he won't participate in the team's two 
minicamps this spring without a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams obtained Faulk, the NFL's best all-around back last  
season, from the Indianapolis Colts on Thursday for second- and 
fifth-round picks in this weekend's draft. The major reason the 
Colts let Faulk go was his desire to renegotiate the last two years 
of the original seven-year contract he signed as the second overall 
pick of the 1994 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season he's scheduled to make a base salary of $2.2 million  
and wants to make closer to $5 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams have a voluntary minicamp April 30-May 2 and a  
mandatory minicamp June 10-12. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk's contract contains a clause that would have made him a  
free agent had he finished fifth in the league in rushing. He ended 
up sixth with 1,319 yards, 13 yards behind Emmitt Smith of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams are treating Faulk and his contract status as if he  
were a first-round draft pick and want to get him into training 
camp on time. They expect to talk contract after the draft 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we'd like to do is give him an extension we can live with  
that locks him up for a while,'' Rams coach Dick Vermeil said. 
``And one that he can live with.''

<HEADLINE> Braves' Rocker Blow First Save Opp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Rocker doesn't have a grunge-rock haircut or  
an intimidating goatee like some major league closers, but he's 
adopting the attitude real quick. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're either the damn hero or the goat,'' Rocker said  
Saturday after giving up three ninth-inning runs in the Atlanta 
Braves' 5-4 loss to the Colorado Rockies. ``I'm not going to change 
my pitching philosophy. I'm fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker, 24, inherited Atlanta's closing job when Kerry  
Ligtenberg went down with an elbow injury and Mark Wohlers was 
traded after an ongoing battle with his control. 
</P>
<P>
	With a 100 mph fastball, the left-handed Rocker has the  
potential to be dominating. He struck out six of the first seven 
hitters he faced this year but struggled Saturday, walking two and 
giving up a two-run single to Angel Echevarria to tie it at 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like facing guys who throw like that because you have to  
make up your mind really, really quick,'' said Echevarria, who was 
1-for-9 before his groundball single between third and shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	Echevarria pounced on a slider, as did Darryl Hamilton, who  
handed Rocker his first loss of the year when he slapped a line 
drive to left-center. The turn of events left Rocker with a scowl 
to match the image of pro wrestler ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin 
staring out from his T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just fouled a 100 mph fastball straight back and the next  
pitch I throw him a good slider 15 mph slower and he's right on 
that, too,'' Rocker said of Hamilton. ``How are you right on both 
of those pitches? I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rocker's breakdown spoiled a solid performance by Atlanta  
starter Tom Glavine (0-2), who is still trying to avoid his first 
0-3 start since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question it would have been nice to get that first  
win under my belt, but it didn't happen,'' Glavine said. ``I feel 
good about what I did today, and it's something to build on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Rocker learned a lesson familiar to even the best  
of closers: You can't save them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll think about that a little bit, but (Glavine) will have  
other chances,'' Rocker said. ``I'll have other chances to save 
games.''

 *Morey Bernstein    	
</P>
<P>
	PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) -- Morey Bernstein, a hypnotist who wrote the  
controversial ``past life'' bestseller ``The Quest for Bridey 
Murphy,'' died April 2 of cardiac arrhythmia. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1940s, Bernstein saw a hypnotism demonstration at a party  
and began exploring the technique as a way to cure ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 29, 1952, the amateur hypnotist tried an experiment in  
age regression on one of his most responsive subjects, a 
29-year-old housewife named Virginia Tighe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein asked her to remember her childhood. After several  
sessions she began telling him about a time before she was born, 
prompting Bernstein to believe his subject had recalled a previous 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	The hypnotist said Ms. Tighe spoke in a thick Irish accent and  
claimed to have been a woman named Bridey Murphy, who was born Dec. 
20, 1798 near Cork, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein's book, which disguised Tighe as a woman named Ruth  
Simmons, was later made into a movie starring Louis Hayward as 
Bernstein and Teresa Wright as Ms. Tighe. 
</P>
<P>
	Various investigations failed to prove that Bridey Murphy ever  
existed. Bernstein gave up hypnotism after the Bridey Murphy 
experience.

<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Donna Cottier, a former reporter for several  
Ohio newspapers, died Friday of congestive heart failure. She was 
77. 
</P>
<P>
	Cottier wrote about events in Maumee, Perrysburg and other  
southern Lucas County communities for 35 years. She joined the 
staff of the Maumee Valley News, a weekly newspaper, in 1951, and 
after that publication folded, worked for The Blade until retiring 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first newspaper job was with The News-Messenger of Fremont,  
which hired her while she was in high school in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
	While attending Kent State University, she was a photographer  
and society writer for the former Kent Courier Tribune and a 
freelance writer for the Akron Beacon Journal in 1941 and 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	She graduated from Kent State in 1943, then became a reporter  
for the former Toledo Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include a son, four daughters and eight grandchildren.

	Lutyens' father was the well-known architect Sir Edwin Lutyens  
and whose maternal grandfather, the Earl of Lytton, was viceroy of 
India from 1876-1880. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she wrote 13 novels and excelled as an editor, she was  
most acclaimed for her biographies, including writings on her 
father's work, her parents' unhappy marriage and her grandfather. 
</P>

<P>
	COLLINSVILLE, Conn. (AP) -- Alan T. Sagal, a former reporter for  
radio station WTIC and a spokesman for the AAA, Automobile Club of 
Hartford, died Friday of pancreatic cancer. He was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Sagal began his career in Connecticut radio at WSTC in Stamford.  
</P>
<P>
	He worked at WICC in Bridgeport and as public information  
officer for the state Department of Health Services before joining 
WTIC in 1974. As early morning news anchor and afternoon capitol 
reporter for the AM station, he also served as the Hartford area 
reporter for WCBS radio in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Beside a stint in the state Office of Policy and Management  
during the energy crisis of 1978, Sagal stayed with WTIC for more 
than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Sagal became manager of public and government affairs  
for the Automobile Club of Greater Hartford. He continued his radio 
presence by reporting state weekend events on AM radio station 
WDRC. 
</P>
<P>
	His series ``Traveling in Connecticut,'' which aired Saturdays  
on WTIC, and his AAA feature articles, ``Touring Connecticut,'' won 
numerous awards and led to his appointment to the Connecticut

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cites New Serb Atrocities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration worked out details  
of an emergency $5.9 billion budget request to pay for military and 
humanitarian operations in Yugoslavia as it cited new, compelling 
evidence of mass killings of civilians there. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending package will cover the cost of U.S. participation  
in the NATO airstrikes and humanitarian relief for refugees from 
the besieged province of Kosovo, said a senior administration 
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The 
administration will formally present the request to Congress early 
next week, the official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected to  
ask President Clinton to approve the call-up of some 33,000 
military reservists, including up to 25,000 Air National Guard 
members in units that fly aerial refueling missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Some civil affairs specialists from the Army Reserve also are  
likely to be activated, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Jamie Rubin said evidence  
of fresh atrocities inside Kosovo might explain in part an increase 
in the exodus from the besieged Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is ... evidence of mass killings and graves associated  
with those mass killings,'' west of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not have precise information on the number killed but  
said it was more than a few dozen. The location is different from 
one where mass graves were reported last week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new information, which Rubin called compelling, comes from  
refugee accounts and independent sources he would not identify. It 
was turned over to the international War Crimes Tribunal, where 
investigators are compiling records that could lead to prosecution 
of Serbian officers. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Pentagon, officials disclosed that a Yugoslav Army  
officer was captured by troops of the Kosovo Liberation Army on 
Tuesday night or early Wednesday and turned over to U.S. custody in 
Albania on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer, said to be about 21 years old, is the first member  
of the Yugoslav military to become a prisoner of war during the 
campaign. Yugoslav forces two weeks ago captured three American 
soldiers near the border between Yugoslavia and Macedonia and are 
holding them as POWs. It wasn't known whether the United States 
would propose a prisoner exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the  
administration would probably ask for $3 billion to $4 billion for 
the Kosovo campaign, an amount that many Republicans called 
inadequate. Even the higher figure now being requested by the 
administration was expected to generate opposition from some 
Republicans who see the bill as a vehicle for dealing with 
longer-term needs of the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress are pressing for spending of from $10  
billion to $18 billion to beef up the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton defended the U.S. role in Kosovo during a fund-raising  
appearance in Michigan. He asked how Americans would feel -- ``no 
matter how many apprehensions you have'' -- if asked to explain 
``why we couldn't lift a finger to do anything about'' the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, meanwhile, broadcast a  
brief message to the Serbian people to counter what she said were 
the falsehoods of their own government. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO has no wish to conquer your people and expand eastward,''  
she said. ``We have recognized Kosovo as part of your country. But 
our nations cannot stand by while thousands of innocent people are 
killed or driven from their homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's message was delivered in Serbo-Croatian, a language  
she learned when she lived in Yugoslavia for a time as a child. It 
was broadcast into Serbia via Radio Liberty, Radio Free Europe and 
the Voice of America.

<HEADLINE> Intimate Universe: The Human Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Want to see a sword-swallower's vocal cords?  
Or watch a British lord get drunk? Tune in to the Learning Channel 
for ``Intimate Universe: The Human Body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fantastic Voyage,'' the 1966 movie showed scientists  
miniaturized to microscopic size and injected into a living body. 
But that was science fiction. The BBC, using medical advances, 
presents the real thing, peering into the workings of the heart, 
womb and other organs in four one-hour segments on TLC Sunday and 
Monday, April 18-19 at 9 p.m. EDT. (The final four hours will be 
shown Aug. 1-2, preceded by a repeat of the first segments.) 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Winston, the tour guide, is man of many talents. He can  
be addressed as Doctor (he is a renowned expert on infertility), 
Professor (he teaches at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School), or 
Lord (he holds a non-inherited seat in Britain's House of Lords). 
</P>
<P>
	But in a telephone interview from London, he seemed to shun any  
such formality. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I think we may have achieved,'' he remarked, ``is to  
demonstrate that you can make perfectly respectable science 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that is what made it such a landmark on British  
television and why it was such an incredible success in Australia 
and New Zealand. I believe it was the most watched series ever in 
New Zealand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited some television firsts for ``Intimate Universe'':  
imaging of the brain, neurons firing, and the use of endoscopy, 
where a slim fiber-optic tube records such things as a fetus 
growing inside the womb and the vocal cords of a sword swallower. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston is no stranger to television. In 1996, BBC presented  
``Making Babies,'' a seven-part series about his infertility unit 
at Hammersmith Hospital, and he has often appeared on TV as a 
medical expert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intimate Universe'' took him from French caves to Egypt, from  
Yellowstone National Park to Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of relaxation,'' he said. But not always. At one  
point he was supposed to film in Guatemala. But he and the producer 
were too tired to travel there so they shot the segment on the 
Thames River. 
</P>
<P>
	To demonstrate the body's reaction to alcohol, Winston did  
something rather undoctorly and unlordly: He got drunk, on camera. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was shot in a London restaurant. Winston drank more  
than two bottles of wine, ``and demonstrated that I can't hold my 
liquor very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really quite a difficult thing to do. It's quite lonely,  
getting drunk on your own, with a camera and a large crew watching 
you. You feel quite exposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another episode explaining the effects of morning sickness  
required him to get seasick. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a bit of a fake, to tell you the truth,'' he  
confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shot that on a very rough day off the English coast, but it  
wasn't as bad as we made it look. I have to admit that there was a 
certain amount of economy with the truth. But it was meant to be a 
fun, lighthearted piece.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Halts Schott's Sale of Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott's attempt to sell control of the  
Cincinnati Reds to a cousin has been blocked by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's limited partners got a temporary restraining order  
Friday preventing Schott from doing anything until a Hamilton 
County Common Pleas judge hears the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The order came one day after the limited partners sued, claiming  
Schott had entered into a ``contrived'' agreement with cousin Steve 
Schott to prevent them from buying her out. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert Ruehlman granted the partners' request for a  
temporary restraining order during a closed hearing in his 
chambers. A full hearing was scheduled for April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	James Burke, a lawyer for the partners, was pleased by the  
ruling but declined further comment. Schott did not return messages 
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents filed with the court show that Schott is trying to  
retain a high profile with the club even after she sells her 
controlling shares. 
</P>
<P>
	She agreed to sell last November rather than face another  
suspension from major league baseball. Schott, who took over the 
team in the mid-1980s, can be forced out by the limited partners 
when the current ownership agreement expires at the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	She signed a preliminary purchase agreement on Feb. 11 with  
Larry Dolan, the brother of Cablevision Systems Corp.'s chairman, 
to sell all but one of her 6 1/2 shares for $65 million. She scrawled 
a dog's paw and ``02'' next to her signature, an indication that 
her St. Bernard also approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal included guarantees that she would maintain her office  
at Cinergy Field and have an office in the club's new ballpark, 
scheduled to open in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	It also said she would have a private luxury suite in the new  
stadium and access to 16 lower-level seats. She also would have 
input on team matters. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball has final say over any deal and most  
likely would reject any provision that keeps Schott in a high 
profile. She has repeatedly been disciplined by the other owners 
for inflammatory remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners have the right to match any offer for  
Schott's shares within 30 days and sent Schott a letter saying they 
would match Dolan's offer on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Schott sent the partners a letter rejecting their  
matching offer, claiming Dolan's offer ``does not exist.'' She also 
said she would enter into another deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from Dolan dated April 1 said Schott was ``mistaken''  
and emphasized that he still intended to buy her shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Monday, Schott informed the partners of a deal to sell her  
shares for $67 million to a group that includes Steve Schott. He 
would receive an estimated $2.68 million payment for his role in 
arranging the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal with her cousin gives Schott even more favorable  
treatment after she sells. In addition to an office and luxury 
suite at the ballpark, she would get 21 tickets and an opportunity 
to participate in the annual opening day parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Whoever purchases her shares also would contribute $250,000  
toward naming rights to a team museum in the new stadium. It would 
be called the ``Schott Hall of Fame/Museum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The limited partners want Ruehlman to rule that Steve Schott's  
offer is invalid and that the partners have properly matched 
Dolan's deal, clearing the way for them to buy controlling 
interest.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Elder Protection Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The greatest threat older Americans now face  
is not a gun-wielding thug but ``a telemarketer armed with a 
deceptive rap,'' President Clinton said Saturday. He proposed 
legislation to shut down telephone scams aimed at the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said also that while the sharply falling crime  
rate is a godsend to older people who once fearfully locked 
themselves into their homes, new protection is needed for nursing 
home residents who ``cannot lock the door against abuse and neglect 
by the people paid to care for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used his weekly radio address to promote the crime bill  
he will send to Congress next month. He said it will impose ``tough 
measures to target people who prey on elderly Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also aims at those who defraud health care plans or  
steal from pensions and retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., sponsor of existing legislation to  
guard the elderly from abuse and fraud, endorsed the president's 
efforts. ``We must strengthen the hands of law enforcement to 
combat those predators who plunder the savings that older Americans 
have worked a lifetime to earn,'' Leahy said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate  
Special Committee on Aging, said he also agrees with the 
president's priorities. ``As the number of older Americans grows, 
so does the number of scams targeting them,'' Grassley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Telemarketing fraud cheats Americans of an estimated $40 billion  
a year, and more than half the victims are over 50, Clinton said. 
``That's like a fraud tax aimed directly at senior citizens,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton bill would give the Justice Department authority to  
cancel telephone service when evidence is found of an illegal 
telemarketing operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you prey on older Americans, we will cut off your phone  
lines and shut you down,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said his administration has already issued rules  
to govern nursing home operations and has stepped up investigations 
of possible abuse or neglect. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when one out of four nursing homes in America does not  
provide quality care ... and when people living in substandard 
nursing homes have as much fear from abuse and neglect as they do 
from the diseases of old age, we must do more,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill gives the Justice Department authority to investigate,  
prosecute and punish operators of nursing homes found to have 
repeatedly abused or neglected residents. Proposed penalties 
include 10-year jail terms for individuals and fines for nursing 
home chains of up to $2 million for each home where residents are 
neglected or abused. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's proposal permits the department seek court  
orders to stop nursing homes from mistreating patients. The plan 
also protects whistle-blowers who tell officials about wrongdoing 
in nursing homes.

<HEADLINE> Protests Against Princeton Prof. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- More than 100 protesters denounced  
Princeton University on Saturday for hiring a philosopher whose 
controversial views include allowing parents to end the lives of 
their severely disabled infants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nazi Germany did the same thing to the disabled, judging their  
lives not worth living. We object to that,'' said John Scaturro, 
49, who protested near the Ivy League school along with his wife 
and young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials stood by the appointment of Peter Singer, a  
professor whose academic work they say will contribute to 
scholarship and ethics debates at Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer, a professor at Monash University in Melbourne,  
Australia, was appointed last year to the Ira W. DeCamp 
Professorship of Bioethics at the university's Center for Human 
Values. He is to begin work in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old academic is widely considered the father of the  
international animal rights movement, and has argued parents should 
have the right to euthanize newborn children who have severe 
handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
	In his books, Singer has said that children less than one month  
old have no human consciousness and do not have the same rights as 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killing a defective infant is not morally equivalent to  
killing a person,'' he wrote in one book. ``Sometimes it is not 
wrong at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His appointment at Princeton has drawn fierce opposition from  
anti-abortion groups, the disabled and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Robert, 51, who uses a wheelchair because of multiple  
sclerosis, protested while wearing a black T-shirt that said ``Not 
Dead Yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want people killing babies like me or adults like  
me,'' Robert said. ``We're just as proud to be alive as anyone 
else. And we have that right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many protesters said Singer's hiring gives inappropriate  
legitimacy to his views. 
</P>
<P>
	Princeton spokesman Justin Harmon defended Singer's hiring and  
suggested that some of his harshest critics have not read his 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to the experts in the field, he is the one of the  
strongest bioethicists out there,'' Harmon said. ``He's been hired 
because of the strength of his teaching and his research, not 
because of any particular point of view he holds for or against any 
issue.''

<HEADLINE> Family Hopes Capsule Remains Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The widow of Mercury astronaut Gus  
Grissom hopes that an expedition being launched this weekend in 
search of her husband's sunken space capsule comes up empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Grissom said Friday she finds it ``disgusting'' that the  
family wasn't consulted from the beginning about the underwater 
salvage effort for the 38-year-old spacecraft, Liberty 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that they do not find it,'' Mrs. Grissom said in a  
telephone interview from her Houston home, just two hours after 
expedition leader Curt Newport met with the press at his chartered 
ship. ``I'm keeping my fingers crossed that something happens that 
they don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 is the only U.S. manned spacecraft lost after a  
successful mission. It sank to the bottom of the Atlantic after 
splashing down with Grissom on July 21, 1961. The explosive bolts 
that blow open the hatch detonated prematurely. Grissom was rescued 
by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport plans to leave Sunday from nearby Port Canaveral on a  
two-week expedition financed by the Discovery Channel, which is 
filming the voyage for a documentary. The ship, named Needham Tide, 
is equipped with the latest in side-scan sonar as well as a 
remote-operated recovery vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport and his crew will survey a 24-square-mile area about 300  
miles offshore at a depth of 15,600 feet. After 14 years of 
analyzing NASA charts and photographs and interviewing witnesses, 
he believes that's where the titanium and aluminum capsule should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though NASA exonerated Grissom in the Liberty 7 mishap and  
he went on to fly in Gemini, there was debate over whether the 
hatch malfunctioned or he accidentally knocked a switch, or even 
panicked and blew the hatch open. He died in the Apollo launch pad 
fire in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe the mystery could be solved if the hatch is found.  
Newport said he will search for the hatch only if he has enough 
time; it could be as far away from the capsule as a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans now call for the capsule, if found, to be restored at the  
Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson, Kan. It would be 
sent on tour following its $250,000, six-month-period of sprucing 
up, then put on display at the cosmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	If Liberty Bell 7 is recovered, Mrs. Grissom said she would like  
it simply cleaned and left in its original condition, not made to 
look like ``a copper pot.'' And she'd prefer it be put on display 
in a place that doesn't have a spacecraft exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want people to see what it really looked like and it's  
not going to be that if it goes to Kansas,'' Mrs. Grissom said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the cosmosphere, Karen Siebert, said the goal  
is to preserve the spacecraft, not make it pristine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of the allure of the spacecraft is it's been on the ocean  
floor for over 30 years,'' she said. ``We want to return it to its 
postflight condition, but retaining that part of the story.''

<HEADLINE> $105M Man Savaged by Padres Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- It was all about the money when Kevin Brown  
returned to the mound at Qualcomm Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres' fans, who lovingly cheered their team even after it was  
swept in the World Series, delighted in savaging Brown, who in turn 
was cashed in by his former teammates on his first visit to San 
Diego since October. 
</P>
<P>
	The boos began 25 minutes before Friday night's game, when Brown  
began running warmups in the outfield. They reached a crescendo 
when his name was called in the Los Angeles Dodgers' starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	As Brown threw his warmup pitches in the bottom of the first  
inning, the Beatles' ``Can't Buy Me Love'' blared from the sound 
system. Pink Floyd's ``Money'' led off the bottom of the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beatles tune was played at the suggestion of owner John  
Moores, who offered $60 million over six years in an attempt to 
keep Brown, the hired gun whose intensity rubbed off on the Padres 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, of course, snubbed that offer and became baseball's first  
$100 million man, getting $105 million over seven years from the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we clean his clock,'' Moores said in the Padres dugout  
before the game. ``That's what we're supposed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moores got his wish. Brown couldn't buy a win, losing his first  
decision of the year, 3-0, as the Padres' new ace, Andy Ashby, was 
brilliant in throwing a five-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Moores even suggested that the Padres leave Brown's NL  
championship ring on home plate. He'll get it sometime this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Brown was largely responsible for getting the Padres to the  
World Series, which in turn got them a new downtown ballpark 
approved by the voters less than two weeks after being swept by the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	But that seemed like ancient history to the crowd of 48,943,  
which provided a playoff-like atmosphere on a perfect spring night. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dodgers manager Davey Johnson walked out to remove Brown in  
the seventh after Wally Joyner's RBI double put the Padres up 3-0, 
the fans stood and roared. The final boos of the night came as 
Brown walked slowly toward the dugout. One man leaned over the 
railing, flashing cash at the right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	As he exited, Brown, who's from Macon, was serenaded by Gladys  
Knight and the Pips' ``Midnight Train To Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments earlier, a life-size pinata resembling Brown, hanging by  
the neck from a stick, was smashed apart by the Padres' Friar 
mascot. Fake dollar bills tumbled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn, who had his second three-hit game of the season to  
pull within 55 of 3,000, said it wasn't necessarily the worst he's 
seen Padres fans. They love to bash Barry Bonds and pillory Mike 
Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was spirited, I'll say that.'' Gwynn said of the fans. I  
didn't think it would be like it was, but they paid their money. 
They're entitled to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Padres players, including Gwynn, spoke of respect for Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bruce Bochy did too, but also seemed to side with the  
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what kind of reaction they'd have,'' Bochy said.  
``Hey, it's our park. It's good for the game, I mean, it definitely 
brought a lot more attention to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real strange seeing him in a different uniform. That's  
part of the game. It's baseball now in the 90s. Hey, we all make 
decisions. It's behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby called it a difficult situation for Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of respect for Brownie,'' he said. ``If anyone  
can handle it, he sure can, I guarantee that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, the loser in Game 4 of the World Series, claimed it was  
no worse than playing in Atlanta, or in Houston during last year's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to boo, that's their choice,'' he said. ``The  
Dodgers aren't real popular down here. I don't think they were last 
year, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown took the musical razzing in stride.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my song, so I didn't pay attention to it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Thomas Accused of Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CROWLEY, La. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings free safety Orlando Thomas  
was arrested Friday night after his wife accused him of assaulting 
her, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 26, was booked on a charge of domestic violence after  
his arrest at 11:30 p.m., according to a press release issued by 
Acadia Parish Sheriff Kenneth Goss. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas' wife was treated at a local hospital and released. The  
statement did not give her name or any specifics about her 
injuries. Thomas was held briefly at the Acadia Parish Jail until 
he posted bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was born in Crowley and owns a home in the town, which is  
140 miles west of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings re-signed Thomas, their starting free safety, to a  
four-year contract worth $11 million in February. The deal includes 
a $2.75 million signing bonus -- most of it deferred -- and incentive 
money aimed at improving Thomas' workout habits.

<HEADLINE> Florida Fire Victims Survey Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Martha Brann started to cry when she  
thought about all she lost when her ranch-style house burned to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone were the photos of her children, the diamond ring from her  
ex-husband and her mother's gold wedding band -- all mementos 
representing special times in her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't get nothing,'' she said Friday in front of the  
charred rubble that remained of her three-bedroom home, one of 43 
destroyed by a raging wildfire the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-three other homes were damaged in the 545-acre blaze in  
the wooded neighborhood west of Port St. Lucie. No injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	With the fire controlled but flames still smoldering Friday,  
firefighters were heartened by rain that began falling at dusk and 
the prospect of thunderstorms today in the Port St. Lucie area. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a lack of recent rainfall -- 90 percent below normal  
during Florida's traditional dry season -- that has produced 
tinder-dry conditions throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty new fires burned 2,266 acres Friday, including 1,700  
acres in Collier, Lee and Hendry counties, Barbara Doran, 
spokeswoman for the state Emergency Operation Center in 
Tallahassee, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,450 fires have burned 60,166 acres in 1999, Doran  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities suggested Thursday's blaze may have been sparked by  
an arsonist, then helped along by record-high temperatures and 
strong 30 mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	At random, the fast-moving blaze skipped some homes, while  
torching others. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dufresne was among the fortunate ones. Across the street  
from his two-bedroom house, the woods were charred. So were the 
pines and shrubbery in an adjacent lot. Behind his property, only 
the yellow stucco walls remained of a neighbor's house. 
</P>
<P>
	Somehow, Dufresne's house survived. Though the inferno burned  
within inches of its wood exterior, the building remained 
untouched. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty fantastic,'' said the 49-year-old handyman.  
``It's like somebody was watching over us ... It burned on all 
sides, but not us. That's really weird, isn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dufresne got a helping hand from Jim Scheib and Bill Harvey, who  
live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	When the fires first hit, Scheib borrowed a 4,000-gallon sewage  
tanker from a friend who runs a disposal company. Scheib and Harvey 
raced around the neighborhood, spraying water at anything in danger 
of burning. Every so often, they stopped to douse their own 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd see the flames jump from one place to another,'' said  
Scheib, 30, who refilled the tanker three times from a nearby 
canal. ``You'd put it out, but they'd keep coming back on. Somehow, 
we got spared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he surveyed the blackened scene in front of him, Dufresne was  
reminded of a comment he made while looking over the same acreage 
just a few days before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Boy, if a fire ever comes across here, it'll just  
cook like that,''' he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials warned that Florida was not out of danger, and said  
fires were burning in about a third of the state's 67 counties 
Friday. At least 7,000 acres had burned in central and southwestern 
Florida and in St. Lucie County about 100 miles southeast of 
Orlando. Small fires also persisted in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
	John Fish, a senior forester with the state Division of  
Forestry, warned that ``it's like a powder keg around the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them haven't gone off yet and it can happen at any  
time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before surveying the damage by helicopter Friday, Gov. Jeb Bush  
said he was asking for an additional $13.2 million in the state 
budget for firefighting efforts. Federal officials also said they 
will make money available to help with costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we are going to have to deal with around the  
state for the rest of the year,'' Bush said.

<HEADLINE> School Clergy Plan Struck Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAUMONT, Texas (AP) -- A school program that brought local  
clergy to counsel students about morality and civic virtues was 
ruled unconstitutional by a federal appeals panel. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals,  
voting 2-1 on Friday to overturn a 1996 federal district court 
ruling, sided with seven students and parents who argued the 
Beaumont Independent School District program violated the 
Constitutional separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ``Clergy in the Schools'' program, which began in 1996,  
local religious leaders were invited to counsel elementary and 
secondary students at the schools during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The district said the program let students discuss morality and  
civic virtues, helped increase school safety and gave a local group 
an interest in the schools. The clergy were not to discuss 
religion, sex or abortion and were not to pray with students. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The school district's) creation of a special program that  
recruits only clergymen to render volunteer counseling makes a 
clear statement that it favors religion over nonreligion,'' the 
panel ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges said the clergy selected were disproportionately  
Protestants. Parents were not notified or asked to give consent, 
though students could decline to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a very sad day,'' said board member Woodrow  
Reece. ``I didn't see any harm (from the program), but I did see a 
lot of good. Students need some type of mentors to come into 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court panel sent the case back to the federal  
district court to issue any orders necessary to prohibit the 
district from continuing with the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the  
Anti-Defamation League submitted briefs in support of the 
complaining students and parents.

<HEADLINE> Wohlers Traded From Braves to Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark Wohlers didn't want to go back to the minor  
leagues for the Atlanta Braves. He's willing to make the move in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	After turning down a minor league assignment from the Braves,  
Wohlers was traded to the Reds on Friday for reliever John Hudek. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati, which also receives at least $4.4 million from  
Atlanta to cover Wohlers' hefty salary, will place the former 
closer on the 15-day disabled list. After that, he will join 
Triple-A Indianapolis for a rehabilitation assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're completely satisfied that physically he's fine,''  
Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden said. ``It's mental, 
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers saved 97 games from 1995-97 and was on the mound for one  
of the most memorable moments in Atlanta history, getting the final 
three outs of the '95 World Series to give the Braves their only 
championship during a run of seven straight playoff appearances 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 29-year-old right-hander, who throws nearly 100 mph, had  
a baffling lapse in control last season and wound up in the minor 
leagues. He reclaimed a spot on the team in spring trouble but 
walked six in his first two appearances and was assigned outright 
to Triple-A Richmond on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers refused the assignment, leaving Atlanta with a week to  
either trade him or release him. After talking with five teams, 
general manager John Schuerholz worked out a deal with the Reds 
prior to the Friday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a matter of getting comfortable again,'' Wohlers  
said. ``I think a fresh start is something that will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta will pay Cincinnati the difference between Wohlers' $5.2  
million salary this season and Hudek's $800,000, according to 
Cincinnati general manager Jim Bowden. The Braves will give the 
Reds an additional $800,000 if Cincinnati doesn't exercise Wohlers' 
$5.5 million option for 2000 and opts to pay an $800,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	But the deal will cut Atlanta's luxury tax payment next January  
by about $1.13 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``While circumstances surrounding Mark Wohlers placed us in a  
challenging and difficult circumstance, we feel this resolution is 
win-win,'' Schuerholz said. ``We acquire a proven major league 
relief pitcher and Wohlers gets a chance to restart his career with 
the Reds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers set a franchise record with 39 saves in 1996 and had 33  
the following season. In 1998, he pulled a muscle in his side, 
apparently tried to come back too soon and discovered he couldn't 
throw strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sent to Triple-A Richmond, but had no success there  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	After working out over the winter with special instructor Guy  
Hansen, Wohlers showed progress in spring training. But he walked 
four of the first seven batters he faced in the season opener, then 
had two walks and an error while facing three batters in his next 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been tough,'' said Wohlers, who started with the Braves  
organization in 1988. ``It's been a lot of sleepless nights, 
tossing and turning, wondering what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``If not being able to throw a strike is the  
worst thing that happens to me, that's not so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers went back to Richmond twice last season, posting an ERA  
of 20.43 with 36 walks in 12 1-3 innings. He saw no reason to 
return to the minor leagues again with the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both times I went to Richmond last year, it got worse,'' he  
said. ``It just wasn't working. I didn't want to make the same 
mistakes a third time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves are now without two pitchers who accounted for 135  
saves over the past four seasons. Kerry Ligtenberg, who stepped in 
to save 30 games when Wohlers faltered in 1998, suffered a 
season-ending elbow injury during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schuerholz said he is not concerned about the state of the  
bullpen. John Rocker has six strikeouts in 2 1-3 innings, while 
Rudy Seanez and rookie Kevin McGlinchey both have ERAs below 2.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know the closer is a unique kind of animal, but I think  
Rocker may be, too,'' Schuerholz said. ``I'm confident John can do 
the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds aren't sure what they'll get from Wohlers. He will have  
access to a battery of medical and psychiatric specialists in 
addition to working with Reds pitching coach Don Gullett, who 
helped revive the careers of Pete Schourek and Pete Harnisch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have a dominant closer,'' Bowden said. ``We may have  
nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hudek, who joined the Braves for their weekend series at  
Colorado, worked in a career-high 58 games last season, splitting 
time with the New York Mets and Cincinnati. He was 5-6 with a 3.09 
ERA and 68 strikeouts in 64 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old has appeared in two games this year, going 0-1  
with a 27.00 ERA.

<HEADLINE> El-Amin Still a Hit With the Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A parade honoring national champion  
Connecticut provided a smooth ending Saturday to what had been a 
very rough week for popular point guard Khalid El-Amin. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 sophomore was arrested on marijuana charges  
Tuesday, 15 days after leading his team to the national title over 
Duke. By Thursday, he had delivered a public apology to his team 
and fans. On Friday, he helped pick up trash as part of his 
community service that will wipe his record clean in 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
	And on Saturday, as he rode atop a flatbed on the 1 1/2-mile route,  
he was clearly the fan favorite. His fans delivered the message 
loud and clear that they were ready to forgive and forget. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserves to be here,'' Rudy Vogel said. ``He means a lot to  
this team. He's the one that pumps them all up. He's the one who 
gets them going. He just made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Campbell couldn't wipe the giant smile off her face after  
El-Amin called out to her ``I love you.'' He waved and threw kisses 
back at her as she made her affection known. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am in love with El-Amin,'' she said. ``I hate what happened  
the other day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elena Lojardi arrived four hours before the start of the parade  
to get a prime spot on the route. 
</P>
<P>
	She unfurled a banner that read: ``Khalid El-Amin We Support  
You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good guy. He's got a good heart and he always means  
well,'' she said. ``He's a big reason why this day is happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He certainly loomed large nearly three weeks ago. El-Amin coolly  
sank two free throws with five seconds remaining in the title game. 
They were the final points in the Huskies' 77-74 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin, 19, said he was grateful for the outpouring.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel comfortable that the fans still support me, and they  
did it in such a way that I really felt it and really am 
appreciative of that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team members donned T-shirts that adorned with the slogan  
``Mission Accomplished.'' They blew kisses back to the crowd, and 
signed everything from basketballs to pennants that were tossed 
their way. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol police said more than 250,000 people turned out for the  
parade. There were some scary moments. A young girl was injured 
when she darted into the street and was hit by a police motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
	As hundreds of children and adults crowded around the team float  
tossing shirts, balls and caps to the players to sign, a few 
youngsters became separated from their parents in the crush. Police 
said by parade's end, all had been reunited. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Calhoun and his wife, Pat, sat atop a red convertible  
just ahead of the team. Calhoun, who arrived at UConn 13 years ago, 
said the emotions of the day were ``absolutely astounding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The championship marked UConn's first trip to the Final Four in  
21 tries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only did the championship capture the state,'' Calhoun  
said. ``I can tell you right now, it's certainly captured us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the parade, Calhoun and senior captains Rashamel Jones and  
Ricky Moore addressed nearly 70,000 people on the lawn of the state 
Capitol in a rally that included remarks from Gov. John G. Rowland, 
university officials and state lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``On behalf of the team, we simply want to say `We love you',''  
said Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
	``You gave us motivation all year long,'' said Moore, whose  
tough defense bottled up the Duke attack. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin did admit there may have been a point during the day  
when he disappointed some fans. Tossing the right autographed 
T-shirt or cap back to the right kid, he said, was more difficult 
that feeding a teammate with an alley-oop pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a couple shirts I got from one side and I went to the  
other side and threw it over there. So I know there's a lot of fans 
out there that are upset at me,'' he said. ``But I hope they'll 
understand.''

<HEADLINE> Gretzky's Departure Will Leave Void </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky's brilliant career is still a game  
away from completion. The appreciation of his talent and numerous 
achievements will last forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the best to ever play hockey,'' Buffalo Sabres  
goaltender Dominic Hasek said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, 38, announced at a Friday news conference that his  
career will come to a close Sunday when he and his New York Rangers 
teammates play the Pittsburgh Penguins at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``Say it ain't so,'' said Gordie Howe, who held many of the  
records that Gretzky shattered. ``He's a proud man. And when you're 
hurting, it makes you think (about retirement). So, it's best that 
I congratulate him. I would (have liked) to seen him wait until 
training camp (to make his decision). He's going to leave a big 
void.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who owns 61 NHL records, insisted that he was sure of  
his decision to retire now and helped convince those around him 
that it was the right time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne's a very proud person and he wanted to go out on his own  
terms,'' Rangers coach John Muckler said. ``Maybe he felt that if 
he didn't do it now, he wouldn't be able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muckler, credited by Gretzky for influencing his hockey life as  
much as anyone, still tried to change the star's mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I learned one thing, I shouldn't go into sales,'' Muckler said  
of his failed attempt. ``I wasn't very convincing ... he was. It 
just makes sense. It's the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only was Gretzky the best at scoring goals, his skill at  
setting up others was even better. His 1,962 assists are more than 
any other player has points. 
</P>
<P>
	``He found everybody that was open,'' said Luc Robitaille who  
scored 63 goals for the Kings in 1992-93 while playing on a line 
with The Great One. ``He became the greatest player of all time, 
then he became the greatest playmaker of all time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he played only for NHL teams in the United States  
following his trade from the Edmonton Oilers in 1988, Gretzky's 
standing in his native Canada never waned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is truly a bittersweet moment,'' Canadian prime minister  
Jean Chretien said in a statement. ``One of the greatest players 
ever to play our national game has decided to hang up his skates. 
No longer will our arenas be energized by his presence and 
electrified by his performance. No longer will we be able to thrill 
in anticipation of his next wondrous play. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we can take heart from the endless, magical memories he  
has given us. Most of all, we can feel reassured that his example 
of decency and sportsmanship will continue to inspire generations 
of young hockey players -- and all young Canadians -- for years to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Lemieux, the six-time NHL scoring champion and prospective  
Pittsburgh Penguins owner, was so inspired by Gretzky that he asked 
for his trademark No. 99 as a junior hockey player long before he 
would make his own No. 66 famous. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's meant a lot to the game. He's really changed the game and  
changed the approach of many young players,'' Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 20 seasons, from Edmonton to his shocking trade to Los  
Angeles, a brief stint in St. Louis and his final stop in New York, 
Gretzky had many teammates. But the time and success he shared with 
Mark Messier with the Oilers and then again for one season with the 
Rangers will always be remembered by hockey fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's been great players before us, there have been  
great players with us and there's going to be great players after 
us,'' Messier said. ``The game is always bigger than any 
individual. Always has been. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe with the exception of Wayne, who has really transcended  
the game when he first came into the National Hockey League and 
changed the way the game was looked at and the way it was played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in three years, Rangers general manager Neil  
Smith has the difficult task of replacing a star. First it was 
Messier, and now Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he knew it was special to see Gretzky wear No. 99 in  
a Rangers blue shirt and have him finish his career in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were lucky just to have him in our uniform,'' Smith said.  
``The whole three years he's been here, every day has been a 
pinch-me day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, in the span of just a few weeks, sports fans have had to  
deal with the departure of Michael Jordan and Gretzky, a fact not 
lost on current Penguins star Jaromir Jagr. 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be another Jordan. There won't be another  
Gretzky.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Speaks of Balkans Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Recalling an uncle who suffered poison  
gas exposure in World War I, Vice President Al Gore said his family 
is ``one of millions that knows firsthand'' about the Balkans' role 
in world stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the 21st century be shaped and molded by thugs in ski  
masks with weapons in their hands and hatred in their hearts? The 
answer given by the people of the United States of America is no,'' 
Gore said Friday night at his first Tennessee fund-raiser for the 
2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We saw midway through this century the moral consequences of  
crimes against humanity that occurred with much of the world 
standing by, not doing much of anything about it,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to about 450 Democratic supporters gathered at a  
$1,000-per-plate dinner, Gore promised to get Kosovar refugees 
``back to their homes, with security and with justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is expected to spend this weekend campaigning in New  
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore hasn't officially announced his campaign for the 2000  
Democratic nomination, but has raised $8.9 million, according to 
the Federal Election Commission.

<HEADLINE> Washington Times Changes Sundays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No more leafing through the paper to get those  
Saturday scores for readers of The Washington Times. Starting 
Sunday, the sports section comes first. 
</P>
<P>
	In a ``letter from the editor'' in Friday's newspaper, editor in  
chief Wesley Pruden said the outside of Sunday editions will now be 
the new Sunday Sports Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports editor Gary Hopkins said, ``We've always been known for  
politics, national issues, trends, things like that. We were 
looking for something unique. Sports is big. When you think about 
what happened Saturday, what are people going to the Sunday paper 
for?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire sports section will be the `A' section,'' he said,  
nearly double the size of the Times' normal Sunday sports sections. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside will be the regular Sunday paper, ``a convenient pull-out  
section with the usual front page of The Times,'' Pruden said.

<HEADLINE> New Information Frees Convicted Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A man who spent more than three years in prison  
for a 1995 killing has been released by authorities who say he may 
have been wrongly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury in October 1996 convicted Marlon Passley of first-degree  
murder for the killing of 18-year-old Tennyson Drakes, who was shot 
in the head. Passley was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	But after authorities learned of new information, prosecutors on  
Wednesday petitioned a judge on the Supreme Judicial Court to stay 
his sentence. On Friday, the judge complied and Passley, now 26, 
was released. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Borghesani, spokesman for the Suffolk County district  
attorney's office, said that prosecutors and police learned two 
weeks ago that it was probable Passley did not commit the crime. 
Authorities refused to discuss the new evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``To not do something would have been unethical and possibly  
illegal,'' said Boston Police Lt. Detective Paul Farrahar. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you get three years back?,'' asked Borghesani. ``I  
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Passley's attorneys said that he was  
``enormously grateful for his freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Marlon Passley has always maintained his innocence since his  
arrest in this case,'' said Mark Horrigan, Passley's trial 
attorney, and Mary Rogers, who handled Passley's appeal. ``He hopes 
that the investigation will lead to the real murderer being 
prosecuted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drakes' family has been notified of Passley's release and the  
investigation is ongoing, Borghesani said. 
</P>
<P>
	Potentially, Passley's conviction could be vacated, said David  
Meier, chief asssistant district attorney.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Swingin On Ice remained undefeated in  
three starts by winning the $135,350 Grade II Beaumont Stakes in 
record time Saturday at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden for the first time by Robby Albarado, the daughter of El  
Prado caught pacesetter Secret Hills with less than a furlong 
remaining and pulled away to a two-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Time for the seven furlongs, 184 feet on a fast track was 1:25  
3-5, 2-5 of a second faster than the stakes record held by Golden 
Gale. 
</P>
<P>
	Secret Hills led from the start, increasing her lead to 1 1/2  
lengths at the top of the stretch, but had to settle for second, 3 1/2 
lengths in front of Appealing Phylly. 
</P>
<P>
	Confessional, winner of the Grade I Frizette Stakes as a  
2-year-old and the 7-10 favorite, finished sixth in the field of 
seven 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by Don Amos and trained by Josie Carroll, Swingin On Ice  
picked up $83,917 for the victory, increasing her career earnings

<HEADLINE> Fans Bid Farewell to BoxCar Willie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- It was BoxCar Willie's last public  
appearance, and it drew a full house as about 900 people filled the 
Branson entertainer's theater to say goodbye to America's singing 
hobo. 
</P>
<P>
	BoxCar Willie, whose given name was Lecil Martin, died last week  
of leukemia at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the mourners who crowded in to the BoxCar Willie Theater  
on Branson's strip Saturday afternoon were many of the mountain 
music town's biggest stars, including Mel Tillis, Andy Williams, 
Jim Stafford and Yakov Smirnoff, and nearly each one had a warm 
memory to share about the years they had known the entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We served in the Air Force together, in Lincoln, Neb., 45  
years ago,'' Tillis recalled after the 45-minute service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a baker and he was a flight engineer. He used to come by  
the place where I did my baking, and we'd sit on the flour sacks 
and pick our guitars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also among the mourners were family, friends and fans of the  
entertainer, though BoxCar Willie fans for the most part considered 
themselves his friends as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Many had come to his theater several times over the years since  
he had arrived in Branson in 1986 and had gotten to know him 
visiting backstage after performances. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were Mary Lee Mousel and her husband Ronald, who came  
from Hollister. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really going to miss him,'' she said. ``We've been  
praying for him to make it back. We just pray that he is with the 
Lord now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral, meanwhile, was as much a celebration of the  
entertainer's life as a chance to mourn his passing. 
</P>
<P>
	The performer was seen in several video clips from his show over  
the years singing such songs as ``The Wabash Cannonball'' and 
``I've Seen It All From a Boxcar Door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As several people in the audience wept, including some veterans  
who had served with BoxCar Willie during the 22 years he spent in 
the Air Force, the Rev. Cliff Braschler told them not to fear 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	He said BoxCar Willie loved life and lived to enjoy every moment  
of it and, because of that, he didn't fear death either. 
</P>
<P>
	On that subject, BoxCar Willie himself seemed to have the last  
word when mourners heard him sing: 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll ride that last train to heaven, on rails of solid gold,  
</P>
<P>
	``In a boxcar filled with satin, where the nights are never  
cold. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where the hobo's always welcome, even in his raggedy clothes.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll ride that last train to heaven, when the final whistle  
blows.''

<HEADLINE> Furniture Fires Kill As Feds Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Karen Wright spent her last moments huddled  
in the bathtub of her mobile home, breathing poison. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager escaped the flames that started when an electrical  
spark ignited a living room love seat. But she couldn't elude the 
swirl of deadly cyanide gas and carbon monoxide that forms when 
foam inside sofa and chair cushions burns. 
</P>
<P>
	The poisonous cloud knocked her 11-year-old sister, Dee Ann,  
unconscious within reach of the front door. There, the intense heat 
from two flaming couches seared 96 percent of her body. Since the 
Feb. 4, 1998, blaze, she has remained in an Augusta hospital, her 
hands and feet gone, her lungs scarred, her heart failing, and her 
body draped for months with pig and cadaver skin until doctors 
could graft laboratory-grown skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen and Dee Ann never knew a sofa could burn as easily as  
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	The government did.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators and furniture makers have known for more than  
two decades that the foam in most sofa cushions is highly 
flammable, emits deadly gases when it burns and kills hundreds of 
Americans each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters call the foam ``solid gasoline.''  
</P>
<P>
	For decades federal prisons, airline regulators and the state of  
California have outlawed furniture that isn't fire-retardant. But 
after 27 years, the federal government is still working on a rule 
that would give similar protection to the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to lobbying by the furniture industry and a congressman from  
a furniture town, it won't be enacted this year either. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice if someone else never had to go through  
this,'' said Dee Ann and Karen's mother, Jeannie South, who quit 
her job to spend each day in Dee Ann's hospital room, caressing and 
reading to a child who cries and speaks only in rare monosyllables. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes all you need is a chance. My room was closed off, so  
I had a chance,'' she said. ``They didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze that swept their North Augusta, S.C., home is all too  
common. Each year about 10,000 fires start in upholstered 
furniture, causing more than 500 deaths, 1,100 injuries and more 
than $150 million in property loss, according to federal fire 
statistics. Those fires account for one in four fire deaths and 
kill more Americans than chain saws, off-road vehicles or any of 
the 15,000 other products regulated by the Consumer Products Safety 
Commission, a federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason lies inside the cushions of millions of chairs and  
sofas. 
</P>
<P>
	What gives 90 percent of upholstered furniture its softness is  
polyurethane foam, a spongy material that's much less expensive 
than down but is created from a petroleum base that makes it highly 
flammable. 
</P>
<P>
	When it burns, it spreads in seconds and radiates an intense  
heat that can roast flesh, even if the victim isn't touched by the 
flames. After the fire at Dee Ann and Karen's house was over, a 
stack of compact disks lay melted on Karen's dresser in a room the 
fire never reached. Dee Ann was in the blazing living room. 
</P>
<P>
	The foam also gives off a deadly cloud of poisonous gases. Among  
them: carbon monoxide, the lethal vapor Dr. Jack Kevorkian used to 
help patients commit suicide, and cyanide, the gas used to execute 
prisoners in some states. 
</P>
<P>
	No warning labels are required to notify consumers of the  
danger. The strongest warnings are on labels the public never sees. 
</P>
<P>
	One manufacturer ships foam to furniture makers with a tag that  
reads ``This foam can burn fast ... resulting in great heat, 
generating dangerous and potentially toxic gas and thick smoke ... 
If foam starts burning -- get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few furniture makers pass those warnings on to consumers,  
although some give toned-down warnings that urge caution. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters are among the few Americans who understand the  
hazard. Randy Sellnow, fire chief in Oregon, Wis., can't shake the 
memory of one of his first fire calls, when toxic fumes killed 
three children who were playing with matches on an upholstered 
chair. The fumes acted so quickly the children couldn't escape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The victims that we had that day -- there's one I'll never  
forget as long as I live. An 11-year-old girl,'' he said. ``She had 
two small burns. Beyond that there was nothing ... . But it was a 
terribly smoky fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years manufacturers have known how to make furniture  
fire-retardant. Some spray chemicals on the back of the covering 
fabric. Others treat the foam with fire retardants or place a 
fireproof barrier between foam and fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	At the urging of state fire marshals, the Consumer Products  
Safety Commission has drafted a regulation to require upholstered 
furniture to meet minimum fire-retardant standards. If the agency's 
three commissioners vote to approve it, the rule would have the 
force of law. As it stands, the draft rule would require furniture 
fabrics to resist an open flame for 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	This extra safety comes at a price -- the cost of three pizzas.  
</P>
<P>
	Furniture makers could meet the planned rule for $22 to $28 per  
sofa, the agency says. Treating a dining room chair would cost $4 
to $6. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a small price to pay for the life of a child,'' said  
Ann Brown, chairwoman of the consumer protection agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Requiring all furniture in the United States to meet the  
standard would cost the $16 billion retail furniture industry $460 
million to $720 million, regulators say, although some of that cost 
might be passed along to the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Furniture makers don't quarrel with those numbers, but say there  
are better, cheaper ways to cut furniture fires, like requiring 
smoke detectors in every home. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a recognition in our industry that we produce one of  
the products that's involved in residential fires,'' said Russell 
Batson, spokesman for the American Furniture Manufacturers 
Association. ``But it is worth questioning whether there are 
approaches that, while not product-specific, would have a broader 
impact. ... For better or for worse, we're living in a universe of 
finite resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Fire Marshal Don Bliss, who has led the campaign  
by state fire marshals for a national standard, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It costs somewhere in the neighborhood of $150 to $200 to make  
the average couch, which costs $800 or $900,'' he said. ``We 
question the need for the added cost even to be passed on to the 
consumer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furniture makers note that retailers get a large share of  
markups. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators have known since the early 1970s that  
upholstered furniture poses an especially potent fire hazard. At 
the time, they stood at the vanguard of fire safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Transportation set fire safety rules for car  
seats in 1971. A year later the Department of Commerce published 
``A Possible Finding of Need for a Flammability Standard for 
Upholstered Furniture,'' pointing out the high death toll and the 
technology available to curb it. Airline regulators set rules to 
protect passenger seats, and the Bureau of Prisons issued rules 
requiring fire protection for prison furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the Consumer Products Safety Commission assumed  
oversight of furniture in 1973, it declined to enact rules on 
household furniture. In 1981, the agency voted not to require 
flame-retardant furniture. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the agency's biggest critics is Ms. Brown, who has been  
running it since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an agency that was all bun and no beef. It was  
inactive,'' she said. ``I would agree with the fire community that 
the agency was not doing its job before, and I'm glad to say that 
we are doing so now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California officials, tired of waiting for a federal standard,  
passed their own in 1974. Britain followed suit in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Damant is a fire-safety consultant who helped write  
California's law. The way he sees it, the federal government could 
have spared the lives of thousands of Americans had it acted when 
California did. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can give people even a few seconds to escape a fire,  
you can save their lives,'' Damant said. ``Look, the technology 
exists. Furniture manufacturers are, in fact, complying with it in 
California.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Damant is testifying in Jeannie South's lawsuit against two  
furniture makers. Neither he nor her lawyers, David Zacks and Ray 
Chadwick of Kilpatrick Stockton, would comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	California requires cover fabric to resist an open flame for one  
second and foam to be treated with fire-retardant chemicals. The 
planned federal rule would require treatment of fabric only. 
</P>
<P>
	California regulators say the state's rule has saved lives. The  
state had 18 deaths compared with 700 nationally in 1991, according 
to a study. With about 10 percent of the national population, 
California would have had 70 deaths at the national rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Furniture makers acknowledge that furniture fire deaths in  
California have decreased much faster than nationally. But they 
point to other reasons: strict smoke-detector requirements and 
fewer smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason the federal government hasn't given consumers the  
same fire protection it gives prisoners lies in Washington and in 
furniture-making towns like High Point, N.C., and Tupelo, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	As the federal government considered regulations in the 1970s,  
the furniture industry sought to avoid them by creating a voluntary 
standard. It requires that furniture fabrics resist smoldering 
cigarettes, but not fires from matches and other open flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Although only about 260 of the nation's 1,500 furniture makers  
and importers agreed to it, consumer regulators say 83 percent of 
furniture complies. The industry says it's 92 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths from furniture fires started by cigarettes and cigars  
fell from 1,150 in 1980 to 410 in 1994. But the number of deaths 
related to furniture set afire by open flames such as matches, 
candles and cigarette lighters has changed little in the last two 
decades, with nearly 100 dying and 460 becoming injured yearly in 
3,100 such fires. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be another problem with the voluntary rule: Federal  
researchers found that chemicals used on fabrics to resist 
smoldering embers of cigarettes might actually make fires from open 
flames faster, hotter and more toxic. 
</P>
<P>
	When federal regulators used those numbers in considering the  
fire marshals' request to adopt California's standard nationally, 
furniture makers turned to Congress. They appealed to Rep. Roger 
Wicker, a Republican from Tupelo, where furniture makers employ 
more workers than any other industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Wicker inserted a clause in a congressional bill last summer,  
forbidding the safety commission from setting a furniture standard 
until the National Academy of Sciences conducts a study on whether 
fire-retardant chemicals are safe for workers and consumers. The 
commission already did that study, identifying at least five 
chemicals that could be used that are not considered hazardous by 
the Environmental Protection Agency. The academy's results are 
expected in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Wicker said he didn't trust the CPSC. He said he's worried about  
safety and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brown points out that Wicker hasn't been a leader among  
environmentalists. The League of Conservation Voters has 
consistently given Wicker among the lowest ratings in Congress for 
his votes on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a congressman responding more to the special interests  
of his constituents than to the health and safety needs of 
America's families,'' Ms. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The furniture industry is clearly behind Wicker.  
</P>
<P>
	Since Wicker was elected in 1994 he has received $29,200 from  
furniture makers. His top contributor over the past two years has 
been the American Furniture Manufacturer's Association, which gave 
him $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you who also is behind me,'' Wicker said. ``That is  
the thousands -- thousands -- of upholstered furniture workers 
throughout the country who want to work in a safe place. ... They 
want to have confidence that they don't have an increased risk of 
cancer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furniture makers have been even more generous to federal  
lawmakers and their political parties at large -- giving $3.1 
million since 1991, an amount equal to Dee Ann Wright's medical 
bills so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother had hoped to take her home as early as April, but the  
child is now recovering from a second heart attack. Dr. Joseph 
Still says her case is the worst he's seen since he founded the 
burn unit at Columbia-Augusta Regional Medical Center 20 years ago. 
When she does come home, she'll have to remain in a 
climate-controlled environment for the rest of her life, because 
her grafted skin will leave her unable to sweat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't even told her about Karen, although I think she  
senses it. We're going to have to work with her to deal with her 
grief,'' Ms. South said. ``Right now we're just trying to keep her 
alive.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Rambis Wanted Rodman Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- To Los Angeles Lakers coach Kurt Rambis, it  
was a pretty easy call -- he believes his team will be better off 
without Dennis Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	An indication could come as soon as tonight in Utah when the  
Lakers begin the post-Rodman era. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis hit the wall after yet another incident involving Rodman  
at Thursday's practice, and that led to the release of the 
seven-time NBA rebounding champion later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers management acted swiftly and decisively in support of the  
man named coach on Feb. 26, coincidentally the same day Rodman 
played his first game with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a time where we need an ultimate focus and  
concentration,'' Rambis said after Friday's practice and just 
before the Lakers left for Salt Lake City, where they'll face the 
powerful Jazz in a nationally televised game. ``I just think this 
is better for the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 next month, has had a terrific career and  
has been a part of five championship teams, including the last 
three with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	However, his unreliability has been an issue for years, although  
the Michael Jordan-led Bulls generally kept him in line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers don't have a Michael Jordan. And now, they don't have  
Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was justified,'' Lakers standout Kobe Bryant said  
when asked his opinion of the move to place Rodman on waivers. 
``When a guy shows up continuously late ... Yeah, it was definitely 
justified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bryant also said, ``I'm a little disappointed. I wanted  
Dennis to hang around. Winning cures everything. He helped us out, 
to be honest with you. When he was here, he did provide us with a 
lot of energy. I would love to have Dennis right now. If we had won 
the last two games, he would still be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't win the last two, losing 113-109 to Seattle at  
the Forum on Sunday and 113-86 at Portland on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis claimed he had a sore left elbow and didn't play at all  
in the second half at Portland. It was the fourth time in his 23 
games with the team he had opted not to return to a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Thursday. According to Rambis, Rodman arrived late for  
the team's practice at Los Angeles Southwest College and was slow 
getting ready because he couldn't find his socks and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis sent him home, and later had a pointed conversation with  
club executives Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman had not been given an ultimatum before Thursday, Rambis  
said, adding he was disappointed the move had to be made because of 
what Rodman had shown what he was capable of doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The in-and-out just got to be too much,'' Rambis said. ``I  
felt we needed everyone to be on the same page. I gave my 
recommendation to management, a minimum of a suspension. It was my 
belief we should waive him at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's what happened.  
</P>
<P>
	Speaking by telephone from Phoenix, Kupchak said the move  
probably wouldn't have been made at this time had Rambis not spoken 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kurt and our staff keep us apprised daily,'' Kupchak said.  
``Quite frankly, the recommendation that Kurt made, we readily 
agreed to. We can't make that decision because we're not the ones 
at practices, at the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a culmination of acts that led to the waiver.  
(Thursday's) act alone would have never led to this kind of action. 
It's another in a series of actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Steiner, a spokesman for Lakers owner Jerry Buss, said Buss'  
reaction to the move was, ``They did what they had to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kupchak said to the best of his knowledge as of late Friday  
nobody with the team had spoken with Rodman after he was sent home 
from Thursday's practice, although Steiner said he believed Buss 
would make an attempt to speak with the now ex-Laker as a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Buss and Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal who were most in  
favor of signing Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal declined to speak with reporters after Friday's practice.  
</P>
<P>
	Kupchak said he tried to call Rodman late Thursday and spoke to  
his representative and bodyguard, but Rodman didn't return phone 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Kupchak said Steve Chasman, Rodman's agent, acted surprised  
about the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it difficult to believe he was surprised,'' Kupchak  
said. ``We try to do things the right way. Everything we do is well 
thought out. This is a decision we had to make. We're the ones who 
have to make these decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kupchak had words of praise for Rambis, saying, ``Jerry (West)  
and I feel Kurt has done a wonderful job. Regarding Dennis, he 
handled it the same way Jerry and I would have handled it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Labov, Rodman's publicist, refused comment Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers (25-15) have 10 games remaining before the playoffs,  
starting with their game against the Jazz (30-8), winners of nine 
straight games. Utah has the NBA's best record. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's place on the roster was taken by forward Travis Knight,  
who was activated from the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis said J.R. Reid would replace Rodman in the starting  
lineup against the Jazz.

<HEADLINE> $105M Man Savaged by Padres Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- It was all about the money when Kevin Brown  
returned to the mound at Qualcomm Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Padres' fans, who lovingly cheered their team even after it was  
swept in the World Series, delighted in savaging Brown, who in turn 
was cashed in by his former teammates on his first visit to San 
Diego since October. 
</P>
<P>
	The boos began 25 minutes before Friday night's game, when Brown  
began running warmups in the outfield. They reached a crescendo 
when his name was called in the Los Angeles Dodgers' starting 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	As Brown threw his warmup pitches in the bottom of the first  
inning, the Beatles' ``Can't Buy Me Love'' blared from the sound 
system. Pink Floyd's ``Money'' led off the bottom of the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beatles tune was played at the suggestion of owner John  
Moores, who offered $60 million over six years in an attempt to 
keep Brown, the hired gun whose intensity rubbed off on the Padres 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, of course, snubbed that offer and became baseball's first  
$100 million man, getting $105 million over seven years from the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we clean his clock,'' Moores said in the Padres dugout  
before the game. ``That's what we're supposed to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moores got his wish. Brown couldn't buy a win, losing his first  
decision of the year, 3-0, as the Padres' new ace, Andy Ashby, was 
brilliant in throwing a five-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Moores even suggested that the Padres leave Brown's NL  
championship ring on home plate. He'll get it sometime this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, Brown was largely responsible for getting the Padres to the  
World Series, which in turn got them a new downtown ballpark 
approved by the voters less than two weeks after being swept by the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	But that seemed like ancient history to the crowd of 48,943,  
which provided a playoff-like atmosphere on a perfect spring night. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dodgers manager Davey Johnson walked out to remove Brown in  
the seventh after Wally Joyner's RBI double put the Padres up 3-0, 
the fans stood and roared. The final boos of the night came as 
Brown walked slowly toward the dugout. One man leaned over the 
railing, flashing cash at the right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	As he exited, Brown, who's from Macon, was serenaded by Gladys  
Knight and the Pips' ``Midnight Train To Georgia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moments earlier, a life-size pinata resembling Brown, hanging by  
the neck from a stick, was smashed apart by the Padres' Friar 
mascot. Fake dollar bills tumbled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Gwynn, who had his second three-hit game of the season to  
pull within 55 of 3,000, said it wasn't necessarily the worst he's 
seen Padres fans. They love to bash Barry Bonds and pillory Mike 
Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was spirited, I'll say that.'' Gwynn said of the fans. I  
didn't think it would be like it was, but they paid their money. 
They're entitled to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Padres players, including Gwynn, spoke of respect for Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bruce Bochy did too, but also seemed to side with the  
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what kind of reaction they'd have,'' Bochy said.  
``Hey, it's our park. It's good for the game, I mean, it definitely 
brought a lot more attention to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real strange seeing him in a different uniform. That's  
part of the game. It's baseball now in the 90s. Hey, we all make 
decisions. It's behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby called it a difficult situation for Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of respect for Brownie,'' he said. ``If anyone  
can handle it, he sure can, I guarantee that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, the loser in Game 4 of the World Series, claimed it was  
no worse than playing in Atlanta, or in Houston during last year's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they want to boo, that's their choice,'' he said. ``The  
Dodgers aren't real popular down here. I don't think they were last 
year, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown took the musical razzing in stride.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not my song, so I didn't pay attention to it,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As Serb forces appeared to be making  
a final push to clear Kosovo of its ethnic Albanian population amid 
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, thousands of refugees were on 
the move today. At least 5,000 refugees crossed into Macedonia 
yesterday, and 8,000 arrived in Albania by late afternoon. More 
were expected today. Ron Redmont, a spokesman for the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees, said an enormous new wave -- more than 
100,000 refugees -- was believed bound for Macedonia alone.

Oscar nominee for the 1948 film ``I Remember Mama,'' has died. She 
was 87. Corby died Wednesday at the Motion Picture &AMP; Television 
Hospital after an extended illness, a hospital spokeswoman said 
yesterday. She appeared in more than 100 movies, including 
``Shane'' (1953), ``Sabrina'' (1954) and ``Vertigo'' (1958). Her

percent last year, enabling about 600 more transplants in 1998 over 
1997 and marking the first substantial increase in three years, 
according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The 
increase was most dramatic among donors age 60 and older, who have 
traditionally been passed over by organ banks and hospitals because 
their hearts, kidneys and livers tend to be less healthy than

<HEADLINE> Browns Make Couch Their Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Sleepless nights, fights at office water  
coolers and months of hand-wringing have all ended. No more 
questions. No more guessing, and no more waiting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns made up their mind: Tim Couch is their man.  
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland, which begins a new era in the NFL as an expansion  
team in 1999, selected Couch with the No. 1 overall pick in the 
draft Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to choose Couch ended months of rumors, speculation  
and overanalysis by all of Cleveland as the city's football-starved 
fans tried to figure out what the team might do with its first 
draft pick in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's safe to relax, Dawg Pounders. You won't have to suffer  
through another Mel Kiper Jr., interview. The Browns say they got 
their man, and before he's even played one game for Cleveland, 
Couch has already shown a knack for come-from-behind victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim Couch has always been the guy,'' said Dwight Clark,  
Cleveland's director of football operations. ``He's always been the 
guy. He's always been the leader. He's always been the one that 
rallied the troops. He set records in high school, he set records 
in college, and we expect him to set records here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch only became the Browns' top pick after a strong workout  
last weekend and after his agent, Tom Condon of Cleveland-based 
IMG, had worked out a deal with the Browns early Saturday morning 
in a New York hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to get started,'' Couch said after arriving at the  
Browns' headquarters. ``I can't wait to get the playbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who also considered using the top pick on Oregon  
quarterback Akili Smith or Texas running back Ricky Williams, said 
they wouldn't pick a player unless they had an agreement with him 
before the draft began. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Carmen Policy said talks between Condon and Lal  
Heneghan, the Browns' contract expert, became ``testy'' Friday 
evening and at one point tempers flared before the bargaining 
session broke off for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I normally don't carry a cell phone with me, but last night I  
did,'' said Policy, who remained in contact with Heneghan most of 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said it wasn't until 7:30 a.m. that the Browns and Condon  
had finalized the deal, a seven-year, $48 million package that 
included a $12.25 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing about doing the contract is that it  
is done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns, who have 13 selections in the two-day draft, didn't  
decide Couch was the valedictorian of the class of '99 quarterbacks 
-- five were taken in the first 12 picks -- until a private workout 
last weekend in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer, Clark, Policy and owner Al Lerner  
attended the workout. Palmer was so disappointed with Couch's first 
workout session for the Browns that Smith had leapfrogged him on 
the Browns' draft board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into the April 11 workout, Tim was definitely behind  
Akili,'' Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Couch dazzled the Browns during the 90-minute, 115-pass  
workout, displaying an ability to throw deep, something he rarely 
had to do while smashing school and NCAA passing records at 
Kentucky. Palmer was also impressed by the way Couch had adopted a 
new throwing grip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think last Sunday's workout was what really put me over the  
top,'' Couch said in New York before he and his family were flown 
here on Lerner's jet. ``I threw the ball with a lot of velocity, 
and I think they saw what they wanted to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer knows he did.  
</P>
<P>
	``The difference in the workouts was night and day,'' Palmer  
said. ``He wiped out any doubts we had and we walked away from that 
workout thinking that this is our guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Palmer said he wanted to sleep on it for a few days, and  
it wasn't until Thursday that the Browns decided to make Kentucky's 
No. 2 the No. 1 choice for Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 227-pound Couch decided to skip his senior season  
at Kentucky when he knew he would have a chance to be the No. 1 
pick in the draft. He openly courted the Browns, even after the 
team acquired veteran Ty Detmer in a trade with San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard a lot of great things about Ty,'' Couch said. ``I  
look forward to learning as much as I can from him. As far as when 
I'm going to get into a game, I'm just going to work as hard as I 
can, and I'll leave that decision up to coach Palmer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said the Browns' starting quarterback job would be  
contested like every other position, and that right now it was 
``Ty's job to lose and Tim's job to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A classic pocket passer, who Palmer says doesn't get enough  
credit for his mobility, Couch was a first-team All-America last 
season after passing for 4,275 yards and 36 touchdowns. He passed 
for at least 300 yards and one TD in each game, and finished his 
career by throwing for 336 yards and two TDs in the Outback Bowl 
against Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	And now with his contract resolved, he and the Browns can begin  
a relationship they hope lasts well into the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now let's just play football,'' Couch said. ``And do what got  
me here.''

<HEADLINE> Town Cherishes Down's Syndrome Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHURUBUSCO, Ind. (AP) -- Some days, John Krieger is a police  
officer, arresting bad guys. Some days, he is a fireman or a medic, 
saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Some days, he is an insurance agent. Some days, he helps out at  
the hardware store or at the barber's, at a restaurant or at the 
local paper. Some days, he preaches in church. 
</P>
<P>
	Always -- as his business cards proclaim -- he is ``Churubusco's  
All-Round Nice Guy,'' appreciated not for what he does, but for 
what he is. 
</P>
<P>
	And this is what he is: A 63-year-old man with Down syndrome,  
hobbled by weak eyes and aging legs, his words mumbled and hard to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
	In other places, people might shy away from him, embarrassed by  
his tics and antics. But this is Churubusco, where John has spent 
his whole life. In this town of 1,800, 15 miles northwest of Fort 
Wayne, he is respected and cherished. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's not to like about him? I say when I grow up, I'll be  
just like him,'' says barber Norm Decker as he gives Wayne Haire a 
trim. ``No chance of me growing up anytime soon, of course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``John's all right. He tends to his own business,'' Haire says.  
</P>
<P>
	``But look at how many businesses he's got,'' Decker replies.  
</P>
<P>
	Every day, John reports to work at Norm's or Diffendarfer's Body  
Shop or Shroyer's Variety &AMP; Hardware or any one of a half-dozen 
other businesses along Busco's Main Street. He helps out, tidies 
up, and they pay him $5 or $10 each week or just take him out for a 
soda. 
</P>
<P>
	But when you hire John, you give him more than a dust pan and a  
broom. You provide another platform for his fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent Tuesday, John is helping with the stock at the  
hardware store when he bolts for the door. He races next door, into 
the office of the Churubusco News, and back to the garage. 
</P>
<P>
	He speaks excitedly into an imaginary police radio in his hand  
and then begins, with elaborate pantomime, to make an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take him to jail,'' John says.  
</P>
<P>
	Back in the newspaper office, managing editor Viv Rosswurm asks  
John what's going on. He explains that someone had been shot twice 
in the heart with a shotgun. Receptionist Marcia Hoffman expresses 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monday's usually the killing day,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	John is always finding ways to bring excitement to the newsroom.  
The other day, Ms. Rosswurm says, John reported that ``somebody in 
Fort Wayne came here and left this baby. I hate it when they do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folks in Churubusco are used to John's police work; for many  
years, John would ride his bicycle up to the elementary school 
every day during recess, and would make an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	In those days, the townspeople used to get together every so  
often to buy John a new bike and doll it up with lights. This was 
his squad car, and when he encountered a perp -- perhaps someone who 
made an illegal turn -- he would uncork an uncanny imitation of a 
siren and pull them over. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of startled strangers,'' Ms. Rosswurm says.  
</P>
<P>
	Then ``traffic got a bit heavier, and his eyes got bad,'' says  
Doug Arnold, who works with John at the hardware store. John was 
knocked off his bike a few times, and an ambulance picked him up. 
``He wasn't hurt. He liked the excitement, the lights,'' says 
insurance agent Chuck Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	So a few years ago, they took his bike away. Now, he must do his  
police work on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	John's obsession with policing comes from his father -- ``a  
flatfoot,'' John says, who worked part-time as a Churubusco cop. 
</P>
<P>
	When John was born, doctors told his parents to send him to an  
institution. He might live to see his 14th birthday, but not much 
more, they said. He would be a burden. They would be better off 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
	Never, his parents said.  
</P>
<P>
	``That was their baby. They weren't going to give him up,'' says  
his sister, Beverly Davis. ``One of your own, you don't send him 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he had been born today, Davis says, he might have received  
more training, and he might have learned how to be self-sufficient. 
Instead, he came into a world where little was expected of people 
like John, who were dismissed as Mongoloids. 
</P>
<P>
	When John was 20, he began to walk into town each day. Clarence  
Raypole, who owned the Standard filling station, took a liking to 
him and put him to work. Then the guy who owned the Ford garage, 
directly behind the gas station, asked John to help out. 
</P>
<P>
	Raypole died some time ago, but over the years, other merchants  
would take his place. ``They just looked after him,'' Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
	When a tornado slammed through Churubusco -- and John was out in  
the storm -- his family was terrified. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we knew somebody was uptown, taking care of him,'' Davis  
says. Sure enough, another worker at the gas station crouched with 
John in the attendant's booth until the winds died down. 
</P>
<P>
	John lived with his mother, Hazel, until she died in 1989, and  
then with his sister, Phyllis. But when she died, two years ago, 
the calls started coming into the Churubusco News. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going to happen to Johnny?'' they asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Don't let the state take him,'' they pleaded.  
</P>
<P>
	They needn't have worried. His nephew, Don Ferguson, took him  
in. ``If John was put in a home, if he was put to where he couldn't 
get out to do things, he wouldn't last that long,'' says Phyllis 
Ferguson, Don's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	He has his own room; it is extraordinarily neat. He keeps his  
prize possessions there, including his autographed picture of 
Purdue University basketball coach Gene Keady (``If you want to 
make him mad, just say something bad about Purdue or the Chicago 
Cubs,'' says Don Ferguson). 
</P>
<P>
	He makes his own breakfast, and then each weekday morning he  
walks to John Diffendarfer's body shop, arriving promptly at 9 a.m. 
He sweeps the floor, puts the tools in their place, takes out the 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we had that last snowstorm, he couldn't make it in,''  
Diffendarfer says. ``It got pretty messy here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 11:15 a.m., when John departs for home and a shower, the  
Rotary Club prepares for its weekly gathering in the St. John Bosco 
Church basement. 
</P>
<P>
	They sit down to ham, macaroni and cheese and Jell-O, and then  
they open the meeting with songs -- ``It's a Small World'' and 
``Smile'' -- and a prayer. Visitors are asked to say a few words, 
and plans are made for the big auction, to raise money for 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	This is truly small-town America. And Joe Dickson, the club's  
president, says ``the smallness of the community, the town, 
everybody knowing each other,'' partly explains why John Krieger is 
embraced. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's more to it than that. Chuck Jones, a former Rotary  
president, says, ``Johnny reaches out to you. There's many times 
when I've had a bad day, and Johnny comes in at quarter of five and 
lifts me up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's kind of the town's soul, the town's heart,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	He's relentlessly upbeat. His playfulness is contagious; in his  
guise as a medic, he often stops in to give workers imaginary 
inoculations. 
</P>
<P>
	Who named him ``Churubusco's All-Round Nice Guy''?  
</P>
<P>
	``Me,'' John says, with a grin that shows off his single tooth.  
</P>
<P>
	He used to direct traffic at funerals. He still goes to most  
funerals; he writes ``JOHN'' in simple block letters in the 
register. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is THE man about town,'' says Greg Childs, director of  
Sheets Funeral Home. ``John is absolutely a gift to us. It's his 
outlook on life. He's so positive. He always finds the good in 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has always watched out for children. ``He was on our butt  
every day,'' remembers police officer Chad Fulkerson, 27. ``If you 
didn't cross at the crosswalk ... you used to yell at us, didn't 
you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	John grins again, and rubs the gray stubble on his head.  
</P>
<P>
	He is drinking a Diet Coke with Fulkerson and officer Clifford  
Smith (together, two-thirds of a police force that made five felony 
arrests in all of 1998) and Sheriff's Deputy Tony Helfrich. 
</P>
<P>
	Cliff is John's best buddy. Every day -- during his afternoon  
break, and before John goes off to one of his many jobs -- Cliff 
picks him up in his squad car and takes him to the Ramble Inn. 
</P>
<P>
	John shows off his honorary sheriff's deputy card. The cops have  
given him a police radio with a limited range, tuned to frequencies 
only they can pick up. His handle is ``Sarge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around the table, they kid John unmercifully. They ask him how  
many girlfriends he has (244, he says). They call him ``Knothead'' 
and ``Fatboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You got a piano case for your casket yet?'' asks Cliff.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're treating him as an equal,'' says Pastor Dennis Shock.  
``It's like they're talking to their brother or their best 
friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shock is minister at the Churubusco United Methodist Church,  
where John worships -- or, more accurately, where John preaches. 
Every Sunday morning, before the 10:30 service, John climbs to the 
pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the congregation -- Shock included -- cannot understand  
what he is saying. Soon after Shock's arrival in Churubusco four 
years ago, he heard complaints from some congregants who found it 
hard to meditate, and were afraid of what visitors from out of town 
would think. 
</P>
<P>
	Shock was not happy, either.  
</P>
<P>
	``He kept getting longer and longer, and a bit louder,'' Shock  
says. ``Occasionally, I got worried that he wouldn't sit down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Shock approached John and suggested that he retire. The next  
Sunday, John did not preach. But the Sunday after that, Shock 
recalls, ``there he was again, preaching as usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shock gave up. Obviously, there was little he could do to  
dissuade John from sharing his special version of the Gospel. 
Besides, he had heard from congregants who LIKED having John on the 
pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows about Christ and he prays. He knows what the Bible is  
and he believes in God. I know that much,'' Shock says. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's John,'' the pastor says. ``He sort of ties this community  
together, in a way. They've all adopted him as their son, or 
father. I've never seen anything like it, and I've been in a few 
small towns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His adopted family worries about John as he gets older; he had a  
mild heart attack not long ago, and he had surgery for cataracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Long ago, before antibiotics, a child with Down syndrome was not  
expected to live to his teens. Now, the average life expectancy is 
55, though many -- like John -- live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, his life has become richer in recent years. Since  
he moved in with his nephew, new vistas have opened: The family 
sometimes eats out, and he likes that. And he went with them to 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	They drove at night, figuring he would sleep, but he did not  
close his eyes. ``He didn't want to miss a minute,'' Ferguson says. 
</P>
<P>
	His birthday, each April, is a major event. ``We keep telling  
him Marcia's going to jump out of a cake. He's all for that,'' says 
Ms. Rosswurm, editor of the News. Marcia, the receptionist, shakes 
her head vehemently. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in June, comes the other high point of John's year: Turtle  
Days. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty years ago, Churubusco had a moment in the spotlight. There  
were reports that a 500-pound turtle -- nicknamed Oscar -- had been 
sighted in a local pond, and the national media picked up on the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	Oscar never surfaced. But they still call Churubusco ``Turtle  
Town, USA,'' and they still have Turtle Days and the Turtle Parade 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
	And every year, ``Churubusco's All-Round Nice Guy'' rides a fire  
truck and waves to his 244 girlfriends, his fellow policemen, his 
flock, his many employers and all the men, women and children who 
are his friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Johnny's buried,'' says Chuck Jones, ``it's going to be  
the biggest funeral this town's ever had.''

<HEADLINE> 1973 Murder Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A man who spent 26 years behind bars was  
released from prison after a judge overturned his murder conviction 
due to suppressed evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	However, John Duval's legal troubles may not be over. After he  
was released Friday, prosecutors said they may retry him for the 
1973 killing of a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position is that he was certainly properly convicted of  
these crimes and guilty of these crimes,'' said Assistant District 
Attorney Robert Mastrocola. ``That's still our position. But that 
doesn't necessarily mean we're ... going to re-try him. There's a 
lot of other things that go into this, more practical concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was greeted by an exultant knot of family, friends and  
supporters following his release. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to be home, and that's all I've got to say,'' Duval  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Betty Duval-Rutley, said she had already dropped by  
a supermarket to prepare him a special meal. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's conviction was overturned April 5. A judge ruled that a  
one-page report of a police interview in which a teen-ager accuser 
initially claimed he never saw Duval and co-defendant Betty Tyson 
with the victim was never turned over to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson had her conviction dismissed last May for the same reason.  
The 50-year-old had spent half her life in prison and became New 
York's longest-serving female inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Tyson, both former prostitutes, maintained they signed  
confessions only after being severely beaten by the police, who had 
no physical evidence linking them to the killing of Timothy 
Haworth. 
</P>
<P>
	A Philadelphia businessman and consultant to Eastman Kodak Co.,  
Haworth was apparently soliciting a prostitute on the night he was 
strangled on May 25, 1973. In separate trials, Duval and Tyson were 
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, he twice told the state Parole Board that he  
killed Haworth. He says now he believed he would remain behind bars 
unless he admitted guilt. ``I wanted to go home, so I lied,'' he 
said in an affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	Mastrocola said prosecutors would make their decision on whether  
to seek a retrial in the next few weeks. A hearing was set for May 
14.

<HEADLINE> Williams Deal Lights Up Ditka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Mike Ditka wasn't just blowing smoke.  
</P>
<P>
	From the very start, the New Orleans Saints coach had wanted  
Ricky Williams, and on Saturday he traded away just about 
everything short of Bourbon Street to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he got the Heisman Trophy winner, Ditka pumped his fists,  
broke out into a big grin, fired up a huge cigar, and sang a little 
ditty about going out to play golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was meant to be, it was ordained,'' Ditka enthused after a  
last- second deal with Washington allowed him to pick the player he 
believes will turn the Saints into winners. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans switched first-round picks with the Redskins, moving  
from 12th overall to No. 5, and gave them their other five 
selections this year in rounds 3-7, and a No. 1 and No. 3 next year 
to get Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	In his yellow Hawaiian shirt with a picture of a pitcher of  
margaritas and a filled cocktail glass on the back, Ditka slapped 
backs, joked with owner Tom Benson, and puffed a giant LaUnica 
cigar, eight inches long and two inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said from Day 1 he was the player we wanted,'' Ditka said.  
``We did the thing we thought would make us best, fastest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He gives us what Walter Payton gave us in Chicago.''  
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone agreed with Ditka's strategy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're all different,'' said Mike Holmgren, coach and general  
manager of the Seattle Seahawks. ``Look at the shirt that Mike 
Ditka was wearing. I didn't want to trade all my picks and go 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ditka dismissed speculation that he should have picked a  
quarterback to replace Billy Joe Hobert, Billy Joe Tolliver or 
Danny Wuerffel. He said he has confidence in Hobert as the starter. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he hadn't blown out his tendon in the first game last year,  
I think we would have gone to the playoffs last season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints had been trying to work out a deal that would allow  
them to move up from the No. 12 pick in the first round so they 
could take the former Texas back. On Saturday, New Orleans tried to 
entice Cincinnati to part with the No. 3 pick, offering them all of 
this years picks, No. 1s in 2000 and 2001, and a No. 2 in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to make that deal, they offered Indianapolis all this  
year's picks, a No. 2 and No. 3 next year, a No. 1 in 2001, and 
cornerback Alex Molden, the No. 1 pick in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Colts traded Marshall Faulk, Saints officials were  
convinced Indianapolis would take Williams. When the Colts chose 
Edgerrin James and New Orleans struck the deal with the Redskins, 
the celebration began. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson sent his private jet to New York to pick up Williams for  
a dinner date with Ditka, Benson and other team officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans at the Saints camp celebrated the pick, unconcerned at the  
heavy price paid for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a stroke of genius,'' said Joseph LeBlanc, 67, of  
Slidell, La. ``What do I care about the future? At my age, I'm just 
hoping they'll win before I die, and if Ricky Williams will do 
that, praise God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints have only five winning seasons in 32 years, the last  
in 1992. Last season, New Orleans ranked 28th in the NFL in offense 
and was last in rushing the football. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most exciting thing that ever happened to me as  
far as getting a player,'' Ditka said. ``This is the best thing to 
happen to the New Orleans Saints ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like singing `When The Saints Go Marching In,''' said  
season ticket holder Clarence Powell, 57, as he ate crawfish and 
watched the draft. ``This is a big step, a big step. If the coach 
says this is what will get us to the Super Bowl, I believe him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans planned to have Williams available Sunday to sign  
autographs in the tent next to the table selling season tickets, 
which just went up in price last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will make everybody forget about the price hike,'' said  
Rome Lytton, 42, an 18-year ticket holder. ``I think this will 
probably a winning season now, and that makes you forget all of the 
bad things.''

<HEADLINE> Is Arrest Straw's Last Straw? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry is approaching the major  
league record no one wants: Steve Howe's mark for second chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Just when it seemed he had turned himself around, Strawberry  
finds his latest comeback with the New York Yankees teetering on 
the edge. His arrest on charges of cocaine possession and 
soliciting a female police officer may be the final straw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope his career isn't over. I hope they don't give up on  
him,'' said David Cone, his best friend on the team. ``But these 
sorts of situations conjure up the flip-side argument, too: How 
many chances do people get?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has been the toast of New York and the goat, too. His  
life is the stuff the tabloids live for: Every time he gets fans' 
adulation and sympathy, he seems to turn into his own worst enemy 
and become a magnet for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make sure he becomes a real example of how you can  
turn your life around and make something out of yourself,'' Yankees 
owner George Steinbrenner said shortly before signing him for the 
first time in July 1995. ``I think this young man has to realize 
he's been given a great chance here ... one some people say he 
didn't deserve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last 12 years, Strawberry has been accused of breaking  
his first wife's nose, named in a paternity suit, arrested for 
assaulting his wife with a deadly weapon, arrested for striking a 
woman he lived with, ordered to pay $350,000 in back taxes, 
confined to home for six months by a federal judge, charged with 
failing to make child-support payments and sued by his ex-lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	He went through alcohol rehab in 1990 and substance-abuse rehab  
in 1994, then was suspended for 60 days in 1995 after testing 
positive for cocaine. He was released by the Dodgers and Giants, 
and struggled through a half-season in the Northern League, about 
as far from the majors as a professional can get. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, before Wednesday night's arrest near the team's training  
facility in Tampa, Fla., he had been a model citizen since joining 
the Yankees, the team he hoped to return to as he tried to regain 
strength and form following surgery for colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	When the illness and operation last October forced him to miss  
the postseason, his teammates repeatedly telephoned him so he would 
feel a part of the clubhouse celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	After the World Series sweep of the Padres, the clubhouse in San  
Diego was filled with chants of ``Straw Man! Straw Man!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We told him how much we loved him and missed him. It was a  
very emotional moment,'' catcher Joe Girardi said of phone calls to 
Strawberry that night from the trainer's room. ``It was hard 
without Darryl, not so much because of his baseball presence but 
just as a person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just two months ago, the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug  
Dependence hired Strawberry as a spokesman. While he didn't have as 
much ability as when he came up with the New York Mets in 1983, he 
had regained the luster of his years as a fearsome hitter, the 
eight-time All-Star and NL Rookie of the Year winner who led the 
Mets to the World Series championship in 1986 and another division 
title two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a star. I just want to be a player,'' he  
said last year, when he had his best season since 1991. ``I had my 
days of what they call stardom. That's not important to me. What's 
important to me is to enjoy my life and help ... other people who 
are having problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His turning point seemed to be his time in the Northern League  
in 1996, when he was making $2,000 a month, riding a bus with the 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``St. Paul was a very humbling experience for me,'' he said.  
``It allowed me to find out who I am as a person. It allowed me to 
have no pride. It showed me baseball was fun again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner was at Strawberry's bedside last fall. But he  
demands loyalty in return. That's why he lashed out in February 
after Strawberry missed an autograph session, remarks he later said 
were out of line. 
</P>
<P>
	``For what we have done, bent over backwards for Straw, we've  
tried to understand his problems and worked with him,'' 
Steinbrenner said. ``We pulled for him every bit of the way. It's 
the last guy I expected to have pulled that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner will decide Strawberry's future, and a guilty plea  
or conviction may cause him to decide whether to cut Strawberry 
loose. Then again, the Yankees are the team that Howe played for 
following his eighth suspension for drug and alcohol problems.

<HEADLINE> Four Honored For Distance Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Johnny Kelley, known as Boston's Marathon Man, and  
three other outstanding runners have been elected into the National 
Distance Running Hall of Fame at Utica, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the 91-year-old Kelley in the Hall are 1972 women's  
Boston Marathon winner Nina Kuscik, 1964 Olympic 10,000-meter gold 
medalist Billy Mills and five-time Olympian Francie Larrieu Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley has competed in 62 Boston Marathons, winning twice and  
placing second seven times. Generally an active participant in race 
activities, he is missing Monday's marathon while recovering from 
colon surgery and pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuscik's victory 27 years ago was the first time women were  
officially recognized at Boston. She also won then New York City 
Marathon in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills' triumph was one of the biggest upsets in Olympic history  
as he became the first American to win a gold medal in the 10,000. 
Larrieu Smith, a member of the USA Track and Field Hall of Fame, 
finished fifth in the 1988 Olympic 10,000. She has set 36 U.S. 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	The new members will be inducted July 10 in a ceremony at  
Utica. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	DE HAVEN CARRIES AMERICAN HOPES: Rod De Haven is not impressed  
by being the only elite American man in Monday's Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no big deal,'' said the 32-year-old from Madison, Wis.,  
who works as a computer programer for an insurance company, coaches 
himself, and is married with three children. ``Americans don't 
consider running Boston anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an American is going to run a marathon, he wants to make  
some money. That's the mindset of most Americans, because they 
can't beat the Kenyans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this decade, only three Americans have finished in the top 10  
at Boston -- Mark Plaatjes, a transplanted South African, was sixth 
and Keith Brantly ninth in 1993, and Bob Kempainen placed seventh 
in 1994. Meanwhile, Kenyans have won the past eight races. 
</P>
<P>
	De Haven doesn't figure to crack the top 10 Monday, not off his  
career-best of 2 hours, 13 minutes, last year at the Chicago 
Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an American is going to run 2:13, why not go to Pittsburgh  
for the national championships, where that might win?'' De Haven 
said. ``If someone runs even 2:14 or 2:15 at Pittsburgh, he can 
make $5,000 or $10,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why doesn't De Haven follow his own advice?  
</P>
<P>
	For two reasons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to get caught up in a fast Boston race and slice my  
time by at least one minute to 2:12,'' he said. ``If I can run 
2:12, I will be in the top 10. Right now, running a fast time is 
more important than picking up a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Also, I picked Boston because of its tradition. At my age, I  
won't have too many other chances to run Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	DE REUCK HOPEFUL: South African Colleen de Reuck has come into  
the Boston Marathon three times with great expectations and left 
each time with tremendous disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time road racer of the year finished ninth in her Boston  
debut in 1994, was third in 1997 and fifth last year. This year, de 
Reuck believes she can overcome her Boston jinx and end the 
two-year winning streak of Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia. 
</P>

	``I think I have the speed to beat her,'' de Reuck said, ``But  
you have to maintain. The top girls all have the caliber to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what I have to do to win -- I can't go out too fast. I  
will have to run a good, even pace. Boston is very different from 
all other courses because of the uphills and downhills. Boston 
beats you up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De Reuck keeps coming back, though, because of the ``special  
magic'' of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the top marathons in the world,'' she said. ``The  
course is a challenge, and I like challenges.''

	KAGWE CHASING WORLD RECORD: John Kagwe, winner of the past two  
New York City Marathons and one of the top contenders in Monday's 
Boston Marathon, has designs on breaking the world record of 2 
hours, 6 minutes, 5 seconds, by Brazil's Ronaldo daCosta. But he 
probably won't do it in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagwe has run Boston three times without much success. He  
finished 16th in his debut in 1994, did not finish in '96 and was 
fifth last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenyans have run very fast, but they haven't had the blessing  
of the record,'' Kagwe said. ``I want to be the next world 
record-holder.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Lower Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican-led budget plan passed by  
Congress would cut most Americans' taxes while spending more on 
Social Security, education and national defense, GOP Sen. Spencer 
Abraham said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Michigan Republican, delivering the GOP's weekly radio  
address, said the party's agenda ``will help our families and our 
children face the future with optimism and confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.74 trillion spending plan for the fiscal year starting  
Oct. 1 places overall limits on the detailed tax and spending bills 
lawmakers will write, then try to persuade the White House to 
accept. Congress passed the legislation Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax breaks in the plan are meant to keep Americans from having  
to ``work nearly three hours out of an eight-hour day just to pay 
taxes,'' Abraham said. The GOP plan sets aside for tax cuts $800 
billion of the surplus, which would not be connected to Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the trillions of dollars in surpluses expected in the  
next decade amount to a tax overpayment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's your money, and Republicans will work to give tax relief  
to as many taxpayers as possible,'' Abraham said. ``We want 
sensible tax cuts for all taxpayers. The president doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants more closely targeted cuts, largely for lower and  
middle-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Abraham said the GOP budget would preserve for Social Security  
alone the trust fund surplus generated by the nation's retirement 
program. It also would increase education spending by $721 billion 
over the next decade, much more than Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want fewer `Washington knows best' solutions and more  
people at the local level making education decisions for America's 
children,'' Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan also would rebuild national defense system and  
``give our nation the security it needs in this dangerous world,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Pays $3.77 Million in Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush said he and his wife  
paid $3.77 million in federal income taxes on an estimated 1998 
income of $18.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wrote a check that is the biggest check I could conceivably  
(write),'' Bush, a possible Republican candidate for the 2000 
presidential election, said Thursday. ``I never dreamt I'd write a 
check that big. Of course, I never dreamt I'd make that much money, 
either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bushes previously paid $97,252 in taxes.  
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of Bush's 1998 income came from the sale of the Texas  
Rangers baseball team, of which he'd been managing partner before 
his 1994 election as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who bought into the Rangers for just more than $600,000,  
received about $14.9 million when sale of the club was announced 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bushes also reported giving $334,425 to churches and  
charitable organizations during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The blind trust that manages Bush's assets has applied for an  
extension of time to file the governor's 1998 tax returns. It is 
still waiting for tax information from some entities in the trust, 
spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who established a presidential exploratory campaign on  
March 2, has raised $7.6 million for a possible campaign so far.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky's Couch is Top Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns began the Draft of the  
Quarterbacks today by selecting Kentucky's Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, who left school after his junior season, reached a  
contract agreement with the expansion team hours before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In selecting Couch, the Browns -- awarded a franchise by the NFL  
after the original Browns moved to Baltimore -- opened what was 
expected to be a first-round run on quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch posed for photographs with Browns owner Al Lerner while,  
in a makeshift Dawg Pound in the balcony, fans dressed in Browns 
jerseys chanted ``Here we go, Brownies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He displayed so much character and poise,'' Browns president  
Carmen Policy said. ``He's such a solid human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia continued the fancy with passers by selecting  
Donovan McNabb of Syracuse. McNabb, a three-time Big East Offensive 
Player of Year, joins a team whose projected starting quarterback 
is longtime third-stringer Doug Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't meet with the approval of the Eagles fans on hand  
who wanted the team to select Ricky Williams of Texas. For much of 
the hour before the pick, they shouted, ``We want Ricky!'' and they 
booed loudly when McNabb's name was called. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1971, the first three selections were  
quarterbacks after Cincinnati took Akili Smith of Oregon. Although 
Smith was a starter for just one college season, his arm strength 
and athletic ability impressed the Bengals, who already have four 
quarterbacks on their roster. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, the top three selections were Jim Plunkett by the  
Patriots, Archie Manning by the Saints and Dan Pastorini by the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest shock of the draft -- and the biggest surprise in  
many years -- came on the fourth selection. Indianapolis traded star 
running back Marshall Faulk to St. Louis on Thursday, seemingly 
clearing the way to take Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Colts instead went for another running back, junior  
Edgerrin James of Miami, whose spectacular performance in the 
season finale against UCLA brought him to prominence. The stunned 
crowd let out a gasp when James' name was announced by commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We liked both backs ... but basically we feel Edgerrin gives  
us a little more with what we want to do with our offense,'' Colts 
coach Jim Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams went with the next pick -- to New Orleans. The Saints,  
who previously offered all of their 1999 picks to Cleveland for the 
top overall spot to get Williams, dealt with Washington moments 
after the Colts' stunner. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Ditka, sporting a big grin and an even bigger cigar  
after selecting college football's career rushing leader, traded a 
first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh picks this year and 
a first- and third-rounder in 2000 to the Redskins to get Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the kid. He's what we really need,'' Ditka said. ``He  
gives us what Walter Payton gave us in Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It feels great,'' Williams said. ``I was down there last week,  
and they said, `If we draft you, we can go home and hit the golf 
course.' I'm excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams, looking for a big-play receiver to go with Faulk out  
of the backfield, grabbed Torry Holt of North Carolina State. Then 
Washington jumped right back up to No. 7 overall, sending to 
Chicago the first-rounder acquired from the Saints (12th overall), 
and the third-rounder obtained from New Orleans. The Redskins also 
included their own fourth- and fifth-rounders, plus a third-round 
selection in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Redskins -- and the audience -- caught their breath,  
they selected cornerback-wide receiver-kick returner Champ Bailey 
of Georgia. Bailey was the player Washington hoped to get at the 
No. 5 overall slot, so general manager Charley Casserly showed he 
knows how to play the draft-day-trade game superbly. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey was the first defensive player selected, although he is  
versatile enough to line up at wideout, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona went for a deep threat to help QB Jake Plummer, taking  
David Boston of Ohio State. Detroit grabbed Chris Claiborne of 
Southern California, rated the top linebacker. Claiborne can play 
inside and out and was the Butkus Award winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris McAlister, whose father James played in the NFL, was taken  
by Baltimore. If the cornerback starts, the Ravens could move Rod 
Woodson to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth quarterback was selected by Minnesota with the 11th  
overall pick, Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida, who had the 
largest contingent of family and friends on hand. That group roared 
when Culpepper was called. 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper joins a team that had the best record in the league  
last season but whose starting quarterback, Randall Cunningham, 
turned 36 three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears added to the quarterback run by taking left-hander  
Cade McNown of UCLA, whose arm strength has been questioned. 
McNown, who beat out Couch for the All-America team, is a winner, 
though -- several scouts have compared him to Jim McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
	That made for five quarterbacks in the first dozen picks.  
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh, desperate for a wideout, might have reached a bit in  
taking Troy Edwards of Louisiana Tech. Edwards had great numbers, 
including 21 passes 405 yards and three touchdowns vs. Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City, which took tackle Victor Riley a year ago, went for  
another offensive lineman, BYU tackle John Tait. He was the first 
blocker chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay, which was interested in both Culpepper and McNown,  
settled for defensive tackle Anthony McFarland of LSU, who will 
make a nice sidekick for Warren Sapp. 
</P>
<P>
	Another defensive player, All-American end-linebacker Jevon  
Kearse of Florida, went 16th overall to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	New England moved up three spots by dealing a third-rounder and  
fifth-rounder to Seattle, along with the 10th overall slot, and 
took a local product, center Damien Woody of Boston College. The 
Patriots lost starter Dave Wohlabaugh as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	That began a mini-run on behemoth blockers. Oakland used up  
nearly all of its 15 minutes before choosing All-American tackle 
Matt Stinchcomb of Georgia. The Giants needed only 34 seconds to 
take Notre Dame tackle Luke Petitgout, who was projected to go much 
deeper into the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle traded down again, allowing Dallas to pick Ebenezer  
Ekuban, a defensive end from North Carolina to fill a likely hole 
created by Leon Lett's positive drug test. The Cowboys surrendered 
the 22nd overall pick and a fifth-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals, who went for excitement earlier, opted for bulk  
in 6-5 1/2, 340-pound L.J. Shelton, a tackle from Eastern Michigan who 
is the son of former NBA player Lonnie Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Seahawks finally used a first-round pick, it was for  
Lamar King, a defensive end from Division II Saginaw Valley whose 
stock soared after postseason workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bills did as expected, selecting hard-hitting cornerback  
Antoine Winfield of Ohio State.

<HEADLINE> Americans Still Love Poetry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *by HUGH A. MULLIGAN    	
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- What is your favorite poem?  
</P>
<P>
	Robert Pinsky, poet laureate of the United States, begged that  
question of a nation supposedly brain-drained by information 
overload and received an astonishing 10,000 and more replies. 
</P>
<P>
	By postcard, letter, e-mail, even audio- or videocassette, the  
rhymes -- and the reasons for tucking them away in memory or pasting 
them to the refrigerator -- flowed in from town and country. 
</P>
<P>
	In meters merry and sad the unleashed bard sang from truck stops  
and hip-hop bars, from trailer parks and prison cells, from 
seniors' centers, library reading rooms and gin mills staging the 
subculture craze of poetic ``slams,'' and from a park ranger deep 
in the forests primeval of Oregon sighing beneath the brim of his 
Smoky the Bear Stetson: ``I think that I shall never see, a poem 
lovely as a tree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually Joyce Kilmer, so long put down by academia, ended up  
among the top 10 poets chosen by Pinsky's respondents. These 
include, Pinsky joyously reports, ``a bank courier, a welder, an 
antiques dealer, a supermarket checkout clerk, a TV sitcom writer, 
a ballpark hot dog vendor, the real Dr. Patch Adams of recent movie 
fame, a dancer in a Broadway musical, several commercial pilots, a 
mail carrier, a retired parole officer, lots of actors, farmers, 
students, priests and rabbis -- just an amazing spread of 
professions and educational backgrounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky conceived the Favorite Poem Project as a 200th birthday  
gift to the Library of Congress, where the poet laureate has an 
office high in the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	His idea was to have a broad cross section of Americans choose  
their favorite poems and explain briefly why. From these, now 
flowing at the rate of a dozen a day into computers staffed by 
graduate students at Boston University, l,000 will be asked to read 
their favorites aloud on audio tape and another 200 on video tape. 
</P>
<P>
	The tapes will reside in the Library of Congress archives as a  
sort of metrical time capsule recording a nation's poetic 
consciousness. ``If in a thousand years from now anyone should ask 
who Americans were, this archive might help give an answer,'' 
Pinsky muses. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, supposedly the most moribund member  
of the dead poets society, was the eighth most memorized poet in a 
field led by Robert Frost. Poetry lovers by the score quoth ``The 
Raven'' evermore, putting Edgar Allan Poe near the top, along with 
Shakespeare, William Butler Yeats and Emily Dickinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Walt Whitman, in 12th place, the poet laureate heard  
America singing in voices as varied as Shelley and Shel 
Silverstein, Keats and Ogden Nash, Langston Hughes, E.E. Cummings, 
Dr. Seuss, Alexander Pope and Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	Rudyard Kipling, frowned on by the Establishment, beat out Lords  
Byron and Tennyson, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning was voted more 
memorable than her more prolific husband Robert, and Edgar A. 
Guest, the newspaper rhymester laughed at in faculty lounges, 
reminded all that ``It takes a heap o' livin' in a house t' make it 
home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mixture of the sublime and the scorned pleases the poet  
laureate, who set out to prove that poetry is alive and well beyond 
ivy-clad college walls, off-campus coffee bars and graduate 
seminars like the one he teaches in poetry writing at Boston 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The author of five books of poetry and three collections of  
essays, Pinsky put Dante on the best-seller list after 700 years 
with his gloriously readable translation of the ``Inferno.'' He 
helped Polish Nobel Laureate Czeslaw Milosz translate his poems 
into English. 
</P>
<P>
	With his love of languages, Pinsky is delighted that poems in  
many tongues were nominated. ``It would not be American to limit 
the choices to English,'' he explained in the book-lined den of his 
suburban Boston home. ``We have on our Web site poems in Yiddish, 
Persian, Spanish, Italian and many other tongues. There is a 
Japanese haiku and a poem in American sign language. We do ask that 
a translation be provided. Original poems, however, are not 
acceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entries close at midnight April 30, and an anthology of the  
favorites will be published by W.W. Norton. 
</P>
<P>
	Launched in April a year ago, the Favored Poem Project, or FPP,  
as it came to be called, was encouraged at more than l00 poetry 
events in libraries, schools and town halls across the land. The 
White House played host to a poetry reading that heard President 
Clinton recite Emerson's ``Concord Hymn,'' commemorating ``the shot 
heard round the world.'' Hillary Rodham Clinton read ``The Makers'' 
by former poet laureate Howard Nemerov. The President was so 
impressed he adopted the FPP as part of the nation's millennium 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	At New York City's Town Hall, TV's Mike Wallace declaimed  
Browning's ``My Last Duchess'' in portentous ``60 Minutes'' 
cadence. In Boston, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., gave a soulful 
elocution of T.S. Eliot's ``The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.'' 
And in Seattle, Fire Chief James Sewell ignited listeners with a 
smoldering recitation of the Robert Frost poem that begins: 
</P>
<P>
	``Some say the world will end in fire,  
</P>
<P>
	Some say in ice.  
</P>
<P>
	From what I've tasted of desire  
</P>
<P>
	I hold with those who favor fire.''  
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before his turn at the White House, the 58-year-old poet  
laureate found himself in a Chicago saloon judging a poetic 
``slam.'' In this latest cultural phenomenon, ordinary citizens 
unburdened by textbook gravitas compete for prizes in delivering 
poems with passion and personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``Slamming is somewhere between serious poetry and karaoke, and  
it should be encouraged,'' says Pinsky, who regards poetry as a 
performing art. 
</P>
<P>
	All this exposure has convinced many Americans that this nation  
indeed does have a poet laureate, and the title is not reserved for 
British blokes in velvet knee britches bent on rhyming their way 
into the monarch's good graces and ultimately the Poets' Corner at 
Westminster Abbey. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky, who has just been given an unprecedented third one-year  
term, is the 9th U.S. Poet Laureate since Robert Penn Warren was so 
designated by the Librarian of Congress in 1986. Until then the 
Library had poetry consultants but no laureate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic differences separate the American from the British.  
</P>
<P>
	In England, the laureate is the official court poet, a member of  
the royal household. Appointed by the monarch, he traditionally 
composes something for auspicious state occasions -- a royal 
birthday, wedding or funeral, or a famous victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky deems ``the American post nobler and more dignified. I do  
not serve a family or any branch of government, and I don't write 
poems for anniversaries. I am appointed by the Librarian of 
Congress as poetry consultant to the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In two years as laureate, Pinsky has written another book of  
poems, ``but not a stanza for any official occasion, nor do I 
intend to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the brief succession of U.S. poets laureate lacks the  
color and controversy of England's royal rhymesters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Jonson, in 1619, was the first to assume the laureateship,  
although in earlier times Chaucer and Spenser held the title of 
Versificator Regis, the King's verse-monger. 
</P>
<P>
	The literary laurel has since been worn by such eminent bards as  
Alfred Lord Tennyson, Robert Bridges, John Masefield and Ted 
Hughes, who died in October and whose successor has not yet been 
named. It also has been worn by a number of dullards, drones and 
drunkards who, like their poems, are best forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	Some suffered peculiar poetic justice.  
</P>
<P>
	John Dryden was a major poet with radically shifting political  
loyalties who could sing the praises of Oliver Cromwell, the 
restored Stuart Charles II and the Catholic James II. But he was 
stripped of the laureateship for refusing an oath of allegiance to 
William and Mary. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander Pope was the greatest poet of his age, but as a  
Catholic was unacceptable as laureate to the Protestant House of 
Hanover. Instead George II, who spoke broken English, named the 
hapless Colley Cibber to replace the drunken parson Laurence 
Eusden. 
</P>
<P>
	Cibber was a mediocre low comedian, an actor-manager and  
sometimes playwright specializing in bedroom farces who liberally 
plagiarized from Shakespeare, William Congreve and John Gay. He 
incurred Pope's wrath by turning Moliere's ``Tartuffe''' into an 
anti-Catholic diatribe. 
</P>
<P>
	The irascible Pope, known for his biting wit as the ``Wicked  
Wasp of Twickenham,'' stung the King's doggerel robber with a 
quatrain raucously repeated in every tavern and coffee house 
throughout the kingdom: 
</P>
<P>
	``In merry Olde England it once was the rule:  
</P>
<P>
	The King had his Poet and also his Fool.  
</P>
<P>
	But now we're so frugal, I'll have you know it,  
</P>
<P>
	The Cibber can serve both for Fool and for Poet.''  
</P>
<P>
	By tradition, the British poet laureate receives ``200 Pounds a  
year and a butt of sack''-- two hogsheads or 126 gallons of rather 
ordinary dry Spanish white wine not quite up to the standards of 
the royal table. 
</P>
<P>
	The American laureate is heir to no such liquid assets. However,  
Pinsky happily reports, when he was appointed, the American Wine 
Council sent him a case of excellent red and white table wine. 
``After the Library of Congress consulted its lawyers, I was 
allowed to accept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. laureate receives an annual stipend of $35,000 and a  
small travel budget. ``The taxpayers do not pay a cent of this,'' 
he says. ``The post is funded by a gift from philanthropist Archer 
M. Huntington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When not teaching, Pinsky frequently appears on PBS' ``The  
NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' musing on the headlines in verse. He is 
poetry editor of SLATE, an on-line magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	There is a touch of the poet in most of us, the poet laureate  
avows, whether computer nerd, professional wrestler, brain surgeon 
or taxi driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Pass me my Palgrave's Golden Treasury, I'm beginning to feel  
verse.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Recalls Playing Against Greats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANONSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The man who may be the NHL's best current  
player is about to go up against the man considered to be the best 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jaromir Jagr -- a former teammate of Mario Lemieux -- isn't  
ready to give that superlative title to Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagr's Penguins play Gretzky's Rangers Sunday in New York in  
what will be Gretzky's last game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played with Mario Lemieux and Ron Francis; Mario's in the  
Hall of Fame and Ronnie should be after he retires,'' Jagr said 
Friday. ``And I played against Gretzky, Mark Messier, Ray Bourque 
... guys like that. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, I think Mario was the best, but Gretzky's a great  
player, too. And that means our game with the Rangers is more 
important for them. It's already important for us to get ready for 
the playoffs,'' Jagr said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins (37-29-14) have two games remaining. They play the  
New York Islanders today at the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs begin Wednesday or Thursday for the Penguins.  
</P>
<P>
	Second-year Penguins coach Kevin Constantine said Gretzky's  
retirement could be a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a great player and a great ambassador for the game  
and nobody, including myself, likes to see those people leave it,'' 
Constantine said. ``We love the game ... and Wayne played a big 
part in it, but if he's going to retire, we're honored to be part 
of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the playoffs are more important.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to try to get ourselves ready for the playoffs, and  
we'll keep our focus on what we're doing as a team. ... And playing 
a team that has a reason to play helps us better prepare for the 
playoffs,'' Constantine said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers have been successful against the Penguins, with  
three wins and a tie. The Islanders, one of the worst teams in the 
NHL, split four games with Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins need two wins this weekend to rise from the eighth  
playoff spot to the No. 6 position. The Penguins aren't as 
concerned about which team they face in the first round as they are 
about how well they're playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be a healthy and rested team going into the  
playoffs, and I think we'll be fine once they start,'' forward 
Matthew Barnaby said. ``So, we're getting things together at the 
right time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing the last game against Gretzky will be something to  
tell my grandchildren someday, but we can't get caught up in that. 
We have to get ready for the playoffs and play our own game,'' 
Barnaby said.

<HEADLINE> Tranquility Lake Uupsets Virginie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Tranquility Lake, ridden by Eddie  
Delahoussaye, used a slow, easy pace to upset unbeaten Virginie and 
win the $250,000 Santa Barbara Handicap by four lengths Saturday at 
Santa Anita Park. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Tranquility Lake's first stakes victory.  
</P>
<P>
	Virginie finished second, 1 1/4 lengths in front of Midnight Line  
in the field of seven in the Grade II turf handicap for fillies and 
mares 4-years-old and up. Virginie had eight wins in her native 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Tranquility Lake set the pace and never relinquished it, leading  
by five lengths at the three-quarter mark. The winner covered 1 1/4 
miles over a firm course in 2:01, earning $150,000 and increasing 
her career earnings to $349,100. 
</P>
<P>
	Tranquility Lake carried 116 pounds and paid $13.40, $6.60 and  
$4.60. Virginie returned $4 and $3.20, while Midnight Line paid 
$4.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if there had been pace in front of her, she could have  
sat right off it and won,'' Delahoussaye said. ``When I found 
myself alone on the lead, I said, `Hey, we're on our way.''' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Tranquility Lake's fourth win in 11 starts.  
</P>
<P>
	In the $108,700 San Simeon Handicap, 11-1 long shot Naninja,  
ridden by Chris McCarron, won by a neck. The 6-year-old gelding 
covered 6 1/2 furlongs over a firm turf course in 1:13 1-5 and won 
$65,220 for lifetime earnings of $289,940. 
</P>
<P>
	Expressionist finished second, a head in front of favored Indian  
Rocket in the field of seven in the Grade III handicap for 
4-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
	Naninja, carried 115 pounds and paid $25.20, $9.60 and $3.80.

<HEADLINE> Starr May Turn Over Part of Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr is raising the possibility he  
might turn over parts of his criminal investigation of the Clintons 
to the Justice Department when the independent counsel law expires 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	If the law is not renewed, an independent counsel is required to  
``make a determination as to whether his continuation with matters 
in his jurisdiction is required,'' Starr said in an interview 
Friday with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he would follow the law and consult with the Justice  
Department before deciding. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor, whose investigation of almost five years has  
been criticized widely, said one possible approach would be to make 
``judgments ... with respect to what matters the independent 
counsel should carry on'' with ``and what matters should be 
otherwise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting a suggestion he is readying an exit strategy, Starr  
said his office will continue to function, though he declined to 
say how long he plans to stay on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he is considering replacing three Washington deputies  
who departed recently. ``We may be having an announcement'' 
shortly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least for now, Congress seems unlikely to reauthorize the  
post-Watergate statue. But a clause in the law says existing 
counsels are to stay on the job until their investigation is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr refused to speculate about what parts of his investigation  
might be turned over to the Justice Department, with which Starr 
said relations have become ``especially difficult'' in the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Monica Lewinsky investigation, the department represented  
the Secret Service in the court battle to keep uniformed officers 
and agents from testifying in Starr's investigation. Starr won the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has advised Starr it intends to investigate his  
handling of the Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said he has enjoyed the ``unfailing support of the  
director of the FBI. Louis Freeh has been terrific.'' Asked whether 
he would apply a similar assessment to the Attorney General Janet 
Reno, Starr declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations with the Justice Department were excellent in 1994  
when he began investigating the president and first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton for their involvement in the Whitewater real venture 
in Arkansas, Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Starr noted prosecutors got prompt approval from  
Reno to investigate then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker's cable 
television business, which had made him wealthy. Tucker ultimately 
pleaded guilty to using a sham bankruptcy to avoid taxes on that 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said cooperation from the attorney general is essential  
for the law to work properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The law ``purports to regulate with precision the attorney  
general's exercise of discretion, but then leads her exercise of 
discretion completely unreviewed and unchecked,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still pending before Starr's office are:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Two trials involving longtime Clinton friend and former  
associate attorney general Webster Hubbell. One is for tax evasion; 
the other for concealing evidence. Both cases are delayed because 
of appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A decision on whether to seek a retrial of Susan McDougal, one  
of the Clintons' Whitewater partners, on two counts of criminal 
contempt for refusing to give grand jury testimony about the 
president and first lady in 1996 and 1998. A judge declared a 
mistrial on the two counts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A May 3 trial of a Virginia woman, Julie Hiatt Steele, in  
Alexandria, Va., charged with obstructing Starr's probe into 
whether Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance toward former White 
House volunteer Kathleen Willey. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Wrapping up investigations of the FBI files controversy and  
the White House travel office firings. 
</P>
<P>
	One former independent counsel, Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence  
Walsh, said he did not think ``the expiration of the law is the 
test'' for sending a matter to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``The test is whether there's a conflict of interest that  
prevents you from turning it back to Justice,'' Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh served the final part of his tenure after the independent  
counsel law had expired the last time, in December 1992. He wrote 
his final report in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The law was reauthorized in June 1994, with Clinton's support.  
</P>
<P>
	A former Iran-Contra prosecutor on Walsh's staff, John Barrett,  
said there is nothing in the independent counsel law that requires 
Starr ``to terminate any aspect of his activity after June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law explicitly grandfathers in Independent Counsels as  
Walsh was grandfathered when the law expired in December of 1992,'' 
said Barrett, a St. John's University law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Starr surprised many by testifying before Congress  
that that law is flawed and should not be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I opposed the law back in the early 1980s when serving as  
chief of staff to then-Attorney General William French Smith,'' 
Starr said in the interview. ``My views have developed over the 
years, but they have not changed.''

<HEADLINE> Botched Launch Probe Delays NASA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray  
telescope may have to remain on Earth a while longer due to an 
investigation into a stranded military satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has impounded an upper-stage motor intended for  
the telescope, to be launched in July aboard space shuttle 
Columbia. It's the same kind of motor that apparently malfunctioned 
April 9 and left the Defense Department's newest Defense Support 
Program satellite in a useless orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope-delivery mission already is a year late because of  
bad circuit boards that had to be replaced in Chandra and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This telescope is a multibillion-dollar investment. You can  
rest assured the program is not going to go launch it until all the 
open questions have been answered,'' said payload manager Scott 
Higginbotham. 
</P>
<P>
	The stranded military satellite is spinning so fast in its  
lopsided orbit that Air Force controllers have yet to unfurl its 
electricity-generating solar panels. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're continually trying to work with it,'' Staff Sgt. Steve  
Horton of Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado said Friday. 
``There's always a hope that they can recover it and rescue it and 
get it into its proper orbit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $250 million satellite needs to be in a circular  
22,300-mile-high orbit in order to perform its missile-warning job. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is working  
with the Air Force's accident investigation board, which convened 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force must deliver the impounded Boeing-built motor to  
NASA by the end of April if the space agency hopes to meet its July 
9 launch date for Chandra, said Higginbotham. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra, a Hubble-caliber observatory, should have rocketed into  
orbit last summer. Unlike Hubble, the X-ray telescope will be 
placed in an orbit too high to be reached by spacewalking 
astronauts so it will be irreparable once launched.

<HEADLINE> USOC Tells Salt Lake to Cool It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Olympic organizers must step away from  
politics and stop worrying about money, says the top fundraising 
official for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am calling for an end to political rhetoric,'' said John  
Krimsky, deputy secretary general for the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
``The organizing committee is being led to an extent by those who 
have a government agenda ... (SLOC) cannot become distracted by 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky said there's too much attention being paid to the  
possibility taxpayers could be responsible if organizers can't 
cover the $1.4 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he's concerned sponsors will be driven away by  
extensive discussion of the Salt Lake bribery scandal's impact on 
finances. Companies don't want to be associated with a financially 
troubled Olympics any more than they want to see their names next 
to news of the scandal, Krimsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't chill the sales and marketing agreement and drive  
sponsors away because they feel these will not be the best games 
ever -- for whatever reason,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky is leading a marketing effort set on raising $859  
million from corporate sponsors. He said he's confident the money 
is there even though no new sponsors have signed on since the 
scandal surfaced last year, because four deals are pending, 
including one with the automobile manufacturer BMW. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen companies like US WEST, Delta Air Lines and  
Anheuser-Busch already have paid $50 million or so in cash, goods 
and services to sponsor both the Games and the U.S. Olympic teams 
through 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC's share of the cash expected to be raised through the joint  
sponsorship program is about $250 million. SLOC President Mitt 
Romney has pledged to raise $100 million from Utah residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Krimsky said, organizers should stop mulling over the  
numbers and start preparing for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We seem to be preoccupied with the budget at the moment. I  
hope nothing is falling through the cracks,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky's Couch is Top Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns began the Draft of the  
Quarterbacks today by selecting Kentucky's Tim Couch. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch, who left school after his junior season, reached a  
contract agreement with the expansion team hours before the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In selecting Couch, the Browns -- awarded a franchise by the NFL  
after the original Browns moved to Baltimore -- opened what was 
expected to be a first-round run on quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch posed for photographs with Browns owner Al Lerner while,  
in a makeshift Dawg Pound in the balcony, fans dressed in Browns 
jerseys chanted ``Here we go, Brownies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He displayed so much character and poise,'' Browns president  
Carmen Policy said. ``He's such a solid human being.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia continued the fancy with passers by selecting  
Donovan McNabb of Syracuse. McNabb, a three-time Big East Offensive 
Player of Year, joins a team whose projected starting quarterback 
is longtime third-stringer Doug Pederson. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't meet with the approval of the Eagles fans on hand  
who wanted the team to select Ricky Williams of Texas. For much of 
the hour before the pick, they shouted, ``We Want Ricky!'' and they 
booed loudly when McNabb's name was called. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1971, the first three selections were  
quarterbacks after Cincinnati took Akili Smith of Oregon. Although 
Smith was a starter for just one college season, his arm strength 
and athletic ability impressed the Bengals, who already have four 
quarterbacks on their roster. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, the top three selections were Jim Plunkett by the  
Patriots, Archie Manning by the Saints and Dan Pastorini by the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest shock of the draft -- and the biggest surprise in  
many years -- came on the fourth selection. Indianapolis traded star 
running back Marshall Faulk to St. Louis on Thursday, seemingly 
clearing the way to take Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams of 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Colts instead went for another running back, junior  
Edgerrin James of Miami, whose spectacular performance in the 
season finale against UCLA brought him to prominence. The stunned 
crowd let out a gasp when James' name was announced by commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We liked both backs ... but basically we feel Edgerrin gives  
us a little more with what we want to do with our offense,'' Colts 
coach Jim Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams went with the next pick -- to New Orleans. The Saints,  
who previously offered all of their 1999 picks to Cleveland for the 
top overall spot to get Williams, dealt with Washington moments 
after the Colts' stunner. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Ditka, sporting a big grin and an even bigger cigar  
after selecting college football's career rushing leader, traded a 
first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh picks this year and 
a first- and third-rounder in 2000 to the Redskins to get Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the kid. He's what we really need,'' Ditka said. ``He  
gives us what Walter Payton gave us in Chicago.''

<HEADLINE> HIV-Infected Mom Fights for Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- An HIV-infected woman who insists on her  
right to breast-feed is taking a life-or-death chance with her 
child, a state attorney said during a custody hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Tyson is ``playing Russian roulette with the virus,''  
said Robert Nagler, the state lawyer who is representing 
4-month-old Felix Tyson in court proceedings that began Friday. 
``The parents were blessed with a robust, healthy child, but they 
also chose to adopt a cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tyson and her husband, David, have physical custody of the  
child, but the state has retained legal custody pending the outcome 
of the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the couple promised Friday to call witnesses who  
believe there is no evidence that the HIV virus can be contracted 
by drinking breast milk, and who do not believe the HIV virus 
causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tysons ascribe to both theories and argue that they have the  
right to raise Felix as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
	``She made a choice that she feels is in Felix's best  
interest,'' said Hilary Billings, the mother's attorney. ``It's a 
measure of risks against each other and benefits against each other 
... The issue would boil down to where a certain line needs to be 
drawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tysons are part of the ``Rethinking AIDS'' movement led by  
scientist David Rasnick of the University of California at 
Berkeley. Rasnick is expected to testify that there is no 
relationship between HIV and AIDS, and that the state has no right 
to enforce unfounded medical theory. 
</P>
<P>
	But sentiments on the other side are equally strong. A number of  
medical professionals and social workers believe Felix's health 
would be endangered if he were to drink his mother's milk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bizarre that 18 years after the epidemic began that  
there's any question about the cause of HIV infection,'' said 
Leslie Mehlhaff, an infectious disease specialist who advised Tyson 
against breast feeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after Felix was born Dec. 7, a state social worker arrived  
at the hospital with three uniformed police officers after Tyson's 
doctor expressed concern about her breast-feeding the baby. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Jo Driscoll, social worker with Oregon's child welfare  
agency, said the couple became combative and told her they believed 
bottle feeding was the method that carried the real deadly risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were upset,'' she said. ``They believed they were making  
informed decisions about their son. They thought I was intruding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several weeks after the state took legal custody of Felix, he  
tested negative for HIV. He has not been tested since. 
</P>
<P>
	About once a week, a caseworker from Oregon's Office for  
Services to Children and Families makes a visit to the Tyson home 
to ensure the state's will is being carried out. The caseworker 
said the child shows no sign of behavior typical of breast-feeding 
and Tyson can be trusted to carry out the court order.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Raul Diaz Arce's goal in the fifth shootout  
round gave the San Jose Clash a 2-1 victory over D.C. United on 
Saturday night before the largest crowd to watch a regular-season 
MLS game at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz Arce challenged United goalkeeper Tom Presthus straight on,  
sliding a low shot that snuck beneath his right arm for the 
decisive goal. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose also got goals during the shootout from Ronald  
Cerritos, Eddie Lewis and Jamie Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno scored in the first two rounds  
of the shootout for D.C. United, which lost its first in four 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The game drew 35,167, the largest crowd to see an MLS regular  
season game, surpassing the 35,032 that attended D.C. United's 
inaugural match in 1996. The only larger crowd in franchise history 
was the 57,431 that saw the United win the MLS Cup in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	D.C. United's Geoff Augner and Cerritos swapped goals in a  
seven-minute, first-half span for a 1-1 halftime tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The United went ahead 1-0 in the fourth minute when Augner  
converted a left-wing chip from Etcheverry. 
</P>
<P>
	Presthus gobbled up Diaz Arce's point-blank attempt about a  
minute later, but was helpless to stop Cerritos in the 11th minute. 
Cerritos leaped high to flick a header off a feed from Cloutier. 
</P>
<P>
	Augner was ejected in the 75th minute for undercutting San  
Jose's Jeff Baicher, and the United played a man down for the 
remainder of regulation.

<HEADLINE> Utah Mulls Shooting Circumstances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A mentally ill man's shooting rampage at  
the Mormon Family History Library has left health officials, law 
enforcement and the gunman's son arguing over whether the tragedy 
could have been averted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so terrible, so shocking and it could have easily been  
prevented,'' said Alex Babarin, 48. 
</P>
<P>
	His 71-year-old father, Sergei Babarin, walked into the library  
Thursday and opened fire, killing two people and wounding four 
before police killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	While Alex Babarin said Friday that the mental health system  
should have been more attentive, Salt Lake County mental health 
officials said they did everything they legally could. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Police Chief Ruben Ortega pushed for new laws to keep  
guns out of the hands of certain mentally ill people. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is ludicrous. It's happening too much all over the  
country and innocent people are dying,'' Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief focused on loopholes in parts of the 1994 Brady bill,  
which prohibits the sale of guns to those who have been declared 
mentally incompetent. Ortega said the problem is that few of Utah's 
100,000 people diagnosed with mental illness meet a threshold 
required by law, which essentially requires a person to be a clear 
and imminent danger to himself or others. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortega wants psychiatrists to be required to report to the state  
Department of Public Safety the names of people diagnosed with any 
one of a list of particular mental illnesses. Gun dealers would 
then be barred from selling to anyone on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's so doable and it makes so much sense,'' Ortega said.  
``We can work out the law to give the doctors and patients 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Alex Babarin said that law wouldn't have deterred his  
paranoid father's murderous impulses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could just take a car and run people down,'' Babarin said  
</P>
<P>
	Babarin said he fought to get his father committed for nearly a  
year. Just two days before the shooting, his father accused him of 
spying and being out to get him -- the same charges he leveled 
against his wife, his neighbors, even people passing in the street. 
</P>
<P>
	But his illness went untreated because he also feared doctors  
and refused to take the medication prescribed to him, calling it 
poison. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks Sergei Babarin had said television coverage of  
the NATO attack in Kosovo reminded him of his wartime youth, and 
his son thinks that might have spurred Thursday's deadly attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been easily prevented, just by taking him for a  
few days or a few weeks at the hospital, start him taking 
medicine,'' Babarin said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Valley Mental Health center did not admit him because  
doctors there did not diagnose him with schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Stevens, Valley's clinical director, said the  
hospital could not declare him incompetent for fear of violating 
his civil rights, which demand an involuntary patient show an 
imminent threat of endangering himself or others. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was determined that Babarin would be admitted if he  
showed further signs of danger.

<HEADLINE> Intimate Universe: The Human Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Want to see a sword-swallower's vocal cords?  
Or watch a British lord get drunk? Tune in to the Learning Channel 
for ``Intimate Universe: The Human Body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Fantastic Voyage,'' the 1966 movie showed scientists  
miniaturized to microscopic size and injected into a living body. 
But that was science fiction. The BBC, using medical advances, 
presents the real thing, peering into the workings of the heart, 
womb and other organs in four one-hour segments on TLC Sunday and 
Monday, April 18-19 at 9 p.m. EDT. (The final four hours will be 
shown Aug. 1-2, preceded by a repeat of the first segments.) 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Winston, the tour guide, is man of many talents. He can  
be addressed as Doctor (he is a renowned expert on infertility), 
Professor (he teaches at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School), or 
Lord (he holds a non-inherited seat in Britain's House of Lords). 
</P>
<P>
	But in a telephone interview from London, he seemed to shun any  
such formality. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I think we may have achieved,'' he remarked, ``is to  
demonstrate that you can make perfectly respectable science 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that is what made it such a landmark on British  
television and why it was such an incredible success in Australia 
and New Zealand. I believe it was the most watched series ever in 
New Zealand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited some television firsts for ``Intimate Universe'':  
imaging of the brain, neurons firing, and the use of endoscopy, 
where a slim fiber-optic tube records such things as a fetus 
growing inside the womb and the vocal cords of a sword swallower. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston is no stranger to television. In 1996, BBC presented  
``Making Babies,'' a seven-part series about his infertility unit 
at Hammersmith Hospital, and he has often appeared on TV as a 
medical expert. 
</P>
<P>
	``Intimate Universe'' took him from French caves to Egypt, from  
Yellowstone National Park to Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a way of relaxation,'' he said. But not always. At one  
point he was supposed to film in Guatemala. But he and the producer 
were too tired to travel there so they shot the segment on the 
Thames River. 
</P>
<P>
	To demonstrate the body's reaction to alcohol, Winston did  
something rather undoctorly and unlordly: He got drunk, on camera. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was shot in a London restaurant. Winston drank more  
than two bottles of wine, ``and demonstrated that I can't hold my 
liquor very well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really quite a difficult thing to do. It's quite lonely,  
getting drunk on your own, with a camera and a large crew watching 
you. You feel quite exposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another episode explaining the effects of morning sickness  
required him to get seasick. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a bit of a fake, to tell you the truth,'' he  
confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shot that on a very rough day off the English coast, but it  
wasn't as bad as we made it look. I have to admit that there was a 
certain amount of economy with the truth. But it was meant to be a 
fun, lighthearted piece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Do Winston's fellow lords and physicians look askance at his  
dabbling in something akin to show business? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in Parliament the series went very well,'' he replied.  
``The parliamentarians liked it a lot, both in the Commons and the 
House of Lords. The prime minister's wife watched the whole series, 
with her children, and she was very complimentary about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not so sure, though, that fellow medics were quite so  
congratulatory. The physical scientists liked it. I think the 
problem with one's colleagues is that they're a little bit jealous 
that they hadn't done it.''

<HEADLINE> Patriots Get The Big Kat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Andy Katzenmoyer might be known best for  
being one of Ohio State's greatest linebackers if he wasn't known 
nearly as well for academic and alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England Patriots overlooked those troubles -- and the  
fact his play dropped off last season -- and took him with the 28th 
pick of the first round of Saturday's NFL draft, their second 
choice of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to bring great enthusiasm and intensity,'' Patriots  
coach Pete Carroll said. ``He's as fast as any linebacker out 
there. He's big and strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer was a second-team All-American as a freshman in  
1996, a first-team All-American in 1997 but only a first-team 
All-Big Ten conference selection last season as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did the jobs that the coaches asked me to do,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	His coach, John Cooper, said opponents put two and three  
blockers on him to try to control him last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other teams wised up a little bit,'' Cooper said. ``I  
thought Andy would go in the top 10 (or 15) this year. Physically, 
he's got that kind of talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a first-round draft pick,'' Katzenmoyer said. ``That's  
something that every kid dreams of, and I'm going to a great 
organization so there's nothing to complain about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His problems might have hurt his stock in the draft, Cooper  
said. And Katzenmoyer admitted he let his schoolwork slip to the 
point where he had to go to summer school before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just lack of discipline on my part in the grades  
department. I was lost for a little while and my classes slipped,'' 
he said. ``It just woke me up and made me realize you can't fall 
behind in anything you want to achieve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his past alcohol problems are ``a non-issue with me and  
my family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted of underage drinking after a policeman saw him  
with a beer at a bar on his Ohio State recruiting visit. And last 
winter, he pleaded no contest to charges of speeding and drunken 
driving. He paid fines in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll didn't seem particularly concerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we start talking about Andy ... being kind of crazy and  
kind of wild and a guy that isn't real fired up about school, it 
kind of starts making a little format for what a linebacker might 
be all about that you need in this league,'' Carroll said. ``This 
guy is nuts about football. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really excited about the fact that now he can concentrate  
and put all his direction into football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Katzenmoyer was an inside linebacker in college, but the  
Patriots plan to use him outside as a replacement for Todd Collins, 
who signed with St. Louis as a free agent. Katzenmoyer could share 
time at that spot with Tedy Bruschi, who is best in third-down 
situations.

<HEADLINE> Organic Food Going Mainstream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers once could find organic food  
products only in specialty stores. Today, with more organic choices 
than ever, from beef to baby food, and with more markets stocking 
the goods, organic is going mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	Stores are selling meats and poultry products carrying organic  
labels, which the Agriculture Department approved in January. Last 
month, food giant General Mills introduced its organic cereal, 
Sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic vegetables and fruits, already well known to consumers,  
now are being used in a variety of products, including baby food. 
</P>
<P>
	For years organic foods were bit players in the food industry.  
The growing number of organic offerings, supporters say, shows a 
mainstream acceptance -- and a victory for farmers, merchants and 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the last few years, when you talk about organic, usually  
it's lettuce, vegetables, fruit,'' said Bob Scowcroft, executive 
director of the Organic Farming Research Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You devote your life to this and it's just hard to envision.  
... Overnight, it's the ad in the middle of the evening news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the organic industry is growing at least 20 percent  
each year in the last five years, with overall 1997 sales of about 
$4.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The increased demand has caught the attention of the estimated  
5,300 farmers growing organic products, Scowcroft said. Each day, 
his office hears from dozens of farmers wanting information about 
making the transition to organic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quantity that General Mills is buying and their projected  
expansion . . . shows up on the radar screen (for farmers),'' 
Scowcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Sunrise cereal contains organic whole wheat, corn, oats  
and barley as well as organic sugar, said Scott Lutz, vice 
president for new enterprises at General Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the bigger challenges was to make sure there was an  
ample supply of organic grains and organic sugar,'' Lutz said. The 
company spent about four years developing the product. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reaction has been very positive,'' Lutz said. ``We've been  
hearing from consumers for quite some time that they wanted another 
choice. We tried to make organic cereals accessible to the 
mainstream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers will also benefit from the introduction of organic  
meat in stores across the country, activists say.

<P>
	Organically-grown meat typically comes from animals that have  
been fed vegetarian diets free of pesticides, fertilizers and 
antibiotics. The animals are also free range, meaning they are able 
to roam and are not confined to small pens that sometimes house 
hundreds of animals. 
</P>
<P>
	In a much-anticipated announcement, Agriculture Secretary Dan  
Glickman in January said the agency would allow meat to be 
certified and labeled as organic. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the industry had complained that it was unfair to allow  
vegetables, fruits and milk to be labeled organic, while placing 
restraints on the meat industry. 
</P>
<P>
	California-based Petaluma Poultry, which has marketed  
antibiotic-free chicken for several years, plans to introduce its 
Rosie the Organic Chicken next week to consumers in California, 
Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic Valley, a Wisconsin-based company that has marketed  
vegetables and milk, already offers frozen hot dogs and hamburger 
patties. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Organic Valley plans to introduce the first organic  
bacon and ham as well as whole organic chicken and chicken breasts. 
A line of sausage products is expected in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh products first will be marketed in the Midwest while  
the frozen items will be distributed nationally, said Theresa 
Marquez, Organic Valley's marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Shainsky, president of Petaluma Poultry, said if the  
growth of his company's antibiotic-free chicken line is any 
indication of what is in store for organic, the industry should do 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen the reaction to our antibiotic free business become  
bigger and bigger,'' Shainsky said. ``You hear how everyone wants 
organic. We'll see how well we're received.''

<HEADLINE> Former Mets GM Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JENSEN BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Joe McIlvaine, former general manager  
of the New York Mets and now an assistant GM for the Minnesota 
Twins, was charged with a misdemeanor for nude sunbathing on a 
public beach. 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine, 51, was arrested last Monday after Martin County  
sheriff's deputies answered several calls complaining about a man 
lying on his stomach on the beach without any clothes on. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like he had to have known better,'' said Janell  
Atlas, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. ``He knew he wasn't 
supposed to be naked. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was lying there buck naked,'' Atlas said. ``When the deputy  
approached him, he started to put his shorts back on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine was released on $1,000 bail.  
</P>
<P>
	McIlvaine's lawyer, Michael Rubin, called it ``not a big deal at  
all.'' He said McIlvaine thought he was on a private beach, and 
therefore not violating any rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real innocent incident of sunbathing,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Crew 1, Revolution 0, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- New England player-coach Walter Zenga made  
a handful of brilliant saves in regulation but allowed four goals 
in the shootout as the Columbus Crew beat the Revolution 1-0 
Saturday night in the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern John, Brian McBride, Jeff Cunningham and Jason Farrell all  
scored in the shootout for Columbus (3-1), while Kris Kelderman 
converted the lone goal for the Revolution (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Three of New England's four matches this season have been  
decided by a shootout, prompting the crowd to chant ``No more 
shootouts'' prior to the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, played at a breakneck pace with little imagination or  
control by either side, was punctuated by missed scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew had the better of the play, but missed two easy chances  
in the opening minutes and a handful of golden opportunities later 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	John, a Trinidad &AMP; Tobago international, failed to finish in the  
first minute of play and then was foiled by a masterful goalkeeping 
demonstration by Zenga. After Zenga kicked out a bid by McBride, he 
snuffed a 6-yard blast from John at 36 minutes and a minute later, 
stopped a shot by John from 14 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution failed to create more than a couple of legitimate  
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 53rd minute, Edwin Gorter threaded a pass to Johnny  
Torres, whose shot from 12 yards was headed off the line by Crew 
midfielder Todd Yeagley. Six minutes later, the Revolution nearly 
scored when Joe-Max Moore was put through by Tony Kuhn only to 
shoot wide along the left post from 16 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	At 69 minutes, John headed down a cross from substitute Ansil  
Elcock only to have McBride put the ball over the bar from seven 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew in the midst of seven straight road games as they await  
the completion of their new, soccer-specific stadium, are 10-3 
all-time against New England.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Undercover narcotics officers arrested 14 people  
early Saturday at a popular Manhattan nightclub where the drug 
Ecstasy was being sold, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	One patron at the Tunnel club suffered a drug overdose and was  
taken to a hospital during the buy-and-bust operation, said 
Detective George Nagy, a department spokesman. 
</P>

	The nightspot is operated by Peter Gatien, who also owns the  
Limelight. Last month, he and his wife pleaded guilty to larceny 
and tax evasion charges.

	Last year, Gatien was acquitted in a federal narcotics case.  
Prosecutors claimed he had allowed sales of cocaine and other drugs 
to his customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those arrested early Saturday, nine were charged with  
selling the drug, three with possession and one with disorderly 
conduct, Nagy said.

<HEADLINE> Skins Swap Around, Still Get Bailey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins worked the draft to  
perfection, wheeling and dealing and winding up with exactly what 
they wanted -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
	After two trades involving 11 draft picks in the first 90  
minutes Saturday, the Redskins not only got the player they had 
targeted -- Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey -- but also left 
themselves loaded for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprised to see Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams still  
available when they went on the clock, the Redskins took up Mike 
Ditka's offer and traded their No. 5 overall pick for the New 
Orleans Saints' entire draft -- plus first- and third-round choices 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	That put the Redskins at No. 12 overall, too low to get Bailey,  
so they packaged five picks and sent them to Chicago to move up to 
No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The end result: Bailey comes to Washington, and the Redskins --  
who already had two first-round draft picks in 2000 -- now have 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about a lot of phone calls in a short period of  
time,'' said general manager Charley Casserly, who had worked out a 
firm deal with New Orleans and a tentative one with Chicago before 
the draft started just in the unlikely case that Williams didn't go 
in the top four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone felt at No. 4, Indianapolis was going to take a  
running back. Everyone assumed it was Ricky Williams. We were 
wrong,'' Casserly said. ``So we moved back two spots, got a No. 1 
next year and the player we were going to take at No. 5. When we 
put that all together, it's a pretty good deal for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casserly said the Redskins gave some consideration to taking  
Williams, but coach Norv Turner is content with young running backs 
Stephen Davis and Skip Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to come away with a corner,'' Turner said.  
``Champ Bailey was the corner we preferred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, 6-foot and 181 pounds, was considered the best  
all-around player available in the draft. He was also a stellar 
receiver and return man in college, but Turner said he wants Bailey 
to concentrate on defense before even trying to make him the next 
Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing for Champ is to come in here and learn how  
to play cornerback at this level,'' Turner said. ``With specific 
coaching, spending all of his time on defense, he can make great 
strides and improve. We're not going to fool around with the 
offensive part of it until he's thoroughly comfortable as a 
corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said he expects Bailey to start this season, and backed  
it up by announcing that 11-year veteran and two-time Pro Bowl 
selection Cris Dishman -- who had a miserable season last year -- 
will be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That news stunned Bailey.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, man,'' Bailey said. ``I remember watching him when he  
played for the Oilers, and he was a great corner. That's as big 
complement. Man! Oh, that means a lot right there. For them to do 
that, that means they got a lot of confidence in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, speaking by phone from his family home in Folkston, Ga.,  
said he was celebrating his selection with about 300 people and an 
outdoor buffet of crawfish. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as Turner's decree that can't play offense right away,  
Bailey sounded eager to prove he can go both ways in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can prove myself to be a great corner, and playing other  
positions can only help me, I believe,'' Bailey said. ``I'm going 
to be ready to do whatever it takes to prove myself at this level 
and do what I've got to do be a productive corner and receiver.''

<HEADLINE> Pit Road Could Decide Goody's 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Now that they've all had a chance to  
see Martinsville Speedway's all-new pit road, some Winston Cup 
drivers think it's an equalizer while others see it as a travesty 
waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of pits on the front and back stretches, the .526-mile  
oval now has one long pit road that begins where the third turn 
starts, continues all the way through the front stretch and stops 
where the second turn ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers have long complained at NASCAR's oldest and shortest  
track that pitting on the back under the old setup made winning 
near impossible, but many view the new arrangement with a 35 
mph-pit road speed as dicey, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to be careful what you pray for sometimes,'' said  
Darrell Waltrip, second only to Richard Petty with 11 career 
victories at Martinsville Speedway. ``We've all been praying for 
one pit road here and we've got it. Now we've got to help them make 
it as good as it can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Petty, who qualified 10th for Sunday's Goody's Body Pain  
500, doesn't like it at all, saying he preferred the front and back 
pits. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pit road is going to kill you, period, on a green-flag  
stop,'' he said. ``Look at the race track. It's a half-mile track. 
We can get around here in 20 seconds. It takes you 44 seconds to go 
down pit road at 35 mph. That's two laps you've got already during 
a green flag stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petty said he didn't mind pitting on the back and at least  
having a chance to be competitive, but Winston Cup point standings 
leader Jeff Burton thinks the difference between competing and 
having a chance matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may be penalized because you're running in the back, but  
in Winston Cup racing we get paid points for racing,'' said Burton, 
who qualified third. ``The only thing that pays in qualifying is 
the pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything around Winston Cup is built on racing, so why  
should there be a pit road on the back that hampers you from 
winning that badly?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wall erected to form the outside boundary of pit road also  
gives some drivers cause for concern, some saying the road isn't 
wide enough, especially at the end in turns one and two, others 
because it's something to hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only problem will be if somebody spins and backs up in  
(the turns),'' Waltrip said. ``There no grass to back into. There's 
a wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several drivers said they planned to watch Saturday's NAPA 250  
Craftsman Truck Series race with interest to see how the pit 
situation worked out, and others said they were content just to see 
what happens on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no telling what we're going to see,'' Ken Schrader  
said. ``I wouldn't even start to guess about that. It's going to be 
interesting.''

</P>
<P>
                     *Washington and New Orleans

<HEADLINE> Misplaced Embryo Case Explored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An embryologist who assisted in the in vitro  
fertilization of a woman who gave birth to two babies -- one white, 
one black -- knew his error caused the wrong embryo to be implanted 
in the woman but remained silent, according to a state inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Obasaju was aware he had given Dr. Lillian Nash the  
wrong embryos for implantation but prepared a second batch with 
correct embryos rather than stop the procedure immediately, 
according to the report, which was obtained under the Freedom of 
Information Act and detailed in today's New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The case that became public last month when Robert Rogers and  
Deborah Perry-Rogers, a black couple from Teaneck, N.J., claimed 
Richard and Donna Fasano, who are both white, were given an embryo 
that the Rogers stored at the IVF New York clinic in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Fasano gave birth to two boys in December 1998. One child,  
who is white, was her biological child; the black baby is no 
relation. 
</P>
<P>
	The mix-up occurred on April 24, 1998, when Mrs. Fasano and Mrs.  
Perry-Rogers were in the office for embryo implantation after in 
vitro fertilization of their eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparing the embryos, Obasaju separated four of Mrs.  
Perry-Rogers' fertilized embryos, which he determined to be lower 
grade, to be discarded. But he accidentally placed those embryos 
into a catheter used for Mrs. Fasano's procedure, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Had he announced his mistake immediately, the embryos could have  
been washed out, said Diane Mathis, a state Department of Health 
spokeswoman. But Obasaju didn't admit his error until Nash learned 
that Mrs. Fasano was pregnant, the report said. He did not come 
forward sooner because he thought the wrong embryos would not grow, 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state report cited Nash for failing to properly oversee  
Obasaju. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fasanos filed a malpractice suit against Nash, Obasaju and  
another physician, Dr. Dov Goldstein, on April 5. Court papers said 
Nash informed both couples of the mistake months before Mrs. Fasano 
gave birth to the boy. The Fasanos did not know the Rogers until 
they filed suit seeking custody of the black baby. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fasanos have said they will give the Rogers custody of the  
black baby if DNA tests show they are the baby's genetic parents. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cohen, a lawyer for the Fasanos, said Friday that the  
tests had been completed. He would not reveal the results, but said 
lawyers for both couples were negotiating a visitation agreement so 
the boys would grow up knowing each other.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Wohlers Has Anxiety Disorder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mark Wohlers was put on the 15-day disabled  
list Saturday because of an anxiety disorder, a day after the 
Cincinnati Reds got the struggling reliever in a trade with the 
Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers and the Reds both believe he can once again be a  
dominant closer. They just don't know when he might make it back to 
the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no timetable,'' Wohlers said at Cinergy Field before a  
7-6 loss in 10 innings to Pittsburgh. ``It could be two weeks. It 
could be two months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers has been unable to solve the control problems that ended  
his career with the Braves. He will join Triple-A Indianapolis to 
begin a rehabilitation assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both parties believe I can overcome this and get back to doing  
what I used to do,'' Wohlers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reds general manager Jim Bowden described Wohlers' situation as  
a ``mental reclamation project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're completely satisfied that physically he's fine,'' Bowden  
said. ``It's mental, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds got the 29-year-old right-hander from the Braves for  
pitcher John Hudek. Cincinnati also will receive at least $4.4 
million from Atlanta to cover Wohlers' big salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers recorded 97 saves from 1995-97, and closed out the  
clinching Game 6 of the 1995 World Series for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	After running into severe control trouble last season -- he was  
sent down to Triple-A Richmond for a time -- Wohlers seemed to be 
making progress this year in spring training. But he got off to a 
bad start in the regular season, walking six in only two-thirds of 
an inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers said he hopes to find a more successful approach with  
the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm not going to make every pitch life and death,'' he  
said. ``I'm not going to put pressure on myself to make every pitch 
a perfect pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers said he had run out of things to try with the Braves.  
</P>
<P>
	``I did everything I could do over there,'' he said. ``I tapped  
all their resources. I went to Richmond twice last year. I think I 
tried to do too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said he's not worried about Wohlers' physical condition.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it's a mental problem. We will employ every  
psychologist, psychiatrist or imaging specialist necessary to help 
him overcome it,'' he said.

	PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) -- Long-awaited rains appeared to  
dampen some brush fires and dust-dry forests Saturday, but Florida 
officials still issued a warning that more fires were likely on 
Sunday.

	Earlier Saturday, 10 tractor plow operators from the Texas  
Forest Service arrived to help fight the fires that have scorched 
spots across the Sunshine State for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra equipment is expected to be used to fight fires like  
the 50,000-acre blaze setting parts of the Everglades crackling 
Saturday night along. 
</P>
<P>
	The massive fire -- the largest so far this year -- sent a thick  
blanket of smoke wafting southward, prompting hundreds of calls to 
fire officials in Miami, 45 miles to the southeast, from people 
trying to locate the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Drivers in parts of South Florida had to turn on their  
headlights to make their way under smoke-darkened skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke from the blaze closed the portion of Interstate 75 known  
as Alligator Alley, one of two roads that connects the east and 
west coasts of Florida's southern peninsula. The other road 
connecting the coasts, U.S. 41, remained open. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not affecting anyone. It's too far west,'' said Bill  
Parker, a spokesman for the Florida Division of Forestry of the 
huge Everglades fire. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Florida, though, firefighters battled a 250-acre fire  
in Walton County that destroyed one house and forced the evacuation 
of 35 families. There was a 40-acre fire near a heavily populated 
area in the Panhandle's Santa Rosa County, but no evacuations were 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	In St. Lucie County, southeast of Orlando on Florida's Atlantic  
Coast, where 43 homes were burned in wild fires just being 
contained Saturday, homeowners spent the weekend searching for 
anything worth saving among the ashes and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Idamaye and George Cooksey, helped by several neighbors, found a  
diamond ring that Mrs. Cooksey had inherited. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you believe that?'' asked Mrs. Cooksey, 73, as her  
neighbors applauded. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was the only bright spot. The only other recognizable  
remains of their three-bedroom house were a shower pipe and the 
remnants of appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,450 fires have burned 60,166 acres this year,  
including 30 that covered more than 2,250 acres on Friday, said 
Barbara Doran, spokeswoman for the state Emergency Operations 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In Port St. Lucie, residents returning Saturday found damaged or  
destroyed homes, charred lawns and trees turned to charcoal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really heartbreaking,'' Mary Gitto said as she and her  
husband, Sal, looked at the damage. ``I pray to God I never see 
anything like this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities suspect the fire was set.  
</P>
<P>
	Martha Brann started crying when she thought about all she lost  
when her ranch-style house burned to the ground. Gone were photos 
of her children, her mother's gold wedding band and the diamond 
ring from her ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't get nothing,'' Ms. Brann, 59, said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	With rainfall 90 percent below normal during Florida's dry  
season, some fire officials fear conditions are ripe for a repeat 
of last summer's blazes that charred 500,000 acres and forced 
100,000 people from their homes.

<HEADLINE> Charlotte Desegregation Challenged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A parent's lawsuit challenging his  
child's kindergarten assignment has sparked a new look at three 
decades of desegregation in North Carolina's largest school system. 
</P>
<P>
	The case goes to federal court Monday as a broad review of the  
whole issue of busing for desegregation in the 
Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools. 
</P>
<P>
	On one side are parents who believe it's time to end raced-based  
busing. On the other are school officials and black parents who say 
the school system still lacks equal opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got a montage of inequities in our schools,'' said  
Dwayne Collins, president of the local branch of the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a narrow focus on Bill Capacchione's complaints abut  
his child's magnet school assignment in 1997, U.S. District Judge 
Robert Potter broadened the case into a sweeping look at the 
race-based policies of the school system. 
</P>
<P>
	The case will include a review of the landmark Swann vs.  
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education case. U.S. District Judge 
James McMillan's ruling in that case in 1969 ordered mandatory 
busing to achieve desegregation. The U.S. Supreme Court, in 
upholding the decision in 1971, cleared the way for busing 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Capacchione case was widened last year, a group of  
white parents filed its own desegregation lawsuit against the 
school board. In August, Potter allowed three black families to 
join the suit on the Swann side. Those parents, who include 
Collins, want to keep the 1969 court order in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Potter could lift the court order and declare the city's school  
system to be ``unitary,'' which means it offers equal opportunities 
to students of all races. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts that have been declared unitary, including  
those in Cleveland, Denver and Norfolk, Va., were released from 
court-ordered desegregation plans. 
</P>
<P>
	In Charlotte, top school officials maintain more work needs to  
be done to remove the final vestiges of segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, Capacchione sued the school board after his  
daughter, Cristina, was twice denied entrance into the 
communications magnet program at Olde Providence Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
	Cristina, who is half Hispanic, half white, fell into the  
``nonblack'' category that the school system uses to allot magnet 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	In a December 1998 deposition, Capacchione said Cristina's  
constitutional rights were violated when she ``was not permitted to 
compete equally with similarly situated black people because she is 
not of a preferred race under CMS policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said: ``In effect, CMS hung a `no non-blacks need apply' sign  
on its black-only seats and racially segregated its non-black 
applicants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A challenge similar to the Capacchione case was filed in Boston  
in 1995 and prompted revisions in the city's admission policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP's Collins said he decided to join the suit because he  
is concerned about the lower test scores of black students compared 
to white students. He looks at the trial as an opportunity to put a 
spotlight on the problems with Charlotte's inner city schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was inevitable that this case was going to come  
back to court,'' Collins said. ``What was promised 30 years ago has 
not come to be.''

<HEADLINE> Saints Overshadow QB Triple Take </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The quarterbacks went as quickly as 1-2-3. Then  
the dealing began, with Ricky Williams at the center of it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Couch, Donovan McNabb and Akili Smith went to Cleveland,  
Philadelphia and Cincinnati in Saturday's NFL draft -- the first 
quarterback trifecta since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	And five QBs overall were taken in the top dozen with Daunte  
Culpepper going to Minnesota with the 11th pick and Cade McNown to 
Chicago with the next choice. A sixth quarterback, Shaun King, was 
taken in the second round by Tampa Bay, 50th overall and a seventh, 
Brock Huard, to Seattle in the third, 77th overall. 
</P>
<P>
	But they had to share top billing with the New Orleans Saints  
and coach Mike Ditka, who did just what he said he'd do: get 
Williams, the Heisman Trophy-winning running back, no matter what 
it took. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Ditka's deal helped out the Washington Redskins.  
</P>
<P>
	He made his move when Indianapolis used the fourth overall pick  
to take Miami running back Edgerrin James instead of Williams. 
Ditka traded all his picks this year and his first and third next 
year to Washington, a total of eight in all. It set up the rest of 
the draft and it certainly set up the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	After the deal for Williams was struck, Ditka emerged from the  
Saints' war room, pumped both fists in the air, fired up a big 
cigar and shouted: ``The power of prayer did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the kid, everything about him,'' Ditka said. ``It's  
what we need. I think he's going to show people he's the best 
college football player coming out. He gives us what Walter Payton 
gave Chicago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of that would have happened had not the Colts taken James  
over Williams, who was disappointed not to be the first running 
back taken. 
</P>
<P>
	That opened the way for the Redskins to deal with the Saints and  
allowed the Skins to turn around and trade some of those picks to 
the Bears to for the seventh choice and the player they wanted all 
along -- cornerback Champ Bailey of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Colts president Bill Polian said it ``basically was a tie''  
between James and Williams, although James was better at catching 
the football. That's important in the Colts' offense, particularly 
without Marshall Faulk, who had 86 catches last season but was 
traded to the Rams on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	This was also a socially significant draft.  
</P>
<P>
	Of the first five quarterbacks taken, three are black: McNabb,  
Smith and Culpepper. That equals the entire number of black 
quarterbacks taken in the first round since the NFL-AFL merger in 
1970 -- Doug Williams in 1978, Andre Ware in 1990 and Steve McNair 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland, then in the AFL, chose Eldridge Dickey in the first  
round in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time. We have maybe five or six African-American  
quarterbacks that will be going in the draft today or tomorrow,'' 
said Smith, whose prediction came true again in the second round 
when the Bucs took King. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of people like Doug Williams who have paved the way,  
it now becomes a burden on us to pave the way for the next 
generation,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns' pick was preordained after the new team signed the  
Kentucky junior before the draft. So was Philadelphia's selection 
of McNabb, the Syracuse quarterback, although Eagles fans wanted 
Williams so badly that a group seated in the gallery booed and 
shouted ``We want Ricky!'' when the team selected McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	That made it the second straight year that QBs had gone 1-2 --  
last year it was Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf. Smith made it the 
first time since 1971 that quarterbacks had gone in the first three 
picks: Jim Plunkett was No. 1; Peyton's dad Archie, No. 2, and Dan 
Pastorini No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the shocker of James over Williams.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone felt at No. 4, Indianapolis was going to take a  
running back. Everyone assumed it was Ricky Williams,'' said 
Washington general manager Charley Casserly, who now has three 
first-rounders next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were wrong. So we moved back two spots, got a No. 1 next  
year and the player we were going to take at No. 5. When we put 
that all together, it's a pretty good deal for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few surprises followed.  
</P>
<P>
	St. Louis used No. 6 on Torry Holt, the North Carolina State  
wide receiver. Washington, using some of the Saints' picks to get 
up Chicago's spot at No. 7, took Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State wide receiver David Boston went next to Arizona,  
followed by Southern Cal linebacker Chris Claiborne to Detroit; 
Arizona cornerback Chris McAlister to Baltimore; Culpepper to 
Minnesota and McNown to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was Louisiana Tech wide receiver Troy Edwards to  
Pittsburgh, offensive tackle John Tait of Brigham Young to Kansas 
City, and defensive tackle Anthony McFarland to Tampa Bay. That 
pick, No. 15, is the lowest the first defensive lineman has gone 
since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee then took Florida linebacker Jevon Kearse; New England  
exchanged places with Seattle and chose center Damien Woody of 
Boston College, and Oakland took offensive tackle Matt Stinchcomb 
of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Giants surprisingly took offensive tackle Luke  
Petitgout of Notre Dame. He was projected as a second-rounder, but 
it could be a good choice for the Giants, who have gotten stars 
like Michael Strahan and Jason Sehorn No. 2, but have had a series 
of first-round duds. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas traded up two picks to take Ebenezer Ekuban, a defensive  
end from North Carolina, to bolster a defensive line weakened by 
free-agent defections and the potential suspension of Leon Lett. 
Arizona used its second first-rounder on offensive tackle L.J. 
Shelton of Eastern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle took defensive end Lamar King of Saginaw Valley State,  
the first Division II player chosen, then Buffalo took cornerback 
Antoine Winfield of Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco, needing defensive line help with Bryant Young  
still recovering from a severely broken leg, moved up to take 
defensive tackle Reggie McGrew of Florida; Green Bay chose safety 
Antwan Edwards of Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville chose cornerback Fernando Bryant of Alabama;  
Detroit traded up to take Aaron Gibson, the 376-pound offensive 
tackle from Wisconsin; and New England chose Andy Katzenmoyer, the 
linebacker from Ohio State who has dropped rapidly since being 
projected as a top-five pick after his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota chose Dimitrius Underwood, a defensive end from  
Michigan State; Atlanta took defensive end Patrick Kerney of 
Virginia, and Denver used the final pick of the first round on 
linebacker Al Wilson of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the five quarterbacks, there were six offensive  
and six defensive linemen chosen, five defensive backs, four 
linebackers, three wide receivers and the two running backs, James 
and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the better known players drafted in the second round were  
offensive tackles Jon Jansen of Michigan (Washington) and Solomon 
Page of West Virginia (Dallas); running backs James Johnson of 
Mississippi State (by Jimmy Johnson in Miami), Rob Konrad of 
Syracuse (also Miami) and Kevin Faulk of LSU (New England); and 
wide receiver Peerless Price of Tennessee (Buffalo). 
</P>
<P>
	Third-round picks included running back Amos Zereoue of West  
Virginia (Pittsburgh); linebackers Dat Nguyen of Texas A&AMP;M (Dallas) 
and Gary Stills of West Virginia (Kansas City); offensive tackle 
Kris Farris of UCLA (Pittsburgh); safety Tony George of Florida 
(New England); defensive tackle Jared DeVries of Iowa (Detroit); 
wide receiver Travis McGriff of Florida; kicker Martin Gramatica of 
Kansas State (Tampa Bay); and defensive end Tom Burke of Wisconsin 
(Arizona).

	Serbs Told to Halt Policy  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO's commander bluntly told  
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic today to change his policies 
in Kosovo or see his military machine destroyed. Meanwhile, NATO 
began its 25th night of bombing. NATO disclosed today what it said 
was more proof of atrocities by Serb forces in Kosovo, showing 
reporters aerial photos of what it claimed may be up to 150 fresh 
graves near the Kosovo town of Izbica. ``It's clear that there is 
mounting evidence of detentions, summary executions and mass 
graves,'' NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told reporters in Brussels, 
Belgium.

	U.S., Yugoslavia Won't Trade POWs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It appears there is no interest in either  
Washington or Belgrade to trade prisoners of war captured since 
NATO began its bombing campaign. So U.S. military leaders are 
continuing to mull what to do with a Yugoslav prisoner of war, 
while remaining concerned about three American soldiers seized near 
the Macedonian border two weeks ago. Trading the captured Yugoslav 
officer would be a politically tricky equation, Defense officials 
said on condition of anonymity. On one hand, they said, release of 
the three Americans would be a relief, but it would carry the risk 
of equating what the United States calls an abduction of 
peacekeeping soldiers with the capture of a bona fide enemy POW.

	Dozens Injured in London Blast

market in south London today, injuring dozens. Witnesses said the 
blast was caused by a bomb. No deaths were reported, but Scotland 
Yard said people had been seriously injured in the explosion at 
5:25 p.m. local time. A trader at the market said he had seen the 
device before it exploded. He said nails were stuck on it with 
transparent tape. Police said they received reports of at least 48 
people injured, although apparently not all sought hospital 
treatment.

	BATH, Maine (AP) -- A U.S. Navy destroyer was launched today  
bearing the name of former British prime minister Sir Winston 
Churchill -- an honor rarely afforded foreigners. Lady Soames, the 
former British leader's only living child, joined U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Cohen, British Defense Minister George Robertson 
and other Churchill relatives to watch the 505-foot warship Winston 
S. Churchill slide down a greased ramp at the Bath Iron Works into

association to President Clinton, a poll released today is 
indicating. Public weariness with the Clinton administration's 
ethical problems may be what is taking a toll on Gore's campaign. 
For the first time since September 1997, when Gore was at the

<HEADLINE> Ultra Slim Fast Cans Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A batch of ready-to-drink diet shakes are  
being recalled by Slim Fast Foods because some of the cans may be 
filled with a diluted cleaning solution. 
</P>
<P>
	About 192,000 cans of Ultra Slim Fast's creamy milk  
chocolate-flavored shakes are being pulled off the shelves, said 
Dr. Harry Greene, medical director of the West Palm Beach, Fla., 
company. The cans were sold individually. 
</P>
<P>
	The company believes only a few cans were filled with the  
cleaning liquid, a diluted solution used to clear the filling 
machines in between batches. Some of the liquid was accidentally 
canned and packaged with a group of milkshakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall was prompted by a complaint in Utah, where a customer  
reported buying a can filled with water. Another customer from the 
same store called a week later with the same complaint. The second 
customer was seen by a doctor after complaining about tingling in 
her mouth. Greene, who spoke with that doctor, said there was no 
major injury. 
</P>
<P>
	An FDA official said ``there isn't any immediate health hazard''  
from the products being recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The cans being pulled off the shelves come from batch No.  
ETMC9053B02. In addition to Utah, they were distributed to stores 
in Arizona, California, Colorado, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Oregon, 
Virginia and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The product itself (from that batch) is perfectly OK, but to  
ensure that nobody else gets a can full of water, we're recalling 
it from those areas, '' Greene said.

<HEADLINE> Kyle Petty Has Brush With a Pole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Kyle Petty's first pole of the year  
wasn't at all like he hoped it would be. It came a week early at 
Talladega. 
</P>
<P>
	While testing for next weekend's stop on the Winston Cup circuit  
Wednesday, Petty's car spun out of control and through a chain-link 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ran through the chain-link fence and over a couple of  
azaleas, and I think a couple of dandelions gave their lives,'' 
Petty said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a freak deal. I've never had anything happen like  
that. Never. I hit the curb and the concrete around the flagpole 
and the thing jumped up in the air about two or three feet and 
nailed the flagpole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flagpole finally stopped Petty's Pontiac, the same car he  
finished seventh in at Daytona, and the one he still plans to race 
in next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It needed a new front snout and really, everything forward  
from the front firewall. I just got out and laughed,'' he said. 
``In hindsight, I was thankful. If it had been during practice, I 
would have hit some people.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO FAN OF BULLRINGS:* Ken Schrader will start sixth in the  
Goody's 500, and he'll be looking to better his previous best 
finish here, a fourth in 1988. But don't count Schrader among 
Winston Cup's short-track fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a different weekend,'' he said of the race on the  
.526-mile oval. ``We'll see a lot of car wrestling. They just beat 
and bang.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Schrader's four career victories have come on tracks of  
at least 1 1/2 miles, the last at the mile-long track at Dover in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinsville, though, isn't his favorite stop on the circuit.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a decent track for us, but I don't like the short  
tracks,'' he said. ``I could do this all the time, and this isn't 
why I went Winston Cup racing, to go beat around on the half-miles, 
but it's part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SECOND ROUND:* Dick Trickle was the only one of 10 drivers who  
attempted to requalify Saturday to improve his speed and gain a 
spot in the top 36. Trickle's speed was 93.854 mph after a 
first-round best of 93.631 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	The drivers who didn't make the race were Dave Marcis, Morgan  
Shepherd and Buckshot Jones. Marcis and Shepherd have missed four 
of eight races. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HAPPY BIRTHDAY?:* The Goody's 500 will be run on Geoff Bodine's  
50th birthday at the site of his first career victory back in 1984. 
Bodine has won three others times here, and wants to have a party 
on the track Sunday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ayala Looks Forward to Boxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About a year ago, 36-year-old Tony Ayala started  
thinking seriously about fighting again. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting -- it's what Ayala did with a skill that excited boxing  
insiders and a fury that brought roaring mobs to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting -- it's something Ayala hasn't done since he was 19,  
when he compiled a 22-0 record, with 19 knockouts as a junior 
middleweight. He was on the verge of superstardom. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of the ring, Ayala was a problem.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was 19, I was a junky and a drunk, I was out of  
control,'' Ayala said in a telephone interview from Bayside State 
Prison in Leesburg, N.J. On Tuesday, he'll be released after 
serving 16 years of a 35-year sentence for rape. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early morning hours of New Year's Day 1983, Ayala  
returned to his Paterson, N.J., home after a night out with 
common-law wife, Lisa Paez. She went to bed. He said he was going 
to watch television. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, stoked by heroin and booze, he went to the home of a  
female neighbor and raped her. At the time, he was on probation for 
beating a woman in the restroom of a San Antonio drive-in theater 
in 1980, and for breaking into a San Antonio home in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did I deserve to go to prison?'' Ayala asked, repeating a  
question. ``Damn right. Did I deserve to go to prison for 16 years? 
That's another matter. The last 10 years were a waste of time and 
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala started thinking about a comeback three years ago. Last  
year, he made up his mind to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going into it blind,'' he said. ``I know the odds are  
against me. What people don't see is the heart, the desire. I think 
I still have enough to fulfill my destiny, or at least give it a 
shot. Another big factor is the financial reward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala's story of a promising career derailed is salable, at  
least for a few fights. But to try to recreate ``The Little Bull,'' 
who could have been great at one time, seems beyond reach. 
</P>
<P>
	He says he weighs 175 pounds, but would like to fight again as a  
junior middleweight. To do so he must lose 21 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	While boxing again is Ayala's hope, there were a few years when  
he had wiped it out of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first five or six years of prison, I never thought of  
boxing,'' said Ayala, who served five years in Trenton and nine in 
Rahway before being transferred Bayside. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was another life. I was totally focused on fixing what  
was broken inside myself. It was just common sense,'' he said. ``I 
was in prison, not for boxing. I was in prison because I committed 
a horrible crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Also, a lot of my attention was on not getting killed. I had  
some close calls. Thankfully, I had a guardian angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala said he has the support of his family, including Lisa, who  
left him, but has since come back. There also is Dr. Brian Raditz, 
a psychologist who treated Ayala his first 4 1/2 years in prison and 
became his friend. Raditz will serve as Ayala's adviser. His 
father, Tony Sr., again will train his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gained spirituality, focus and discipline in prison,'' Ayala  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also questioned the system's value as a rehabilitation  
tool. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politicians make a career out of bashing prisoners,'' he said.  
``I'm saying they put a person in prison, dehumanize him, take his 
heart, then after 15 or 20 years they release him and expect him to 
act like a regular person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not too late for Ayala to become a regular person, but  
there has to be considerable doubt he can again become a special 
fighter.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Dominate Boston Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- To John Kagwe, the dominance of Kenyan runners at  
the Boston Marathon is similar to the hold the United States has on 
basketball with its Dream Team lineups. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners make more winners.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like Michael Jordan in basketball,'' said Kagwe, a  
two-time New York City Marathon champion and one of nine elite 
Kenyan runners in Monday's field. ``The younger ones see how well 
John Kagwe is doing and they want to be like him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we came, there were difficulties. There were Kenyans  
who tried but couldn't make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, they've been making it every time they take to the  
course. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Moses Tanui, No. 2 Joseph Chebet and Kagwe  
will lead the charge for a record-tying ninth consecutive Kenyan 
title in the world's most prestigious marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-flight women's field is led by two-time defending  
champion Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia, the 1996 Olympic gold medalist, 
and includes Lynn Jennings, the top American woman distance runner 
who is making her official marathon debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Also running is Bill Rodgers, the four-time Boston winner who is  
aiming for an American over-50 course record at age 51. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Brantly, a 1996 American Olympic marathoner, calls the  
current crop of Kenyans ``the best distance runners the world has 
ever seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way the Kenyans are performing these days, there's little  
argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanui, who also won the centennial Boston race in 1996, took  
last year's edition in a career-best 2 hours, 7 minutes, 34 
seconds. Chebet was runner-up to Tanui last year at 2:07:37 and the 
second-place finisher in the past two New York City Marathons. 
Kagwe has a career-best 2:08:12, while Sammy Korir, the Amsterdam 
Marathon winner the past two years, has a best of 2:08:02. 
</P>
<P>
	Those four will wear starting bids 1, 2, 3 and 5. No. 4 also  
belonged to a Kenyan, Ondoro Osoro, the world's top-ranked 
marathoner last year after winning the Chicago Marathon at 2:06:54, 
the third-fastest in history and the fastest-ever for a first-time 
runner. But Osoro withdrew because of a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Kagwe said this year's run is not a Kenyan lock.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want it to look like only Kenyans can win,'' Kagwe  
said. ``I don't want to say that Kenyans are super, that they can't 
be beaten. Anyone can be a winner if he prepares himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenyans think like me. When they go into a race, they don't  
count themselves as a winner. They go in like they're a contestant. 
What we can say about Kenya is that we have a lot of big-name 
runners, like me, who are known throughout the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known as winners, as they have been here since 1991.  
</P>
<P>
	That was the year Ibrahim Hussein won the second of his three  
titles (he was the first Kenyan winner in 1988), and his countrymen 
haven't lost since. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein won again in 1992. Then Cosmas Ndeti won from 1993-95.  
In between Tanui's two victories, Lameck Aguta won in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In each of the past four races, Kenyans finished at least 1-2,  
taking the first five places and seven of the top eight in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	That kind of monopolization is similar to the period between  
1916 and 1925, when Americans won all nine individual Boston races 
contested, including three by Clarence DeMar (in 1918, there was 
only team competition). 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Kenyans won nearly every major marathon in the United  
States -- Tanui at Boston, Kagwe at New York, Osoro at Chicago, 
Simon Bor at Los Angeles, Philip Tarus at the Rock 'n' Roll 
Marathon in San Diego and Mbarek Hussein, brother of Ibrahim, at 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	They also took the first six places and seven of the first 10 at  
San Diego, the first three at Honolulu, seconds at New York, Boston 
and Los Angeles, and three of the first five spots at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not only slaughtering the Americans, they are  
slaughtering everybody,'' Brantley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Kenyan runners live and train in the United States,  
but their dominance has spread throughout the world, winning three 
marathons in Japan and one in South Africa last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kenyans' superiority in such a relatively short time is  
remarkable considering that not that long ago Kenyans didn't even 
run marathons. They felt it was something old men did. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, their diligent training methods are paying big dividends --  
the Boston winner gets $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kenyans are winning because they train hard and leave aside  
everything else, like going to discos or seeing friends at night,'' 
Tanui said. ``They only concentrate on training. They know if they 
are successful in training, they will be successful in a race. They 
go to bed at 8 o'clock and they leave (for training) at 5 in the 
morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korir trained between 155 and 186 miles per week during February  
to get ready for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without training, you cannot win,'' Korir said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bobby McGee, the agent for South African Colleen de Reuck, one  
of the leading women contenders in Monday's race, said the Kenyans' 
success is due to a combination of factors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot to be gained nationally if you can run well,''  
McGee said. ``Kenya is a poverty stricken country, so running well 
is a way to make a name for yourself instead of just being a 
number. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just a race for them. They're in it for each other.  
Ask a Kenyan if he won a race and he might say no, but he'll say a 
Kenyan did. They draw from that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGee also noted that Kenyan runners have small calf muscles and  
big thigh muscles; that they're born at altitude, so train at 
altitude; that they running in a loping, shock-absorbing way; that 
they are biomechanically sound; that ``they don't give up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only Brazilian Vanderlei Lima, Spain's Jose Garcia and Mexicans  
Andres Espinosa and Isaac Garcia are given outside chances of 
breaking the Kenyan streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Challenging Roba in the women's field are de Reuck, the road  
racer of the year in 1997; New York City Marathon champions Anuta 
Catuna of Romania, Franca Fiaconni of Italy and Franziska 
Rochat-Moser of Switzerland; two-time Olympic medalist Yuko Arimori 
of Japan; and first-time marathoners Jennings of Newmarket, N.H., 
and Catherine Ndereba of Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers, who also won the New York marathon four times, will try  
to break the over-50 course record of 2:31:34 for an American. 
</P>
<P>
	However, one notable will be missing -- 91-year-old Johnny  
Kelley, who finished Boston 58 times and won twice. He is 
recovering from pneumonia and colon surgery.

<HEADLINE> Hayes: Stottlemyre Had it Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Do not expect Charlie Hayes to be inviting Todd  
Stottlemyre to dinner anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes, who plays third base for the San Francisco Giants,  
charged the mound from second base Friday night with the intent of 
knocking out the Arizona Diamondbacks' pitcher. Afterward, he had 
no regrets, even if it means a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't land a punch, but I did try to hurt him,'' Hayes  
said. ``He can say `Hi' to me, and I'll try to slap him. I just 
don't like him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre, one of the most intensely competitive players in  
baseball, has been involved in more than his share of fights in his 
12-year career as a big-league pitcher. But he said this is the 
first time anyone had gone after him from second base. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened in the sixth inning, with Arizona leading 8-3.  
Hayes, 0-for-13 lifetime against Stottlemyre, had just hit into a 
fielder's choice. Hayes moved to second on Brent Mayne's base hit, 
and Hayes and Stottlemyre continued their heated exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was yelling at me from first base, so when he got  
to second base, I had something to say to him,'' Stottlemyre said. 
``That was enough to trigger him, and here he came. I don't know 
why he was frustrated. I guess you'll have to ask him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes said his lingering feelings toward Stottlemyre added fuel  
to the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it had been anybody else, I wouldn't have said anything,  
but I don't like him,'' Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes rounded second and then ran full speed toward a somewhat  
startled Stottlemyre. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to knock him out,'' Hayes said. ``I didn't want  
to wrestle. He talks like he's Bob Gibson. I'm the only one he can 
get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre ducked, and the punch failed to connect.  
</P>
<P>
	``He missed me all night at the plate and he missed me on the  
mound,'' Stottlemyre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Matt Williams, who said he'd never seen a player  
charge the mound from second, raced to Stottlemyre's defense, 
tackling Hayes. Sonny Jackson, San Francisco's third base coach, 
tackled Stottlemyre. 
</P>
<P>
	Both dugouts emptied, and so did the bullpens. There was a big  
pile of humanity the umpires had to pull apart. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Randy Johnson, towering over the throng, lost his cap  
and put on Jackson's Giants' cap instead. He thought it felt a 
little snug. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I was a Giant for a half-minute,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hayes was still livid and had to be restrained by teammate Barry  
Bonds, who wrapped his arm around Hayes and walked him to the 
dugout. Stottlemyre was tossed, too, although he argued he was only 
defending himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes knows he could face punishment from the league.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care,'' Hayes said. ``I'm sick of people like that.  
Who does he think he is, Sandy Koufax or somebody? To me he's a 
.500 pitcher, 12-and-12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think nobody likes him. I don't think some of his  
teammates like him. He's going to get some of them hurt. He needs 
to just pitch and just shut up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona manager Buck Showalter defended Stottlemyre as a fierce  
competitor, the type of player sorely needed by a second-year 
franchise trying to make a quick leap into contention in the NL 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoyed competing against him. I always respected his  
competitive skills,'' Showalter said. ``I don't think you ever 
dislike him from the other side unless you don't like 
competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks lead the majors in dugout-clearing incidents in  
the early season. They had one in the second game of the season at 
Dodger Stadium when Williams angrily accused Chan Ho Park of 
throwing at his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Lee, Arizona's 23-year-old first baseman, is appreciating  
the competitiveness of the Diamondbacks, whose roster is loaded 
with veteran major leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of gamers. They aren't going to put up with  
that,'' Lee said. ``This year we know we have a really good chance 
of winning, and sparks are going to start flying. It's great. It's 
fun.''

<HEADLINE> Dozens Hurt in Blast in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An explosion fired nails through a crowded street  
market in south London on Saturday, injuring dozens. Witnesses said 
the blast was caused by a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	No deaths were reported, but Scotland Yard said people had been  
seriously injured in the explosion at 5:25 p.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
	A trader at the market said he had seen the device before it  
exploded. He said nails were stuck on it with transparent tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Commander Hugh Orde, Metropolitan Police head of crime for  
southwest London, said police received reports of at least 48 
people injured, although apparently not all sought hospital 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen people were admitted with ``shrapnel-type'' injuries  
at King's College Hospital, said spokesman Nick Samuels. Twelve 
people were taken to St. George's Hospital, and eight others were 
treated at St. Thomas's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The injuries are relatively minor, but they range from people  
who were shaken because they were blown off their feet by the blast 
to a female who had got a nail in her belly,'' said Jenny Reid, 
spokeswoman for St. Thomas's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Police did not immediately confirm the cause of the explosion,  
and there were no reports of anyone claiming responsibility. Press 
Association, the British news agency, said police sources suggested 
the explosion was related to criminal activity and not to 
politically motivated terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	George Jones, 42, who has a stall at the street market, said he  
had seen the device before it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	A utility bag ``was handed to me by somebody who said someone  
had forgotten their shopping. I unzipped it and opened it wide, and 
I could see what it was,'' said Jones, who described it as being 
wrapped with tape and nails. ``I picked it up and moved it 10 to 15 
yards and put it by a brick wall to stop people getting hurt .... 
Then it went off. I was blown across the road and a couple of nails 
lodged in my leg, and I was hit by concrete and glass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he had telephoned police before the explosion.  
</P>
<P>
	Neall Whatley, 36, said he saw a child with a nail in her cheek  
and an adult man with serious head, chest and leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The small child, I would say, was about seven. She was just  
very, very shocked,'' Whatley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Metin Saglam, 34, who runs a fast food shop on Brixton Road near  
the site of the explosion, said: ``I heard two bangs, and there 
were people running around screaming `bomb, bomb, bomb.'''

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Naming Chiquita Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A judge says a reporter can name his  
confidential source for a package of stories accusing Chiquita 
Brands International Inc. of improper dealings in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporter, Michael Gallagher, relied on voice mail messages  
for stories published last May by The Cincinnati Enquirer. The 
newspaper later renounced the articles, fired Gallagher and paid 
Chiquita more than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallagher pleaded guilty in September to illegally intercepting  
communications and obtaining unauthorized access to Chiquita's 
computer systems. He is awaiting sentencing that could range from 
probation to 2 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	At a court hearing last week, Gallagher identified former  
Chiquita counsel George Ventura as one of his confidential sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's attorneys said Gallagher shouldn't be allowed to name  
their client at Ventura's trial because it would violate Ohio's 
``shield law,'' which allows reporters to protect sources' 
identities. 
</P>
<P>
	However Judge Ann Marie Tracey ruled Friday that Ohio law  
doesn't protect the source from being identified if the reporter 
voluntarily divulges the source's name. The judge said the shield 
law only applies when reporters assert their right to protect their 
sources. Gallagher has willingly given up that right. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, now an attorney in Salt Lake City, has pleaded innocent  
to five counts of unlawful interception of communications and five 
counts of unauthorized access to computer systems. He could be 
sentenced to 12 1/2 years in prison if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Couch Appears To Be Browns Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Barring a blockbuster trade or a breakdown at  
the bargaining table, the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft will likely 
be a No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Couch, the quarterback who wore No. 2 while setting dozens  
of passing records at Kentucky, is expected to be Cleveland's 
choice when the Browns pick first in today's draft in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns are returning to the league as an expansion team  
after a three-year hiatus, and indications are that they will make 
the 21-year-old Couch their quarterback of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's agent, Tom Condon, began face-to-face contract  
negotiations with Lal Heneghan, Cleveland's contract expert, in New 
York on Friday night. The two met for three hours before breaking 
for dinner and indicated they would work through the night if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	According to reports Friday night, if the two sides come to an  
agreement, the Browns will make Couch their top pick. Condon is 
reportedly seeking an 8 percent increase on the six-year, $48 
million deal he got for Peyton Manning last year when he was taken 
No. 1 by Indianapolis. He is also looking for a larger signing 
bonus than the $12 million Manning got. 
</P>
<P>
	As they prepared for the draft, the Browns received a new offer  
Friday from another team interested in moving up into the No. 1 
spot. Team president Carmen Policy would not name the team or say 
if it was the New Orleans Saints, who have already offered 
Cleveland all their picks this year plus some future ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some new developments with at least one other team  
wanting to trade up and take the pick,'' Policy said. ``We have 
four alternatives, and all of them are still alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy denied rumors that the Browns have already decided to  
take Couch first. He said Couch, Oregon quarterback Akili Smith and 
Texas running back Ricky Williams are all still in the mix and that 
negotiations with all three players' agents were taking place.

<P>
	But by Friday night, Couch was the only one the Browns were  
still talking to.

the two and appeared to be Browns coach Chris Palmer's favorite

<HEADLINE>  Couch Appears To Be Browns Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Barring a blockbuster trade or a breakdown at  
the bargaining table, the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft will likely 
be a No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Couch, the quarterback who wore No. 2 while setting dozens  
of passing records at Kentucky, is expected to be Cleveland's 
choice when the Browns pick first in today's draft in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns are returning to the league as an expansion team  
after a three-year hiatus, and indications are that they will make 
the 21-year-old Couch their quarterback of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch's agent, Tom Condon, began face-to-face contract  
negotiations with Lal Heneghan, Cleveland's contract expert, in New 
York on Friday night. The two met for three hours before breaking 
for dinner and indicated they would work through the night if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	According to reports Friday night, if the two sides come to an  
agreement, the Browns will make Couch their top pick. Condon is 
reportedly seeking an 8 percent increase on the six-year, $48 
million deal he got for Peyton Manning last year when he was taken 
No. 1 by Indianapolis. He is also looking for a larger signing 
bonus than the $12 million Manning got.

<HEADLINE> Davenport To Miss Fed Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- With Lindsay Davenport out with a wrist  
injury, the United States turned to Monica Seles to lead it in the 
first round of the Fed Cup against Croatia this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles, who was born in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, wasn't even slated  
to be on the U.S. team. But when the series was moved from Zagreb, 
Croatia, to Raleigh because of NATO airstrikes over Yugoslavia, 
U.S. captain Billie Jean King added Seles. 
</P>
<P>
	International Tennis Federation officials also decided against  
playing the series in Hamburg, Germany, where Seles was stabbed 
during a match nearly six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is playing great,'' King said Friday. ``And she's getting  
better and better. So she's back in a big way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles' Bausch &AMP; Lomb Championships title last weekend was her  
first since last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranked third in the world, one spot below Davenport, Seles will  
play in the second match today against Croatia's Silvija Talaja, 
who is undefeated in five Fed Cup singles matches. 
</P>
<P>
	During a ceremonious draw on the lawn outside the North Carolina  
governor's mansion, Iva Majoli, the top-seeded player on the 
Croatian team, was chosen to play Chanda Rubin in today's opening 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport, who lost to Anna Kournikova in two sets in the Bausch  
&AMP; Lomb last weekend, was forced to drop out of the Lipton 
Championships earlier this spring because of her sprained left 
wrist. She decided Wednesday her wrist was not well enough to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Davenport's injury) doesn't have much of an impact,'' King  
said. ``The U.S. is lucky to have great depth ... We have Monica 
and Chanda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four Croatian women and their captain said they were excited  
to be playing in Raleigh, with or without Davenport, who said she 
hopes to recuperate in time for the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big thing for Croatia,'' said Majoli, who has played  
in the last seven Fed Cups. ``We should just enjoy the weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Majoli, who has been beaten Davenport four times in their  
eight meetings, said Davenport's injury ``is a disappointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her captain, Vjeran Friscic, however, seemed pleased with the  
draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I prefer Chanda, but all the players are top and  
everyone knows how to play well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin leads the head-to-head series with Majoli 3-2, winning in  
three sets at the Hopman Cup in 1997. Both players are coming off 
three-set losses in the Baush &AMP; Lomb. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't played Chanda in so long. It's going to be a tough  
match,'' Majoli said. 
</P>
<P>
	The players switch opponents Sunday. The series ends with a  
doubles match pitting Seles and Lisa Raymond against Majoli and 
Talaja to determine which team advances to the second round.

<HEADLINE> Bush Pays $3.77 Million in Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush said he and his wife  
paid $3.77 million in federal income taxes on an estimated 1998 
income of $18.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wrote a check that is the biggest check I could conceivably  
(write),'' Bush, a possible Republican candidate for the 2000 
presidential election, said Thursday. ``I never dreamt I'd write a 
check that big. Of course, I never dreamt I'd make that much money, 
either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bushes previously paid $97,252 in taxes.  
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of Bush's 1998 income came from the sale of the Texas  
Rangers baseball team, of which he'd been managing partner before 
his 1994 election as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who bought into the Rangers for just more than $600,000,  
received about $14.9 million when sale of the club was announced 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bushes also reported giving $334,425 to churches and  
charitable organizations during 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The blind trust that manages Bush's assets has applied for an  
extension of time to file the governor's 1998 tax returns. It is 
still waiting for tax information from some entities in the trust, 
spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who established a presidential exploratory campaign on  
March 2, has raised $7.6 million for a possible campaign so far.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Spruces Up for NATO Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An army of civil servants, corporate  
volunteers, federal planners and law enforcement officers is 
mobilizing to help the nation's capital prepare as host of its 
largest gathering of world leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization returns for  
three days to the city where President Truman and the leaders of a 
handful of other nations created NATO in 1949. The now-19 NATO 
nations will be joined by officials from 25 eastern and central 
European partner countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity to showcase Washington, D.C. as a  
beautiful city,'' said Mayor Anthony Williams. ``We're also the 
co-host with the president and the first lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The event, with some 40 heads of government, 2,500 to 3,000  
media and 1,700 dignitaries, is a huge logistical challenge, said 
Dana Shelley, spokeswoman for the NATO 50th Summit Host Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor has ordered a massive cleanup of areas of the city  
that don't normally appear on postcards. Vacant lots are being 
fenced, graffiti wiped out, trees trimmed and streets swept. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for foreign delegations to arrive at Ronald Reagan  
National and Dulles airports in Virginia and the 
Baltimore-Washington International Airport and Andrews Air Force 
Base in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``That means cleaning our gateways - Georgia Avenue, New York  
Avenue - the ways that people come into our city, and then cleaning 
the neighborhoods around them,'' said Kay McGrath, a special 
assistant to the mayor. ``What one weekend does is, it helps you 
reposition the District of Columbia into its rightful position as 
the capital of the free world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City officials see it as a prime opportunity to market  
Washington's prestige addresses -- the Capitol Hill area, portions 
of New York and Pennsylvania avenues -- in a continuing effort to 
spur economic revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen law enforcement agencies, including the Secret  
Service, FBI, Metropolitan Police Department and National Park 
Service Police, will provide security. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers will be prepared for unrest. ``It would be  
un-American not to have at least some demonstrators,'' said Richard 
Socarides, chief operating officer for summit organizers, 
explaining that a specific area will be designated for protesters 
granted permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for areas where summit events are planned, streets will  
be open and vendors will be allowed to remain, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have rolling street closures,'' as motorcades for the  
40 heads of state move through, said Cmdr. Michael Radzilowski, 
head of the city police department's Special Operations Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington, D.C. is a tough town for traffic anyway, and  
moving these folks around is a tough task for us,'' said Maj. 
General Joseph Garrett, the vice director of the NATO summit 
planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers from Fort Eustis, Va., are being brought in to drive  
shuttle buses and cars for dignitaries. In addition, most 
government offices near summit sites will be closed Friday to 
reduce traffic. About half the 180,000 area federal employees and 
7,500 district government workers will receive the day off with 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's subway will travel through, but not stop, at the  
Federal Triangle subway stop near the main summit site, the Ronald 
Reagan International Trade Center downtown.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Gets Chair, Baseball Pass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky doesn't expect to sit around in  
retirement, but when he does, his New York Rangers teammates made 
sure he will be comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before their final practice together, they presented  
Gretzky with a big baseball glove chair that he had admired after 
seeing a similar one in Yankees owner George Steinbrenner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't expecting any gifts, but this was great,'' said  
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the chair, Gretzky received a lifetime pass to  
major league baseball from the sport's chief operating officer, 
Paul Beeston. 
</P>
<P>
	As practice wound down, Rangers coach John Muckler jokingly  
suggested that Gretzky do extra down and backs exercise to stay in 
shape. The 38-year-old Gretzky laughed and declined but offered to 
lead the team in their final stretching exercises and all his 
teammates banged their sticks on the ice in salute. 
</P>
<P>
	After the exercise, winger Kevin Stevens suggested that the team  
gather for a photo dressed in their red and blue Statue of Liberty 
practice jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely want one final team picture tomorrow, with all of  
us in our game uniforms,'' said Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told all the young guys to enjoy (tomorrow's game),'' said  
Gretzky. ``This is what it feels like to be in the Stanley Cup 
finals. This is how exciting it can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many friends and family will be flying in to watch Gretzky's  
final game Sunday when the Rangers play the Pittsburgh Penguins at 
Madison Square Garden, including former Rangers and Edmonton Oilers 
teammate Mark Messier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to score tomorrow,'' said Gretzky. ``But if I get  
a hat-trick I'm not going to stay, and if I don't score it's not 
going to kill me either.''

<HEADLINE> Faulk Traded To Avoid Disruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Bill Polian traded Marshall Faulk because he  
believed the three-time Pro running back was going to demand a new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk was sent to St. Louis in exchange for the Rams' second-  
and fifth-round picks in this weekend's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts have the fourth pick in today's NFL draft and it was  
expected that Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams could still be 
available when Indianapolis selected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Faulk was a great player. You need to replace that. We don't  
have that now. How we go about that remains to be seen,'' Bill 
Polian said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The running back had two more years on the contract he signed as  
the No. 2 overall draft pick in 1994, and Polian said he was to be 
paid $2.9 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian, hired as the club president in December 1997 to rebuild  
a team that compiled a 3-13 mark that year, said he became 
convinced in March ``that Marshall and his agent were quite serious 
about not coming in without a new contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once it was determined that a trade was in the best interests of  
the Colts, Polian said he heard from several teams and considered 
the offer by the Rams as the best deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we gave Marshall his (new contract) money, we would be  
capitulating to a holdout. We cannot do that,'' Polian said. ``I 
don't want to make this personal, but you assume that any player 
had one good year, that we should tear up his contract and 
renegotiate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We paid a hefty signing bonus to get that contract, and I  
didn't see Marshall's agent knocking on the door when Marshall was 
injured and giving us back any money. If we should have given him 
money, why didn't they give us something back when he was hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts will hold a mini-camp next week and Polian said the  
collective bargaining agreement would have resulted in a $5,000 per 
day fine if Faulk did not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no point in levying those fines if they're going to be  
rescinded or forgiven ... As a result you have an atmosphere that 
isn't conducive to good feeling,'' Polian said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Polian said a holdout by Faulk ``would have been  
very damaging to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polian declined to confirm that the Colts would draft Williams  
today if he was available when it is the Colts' turn to draft. He 
also said he had no plans to move up in the draft to get the former 
Texas star and that he feels no pressure to use the first-round 
pick to select a running back. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Polian said he had no problem over the prospect of having a  
rookie running back playing in a backfield with second-year 
quarterback Peyton Manning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rookies can play running back faster than rookies can play  
most any other position,'' he said. ``Don't read anything into 
that. What they do at the college level by and large is relatively 
easier to translate to the NFL as opposed to other positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams comes to the NFL as college football's all-time rushing  
leader, a record he set by remaining at Texas for his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	Polian said he believes the second pick in the draft, held by  
Philadelphia, will dictate what the Colts and the other teams 
holding one of the first 10 picks will do on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stay tuned, we'll find out,'' he said. ``I anticipate that the  
phone will be ringing and we'll evaluate. We evaluate every 
different scenario.''

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Roman Catholic Church in  
Brazil appears set to mark the 500th anniversary of the nation's 
discovery next year by apologizing for its links with slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's 280 bishops met Saturday in Sao Paulo state to discuss  
the church's yearlong anniversary program, which is due to end with 
a visit by Pope John Paul II in April 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	There were indications they would decide to make a declaration  
about slavery in the program, said Maria Veiga, a spokeswoman for 
the Brazilian Bishops Council, or CNBB. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4 million slaves were shipped from Africa to Brazil  
from 1500 until the late 19th century. Churchmen openly accepted 
slavery and kept slaves themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the CNBB, Bishop Jaime Chemello, was quoted  
this week saying that it would not be ``going too far'' to 
apologize for the church's links with slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	The church program is to be approved by the bishops before the  
annual nine-day conference ends Friday, said Veiga. 
</P>

<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Thousands of demonstrators marched  
through Brazilian cities on Saturday to protest the alleged 
massacre of 19 peasants by police in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, a trial date is expected for 154 police officers  
accused of carrying out the killings at a land rights march in 
Eldorado de Carajas in the northern state of Para. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the massacre's third anniversary, more than 5,000  
people marched in Salvador, capital of the northeastern state of 
Bahia, and hundreds more did so in Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Marches were scheduled in other state capitals Sunday and  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The marches were being led by the Landless Rural Workers  
Movement, which has gained national prominence for invading 
uncultivated land to speed up the government's land reform program. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of Brazil's population owns 88 percent of the  
land, while the poorest 40 percent owns just 1 percent.

	LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Portugal and Brazil on Saturday urged  
the European Union to provide a clear mandate for negotiations on a 
free trade agreement with Latin American nations grouped in the 
Mercosur trading bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	``Europe must understand that it is strategic for its global  
position to deepen relations with Mercosur,'' Portuguese Prime 
Minister Antonio Guterres said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso called on the EU  
to reach a trading agreement as soon as possible with Mercosur -- 
composed of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso was due to leave Lisbon for London on Sunday, after a  
three-day visit to attend a summit focusing on cultural and 
economic ties between Portugal and its former colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Guterres said EU-Mercosur trade talks should ``have the  
potential for significant advances in reaching understanding on 
items like agriculture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture is a particular sticking point as Mercosur complains  
that EU countries spend up to $160 billion per year to subsidize 
European producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercosur says that while its imports from Europe have  
skyrocketed in recent years exports to Europe have increased much 
more slowly.

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky Gets Chair, Baseball Pass </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky doesn't expect to sit around in  
retirement, but when he does, his New York Rangers teammates made 
sure he will be comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before their final practice together, they presented  
Gretzky with a big baseball glove chair that he had admired after 
seeing a similar one in Yankees owner George Steinbrenner's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't expecting any gifts, but this was great,'' said  
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the chair, Gretzky received a lifetime pass to  
major league baseball from the sport's chief operating officer, 
Paul Beeston. 
</P>
<P>
	As practice wound down, Rangers coach John Muckler jokingly  
suggested that Gretzky do extra down and backs exercise to stay in 
shape. The 38-year-old Gretzky laughed and declined but offered to 
lead the team in their final stretching exercises and all his 
teammates banged their sticks on the ice in salute. 
</P>
<P>
	After the exercise, winger Kevin Stevens suggested that the team  
gather for a photo dressed in their red and blue Statue of Liberty 
practice jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely want one final team picture tomorrow, with all of  
us in our game uniforms,'' said Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told all the young guys to enjoy (tomorrow's game),'' said  
Gretzky. ``This is what it feels like to be in the Stanley Cup 
finals. This is how exciting it can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many friends and family will be flying in to watch Gretzky's  
final game Sunday when the Rangers play the Pittsburgh Penguins at 
Madison Square Garden, including former Rangers and Edmonton Oilers 
teammate Mark Messier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to score tomorrow,'' said Gretzky. ``But if I get  
a hat-trick I'm not going to stay, and if I don't score it's not 
going to kill me either.''

<HEADLINE> Botched Launch Probe Delays NASA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray  
telescope may have to remain on Earth a while longer due to an 
investigation into a stranded military satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has impounded an upper-stage motor intended for  
the telescope, to be launched in July aboard space shuttle 
Columbia. It's the same kind of motor that apparently malfunctioned 
April 9 and left the Defense Department's newest Defense Support 
Program satellite in a useless orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope-delivery mission already is a year late because of  
bad circuit boards that had to be replaced in Chandra and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This telescope is a multibillion-dollar investment. You can  
rest assured the program is not going to go launch it until all the 
open questions have been answered,'' said payload manager Scott 
Higginbotham. 
</P>
<P>
	The stranded military satellite is spinning so fast in its  
lopsided orbit that Air Force controllers have yet to unfurl its 
electricity-generating solar panels. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're continually trying to work with it,'' Staff Sgt. Steve  
Horton of Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado said Friday. 
``There's always a hope that they can recover it and rescue it and 
get it into its proper orbit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $250 million satellite needs to be in a circular  
22,300-mile-high orbit in order to perform its missile-warning job. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is working  
with the Air Force's accident investigation board, which convened 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force must deliver the impounded Boeing-built motor to  
NASA by the end of April if the space agency hopes to meet its July 
9 launch date for Chandra, said Higginbotham. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra, a Hubble-caliber observatory, should have rocketed into  
orbit last summer. Unlike Hubble, the X-ray telescope will be 
placed in an orbit too high to be reached by spacewalking 
astronauts so it will be irreparable once launched.

<HEADLINE> Starr Won't Say When Probe Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth W. Starr is both Exhibit A and prime  
witness for an end to the independent counsel system that put him 
on President Clinton's case five years ago. But even with the law 
virtually certain to expire early this summer, Starr's operation 
won't. 
</P>
<P>
	Not until his Office of Independent Counsel concludes that its  
work is done. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr wouldn't say how long he expects that to take. An aide had  
said earlier it might be close to two years. That would make the 
Whitewater independent counsel the longest-running and costliest 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	And perhaps the last.  
</P>
<P>
	Starr told a Senate committee considering renewal of the law  
that Congress should let it expire on June 30, at least temporarily 
``for a cooling-off period or, perhaps more aptly, a cease-fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers, especially Democratic tempers, are still high after the  
Monica Lewinsky investigation and the impeachment of Clinton on 
charges brought by Starr. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as Republican tempers flared over the independent counsel  
process in 1992, when an earlier prosecutor issued a report that 
questioned President Bush's truthfulness just before the election 
he lost to Clinton. That led Republicans to block renewal of the 
law, and it lapsed for 18 months before it was revived, with 
Clinton's backing. 
</P>
<P>
	After five years of being under Starr's scrutiny, Clinton  
opposed renewing it again, a rare point of agreement with the 
independent prosecutor he said long ago was out to get him. And 
that was before the Lewinsky case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's position was consistent with views he'd expressed before  
his appointment as Whitewater independent counsel by a three-judge 
federal court panel. But it was startling to senators, given his 
role since. Democratic critics said he poisoned attitudes toward 
the whole system with excesses in his prosecutions, which he 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
	He defended his operation, complained about political assaults  
on it, and said he's not finished. ``We're going to enforce the 
law,'' he said. ``That's our duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Starr said he still has the authority to seek an indictment  
of Clinton after the president leaves office. For that to be done, 
his prosecution force would have to be in operation after Jan. 20, 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Could be. The law provides that independent counsels on duty  
when it expires can complete their work. There are three others 
still active. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said the independent counsel system is constitutionally,  
practically and politically flawed. ``Independent counsels are 
especially vulnerable to partisan attack,'' Starr said. ``In this 
fashion, the legislative effort to take politics out of law 
enforcement sometimes has the ironic effect of further politicizing 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has long complained that the Clinton's defenders were trying  
to make the prosecutors the villains of the piece. ``The assaults 
took a toll,'' he said. ``A duly authorized ... investigation came 
to be characterized as yet another political game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Law becomes politics by other means.''  
</P>
<P>
	But there is a reverse side to that. The lawsuit that produced  
the Lewinsky case was grounded in politics, pressed and financed by 
Clinton's conservative foes. And Democrats complain that people in 
Starr's operation were in contact with lawyers involved in the case 
against Clinton. He insists that there were no improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
	In a case as sensitive as one against the president, even the  
appearance of anything out of line invites political attack. 
Starr's tactics made him a target. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr put his own spin on that. He said that because an  
independent counsel is vulnerable to partisan attack, ``the 
investigation is likely to be seen as political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That being so, he said, better to put the responsibility for it  
all where tradition assigns it, on the attorney general as 
prosecutor and on Congress as overseer. 
</P>
<P>
	It worked that way until 1978, when the Independent Counsel Act  
was created, an outgrowth of Watergate. Until then, when there were 
outside prosecutors -- and there were only five -- they were chosen 
by attorneys general, seldom because they wanted to but because 
they had to. 
</P>
<P>
	In President Nixon's case, a special prosecutor was the price  
for confirmation of his attorney general. When Nixon fired one, the 
political storm forced him to accept another, and he was on his way 
out of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Political pressure drove Clinton to have the first outside  
prosecutor in Whitewater appointed to the job Starr took over when 
the counsel law was re-enacted in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	When the two-party system is working, there's always going to be  
somebody to blow the whistle on alleged corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr again:  
</P>
<P>
	``Returning the authority over these prosecutions to attorneys  
general, and relying on them to appoint outside counsel when 
necessary, is the worst system -- except for all the others.''

	NATO Hitting Yugoslav Targets  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the 25th night of NATO bombing, a  
major oil refinery in Yugoslavia's second largest city was bombed, 
and Yugoslav officials say a 3-year-old girl was killed in attacks 
near Belgrade. Serb television described the bombing as the 
strongest attack so far of the air campaign. Targets also were hit 
around Belgrade. Serb authorities said the 3-year-old was killed 
and five people were injured in an attack in Batajnica, about 12 
miles north of Belgrade, where a military airfield is located.

	NATO Trading of POWs Unlikely  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is little chance of a prisoner exchange  
between the United States and Yugoslavia, officials said today. 
While U.S. military leaders are mulling what to do with a captured 
Yugoslav lieutenant, they remain aware of the three American 
soldiers seized near the Macedonian border two weeks ago. Trading 
the captured officer would be a politically tricky equation, 
officials said. On one hand, release of the three Americans would 
be a relief, but it would carry the risk of equating what the 
United States calls an abduction of peacekeeping soldiers with the 
capture of a bona fide enemy POW.

	Castro May Spare Convicted Bombers  
</P>
<P>
	SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Cuban leader Fidel  
Castro has promised to consider sparing the lives of two 
Salvadorans sentenced to death for terrorism in Cuba, El Salvador's 
president said today. President Armando Calderon Sol said he asked 
Castro for clemency on behalf of the men's families and ``in the 
name of the Salvadoran people.'' Calderon Sol noted that the men's 
cases were now before Cuba's Supreme Tribunal and later could be 
referred to the Council of State, over which Castro presides. Otto 
Rene Rodriguez Llerena and Ernesto Cruz Leon were convicted in 
March of terrorism charges and sentenced to death.

one was killed, but Scotland Yard said four people had been 
seriously injured in the explosion at 5:25 p.m. local time. 
``Clearly the person who set this off is disturbed and had no 
regard for human life,'' said Commander Hugh Orde, the Metropolitan 
Police officer leading the investigation. There was no report of 
anyone claiming responsibility.

	Poll Says Gore Hurt by Clinton

administration's ethical problems could hurt Vice President Al 
Gore's chances of winning the presidency in 2000, a new poll is 
indicating. For the first time since September 1997, when Gore was 
at the center of a controversy about campaign fund-raising, his 
favorable ratings slipped below 50 percent in the poll by the Pew

Churchill -- an honor rarely afforded foreigners. Lady Soames, the 
former British leader's only living child, joined U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Cohen, British Defense Minister George Robertson 
and other Churchill relatives to watch the 505-foot warship Winston 
S. Churchill slide down a greased ramp at the Bath Iron Works into

overall were taken in the top dozen with Daunte Culpepper going to 
Minnesota with the 11th pick and Cade McNown to Chicago with the 
next choice. The New Orleans Saints, meanwhile, traded all of their 
1999 draft picks plus next year's No. 1 and No. 3 choices to the

eliminating the Senators from the top playoff seed in the Eastern 
Conference. Ottawa needed a win against Carolina and a New Jersey 
loss to secure the No. 1 spot in the conference, but the Hurricanes 
were able to produce their franchise-record 24th tie of the season. 
Carolina finished 1-5-18 in those games.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Ends a Magnificent Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky kept his emotions in check while  
announcing his retirement. The hard part will come Sunday when he 
takes off his skates for the last time following the New York 
Rangers' game with the Pittsburgh Penguins at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``That will be a tough time,'' the 38-year-old Gretzky said.  
``I've played for 35 years ... since I was 3. Now I'm handing in my 
skates. I'm done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky remained composed Friday as he announced he was leaving  
the game he loved following several months of agonized 
self-searching. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a gut feeling, something I really believe is right,''  
said the NHL's all-time leading scorer and No. 1 goodwill 
ambassador. ``I have peace of mind. A farewell season was not on my 
agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky referred to a recent request by NHL commissioner Gary  
Bettman that the Great One play one more year and make it a virtual 
farewell tour of the league, similar to what big stars have done in 
other sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel it was the right thing for me to do,'' Gretzky  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's press conference was easily one of the biggest in team  
history. Hundreds of media from print, radio and television were in 
attendance to record the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky sat on a dais with his wife, Janet, and two of their  
children, Ty and Trevor. Gretzky said his daughter, Paulina, did 
not want to come ``because she thought she'd cry too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also in attendance were Bettman, Rangers coach John Muckler, GM  
Neil Smith and Charles Dolan, head of Cablevision, which owns the 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	In his introductory words, Bettman said that ``all fans of  
hockey were sad.'' Most of the others on the dais looked as if they 
were at a funeral, but not Gretzky. He remained upbeat throughout 
his announcement and later when taking questions from the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's a party, a celebration,'' Gretzky said of his  
final weekend in hockey. ``It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm not 
thinking of this as a downer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky seemed like a man very much at peace with himself,  
particularly after finalizing his decision about retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew for five days I had made the right decision,'' said  
Gretzky, who revealed that his thought process about retirement had 
started as far back as Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Just about everyone tried to change Gretzky's mind, including  
his wife and the prime minister of Canada. Dolan made a last-ditch 
effort on Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a nice conversation,'' Gretzky said. ``He extended a  
hand out to me to stay with the team. I told him I hadn't wavered 
at all. I'm very confident about that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky's departure marks the second time in three months that  
one of the world's premier athletes -- and the best in his sport -- 
has chosen retirement. But unlike Michael Jordan, who left after 
winning his sixth NBA championship, Gretzky ends his career with a 
disappointing Rangers team that didn't make the playoffs this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to go out like Michael Jordan did, but it's  
not a perfect world. ... It's not going to happen that way, not 
this year, but it is nice to be able to say people do want me to 
play more,'' Gretzky had said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, and now Gretzky's departure, certainly has made 1999 a  
year for losing sports heroes. Then there's the Yankee Clipper, Joe 
DiMaggio, who died last month at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Gretzky decided to leave sooner rather than later  
following a troubled season that included a neck injury and the 
Rangers' failure to make the playoffs for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to leave a big void,'' longtime friend and Hall of  
Famer Gordie Howe said from his winter home in Florida. ``He's a 
proud man. And when you're hurting, it makes you think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1,486 games with teams in Edmonton, Los Angeles, St. Louis  
and New York, Gretzky has 894 goals and 1,962 assists for 2,856 
points -- 1,006 more than runner-up Howe scored in his Hall of Fame 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky owns roughly 60 records, is a 10-time scoring champion  
and a nine-time MVP. But the 1998-99 season was one of frustration 
for Gretzky as he struggled through his injury problems and said he 
was ``feeling more fatigue than I ever felt before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he saw some declines in his talents,'' Muckler  
said. ``Wayne's a very proud person and he wanted to go out on his 
own terms. Maybe he felt that if he didn't do it now, he wouldn't 
be able to do that.''
