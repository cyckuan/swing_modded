<HEADLINE> British Farmers Welcome EU Agriculture Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- British farmers Thursday gave a
mixed welcome to the European Union deal to reform the Common
Agricultural Policy.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly the result is a great improvement for UK farmers
when compared with the shape of the package just a few days ago,"
National Farmers Union (NFU) President Ben Gill said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
European farm ministers reached the deal late Wednesday in
Brussels after nearly three weeks of negotiations, agreeing to
reforms to the EU's cereals, beef and dairy regimes, cutting
internal prices and offering farmers higher direct aid payments.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we are concerned at the impact of the support price
cuts on UK farm incomes and the decision to delay and phase-in
these cuts will be particularly helpful considering the current
difficult positions," Gill said.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the absence of any cap on support payments to
farmers above a particular size or the absence of any mention of
degressivity, or cutting support payments over time.
</P>
<P>
The NFU leader also welcomed a guarantee that oilseed payments
would not be lower than the final cereal and set-aside rate as
well as earlier than proposed payment of the arable aid.
</P>
<P>
"Despite these improvements, dairy farmers have been dealt an
extremely severe blow with four member states and Northern Ireland
being given an extra milk quota allowance," Gill said.
</P>
<P>
But the Conservative party attacked the EU farm reform deal as
bad for farmers and shoppers.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Agriculture Minister Tim Yeo said costs would rise
further and much-needed dairy reforms would wait four years.

<HEADLINE> State Department Worried Over House Debate on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A congressional debate on the
proposed deployment of U.S. troops in Kosovo could upset peace
negotiations between the Serbs and Kosovar Albanians, State
Department spokesman James Rubin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told CNN that Kosovar Albanians would not sign a peace
deal negotiated in Rambouillet, France, last month unless the
United States would participate in a NATO peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
"Anything that complicates that could make it harder for them
to sign and therefore destroy the chances for peace," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
House of Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert Wednesday
rebuffed begging from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
urged the House to put off a scheduled debate at the House on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
"No one should fear the free expression of ideas and the frank
exchange of opinions" on the U.S. deployment in Kosovo, the
speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Albright told a House panel Wednesday that the debate would
"complicate" the situation when the United States and its allies
were trying to get the Serbs and ethnic Albanians on board for a
peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey Hold Summit on Trilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, 11 March (Xinhua) -- Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey,
began a two-day summit on Thursday in Sinaia, a mountain resort
some 150 kilometers north of Bucharest, to discuss trilateral
political and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The summit, attended by the countries three presidents, Emil
Constantinescu, Petar Stoianov and Suleyman Demirel, will discuss
ties in transport and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of NATO and the stability and security in
southeastern Europe will also be examined.
</P>
<P>
The summit is the third of a series that opened in Varna of
Bulgaria; the second was held in Antalya, Turkey, after the
Romania-Bulgaria-Turkey trilateral was inaugurated in September
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Varna summit, which was held on October 3, 1997, witnessed
the signing of a joint declaration on the crackdown of drug-
trafficking and weapons smuggling on the so-called "Balkan route."
</P>
<P>
The Antalya summit, on April 16-17, 1998, saw the signing of a
document to enhance peace and stability in southeastern Europe and
cooperation in the crackdown on terrorism, corruption, illegal
drug-trafficking and money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
During the current summit, the three presidents will sign a
joint statement to establish a free trade zone between the three
nations, as well as a three-party cooperation accord in tourism.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ASEAN Currencies Taking Technical Correction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Most currencies of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) members are underway for
a technical correction in line with the weakening Japanese yen and
euro against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In the period from January 4 to March 5 this year, nearly all
key ASEAN currencies fell against the U.S. dollar with the
Indonesian rupiah declining by 9.9 percent to 8,856 against the
greenback, the Singapore dollar by 4.2 percent to 1.732, the Thai
baht by 3.7 percent to 37.605, and the Philippine peso by 1.4
percent to 39.113.
</P>
<P>
A bank analyst who declined to identify himself pointed out
that the decline of the currencies came in line with the weakening
yen, which sank to a three-month low of 123.75 last week against
the greenback after the central bank of Japan pumped more money
into the banking system to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the present slump of ASEAN currencies to the
spectacular U.S. economic performance in recent years, namely the
hefty economic growth in output and incomes, low inflation and
robust job market.
</P>
<P>
The analyst said that the current fall in ASEAN currencies is
quite different in nature from the devaluation wave seen in July
1997 when the Asian financial storm started to sweep the region.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing fall is not a sign of a fresh round of economic
crisis but a process of correction after the past months saw ASEAN
currencies bottoming out and trending toward stabilization, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Comparing with the range in which the ASEAN currencies have
fallen since the inception of the Asian economic crisis, he said,
the current decline is not so severe as half a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The past 20 months saw a 17-percent fall in the Singapore
dollar, a 33-percent decline in the Thai baht, a 52-percent slump
in Malaysian ringgit and a 72-percent plunge in Indonesian rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Economic environment in East Asia has largely improved with
clear signs of economic recovery being seen in South Korea,
Thailand and Malaysia and this will cushion possible worsening of
the currency situation, another analyst added.
</P>
<P>
They noted that government monetary policies are also
contributing to the current weakening of ASEAN currencies, some of
which even have not fallen through the level the governments hope
to maintain.
</P>
<P>
Japan's allegation that excessive yen strength is not desirable
has helped boost U.S. dollar sentiment, a media report said.
</P>
<P>
Thio Chin Loo, a currency strategist with Banque Paribas in
Singapore has recently forecast weaker Asian currencies against
the dollar, which she said had gained about 10 yen in less than a
month. She was quoted as saying that "the Japanese government's
comfort zone is 120 to 130 yen so long as it is not too volatile
and its impact is not too severe on other Asian currencies."
</P>
<P>
In the case of Singapore, the government, which says it has
done all it can to cut corporate costs, may have to let the
Singapore dollars slide to help its ailing exporters as the
relative strength of its currency has made it difficult for
Singapore to price its goods and services competitively, pushing
total trade to a record low in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thio Chin Loo also said, "there is increased competition and
price cuts in Asia -- there is room for an easier Singapore
dollar to facilitate growth."
</P>
<P>
Some analysts expect the Singapore dollar to range between 1.76
and 2 to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, they warned that if the currency slump in ASEAN as
well as in Japan last long, or any of ASEAN countries allows its
currency fall freely without control, the decline would have
adverse impact on other Asian currencies and the region's economic
recovery.

<HEADLINE> Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A chemical growth factor found in
urine can be used as early detection test for bladder cancer,
British researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund said they have
found that patients with high levels of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) are at greater risk of developing bladder
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Their research also showed a link between the amount of VEGF in
urine and the likelihood of cancer recurring, which means that the
new test could provide a simple, quick, safe and relatively cheap
way of predicting if the cancer will recur.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the latest issue of the Journal of
Urology, was the first time that scientists have measured in
cancer patients' urine the levels of VEGF, which stimulates the
development of blood vessels to feed the tumor and allow it to
spread.
</P>
<P>
The team, Led by Professor Adrian Harris, have studied 261
patients with bladder cancer and compared them with another group
of people who have no disease or other types of tumors.
</P>
<P>
"When we compared the two groups, the patients with bladder
cancer had far more VEGF in their urine," Professor Harris said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that if VEGF is as important in the development of
bladder cancer as the study suggests, it may be worth studying
ways of inhibiting it, which could lead to the development of new
drugs to treat the cancer.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Conference on Science, Technology Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The third national conference
on science and technology which ended here Thursday had achieved
its objectives, Dayananda Bajracharya, vice-chancellor of the
Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (RONAST), said.
</P>
<P>
He said the four-day conference, which was organized by RONAST
with a view to assessing the current status of science and
technology in the country, sharing ideas and raising awareness
about the sector's importance in national development, had been
achieved.
</P>
<P>
About 730 scientists from Nepal and some 30 participants from
Japan, Italy, India, Britain and Germany attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
"The conference had a very encouraging participation of younger
generation," the vice-chancellor said, adding that the sessions
were very active from the beginning to the end.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a general opinion that the conference was
very successful.
</P>
<P>
A total of 252 working papers were presented at the conference
and special lectures and technical sessions were held on various
aspects of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Though science and technology has played a role in the
country's development in certain areas, it is not a priority
sector of the government and does not have enough investment.
</P>
<P>
But Minister for Science and Technology and Pro-Chancellor of
RONAST Bhim Bahadur Rawal assured at the conference that the
government would do whatever possible to help implement the
recommendations made at the conference, Bajracharya said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that development of science and
technology can be institutionalized if the draining out of
talented persons can be checked and if the scientists involve
themselves actively in their fields.
</P>
<P>
The next national conference on the subject is scheduled for
2002.

<HEADLINE> German Envoy Sees Bleak Hope Over Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- German envoy to Cyprus Detlev
Graf Rantzau said here on Thursday that he was leaving Nicosia
with no optimism over the solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The general atmosphere has "hardened" since he last visited
here in December 1998, Rantzau said at the conclusion of his
five-day visit to the island.
</P>
<P>
Rantzau, also an envoy of the European Union, of which his
country now holds the six-month presidency, said he has not been
able to detect on either the Greek Cypriot side or the Turkish
Cypriot side the flexibility or readiness to enter into a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides has said he is ready to
negotiate with the Turkish Cypriots in the north on the basis of
relevant U.N. resolutions and without any preconditions, Rantzau
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insists that
"there will be no negotiations of any kind" unless the
self-declared Turkish Cypriot state in the north is recognized by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Rantzau said he did not bring any plans to either side, because
it would be useless at a time when there is no compromise.
</P>
<P>
A solution can only be found from inside Cyprus itself and no
solution can be imposed from outside, he said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Rantzau held separate meetings with
President Clerides, Denktash, U.N. Resident Representative Ann
Hercus, Cyprus' EU Chief Negotiator George Vassiliou and other
officials from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Increase 0.9 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Thursday that a big purchase pushed retail sales to another strong
increase in February.
</P>
<P>
The retail sales, representing about a third of the nation's
economic output, rose 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally
adjusted 236.5 billion U.S. dollars, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The increase, the seventh in a row, followed the robust gains
of 1 percent in January and 1.1 percent in December. Both the
January and December figures were revised higher from previous
estimates.
</P>
<P>
In February, auto sales were particularly strong, up 1.8
percent. And sales of everything else jumped a healthy 0.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said several factors are combining to drive spending
higher, including unemployment near a 29-year low, low interest
rates, record stock prices as measured by the Dow Jones average of
industrial stocks and a substantial increase in federal tax
refunds, compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
Good weather across much of the country probably encouraged
some additional spending as well.
</P>
<P>
Last month, other strong sales gains included furniture, up 1
percent; building supplies and hardware, 1.2 percent; apparel and
accessory shops, 1 percent; food stores, 0.9 percent, the most in
nearly two years; drug stores, 1.3 percent; restaurants and bars,
0.8 percent; and gasoline stations, 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales at department and other general merchandise stores rose
0.5 percent, a decent increase on top of an extremely strong 2.6
percent advance in January.

<HEADLINE> Mice Gene Discovery Gives Hope in Fighting Obesity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Two groups of U.S. scientists
Thursday reported their findings of a gene that keeps mice slim
and which, in the long term, could lead to the development of
anti-obesity drugs.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Millennium Pharmaceutical Inc in
Massachusetts, the United States, said that their new gene, called
"mahogany" or "mg," plays a powerful role in ordinary weight
regulations in mice.
</P>
<P>
The gene produces a protein called mg in many tissues. Mice
with a mutation in their mg gene maintain a healthy weight whether
they eat a high fat diet or a low one with the same amount of
calories.
</P>
<P>
But mice with a normal mg gene gain excess weight on the high
fat diet, the researchers said in the scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said that because mouse and human metabolism is
alike, they expect to find that the gene has a similar effect on
humans.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic about using the protein for obesity drug
development," Dr Karen Moore, of Millennium Pharmaceutical Inc,
wrote in Nature.
</P>
<P>
"In developing a drug, it is always easier to decrease gene
function rather than try to increase it," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the same issue of Nature, Gregory Barsh and colleagues from
the Stanford University School of Medicine reported in their
separate study the similar findings of the mg gene.

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Eritean Conflict Can Only Be Solved by Peaceful Means: Eritrean Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior eritrean official said
here Thursday that the Ethio-Eritrean conflict can only be
resolved by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Yermane Gebremeskel,
director of the Eritrean President's Office said that there is no
other way but peace to solve the 10-month conflict between the two
Horn of Africa neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"The only choice is peace," Yermane said. He suggested that
the two countries can present their own arguments and continue
their discussions.
</P>
<P>
Talking about mediation made by the international community,
Yermane said said that Eritrea appreciated the mediation efforts
made by the international community for a peaceful solution to the
Ethio-Eritrean conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said that as this month's President of the U.N. Security
Council, China, is working hard towards a peaceful solution to the
conflict, and other members of the Security Council, the European
Union and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) also hope for an
end to the war.
</P>
<P>
But the Eritrean official said that many countries know the
agenda of the Ethiopians "who want to reoccupy Eritrea."  He said
that he did not think that there would be a cessation of war
immediately.

It broke the previous record of 154,201 lots set on 11 January
1996, as speculation about OPEC production cuts increased price
volatility.
</P>
<P>
Trade in Brent Crude futures made up two thirds of the volume,
and the contract only just failed to set a new record in its own
right.
</P>
<P>
Brent traded 105,040 lots, equivalent to more than 100 million
barrels of oil or one third more than total daily world oil
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The IPE's Brent Crude futures contract is one of the world's
most important pricing indicators for the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Brent Crude futures form a key part of the Brent complex that
is used to price two thirds of the world's internationally traded
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Lynton Jones, chief executive of the IPE, said: "In times of
uncertainty about future supply, with the specter of production
cuts appearing and retreating, the benefits of hedging are clearly
demonstrated."
</P>
<P>
The record volumes seen Wednesday at the IPE was a tribute to
the quality of IPE contracts, and the professionalism of its
members, he added.

<HEADLINE> Palestine-Jordan Confederation May Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A Palestine-Jordan
Confederation might be "a reasonable solution" to the question of
the final status of the Palestinian entity, Israeli opposition
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with foreign reporters here, the Labor candidate for
the premiership said such a confederation would smooth some
toughest points in the permanent talks between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when asked if he foresees a Palestinian
state as a result of the permanent talks if he wins the May
elections.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of leading Israel
into "an impasse" in every field, Barak has vowed to move forward
the peace process with Arab neighbors and thus give momentum to
the economy, which he said is in one of the deepest recessions in
decades.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his pledge that he will pull back Israeli troops
from south Lebanon within a year, through a resumption of talks
with Syria and pursuit of international support, if he becomes
prime minister in May.
</P>
<P>
The premier hopeful surprised almost all Israelis when he first
presented a precise timetable of withdrawal from south Lebanon
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government attached a number of conditions to a
troop pullback from the quagmire, holding Beirut responsible for
providing guarantees for the security of Israel's northern border.
</P>
<P>
As the Lebanon issue became a campaign topic following the
killing of seven Israelis in as many days, including a general, by
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, Netanyahu hinted that he might make
do with a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian issue, Barak said he would unblock the
stalled Wye river agreement and then move forward to achieve a
permanent peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinian entity will be "physically
separated" as a result of the final peace agreement, he said. "We
are here and they are there," he repeated his position.
</P>
<P>
Since most of his guiding principles concerning talks with the
Palestinians are very similar to those of Netanyahu, such as
keeping Jerusalem as the "united capital of Israel" and most major
settlements under Israeli control, he was asked what is the
difference between his policies and Netanyahu's.
</P>
<P>
"I'm determined to move forward, while he is just talking," he
said.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Health of
Ethiopia said Thursday that all neccessary measures have been
taken to preempt meningitis epidemic in the country.
</P>
<P>

city of Mecca.
</P>
<P>
Abebe said immediate actions have been taken to contain the
spread of the disease which has been reported in some part of the
country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Trimble Says Decommissioning Can Be "Resolved" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Ulster Unionist
leader David Trimble said Thursday he was hopeful the impasse in
the Northern Ireland peace process could be overcome.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair at Downing
Street, Trimble told reporters, "I am quite sure that it can be
resolved."
</P>
<P>
"I am quite sure that it is within the capabilities of the
paramilitaries, of all the paramilitary groups concerned," added
Trimble, who is also the province's first minister.
</P>
<P>
But this depended on whether terrorist organizations could
agree to start decommissioning their weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the prime minister and the five-strong
unionist delegation is the latest attempt to break the political
deadlock in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The current impasse over the decommissioning has prompted the
British government to postpone the target date for devolution from
March 10 to 29.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists say they will not take up executive
positions in the province's new assembly alongside Sinn Fein until
the Irish Republican Army begins handing in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, insists there is no
pre-condition in the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement which means
decommissioning must take place before the transfer of power from
Westminster to Northern Ireland takes effect.

<HEADLINE> SADC Countries Expect Better Maize Yields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) expects to have an improved maize harvest as
against last year's total yield of 15.99 million tons given the
better rain fall received in main producing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to its latest Food Security Bulletin issued here
Thursday, areas under maize have increased in Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe, suggesting improved
production.
</P>
<P>
Despite reduced plantings in the major maize producer, South
Africa, forecasts are that production will reach 7.69 million
tons, compared with 7.54 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
But the bulletin cautioned that forecasts for better harvests
based on areas planted could be dampened by the deluge of
incessant rains experienced in most grain-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, another major exporter of maize, preliminary
surveys suggest a 20 percent increase in maize plantings leading
to projections of more than last year's production of 1.46 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, the short rainy season has failed and the
Tanzanian government had already appealed for humanitarian
assistance.
</P>
<P>
On the region's food security position, the unit said the
position remained unsatisfactory and faced an overall deficit of
548,000 tons for the 1998/99 marketing year.

<HEADLINE> Fund for Orphans Launched in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A revolving fund is being launched
in Zimbabwe to service the needs of the growing number of AIDS
orphans estimated to reach 800,000 by the year 2000, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project is the brainchild of Minister of State in the
President's Office Responsible for Gender Issues, Oppah
Muchinguri, who borrowed the idea from Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the minister of state Thursday said that the
fund would be known as the Zimbabwe Women Efforts to Save Orphans.
 A branch for the implementation of the project had been launched
in Manicaland Province, and plans were underway for another branch
in Matabeleland North Province.
</P>
<P>
A national board of trustees will be established once the pilot
project has spread to all the other provinces.
</P>
<P>
"The main aim of the project is to source for funds under one
umbrella body and then distributed the money among the provinces,"
the spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
Members who care for the orphans will borrow money from the
fund to start income generating projects.
</P>
<P>
The idea came from Uganda where Muchinguri went with a
delegation last year to see the work being done by the Uganda
Women Efforts led by first lady Janet Museveni to save orphans.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare of
Zimbabwe, 700 people are dying of AIDS every week in the country.

The two foreign ministers arrived Wednesday on their way to
Abidjan,  Cote d'Ivoire, for a joint conference of the
ambassadors, the Ghana News Agency reported Thursdafy..
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings said African countries yearn for democracy,
abhor dictatorship and are fighting to end corruption.
</P>
<P>
However, some foreign organizations rather tend to support
these negative traits, thus promoting conflicts on the continent,
he said. He appealed to the two Foreign Ministers to take up these
issues in their discussions.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings spoke about the crippling debt burden and said, "We
are waiting to see what Europe can do to assist."
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain and France would work closely with other
European countries on issues relating to Africa. "Without a
common objective we cannot achieve anything," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said: "We want to bring about genuine development and
co- operation between France, Britain and Africa."
</P>
<P>
He said this new policy, as enshrined in the St Malo
Declaration, will enable Europe to assist Africa to speed up its
development efforts.

<HEADLINE> Britain, France Express Willingness to Help Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain and France have
expressed their willingness to co-operate with Africa in finding
solutions to its economic and political development.
</P>
<P>
 Robin Cook, British foreign secretary and his French
counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, said this in a joint pre-departure
press conference at Kotoka International Airport Thursday after
their two-day visit to Ghana, the Ghanaian News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two Foreign Ministers acknowledged that their visit was the
 beginning of a partnership with Africa, saying this would be
beneficial to both sides.
</P>
<P>
They said as leading members of the EU, they are well placed
to assist Africa in her bid towards economic emancipation.
</P>
<P>
The two officials said their countries have already taken the
initiative with the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to relieve Africa of its 300 million pounds sterling
debt.
</P>
<P>
They said poor African countries and those that are performing
well economically will be their priority as far as debt relief is
concerned, adding that the relief will be one of the ways to
move Africa's economy forward.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers said political stability will ensure
a sustained economic development, stressing that it is their
desire to consolidate the rule of law and good governance in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
On Sierra Leone, the ministers said they held discussions with
 Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings on how best France and
Britain will co-ordinate their efforts in finding a lasting
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that peace and the rule of law are restored
in Sierra Leone and now that there is a legitimate government
there the people should be able to live without fear," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
 He said the Britain is supporting west African peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG) with transport and medicine and is exploring
avenues for negotiations with the rebels to secure a cease fire
and  integrate them into society.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers have since left for Cote D'Ivoire.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Court Maintains Death Sentence for Tutsi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kigali military criminal
tribunal Wednesday maintained death penalty for two men, an
ex-Rwandan army officer and a medical doctor, for the murder of
the last Tutsi queen and her family during the April-July 1994
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Another convict, was condemned to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Second-Lieutenant Pierre Bizimana, and doctor Martin Kageruka,
and lance corporal Aloys Mazimpaka had been found guilty of
committing genocide and other crimes against humanity in southern
Butare prefecture, the official Rwandan News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that on July 24, 1998, the Butare Military
Criminal Court had sentenced Bizimana and Kageruka to death, and
Mazimpaka to life imprisonment. However, all the three convicts
had filed an appeal against the verdict to the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
"After examining their appeal, the (Kigali military ) court
found it baseless, and upheld previous punishments," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The three men, in collaboration with the government have been
requested to pay compensation to some 150 victims equivalent to
over 11 million U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The 100-day genocide in Rwanda claimed the lives of over one
million people, mostly ethnic Tutsis and Hutus opposed to the
Hutu extremist regime.
</P>
<P>
Up to 125,000 genocide suspects are currently detained in
Rwandan prisons, and await for trials. Over 150 have already been
sentenced, with 22 publicly executed in April of last year.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Occupation Policy Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A structure of occupation,
displacement and apartheid has been systematically constructed by
Israel around the Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and
East Jerusalem, an Israeli peace group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions (ICAHD), a
newly-formed group campaigning against the Israeli perpetuation of
occupation and house demolitions in the occupied territories, made
the accusation at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The current Israeli government's policy is to ensure Israeli
control and de facto annexation of more than half of the occupied
territories while confining 3 million Palestinians to an
archipelago of small, crowded, impoverished and disconnected
areas, ICAHD said.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, which was also participated by 14 other
peace and humanitarian organizations in Israel, ICAHD demonstrated
facts and figures of Israel's occupation of the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
Since 1967, Israel has taken control of 70 percent of the
occupied territories and confiscated tens of thousands of acres of
Palestinian agricultural land, and hundreds of thousands of fruit
and olive trees have been uprooted, it said.
</P>
<P>
ICAHD sharply criticized the Israeli government's settlement
policy in the territories and particularly Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon's policy of "creating facts on the ground."
</P>
<P>
Thirteen new settlements were established in the past few
months on the West Bank following Sharon's call to "grab the
hills," it said.
</P>
<P>
Till now, 180 Jewish settlements, housing 180,000 settlers
have been established in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
If those living in the neighborhoods of East and West Jerusalem
beyond the Green Line, or the 1967 cease-fire Line, were counted,
the population of settlers reached 350,000, ICAHD said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 6,000 Palestinian houses have been demolished by
Israel in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967, leaving
some 30,000 Palestinians homeless.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, Israel demolished 150 Palestinian houses in the
West Bank and 25 in East Jerusalem, and more than 90 percent of the
Palestinians are now confined to small and disconnected cantons
besieged by Israeli army checkpoints, it said.
</P>
<P>
ICAHD also criticized Israel's policy of moving polluting and
chemical industries to the West Bank during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, it said, the Palestinians have been
unable to move freely without passes in the territories,
including into Jerusalem for reasons of religion, employment and
residency.
</P>
<P>
ICAHD's coordinator Jaff Halper said that from Friday, his
group will organize Israelis and other peace lovers to travel to
the West Bank to help the Palestinians rebuild their houses
demolished by the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
"Together with Palestinians, we will rebuild houses demolished
by the Israeli army and replant trees uprooted by Israeli Civil
Administrations in the territories," Halper declared.

MAPUTO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's customs tax income
reached 146 million U.S. dollars in 1998, raising by 16.5 percent
over 1997, a senior official announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tomaz Salomao, Minister of Planning and Finance, made the
announcement at a press conference, adding that this is a result
of the administrative reform of customs departments in 1997, which

income.
</P>
<P>
About 38 customs employees were discharged and 149 punished for
various mal-practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tax evasion cases, which were mainly found in sectors like
automobiles, cigarettes, beverages and sugar, were reduced to 920
in 1998, from 1589 in 1997.
</P>

The Mozambique got cooperation from Britain's Crown Agents
company in its customs reform. The British company started to act

<HEADLINE> Foreign Acquisitions Of U.S. Companies Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign takeovers of American
firms, which set a record last year, are on an even faster pace so
far in 1999, new data show.
</P>
<P>
The dollar amount of announced deals involving foreign
companies buying U.S. firms soared to 94.5 billion U.S. dollars in
the first nine weeks of this year, up nearly tenfold compared with
the same period in 1998, according to statistics released by
Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
The number of such deals rose 32 percent to 211, compared with
161 in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
While one deal, Britain-based Vodafone's plan to buy AirTouch
Communications for 65 billion dollars, makes up more than half
this year's total, the numbers continue a trend that exploded in
the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In all of 1998 foreign purchases totaled 234 billion dollars,
according to Securities Data, boosted by such deals as Germany's
Daimler-Benz merging with Chrysler Corp. That dwarfed the 65
billion dollars in foreign purchases in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 10 biggest foreign takeover deals so far this year
involve European purchasers.
</P>
<P>
"The Germans, the French, the Dutch, they are all coming this
direction with their checkbooks," said Sung Won Sohn, chief
economist with Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. "They are looking
for opportunities long-term, and clearly that's here in the U.S."

<P>
Economists believe American is attracting many European
companies that are skeptical about the long-term opportunities at
home. Thus they are willing to pay to get a piece of the American
economy despite the strong dollar, they said.
</P>
<P>
While purchases of American companies by foreign companies are
increasing, U.S. holdings abroad remain significant and American
companies still make giant purchases overseas as well, among which
is Ford Motor Co.'s 6 billion dollar deal last year to acquire the
automobile operations of Sweden's Volvo.
</P>
<P>
All this activity is part of the whirl of mergers in recent
years. As companies compete to be global players, they are
scrambling to grow and boost profit potential.

<HEADLINE> Human Development Report Launched in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A human development report
prepared by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Uganda
was launched here Thursday, with emphasis on enhancing the quality
of the poor in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The annual report, third of its kind, is entitled Uganda Human
Development Report 1998. It analyzes causes of poverty in the
country and makes proposals for poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
In his introductory remarks, Babatunde Thomas, the UNDP
resident representative in Uganda and U.N. resident coordinator,
said the report is aimed at transforming the livelihoods of the
rural poor and creating a better life for present and future
generations.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has done a lot to improve the quality
of life of average Ugandans, poverty is still prevalent in the
country, he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to redress the regional imbalance in
the country and to do more toward total elimination of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe, who officially
launched the report, acknowledged that there is a lot to be done
toward this end and thanked UNDP for providing useful data to the
country's decision-making body.
</P>
<P>
"We can't make plans and strategies without data. Yet the most
important thing is to mobilize the public and to change their
attitudes," she said.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders, she asserted, should play the vital role of
transforming the attitudes of most illiterate Ugandans by using
development- oriented information. This is the only way to get
people out of poverty, she concluded.

<HEADLINE> Primakov, 6 Months in Office, Sums Up Government Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Thursday that his cabinet has managed to do "not
that little" in taming consumer panic and bringing down rising
prices.
</P>
<P>
Meeting faction leaders of the State Duma, the lower house that
approved his nomination as prime minister six months ago, Primakov
said his government "has managed to prevent galloping inflation
which is now decreasing. The ruble exchange rate dynamics has come
to be smoother and has practically stabilized."
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this, we have taken a number of measures on the
currency market," Primakov said. "Shorter terms have been fixed
for the repatriation of hard currency proceeds of exporter
enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Such enterprises now must exchange 75 percent of their hard
currency returns for rubles.
</P>
<P>
The national currency is now somewhat stablized at around 23 to
the U.S. dollar, down from the pre-crisis exchanged rate of 6.3
rubles to a dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, Primakov warned that the ruble would further tumble
"until a real growth occurs in the economy," Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"We consider such macroeconomic figures not as an ultimate goal
but rather as a precondition for the development of the real
sector of the national economy," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
On Moscow's relations with the International Monetary Fund,
Primakov said the government has reasons to believe that it will
reach an accord with the fund on provision of new loans.
</P>
<P>
An IMF mission led by Gerard Belanger, deputy director of the
Second European Department of the IMF, arrived in Moscow earlier
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Our position will be maximally constructive on our side (in
the talks with the IMF)," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The premier also touted his government's efforts in
strengthening the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said his cabinet has in the six months managed in
farming "more than in many preceding years."

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Welcomes African Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said here Thursday that he welcomes the idea of networking among
African states and pledged support for its success.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks when meeting with delegates attending
the African Executive Office Network Conference, a press release
from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The president commended the new technologies in communications
and referred to new methods of storing and delivering information
as revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
The main contribution to these new technologies in
communication has been the liberalization of the whole economy
including telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he watched a small demonstration about the Internet
and was briefed about the diversified functions of Internet.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, sponsored by the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID), is the second of its kind.
The first was held in Bamako, Mali, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's conference is "Good Governance and
Effective Policy Making in Africa." It drew delegates from nine
African countries including South Africa, Tanzania, Kenya, Senegal
and Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Reaffirms U.S. Ties with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen reaffirmed Thursday that Washington will
maintain strong ties with Israel no matter who will lead the next
Israeli government after the May elections.
</P>
<P>
He made the assurance after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting he briefed Netanyahu on his talks with
leaders of Arab countries that he visited in the past several
days, Israeli television reported.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Netanyahu said he had discussed with Cohen
the long-term threats that Israel faces, especially those of
ballistic missiles and non-conventional weapons, and the need to
strengthen the strategic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cohen was flown to Israel from Egypt, where he met President
Hosni Mubarak and announced an offer to sell to Cairo weapons
worth 3.2 billion U.S. dollars. Israel is the last stop of his
nine-country tour.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will hold a working meeting with his Israeli counterpart
Moshe Arens and top defense officials Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda is the funding of a third Arrow 2 anti-ballistic
missile battery. During his visit here early last year, Cohen said
the U.S. would fund the third battery.
</P>
<P>
The two will also discuss the agreement to upgrade
the strategic and military cooperation between Israel and the U.S.,
as called for in a recently signed strategic memorandum.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Cohen and Netanyahu was hastily arranged.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Israeli officials said before the arrival of
Cohen that he did not request a meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen denied that he tried deliberately to avoid
meeting Netanyahu, saying that the U.S. does not have any bias
in the Israeli election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government, however, has expressed frustration in
recent months over the reluctance of Washington to meet Israeli
officials.
</P>
<P>
In January, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
refused to meet Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon when he was on
a visit to Washington. Earlier this week, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Near East Affairs Martin Indyk decided
to visit the region without coming to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Also, there were reports last month that Netanyahu did not
attend an economic conference in Switzerland because U.S. Vice
President Al Gore was unwilling to meet him.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Washington is disappointed with the
Netanyahu's government over its non-adherence to the Wye accords
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
To show Washington's neutral position in the Israeli
elections, Cohen will also meet with two other prominent prime
minister candidates, Labor leader Ehud Barak and Center Party
leader Yitzhak Mordechai, after meeting Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Faces Big Challenges in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda still faces tough
challenges in poverty eradication despite the remarkable progress
it has made in this area, a report has said.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda Human Development Report 1998, launched Thursday
afternoon here, indicates that remarkable progress has been made
in some areas like illiteracy rates, average household income,
infant mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
Illiteracy rate dropped from 56 percent three years ago to 46
percent at present. Infant mortality rates have gone down from 122
per 1,000 to 88 per 1,000 over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Per capita annual income increased from 151,081 shillings (151
U.S. dollars) in 1990 to 338,943 shillings (339 dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, big challenges are still there. About 54 percent of
the population are without access to clean drinking water, and six
percent of the urban and 48 percent of the rural population do not
have access to sanitation facilities.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the people live on less than one dollar per
day while 80 percent of the rural poor live in absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
Women, contributing to some 80 percent of work force in the
rural areas, have no control of land and what is produced.  About
41 percent of them are still exposed to domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
Although the government introduced the Universal Primary
Education plan in early 1997, providing free primary education for
four children of every family, there is still a huge number of
school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
The country's infrastructure is old and needs either repair or
improvement.
</P>
<P>
All these obstacles are not insurmountable if the government
does more in this aspect, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The suggestions contained in the report include government's
commitment to poverty eradication, peace and security, improvement
in infrastructure and building dynamic and competitive rural
economies.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey to Create Free Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey
decided to establish a trilateral zone of free trade and a joint
declaration in this respect was signed Thursday by the presidents
of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Romania's President Emil Constantinescu, Bulgaria's President
Petar Stoianov and Turkey's President Suleyman Demirel made the
move after a first round of talks within the trilateral summit
under way in Sinaia, a mountain resort some 150 km north of
Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
Signature of the joint declaration and already existing
agreements are expected to result in the establishment of a large
trade area, as well as of an interesting market both from outside
and inside, Romanian presidential advisor Zoe Petre told the
press.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on trilateral cooperation in tourism between the
governments of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey was also signed on the
same day by ministers concerned of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Romania-Bulgaria-Turkey trilateral goes on under excellent
auspices," Zoe Petre stressed, adding that the cooperation proved
to be fruitful in several priority fields, such as fighting
organized crime, where information exchange was substantial and
efficient.
</P>
<P>
She also pointed out the convergence of political interests and
stands in regional and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A two-day summit began Thursday afternoon between the
presidents of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, with the focus on an
analysis of the stage of the trilateral and multilateral
cooperation and on aspects of the stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The three presidents and their delegations will approach in
their talks afterwards on the process of NATO expanding in the
context of the summit due in Washington. An important point to be
discussed is the situation in Kosovo and the international
community's efforts to resolve this crisis.
</P>
<P>
The summit is the third of a series that opened in Varna of
Bulgaria; the second was held in Antalya, Turkey, after the
Romania-Bulgaria-Turkey trilateral was inaugurated in September
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Varna summit, which was held on October 3, 1997, witnessed
the signing of a joint declaration on the crackdown of drug
trafficking and weapons smuggling on the so-called "Balkan route."
</P>
<P>
The Antalya summit, on April 16-17, 1998, saw the signing of a
document to enhance peace and stability in southeastern Europe and
cooperation in the crackdown on terrorism, corruption, illegal
drug-trafficking and money-laundering.

<HEADLINE> 20 Kurdish Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 20 Kurdish rebels were
killed in recent military operations staged by Turkish security
forces in southeastern Turkey, an official statement said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Office of the Emergency Regional
Rule said that the security forces had wiped out the Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) militants in the provinces of Batman and
Sirnak in the region.
</P>
<P>
Three PKK rebels surrendered in Kozluk town of Batman province,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers of the security forces were killed in the clashes
with the PKK in the region, it added.
</P>
<P>
According to Anatolia News Agency, a group of PKK militants on
Thursday set aflame an official vehicle in Osmaniye province in
the Mediterranean region of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A report of Turkey's General Staff said on Thursday that the
PKK has organized a total of 19,470 bloody incidents including
attacks on security forces, bomb attacks and armed clashes over
the past 15 years.

independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Over 37,000
lives have been killed in clashes since August 1984.

MOSCOW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
has signed a decree to set up the Russian Development Bank with a
charter capital of 375 million rubles (about 16.3 million U.S.

<P>
The Federal Property Fund, which will act as the founder of the
bank, has been ordered to draw up and approve the founding
documents with the Economics Ministry within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
These documents must determine the number of declared shares
that would allow for the bank's charter capital to be raised to 4
billion rubles (about 174 million dollars), with the government
retaining at least 75 percent plus one share after any new share
issues, Interfax said, quoting the government information
department.
</P>

The decree also approved the roster of 11 government
representatives, including First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Congolese Refugees Flee to Zambia </HEADLINE>

<P>
LUSAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of refugees have fled the
war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since last week to
Zambia's Luapula Province, the Zambia News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The province has no capacity to contain the situation as far as
the provision of food and other logistics for the refugees are
concerned, according to the news agency.
</P>
<P>
It quoted deputy permanent secretary of the province, Martin
Kaoma, as saying Thursday that the province has not been funded by
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to
monitor the movement of refugees.
</P>
<P>
He does not know whether the province has enough food to feed
the refugees although he said those being kept in Kaputa adjacent
to DRC are receiving food from northern province of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees are facing serious food problems because
UNHCR has not sent any food consignment to the area, the agency
quoted sources as saying.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Renews U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday decided unanimously to extend the mandate of the U.N.
Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) for a further period of
three months, until June 13.
</P>
<P>
The resolution voiced its welcome to the intention of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to re-establish the UNOMSIL in
Freetown, capital of the West African country, as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The resolution "condemns the atrocities perpetrated by the
rebels on the civilian population of Sierra Leone, including in
particular those against women and children."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "deplores all violations of human rights
and international humanitarian law which have occurred in Sierra
Leone during the recent escalation," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "calls upon all parties to the conflict in
Sierra Leone fully to respect human rights and international
humanitarian law and the neutrality and impartiality of
humanitarian workers, and to ensure full and unhindered access for
humanitarian assistance to affected population," the resolution
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "expresses its grave concern at continued
reports that support is being afforded to the rebels in Sierra
Leone, including through the supply of arms and mercenaries, in
particular from the territory of Liberia," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "expresses its support of all efforts," in
particular by the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), aimed at peacefully resolving the conflict and restoring
lasting peace and stability to Sierra Leone, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council resolution came at a time when the United
Nations is returning to Freetown, capital of the West African
country, due to the stabilization of the military and political
situation on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special representative for Sierra Leone, Francis Okelo
of Uganda, told reporters Monday that "the situation in Freetown
has very much stabilized."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG and government troops intended to
"pursue this process into the other parts of the country as well,"
Okelo said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels invaded Freetown on January 6, unleashing more than
two weeks of fighting before being flushed out of the capital city
into surrounding suburbs and adjacent hills by ECOMOG forces.
</P>
<P>
Up to 5,000 people died during the invasion and vast areas of
the city were razed by rebel-set fires.
</P>
<P>
The fighting forced the United Nations relief agencies to
return to Freetown to resume their work there "and hopefully in
the rest of the country," Okelo said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the Nigerian president-elect, General
Olusegun Obasanjo, said that Nigerian peacekeeping forces would
not be immediately pulled out of Sierra Leone when he takes office
on May 29 in the most populous country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria overwhelmingly dominates the 15,000-strong ECOMOG in
Sierra Leone, which is the only protection elected President Ahmed
Kabbah has against rebels and renegade soldiers fighting to
overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar, who will
step down for Obasanjo, said Tuesday that Nigerian troops would
disengage from Sierra Leone only once talks to end the war made
progress.
</P>
<P>
"The possible partial withdrawal of Nigerian forces from ECOMOG
following the elections in the country and the consequent effects
on ECOMOG's military effectiveness in Sierra Leone could require a
major reappraisal of the situation," Annan said in his March 4
report.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the dual track approach pursued so far, which
combines support for ECOMOG military action to maintain law and
order with a willingness to negotiate with the rebels, may need to
be reviewed," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Chiefs Stress Long-Term Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Two senior U.S. military
officials said Thursday that the United States would take a
long-term strategy of weakening Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
regime while supporting his opponents without allowing Iraq to
disintegrate into chaos.
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any groups that I could say that we could arm
today that would march on Baghdad and successfully achieve regime
change," Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni told the House Armed Services
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zinni, head of U.S. forces in the Gulf region, said Pentagon
leaders were being cautious in pursuing President Bill Clinton's
call for a regime change and he rejected giving weapons to
opponents or setting up opposition camps as they were too weak to
oust Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
He warned the goal of regime change in the region "could end up
with an Afghanistan, an Iran, a Somalia."
</P>
<P>
"In the long run they could be more destabilizing. Anything
reckless, any two-page solution to this every complex problem
could get us in serious trouble," he added.
</P>
<P>
Walter Slocombe, undersecretary of defense for policy, told
the committee that lawmakers should have patience.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see a changed regime in Iraq and that is... our
ultimate objective," he said. "We do not believe that is something
which we can count on happening at any particular time and
certainly not real fast."
</P>
<P>
Slocombe said the Clinton administration's strategy was to keep
Saddam in a strategic box by maintaining support for U.S. actions
among a coalition of Arab nations and other allies; maintaining
U.N. sanctions against Iraq to prevent Saddam from using oil
profits to buy weapons; and keeping a robust U.S. military
presence in the Gulf to respond to Iraqi challenges, including the
challenges in the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
"It's not an instant solution," Slocombe said of the U.S.
policy. "It won't fit on a bumper sticker. But it is, I think, a
policy which has worked historically for longer than people
thought it would.... This is a long-term effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zinni and Slocombe attended the House panel's hearing to defend
the administration's policy as critics were emerging about U.S.
almost daily bombings on Iraqi air defense sites.
</P>
<P>
The critics said the nearly daily U.S. attacks on Iraqi targets
since December have not hurt Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Former CIA director James Woolsey told the House panel
Wednesday that the strikes offer only temporary military victories
and are doing nothing to weaken Saddam's regime.
</P>
<P>
Woolsey suggested that no-fly zones be extended across Iraq,
that the United States recognize an Iraqi government in exile to
oppose Saddam and that U.S. airstrikes be used to hit not just air
defense sites but also Saddam's power sources such as his
Republican Guard and security and intelligence facilities.
</P>
<P>
Republican Representative Floyd Spence, chairman of the
committee, said he called the two days of hearings on Iraq because
what he saw was "the lack of a clear and consistent Iraq policy."
</P>
<P>
"Many of us are deeply troubled by the course of U.S. policy
and the pattern of U.S. military operations in the Persian Gulf,"
he said.

BAGHDAD, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi air defenses believe
that they have shot down one of the U.S. or British warplanes that
violated its airspace on Thursday, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying that at
8:50 a.m. local time (0550 GMT), eight formations of U.S. and
British warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases made 16
sorties over the provinces of Dhi-Qar, Muthanna, Misan, Basra and
Najaf.

"Iraqi warplanes and SAM missiles intercepted the aggressors'
planes and forced them to flee to their bases at 9:55 a.m. local
time (0955 GMT)," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi air defenses believed they had shot down an enemy
plane, but there is no confirmation from the allied side.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said several times that its anti-aircraft units shot
down enemy planes, but the U.S. and Britain denied such claims
every time.
</P>
<P>
At 3:25 p.m. local time (1225 GMT), U.S and British warplanes
again violated the southern Iraqi airspace and made 14 sorties,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that around noon time two formations of enemy planes
from Turkey violated northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk and
Neineva provinces.
</P>
<P>
Violations of Iraqi airspace by U.S. and British warplanes
over the no-fly zones have become nearly a daily occurrence since
the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq following
the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
suppression.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it does not recognized the restricted zones, and
vowed to attack any warplanes violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Denies Involvement in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea does not support any
factions in Somalia which is torn by civil wars, a senior Eritrean
official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Eritrea doesn't have very much involvement in Somalia,"
Yermane Gebremeskel, Director of the Eritrean President's Office
told Xinhua, noting that his country does have some relations with
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Some recent reports said that consignments of arms, ammunitions
and military experts are arriving for many factions in Somalia
from either Ethiopia or Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Eritrea and Ethiopia whose animosity
and fighting along their border is escalating are each trying to
arm Somalia's rival sides in an attempt to relieve the pressure
which each side feels on the border.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) and
the Digil Salvation Army factions in Somalia charged late January
that Eritrea flew five planeloads of weapons to warlord Hussein
Mohamed Aidid to arm Ethiopian dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Yermane said that he did not think that Eritrea is involved in
allowing arms inflow into Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea will not do that for short-term and tactic gains, he
said, adding that the Somali problem will be a problem in the
region for some time.
</P>
<P>
As there are many factions in Somalia which has for quite a
long time no central government, he said, "If you have to support
them, you have to support them all. Otherwise, there will be
wars."
</P>
<P>
The Somalis are very friendly to Eritrea, Yermane said, adding
that they were supportive of the Eritreans in their fighting for
independence in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Eritrea has been refrained from supporting one group
against the other, he said. "We had sympathy with some of them,
but we have not supported anyone."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the "president" of the separatist Somaliland, Ibrahim
Igal, had tried to have a relation with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Igal was seeking for recognition from Eritrea. But Eritrea
told him that it could not. "We have not been trying to play with
one group against another," Yermane said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Adviser Threatens "Sterner Measures" Against DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- William Perry, special adviser
to President Bill Clinton, said Thursday that he would recommend
"sterner measures" against the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) in his upcoming review of U.S. policy toward the DPRK
for the president.
</P>
<P>
"Any recommendation that I give to President Clinton will deal
both with the possibility that North Korea will respond to
positive proposals (on DPRK nuclear and missile programs) and the
possibility that they may not. If they do not, then sterner
measures will be necessary," Perry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The former defense secretary, who has just returned from a trip
to China, South Korea and Japan, did not say what sterner measures
he would recommend, but said he expected they would have the
backing of Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
He said that once the so-called sterner measures were required,
"we would expect to have the United States, Japan and South Korea
united in both the need for them and the way in which we carry
them out."
</P>
<P>
Perry said he expected to present his review of U.S. policy
toward the DPRK to President Clinton in a few weeks and said he
was "open to the idea" of also making a trip to Pyongyang once the
study was completed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has banned public
gatherings with immediate effect as its further effort to control
cholera spread.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the measure here Thursday, Health Minister Nkandu
Luo said that any public gathering will not be allowed in the
affected areas without permission from the medical authorities
concerned.
</P>
<P>
She said the country has also banned sale of fish and food in
open places.
</P>
<P>
Luo said at a news briefing that since cholera broke out in the
country in January of this year 159 people died and about 5,600
cases have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The government has spent 700 million kwacha (about 300,000 U.S.
dollars) in fighting the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
She called for public cooperation in the fighting against the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Luo complained that in some residential communities people have
been given good water supplies but some still dig shallow wells to
fetch their water.
</P>
<P>
Recently Zambia has been using radio, television, newspapers to
 publicize ways of control spread of cholera.

NICOSIA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian government has

</P>
<P>
First councellor at the embassy Maria Szekely, now on a visit

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets End In Buoyant Mood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets ended in
strong mood Thursday after a record high in Wall Street, merger
activity in the financial sector and strong buying of oil stocks.
</P>
<P>
London stocks led the way, as the Dow in New York surged again
in early trading and approached the 10,000 mark. The FTSE 100
touched a number of new highs throughout the session, closing at a
new record of 6,335.7, a rise of 1.51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, the UK government's annual budget was
followed by little activity as it appeared to leave the market
cold. A few sectors were affected, and the overall impact was
broadly neutral.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a revival in the fortunes of oil stocks boosted
activity as crude prices picked up on hopes of significant
production cuts from the OPEC cartel.
</P>
<P>
German shares gained ground despite continued uncertainty about
the German government's economic and taxation policy.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax index closed up 55 points at 4,785 amid merger
speculation in utility and banking stocks and an opening rally on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The surprising resignation of Germany's Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine failed to register on the markets as the announcement
was timed after markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
French shares gained ground overall, led by robust financial
and oil stocks. The leading Cac 40 index closed up 22 points at
4,184.
</P>
<P>
At the forefront of trade was Banque Nationale de Paris
following its 34.2bn euro hostile bid for rivals Paribas and

<HEADLINE> South African Ruling Party Likely to Get Majority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) is likely to achieve its goal of a two-thirds
majority in this year's general election provided that the voter
turnout is less than 65 percent, a survey has found.
</P>
<P>
If the voter turnout is higher, the ANC would probably score
closer to its 63 percent level in 1994, according to a survey
conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC).
</P>
<P>
The survey was completed in early December last year and
targeted at a sample of 2,200 individuals demographically
representative of South Africa' s population. Its results were
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the opposition parties could achieve a
combined voter share of 40 percent if the turnout was high,
otherwise this could fall to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Had an election been held at the time of the survey, the ANC
would have got between 62 and 73 percent of the vote nationally,
the New National Party nine to 12 percent, the Democratic Party
five to eight, the United Democratic Movement four to six, the
Inkatha Freedom Party four to five, and the Freedom Front one to
two.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 75 percent of the eligible voters
clearly intended voting in the election.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that 49 percent of adult South Africans are
dissatisfied with the way South Africa is governed, with 37
percent being satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The statistics correlate strongly with income and race, with
three times more satisfied than dissatisfied people among the
poorest 20 percent of the population, while among the country's
wealthiest 20 percent this is reversed.
</P>
<P>
Among blacks, about 50 percent were satisfied, with 36 percent
dissatisfied. Only six percent of whites indicated they were
satisfied, while 87 percent were dissatisfied. Twenty-two percent
of colored people were satisfied, compared with 54 percent
dissatisfied. Among Indians, the percentages were 72 percent
dissatisfied and 14 percent satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The HSRC said while the overall satisfaction level had declined
from 64 percent in 1994 to 37 percent in December 1998, the level
of trust in the national government was high -- more than 60
percent among blacks, 30 percent among colored people, 19 percent
among Indians and nine percent among whites.

<HEADLINE> Arab League, Belarus Rap U.S. Air Raids on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) and Belarus on
Thursday denounced the continued attacks on Iraq by the U.S. and
British warplanes.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting between AL chief Esmat Abdel-Meguid and
visiting Belarussian Foreign Minister Ural Latypov, AL spokesman
Talaat Hammad said the two sides emphasized their identical views
on rejecting the air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the two no-fly zones
in northern and southern Iraq have continuously attacked Iraqi
targets over the past months.
</P>
<P>
Following the four-day U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq in
mid-December, Baghdad said it does not recognized the no-fly
zones, and would fire at any alien warplanes violating its
airspace.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Iraqi air defenses and U.S.-British planes
occurred almost daily in the no-fly zones, imposed by Western
allies in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, which drove Iraqi troops
out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The allies claimed the set-up of the restricted zones was to
protect the ethnic Kurdish minority in northern Iraq and the
Shiite Muslims in the south from President Saddam Hussein's
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian official, who arrived in Cairo on Tuesday,
asked Abdel-Meguid to mediate among the Arab countries in a bid to
upgrade their diplomatic representation in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief said he has decided to open a representative
office for the 22-nation pan-Arab forum in the Belarussian capital
since Belarus has embassies in Cairo and Damascus, and is now
preparing for a third one in the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Latypov extended an invitation to
Abdel-Meguid to visit his country, the league spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Five Namibian Secessionists Repatriated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Five Namibian nationals from
a group accused of plotting the secession of the Caprivi Strip
have been voluntarily repatriated from Botswana, South African
Press Association reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"They arrived safely in Windhoek this morning," UN deputy high
commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), Mengesha Kebede, was quoted as
saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"They were met by our representatives and officials of the
Namibian government. They will stay in Windhoek for a few days
before returning home (to the Caprivi Strip)."
</P>
<P>
Another 15 Namibians, the leaders of the group, were granted
political asylum in February by Botswana, which, mindful of
relations with Namibia, asked the UNHCR to settle them elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,500 Namibians crossed into Botswana between
October and December last year, claiming they were fleeing
persecution by the Namibian government.
</P>
<P>
The issue has not been publicly raised by Namibian President
Sam Nujoma, who is on a three-day state visit to Botswana.
</P>
<P>
He earlier expressed disappointment that his sister country had
not sent the "terrorists" back home.
</P>
<P>
The Namibians have applied for refugee status, but the UNHCR,
Botswana and Namibia are hoping they will eventually be
repatriated voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Their application for refugee status are being processed by
Botswana and a decision is expected soon.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Find Way to Remove Oestrogen from Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have found a
safe way to get oestrogen, the female sex hormone, out of water
supply, The Daily Telegraph newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Oestrogen pollution, which comes from female contraceptive and
hormone replacement therapy drugs, has been blamed for causing a
range of disorders including sexual malfunctions in fish and a
drop in human males' sperm counts.
</P>
<P>
However, Dr Brian Eggins and his colleagues from the University
of Ulster, Northern Ireland, claimed that they have come up with a
simple and effective treatment which destroys oestrogen in the
water.
</P>
<P>
"We've discovered that if you shine an ultraviolet light on
titanium oxide, the titanium becomes activated and capable of
converting the oestrogen to carbon dioxide," Dr Eggins was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Titanium dioxide, an inert, non-toxic compound frequently used
in creams and toothpastes as a cheap white pigment, acts as a
catalyst in the treatment and is not destroyed or used up by the
ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
Dr Eggins said the new treatment also obviates the need to add
any other chemicals to the water supply to purify it. Those
chemical additives can often cause other problems further
downstream.
</P>
<P>
The researchers were optimistic that the treatment will be
effective against several other pollutants which mimic the effect
of oestrogen, especially some agriculture pesticides.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Further Mediate in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing United Nations
special envoy to Angola, Issa Diallo, held talks here Thursday
with Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Milanda about how U.N. can
continue to mediate the Angolan problem.
</P>
<P>
Diallo told reporters after the talks that he has principally
reached an agreement with the Angolan government on the problem.
However, he declined to give details of the talks saying time is
not ripe to announce anything.
</P>
<P>
He said in what form the U.N. is going to exist in Angola needs
the joint acknowledgement of the U.N. and the Angolan government.
The special envoy added that the two sides will continue to
discuss the details of this issue until a formal agreement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be finally submitted to the U.N. Security
Council for deliberation and adoption, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the strong request of the Angolan government, U.N.
peace-keeping mission in Angola declared on March 1 that it would
withdraw from Angola. But at the same time, the U.N. expressed
hopes that that it could keep a mediation agency in the war-torn
country or a similar institution that could perform the mediation
duty.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government, on the other hand, said that the U.N.
can set up such an agency but the agency should be located in UN
headquarters in New York.

<HEADLINE> New E.coli Drug Shows Promise: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A company in Canada has developed
the first drug to treat E.coli infections, according to a report
in the latest issue of New Scientist magazine.
</P>
<P>
Infection of mutant 0157 strain of the E.coli bacterium, which
releases a toxin that causes kidney failure, usually results in
gut cramps, bloody diarrhoea and life-threatening kidney damage.
</P>
<P>
The new drug, developed by Synsorb Biotech of Calgary, consists
of an inert sphere of silicon dioxide from which multiple copies
of a trisaccharide sugar molecule protrude.
</P>
<P>
These mimic the receptors on gut cells to which the bacterium's
deadly toxin binds. When patients swallow the drug, it reaches the
gut undigested and mops up the toxin.
</P>
<P>
New Scientist reported that the results of earlier trials of
the drug in Japan and Argentina have been "encouraging", although
Japanese recipients received antibiotics as well.
</P>
<P>
Only one percent of patients receiving the combination
developed haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), the stage of the
disease in which the kidney is damaged, compared with a usual rate
of 15 percent for antibiotics alone.
</P>
<P>
Intensive trials are now under way at hospitals throughout the
U.S. and Canada, the magazine said.

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- the United States said on
Thursday that some progress had been made in talks with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on obtaining access
to an alleged nuclear site.
</P>
<P>
"There has been some progress, some headway," State Department
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Rubin gave no details about the progress, only saying that
U.S. and DPRK negotiators, who have been meeting in New York for
nearly two weeks, were holding another round of talks there.
</P>
<P>
Rubin refused to predict the outcome of the talks or even
whether they would wrap up on Thursday. But some officials said
both sides had "consulted with capitals" on Wednesday, which
suggested an accord might be near.
</P>
<P>
The United States has demanded access to the construction site
at Kumchang-ri, where Washington had alleged a new nuclear reactor
complex was under way.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said U.S. relations
with the DPRK are at a critical juncture because of U.S.
suspicions about the Kumchang-ri site.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has flatly denied any new nuclear programs and
demanded compensation if Washington wants to see the site in the
Kumchang-ri.

TEHRAN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami arrived here Thursday night after concluding his three-day
state visit to Italy, the first ever to Europe by an Iranian
head of state since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Italy, Khatami appealed to the Western
nations to treat Iran and Islamic states as international equals
and called on them to follow Italy to hold dialogue and expand
relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Reaching out to the West in a fresh spirit of openness,
Khatami said the world was tired of violence and terrorism and
wanted peace based on mutual respect and justice.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his policy of detente, the Iranian president
pledged that Tehran would oppose terrorism and the spread of and
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran is not hostile toward any
country and will pursue honest and rational relations with all
nations on the basis of mutual respect and non-interference in
the internal affairs of other countries," he told Italian
leaders.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Khatami also met the Pope John Paul II at
the Vatican, renewing his call for dialogue among civilizations.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion has shown that Khatami's visit to Rome opened
a new chapter for Iran's relations with the west and defused
the U.S. efforts to isolate the Islamic state in the
international arena.

<HEADLINE> House Pushes Ahead with Debate on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Republican-dominated House
pushed ahead on thursday with a congressional debate on whether
U.S. troops should be deployed in Kosovo, despite the Clinton
administration's objection.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who called the debate, said it
was his duty as speaker "to ensure that all have opportunity to
openly debate the issue before U.S. troops are sent into a
potentially dangerous situation."
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the debate noted that parliaments in Britain and
Germany had debated the issue and that it was vital to allow the
people through their representatives, to speak before a deadline
for the peace talks end on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But Democrats strongly opposed the debate, which could end up
with a vote against sending the troops to Kosovo, saying this
would signal to both parties in the Kosovo conflict "a weakening
of U.S. resolve."
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leader Richard Gephart said that holding the
debate now was the "height of irresponsibility." "We all know we
are at a very delicate moment in the Kosovo peace negotiations,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be debating this matter while our diplomats at
this moment are seeking to convince the parties to this conflict
to lay down their weapons and choose the path of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how a vote on deploying the troops would
come out.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's President Daniel arap
Moi launched a 16-year poverty relief blueprint Thursday, which
aims at helping 13 million Kenyans who live under poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The "National Poverty Eradication Plan 1999-2015'' is designed
to improve social integration and access to essential services
such as education, housing, basic health and safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Moi emphasized that it would take universal sacrifice to remove
poverty from Kenya, when addressing a meeting of politicians,
civil servants, business people and aid workers on the outskirts
of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven percent of Kenya's 29 million people live below the
East African country's poverty line of half a U.S. dollar a day
per person. The international poverty line usually stands at one
dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
"Some 13.2 million people in Kenya cannot provide themselves a
decent meal, shelter or education for their children,'' Moi said.
"Unless we all work sincerely to resolve the problems that exist,
they will continue.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marine Jet Missing in Air Force Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Marine Corps jet
disappeared on a training mission and a search was under way for
the sole crew member in Alaska State of the United States, Air
Force officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the Marine Corps F/A-18C Hornet fighter was
participating in Northern Edge, a joint military training
exercise, when it was reported missing Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The jet was one of two flying from Eielson Air Force Base near
Fairbanks. The other jet returned safely to Eielson, as planned.
</P>
<P>
Even after daylight arrived, snow and gusty winds were
hampering search efforts and kept all but two Army helicopters
grounded, spokeswoman Angel Newman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At least one of the helicopters was sent to an area north of
Mount Deborah Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Newman said the military has not received reports of smoke,
wreckage or the sounds of a crash. The area where the plane
disappeared is a sparsely populated region of the Alaska Range
adjacent to Fort Greely, an Army post.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mortgage Rates Soar to 10-month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The average interest rate on
30-year fixed-rate mortgages, a key factor affecting the housing
market of the United States, has risen to the highest level in 10
months.
</P>
<P>
Freddie Mac, a mortgage company, reported on Thursday that the
average rate has kept rising for a sixth consecutive week, to 7.11
percent this week, the highest since mid-May last year.
</P>
<P>
The average was up from 7.06 percent last week and marked a
significantly higher level than the 6.74 percent average at the
end of January.
</P>
<P>
The average reached a 31-year low of 6.49 percent in early
October as worried world investors poured money into U.S.
financial markets. Economists attribute the recent climb to strong
demand in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,
averaged 6.75 percent this week, also the highest since mid-May
and up from 6.70 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 5.88 percent, up from 5.74 percent the
previous week and the highest in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which
averaged 0.8 percent of the loan amount for each type of mortgage.

<HEADLINE> Violin Virtuoso Yehudi Menuhin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Violinist Sir Yehudi Menuhin, a
renowned interpreter of classical and modern music, has died in a
Berlin hospital of heart failure, aged 82.
</P>
<P>
Sir Yehudi died three days after canceling a concert because of
an unspecified health problem, BBC quoted Berlin concert promoter
Jutta Adler as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an official at the Yehudi Menuhin School in southern
England said by telephone that "his daughter called us up two
hours ago to say he had passed away this morning in Berlin,"
according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
Menuhin was born in New York of Russian immigrant parents, but
became a naturalized Briton in 1985 and was knighted two years
later. He was made a life peer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
During his unusually long career he gave countless concerts
around the world, although recently he devoted more of his time to
teaching and conducting.
</P>
<P>
Also, he made numerous recordings, published several memoirs,
such as his passionate 1977 autobiography entitled "Unfinished
Journey," and made documentary music films in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
He was a child prodigy who astonished a San Francisco audience
in 1924 at the age of seven with a debut violin performance that
was by all accounts brilliant for a violinist at any age.
</P>
<P>
In one famous incident, at his first concert in Berlin, a few
days short of his 13th birthday, Albert Einstein followed Sir
Yehudi backstage, hugged him and declared: "Now I know there is a
God in heaven!"

<HEADLINE> Six Tons of Drugs Confiscated in Yunnan Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Drug control officials said here
today that they confiscated 6,184 kilograms of drugs and seized 31
drug trafficking suspects in southwest China's Yunnan Province
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with an anti-drug meeting here today, an
average of 25 drug trafficking cases were uncovered every day last
year along the province's 4,060-kilometer-long border with Myanmar,
Laos and Viet Nam, the notorious drug-growing "Golden Triangle"
region encompassing the border areas of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
This shows that China's reinforced anti-drug campaign in this
southwestern area has dealt drug dealers a hard blow, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan took the lead in the country by setting up 17 drug-
control agencies last year, comprising 116 police squads made up
of 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Pino Arlacchi, head of the United Nations Drug Control Program,
said during his inspection tour of Yunnan at the end of last year
that he was deeply impressed by Yunnan's achievements in drug
control and the rehabilitation of drug addicts.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes New German Finance Minister's Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Friday welcomed the
swift nomination of Hans Eichel as Germany's new finance minister.
</P>
<P>
We welcome the fact that Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has acted
decisively to replace Mr. Lafontaine, a spokesman for Prime
Minister Tony Blair told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the resignation of Lafontaine was a matter
for Germany and Britain had no further comments to make on that
issue.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Lafontaine's departure removes a major
stumbling block to Blair's campaign to sell the virtues of closer
ties with Europe to a skeptical British public.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine's views on greater tax harmonization across Europe
were thought to be in strong opposition to Britain's bid to enter
into the European single currency, and so he was widely criticized
in the British anti-EU press.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the possibility of Lafontaine running for
president of the European Commission, the spokesman gave a
cautious response.
</P>
<P>
"The senior post at the commission will be sorted out in the
normal way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair is scheduled to meet Schroeder for talks next Tuesday in
London as part of Germany's tour around Europe ahead of a European
summit in Berlin later this month.
</P>
<P>
Germany holds the rotating six-month European Union presidency.
</P>
<P>
Although the talks will mostly focus on budget reforms, it is
expected that Schroeder and Blair would finalize a joint policy
document on their vision for the future of Europe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Fall 0.4 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Friday that producer price index for finished foods fell a
seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in February, the most in 13
months.
</P>
<P>
February's drop, compared with a 0.5 percent increase in
January and a 0.4 percent increase in December, showed that
inflation pressures in the production process can scarcely be
found.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said inflation's tameness is behind Wall Street's
belief that the Federal Reserve is not in a hurry to increase
interest rates, despite unexpectedly strong economic growth so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
Last month's producer price decline reflected drops of 1.4
percent for food, the most since July 1982, and 1 percent for
energy. Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components
were unchanged after edging down 0.1 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Outside food and energy, car prices fell 0.3 percent, though
light trucks rose 0.4 percent. Clothing prices fell overall, too.
And computers fell 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prescription drug prices, however, jumped 0.8 percent and have
risen 20.6 percent over the past year. Prices in one often
troublesome area, tobacco, were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Prices earlier in the production process also were well
behaved. They fell 0.5 percent for intermediate goods and 3.4
percent for crude goods.

BELGRADE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Deputy Premier Vuk
Draskovic and visiting Greek Foreign Minister Jorgos Papandreau
agreed Friday that the Kosovo issue should be resolved by peaceful
means and on the basis of full equality of all citizens in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic and Papandreau displayed their agreement at a
briefing after their meeting during which the visitor expressed
his belief that the solution to the Kosovo issue will be confirmed
by the text of the political agreement in the continuation of the
peace talks in Paris starting next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister said that the implementation of the
political agreement must be in conformity with the sovereignty of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and international law.
</P>
<P>
He said during the meeting that the main task of implementation
was the disarming of the Kosovo Liberation Army formed by the
ethnic Albanians and that once the political agreement is signed,
the sanctions against Yugoslavia must be lifted and Yugoslavia's
full membership renewed in all international organizations,
according to sources close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav deputy premier told the visitor that Kosovo is the
founding stone of Serbia and a spiritual source for the Serbian
people.
</P>
<P>
"A political agreement must clearly guarantee that Kosovo
remains within Serbia," said the deputy premier.

<HEADLINE> HK Insurers' Performance Indicators Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Over half of Hong Kong's total
population of 6.8 million have their life insured with their
growing insurance consciousness and steadily increasing individual
life business.
</P>
<P>
Alan Wong, Commissioner of Insurance, revealed at a press
conference here today that the number of individual life policies
had increased to 3.4 million by the end of 1997, covering about 53
percent of the population, up from a penetration rate of 50
percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed the first-ever released insurers' performance
indicators in the 1998 Annual Report of the Office of the
Commissioner of Insurance and the Registrar of Occupational
Retirement Schemes published today.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the insurance industry as a whole suffered a lesser
blow than other financial services sectors in Hong Kong, total
gross premiums grew by 12 percent to 52 billion HK dollars (6.66
billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, compared with six percent in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the industry's performance in 1998, Wong said the
long term insurance business sector including life and annuity,
marriage and birth, permanent health, tontines and retirement
scheme management remained robust for that year based on the
previous year's 17 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, office premiums for new individual life business
increased by 17 percent to 7.3 billion HK dollars (935.89 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the Asian financial turmoil began to negatively impact
the general insurance industry including accident, sickness, land
vehicles, aircraft, ships, fire and natural forces, and damage to
property in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the unaudited quarterly returns submitted by
insurers, gross premiums of general business recorded a drop of
eight percent to 18 billion HK dollars (2.3 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The performance for general insurance business continued to
deteriorate in 1998 with underwriting loss increased from 59
million HK dollars (7.56 million U.S. dollars) to provisionally
797 million HK dollars (102 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The increase in loss was mainly attributable to the
deteriorated claims experience with net claims incurred ratio
increased from 56 percent in 1997 to 61 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that the disclosure of the business statistics of
individual insurers in the 1998 Annual Report was a major
initiative taken by the Insurance Authority to enhance the
transparency of the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that greater transparency is in the interests
of both the insurance industry and the insuring public, and is
necessary for maintaining the systemic stability of the industry
and the status of Hong Kong as a regional insurance center," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To further enhance the transparency of the insurance market, he
said the Insurance Authority will commence releasing the latest
industry to the public.
</P>
<P>
These statistics will be released through the Internet on a
quarterly basis starting from the first quarter of 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Year 2000 readiness of the insurance industry,
Wong revealed that based on the regular returns submitted by
insurers, 78 percent of the insurers were already compliant by the
end of January, 1999.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that 16 percent would be compliant by the end
of this quarter and the remaining by the end of the second quarter,
he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Mediator for Kosovo Confident About Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union mediator for
Kosovo, Austrian diplomat Wolfgang Petritsch, expressed his
confidence on Friday that a compromise will be reached at the
forthcoming conference on Kosovo in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"The auspices cannot be the best, but those who deal with
conflicts in the Balkans are used to it," he said during a seminar
on Kosovo organized by the Council of Europe in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He expected Serbs and Kosovo Albanians to make their
compromises in the last minute of the conference.
</P>
<P>
"Positive decisions are always made in an ungracious way." he
said.
</P>
<P>
Petritsch is one of three international mediators at the
Rambouillet talks. The other two are American Chris Hill and
Russian Boris Mayorski.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that in the end, reason will prevail. We will find a
way which does not violate the basic principles of the draft
agreement, but which could accommodate the Yugoslav side," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the new conference will be "very brief" and there will
not be another conference.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear there will be no new sessions of talks on the
draft agreement. But there will be time, a few days at most, for
discussing the implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Serb and Kosovo ethnic Albanian delegates will return to France
on Monday to finalize the peace plan proposed by the six-nation
Contact Group, which will give Kosovo substantial autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be focused on how to implement autonomy in
Kosovo and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force
there.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade is strongly opposed to the deployment of foreign
troops in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Overhaul Customs Tariff Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is planning
to overhaul the whole structure of the customs tariff system to
enhance the country's competitiveness and strengthen key sectors
such as agriculture, industry and services, a senior Thai Finance
Ministry official announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Charnchai Musiknisakorn, deputy director-general of the Fiscal
Policy Office said that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda had
ordered the setting up of a committee to study the all-out
restructuring of the country's customs tariff system.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprises of officials from agencies concerned,
as well as legal advisors and representatives from the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
The multi-sectoral panel would reclassify goods and services
into 10 product groups, namely non-processed farm products,
processed farm products, ore products, mineral products,
jewelries, chemical products, textiles, garments, plastic products
and rubber products.
</P>
<P>
The committee would then recatergorize the classified products
into four groups based on their production processes, including
raw materials, primary goods, intermediate goods, and finished
goods before setting appropriate tariff rates for the whole
framework.
</P>
<P>
Key objectives of the all-out restructuring were to improve
Thailand's business competitiveness, and regenerate agricultural,
industrial and service sectors after the country was hit in
mid-1997 by its worst economic crisis in decades.

<HEADLINE> Court and Procuratorate Reports Draw Positive Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The separate work reports by the
Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate,
especially the parts on their rectification campaigns to fight
internal corruption, have won the applause from deputies to the
current session of the Ninth National People's Congress(NPC).
</P>
<P>
However, some deputies from southern Guangdong Province said
that the anti-corruption drive are merely at their initial stage
and need to be intensified. They hold that the work of courts and
procuratorates should be more standardized and systematic.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, local courts and procuratorates improved their work by
paying greater attention to public opinions and punishing some
wrongdoings, but their rectification efforts should not be over-
estimated, Ye Xionggan, vice-chairman of the provincial committee
of the Jiu San Society, one of the eight non-communist parties in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The deputy said that the NPC should further their supervision
over the activities of courts and procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
Wu Guangqiu, head of the Humen Hospital in Dongguan City,
Guangdong, said it takes time to improve the quality and
capability of court officials and procurators. Things will change
if more efforts are made, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shurong, a teacher from a university, is satisfied with
the reports she receives each month on the work of local courts
and procuratorates.

KATHMANDU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Home Minister Govind Raj
Joshi said here Friday that the government will take strong and
legal actions against those who try to create disturbances during
the May elections.
</P>
<P>
No stone will be left unturned to make the security arrangement
for the May election to the House of Representatives, he told a
press conference held at the Home Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will cooperate with the Election
Commission in all election-related activities and is committed to
conducting the election in a free and fair manner.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that as the police force is inadequate, four
mobile army teams will be used in each of the 27 very sensitive
constituencies and two mobile army teams in each of the remaining
178 constituencies all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters will be used during the election which will be held
in two phases on May 3 and May 17, and communications among the
security personnel will be made effective, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> French Greens Leader Confident About German Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the French Greens,
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, said on Friday that the resignation of German
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine was only "a change of method"
for the German government but not a change of policy.
</P>
<P>
"I think today it is rather a change of method that will take
place. The method of Lafontaine was very hard, brutal, and it is
for that the markets have reacted," Cohn-Bendit said in a
television interview.
</P>
<P>
"What he (Gerhard Schroeder) has said is that he wants to
change the method. He wants to find consensus, but this will not
be at the expense of social policy, nor at the expense of
environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The German finance minister resigned from his government post,
the chairmanship of the ruling Social Democratic Party, and his
parliamentary mandate on Thursday after Schroeder accused him of
making "a strategic mistake" when dealing with the German energy
industry.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no more aggravation of the crisis now. I think
and I hope that the coalition in Germany will be capable of giving
new dynamics to the economic and social reform policy which is
needed in Germany and in Europe," said Cohn-Bendit.
</P>
<P>
Cohn-Bendit was elected to the European Parliament on the list
of the German Greens in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He will lead the list of the French Greens in the European
elections on June 13.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A gas well in the western
Bombay plateau, about 1,400 kilometers southwest of here, caught
fire Friday afternoon, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
An uncontrolled flow of gas, which began at 09:30 local time on
Thursday from a well numbering "B-121-D," started spewing fire
from 12:20 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
The flow of gas was connected to other five platforms
comprising well nearby, PTI said, quoting a spokesman of the Oil
and Natural Gas Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that three multi-support vessels were put
into service Thursday and were spraying water on the burning well
to curtain the fire.
</P>
<P>
Two experts from M/S CUDD Well Control Company, an
international firm on well control and fire control, had been
summoned and were expected to arrive to the scene Saturday,
according to PTI.
</P>
<P>
The B-121 platform, which produces 2 million cubic meters of
gas per day, was shut down for maintenance work two weeks ago,
said PTI.

<HEADLINE> Japan Teachers Union Opposes Flag, Anthem Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Japan Teachers Union on Friday
adopted a resolution opposing the legal recognition "without
national consensus" of Japan's national flag and anthem, Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted at a regular meeting of the 380,000-
member union's central committee, said the union is opposed to
legally recognizing the Hinomaru (Rising Sun) flag and Kimigayo (
His Majesty's Reign) anthem unless there is consent among the
Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
The resolution came at a time when the Japanese government
decided to study legislation to officially recognize the Hinomaru
and Kimigayo as national symbols.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government made the decision after a high school
principal in Hiroshima Prefecture committed suicide February 28
apparently over whether the Kimigayo be sung at his high school's
graduation ceremony. The principal received an order from the
prefectural education board asking the Kimigayo be sung, but faced
strong opposition from teachers.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Education Ministry issued an instruction in 1989 saying
the flag must be raised and the anthem sung at school ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
The question of whether to recognize the flag and the anthem
has been a sensitive issue in Japan because of their close links
to the country's emperor system and militarism during World War II.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Artists Recounts Artistic Crusade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Nyima Tsering, the official
artist for the 10th Panchen Lama, vividly remembers his solo art
exhibition tour of Great Britain and how a British composer
requested permission to compose a symphony inspired by his
painting entitled "Dream".
</P>
<P>
Nyima said the symphony provided new inspiration for his work.
One Manchester resident commented the inspiration was obvious in
the painting's soul-striking three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
The artist's collection of "New Tibetan Paintings" is included
in the ongoing Tibetan Cultural Exhibition at the Beijing
Exhibition Center. Nyima's works have been exhibited in a number
of countries, including the United States, India, Austria,
Switzerland and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Nyima graduated from the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts in 1962.
The accomplished artist encountered a virtual sea of Chinese
paintings and modern western art which led him to belittle
traditional Tibetan paintings based on the major theme of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
The gradual loss of any sense of his roots forced Nyima to
meditate on his cultural heritage. Tibetan culture is based on the
spectacular outlook Tibetans retain concerning life and death, as
well as man and nature. Traditional Tibetan painting is the
embodiment of the ethnic group's beliefs and thus contains
everlasting charm in terms of both religion and art.
</P>
<P>
Nyima is haunted by the fact so many urbanites rush to the snow-
covered "Roof of the World" to escape the forest of skyscrapers in
which they live. He attributes the phenomenon to Tibet's harmony
between man and nature, as well the inner tranquillity and
happiness Tibetans gain from their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a philosopher, but nonetheless I like to use my brush
to record the ethnic group's profound thinking concerning the
outside world," said Nyima.
</P>
<P>
The artist spent more than 10 years studying the countless
legacies of traditional Tibetan paintings. Nyima is awed by the
fact that the treasure-trove of traditional art belongs to the
entire world.
</P>
<P>
The brilliant colors, eternal theme and the emotional character
of traditional painting contributes greatly to Nyima's artistic
endeavor to combine traditional and modern art. He is fully aware
of the long journey through the past and the vast potential ahead.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Army Building (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under the current conditions of an insufficient defense
spending, it is necessary to readjust the army structure and
develop a way of army modernization which costs less but works
better, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the improvement of army quality must be based
on the advancement of science and technology, which can be applied
not only in developing advanced arms and equipment, but also in
promoting military training and education and enhancing logistics
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader went on to say that as China is making
active efforts to endorse the principle of "governing the country
according to law", it is also necessary to promote the concept of
"governing the army according to law".
</P>
<P>
"Governing the army according to law means that we must take a
resolute stand in safeguarding the authority and seriousness of
all military laws and regulations, which have provided a legal
foundation for our army building efforts," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be made to improve the ability of leading
officials at all levels in the army to handle affairs in
accordance with the law, as well as help them to learn how to use
relevant laws and regulations to educate, guide and manage the
troops, he added.
</P>
<P>
The President finally highlighted the necessity to step up
efforts in selecting and fostering outstanding young officials, so
as to "provide a strong organizational guarantee" for the army's
development at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
"We also need to readjust and reform the existing personnel
system within the army and establish a mechanism which enables all
outstanding young cadres to show themselves," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
PLA generals including Zhang Wannian, Chi Haotian and Fu
Quanyou attended the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today stressed the importance of safeguarding the Party's absolute
leadership over the army, as well as the necessity to focus on
quality improvement in army building.
</P>
<P>
"Upholding the Party's absolute leadership over the army and
preserving the nature of the people's army is a fundamental issue
which we must always pay close attention to and work hard for,"
Jiang told the People's Liberation Army (PLA) delegation to the
ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC), China's top legislature, at a meeting with PLA NPC deputies
here today.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee the absolute leadership of the Party, top
priority must be given to the political and ideological work in
army building, said Jiang, also general-secretary of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central
Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that many major events will take place in China this
year, and the work of maintaining social stability has become all
the more important.
</P>
<P>
Calling the PLA a "strong pillar for the people's democratic
dictatorship", he urged Party committees and leading bodies at all
levels in the PLA to pay close attention to the development and
changes of both domestic and global situations and take effective
measures to maintain the army's stability through "powerful
ideological education and strict management".
</P>
<P>
"We must guide the broad masses of officers and soldiers to
enhance confidence in the reform, take a correct attitude toward
interests readjustments in various reforms, and contribute to the
great cause of reform through concrete action," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the President, it is a fundamental guiding
principle for the modernization efforts of the PLA to concentrate
on improving the quality of the army.
</P>
<P>
"Since the early 1980s, our army has undergone several major
cuts, with the number of troops sharply reduced," said Jiang. "Now
a major task for us is to strive to improve the troops' quality
and combat effectiveness."

<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, March 12 (Xinhua) -- German Federal Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder named the Hesse state premier, Hans Eichel, as finance
minister on Friday to replace Oscar Lafontaine, who surprisingly
resigned on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Scroeder will formally recommend Eichel to parliamentary group
of his Social Democratic Party (SPD), government spokesman Uwe-
Karsten Heye said, adding that Eichel will take up his new post
after his term in Hesse ends on April 7.
</P>
<P>
Eichel has headed since 1991 in Hesse a coalition government,
which was defeated by the opposition conservatives in state
election last month.
</P>
<P>
The defeat was more due to crushing support loss of the Greens
Party, junior partner in Eichel's coalition.
</P>
<P>
Eichel, a former history and German teacher coming from the
left wing of SPD, is well-known as a astute finance expert, tough
negotiator and hard-working official.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Role of People's Congress Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Li Peng
today urged all deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top lawmaking body, and to local people's congresses at
all levels to strengthen supervision and assume a more significant
role in promoting the enforcement of various laws and the process
of governing the country according to law.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee and also a Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee, made these remarks here today during a
panel discussion with NPC deputies from southwest China's Sichuan
Province attending the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
"There are a total of more than three million local deputies to
the NPC and various local people's congresses in China, and
further efforts must be made to give full play to their role,"
said Li.
</P>
<P>
Apart from performing their duties and discussing state and
government affairs during the annual full sessions, people's
congress deputies should also play an important role after the
sessions end, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the Standing Committee of the Ninth NPC in the
past year has achieved remarkable success in its legislative and
supervisory work, but this is still far from enough compared with
the duties and responsibilities the NPC has been bestowed with by
China's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The supervisory work is a weak point in the work of people's
congresses, and further efforts are needed to improve supervision,
" he said, adding that equal emphasis must be laid on legislation
and supervision.
</P>
<P>
Li also expressed his views on a draft contract law which has
been submitted to the current NPC session for deliberation.
</P>
<P>
"This draft has been examined by the Ninth NPC Standing
Committee for four times," he noted. "Of course, the current
version is still imperfect and will need revisions according to
developments in practice even if it is adopted this time."
</P>
<P>
Before Li speaking, some Sichuan NPC deputies voiced their
opinions on a variety of issues including law-enforcement
examinations and promotion of judicial justice.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee Friday urged news media to shun maximization of
commercial gains to pursue laudable objectives of high
journalistic and ethical standards.
</P>

Inaugurating a seminar to celebrate the founding of the Press
Trust of India (PTI) 50 years ago, Vajpayee said that the media
has the task of ensuring community spirit among people for their
participation in the process of political, economic and social
changes.
</P>
<P>
PTI won independence in March 1949 from Reuters, which had
controlled the news media in the country during the British
colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Journalists should seek to bring order to information chaos,
explain the enormous social and economic changes and above all,
set high journalistic and ethical standards, Vajpayee said at a
seminar on Information.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday Indian President K. R. Narayanan released a postage
stamp for the golden jubilee of PTI, India's first news agency
after independence.

exhibition, which presents 40 photographs featuring events from
India's nascent days as a nation to the recent opening of bus
service to Lahore, Pakistan.

both internal and international politics open, responsive and
accountable.

Hasina said mass media today played a very important role in not
only disseminating news and views but also cementing good

<HEADLINE> China Never Changes Stand on Its WTO Entry: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Shi Guangsheng, minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said here today that China
has never changed its stand and attitude on the matter of its
entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"We want to enjoy the rights of a WTO member as a developing
nation while also undertaking corresponding obligations of that
organization," said Shi at a press conference sponsored by the
ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
China's top legislature, this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that 13 years have elapsed since China, as a
developing country, first applied for the restoration of its
membership of the General Agreement of Trade and Tariffs (GATT)
and then applied to become a member of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into WTO is the need of both China and the WTO,
the minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As a new round of WTO negotiations will begin in the year 2000,
China is facing a major opportunity for its entry into the
organization, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has constantly held negotiations with major
WTO members such as the United States and the European Union in
order to reach agreements with them as early as possible and
achieve an early entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the recent negotiations between China
and the United States were "very constructive" and achieved very
important progress in market accession, accession protocol and the
agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
Shi also conceded that major differences remain, "because their
demands have greatly overwhelmed China's capability." But the
parties involved are working to seek resolutions to these
differences, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about whether China will make any "
big concessions" for its WTO entry, the minister said that he
believes "both sides" of the negotiations should "make concerted
efforts" for the issue.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Minister Lauds Amman-Cairo Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Culture and
Information Nasser Lawzi on Friday termed the Jordanian-Egyptian
ties as deep and close at all levels.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio, Lawzi said
Jordan and Egypt maintain special ties on the issues relating to
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries which have
signed peace treaties with Israel. The two Arab countries are
active and key mediators in the peace talks between the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian leadership is seeking various ways to further
enhance its relations with other Arab countries, Egypt in
particular, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah is to visit Egypt soon for talks on
issues of mutual interest, including the peace talks between the
Palestinians and Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian, Egyptian and Palestinian foreign ministers will also
meet soon in Jordan's capital of Amman to rally support for the
Palestinians prior to a visit by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to Washington later this month, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
stalled since last December due to Israel's failure to carry out
the Wye peace agreement signed last October in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has announced that he would declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 when the five-year Palestinian interim
self-rule enshrined in the 1993 Oslo Accord expires regardless of
the result of the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He is now trying to win support for the declaration of the
Palestinian state from the international community, especially
that of the United States and European countries.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan should join the World
Trade Organization (WTO) after the Chinese mainland, Shi
Guangsheng, Chinese minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a press conference sponsored by the
ongoing session of the Ninth National People's Congress, the
minister said that back in 1992, GATT made a council chairman
statement, saying that China as a sovereign state should join the
WTO first and Taiwan as a separate customs territory of China
should only join WT0 after the Chinese mainland joins the
organization.
</P>
<P>
To develop cross-strait trade and economic relations and
realize the "three direct services" has long been the objective of
the Chinese mainland, Shi said, adding that it serves the economic
interests of both sides of the Taiwan straits.
</P>
<P>
"However, so far we are only able to do indirect trade because
of the various restrictions imposed by the Taiwan authorities," he
said. "We hope to realize direct trade between the two sides of
the straits at an early date," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Israeli Defense Ministers Discuss Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen and his Israeli counterpart Moshe Arens Friday discussed
ways of enhancing military cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting in the Israeli Defense Ministry in Tel
Aviv, the two discussed the joint funding for a third Arrow 2
anti-ballistic missile battery and sales of U.S. jet fighters to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel asked the U.S. in February last year to expand the
Arrow anti-missile defense system worth 1.6 billion U.S. dollars
from two batteries to three.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Israel last April, Cohen said the
U.S. would fund research and development for a third Arrow 2
battery.
</P>
<P>
In February, Israel raised its stakes in its tender for
U.S. jet fighters, telling Lockheed Martin and Boeing that it
would spend up to 4 billion U.S. dollars on the order expected to
be awarded by the middle of the year. It had originally said it
had about 2.5 billion to spend on new planes.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived in Israel Thursday, was on his final leg of
a nine-nation tour of the region, which was designed to shore up
Arab support for the U.S. policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday,
Cohen reassured Israel that while selling new weapons to Arab
countries such as Egypt, Washington remains committed to Israel's
qualitative edge in military capability.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Arens, Cohen also urged the Israeli
government to implement the Wye agreement it signed with the
Palestinians last October.
</P>
<P>
Washington has expressed its disappointment over Israel's
failure to carry out the agreement, which was frozen by Netanyahu
last December citing alleged Palestinian violations.

<HEADLINE> China Introduces Anti-Piracy Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The China Software Association (
CSA) today introduced new anti-piracy technology to Chinese
software producers, a move to add to the government efforts to
protection intellectual property right.
</P>
<P>
The new technology -- DiscGuard -- was developed by the US-
based TTR Company. DiscGuard, which reportedly offers one of most
effective means to prevent pirating of CD-ROM (read only memory)
software, cannot be decoded, according to one CSA official.
</P>
<P>
CD-ROM is widely used by software producers worldwide and is
highly vulnerable to pirating. DiscGuard technology involves
inserting unique fingerprints to CD-ROM in order to effectively
prevent illegal duplication and applications of CD-ROM software.
</P>
<P>
China's software industry has registered a 30 percent annual
growth rate for a straight ten years. The software market is
expected to hit 100 billion yuan (12.3 billion U.S. dollars) by
2010, when the sector will emerge as one of the nation's pillar
industries.
</P>
<P>
The Copyright Administration Bureau introduced a plan to
establish a nationwide anti-piracy system in January last year.
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials note that introducing advanced anti-piracy and
copyright authentication technology from abroad will substantially
strengthen the national campaign to prevent CD pirating.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from China's major software producers,
including Legend, Founder and Tongfang, attended a press
conference held to introduce the new anti-piracy technology.

<HEADLINE> China to Build A More Prosperous Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China has made a plan to
revitalize the areas along the ancient Silk Road in an effort to
make the western part of the country a prosperous region.
</P>
<P>
The plan will involve the use of 11.8 billion yuan (some 1.4
billion U.S. dollars) in the coming five years in the Hexi
Corridor, a 270,000-sq-kilometer area west to the Yellow River
which is home to the majority of China's Muslim people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese top leaders have shown great concern towards the new
strategy. At the on-going NPC session premier Zhu Rongji has said
that the western part will be given some preferential policies so
that these areas can develop more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Wen Jiabao also said at the session that the move
is vital to the development of rural economy, which will lead to
the take-off of the poverty-stricken northwestern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Zhaolong, deputy Party secretary of the Gansu provincial
committee, a major province in the Hexi corridor, noted that the
program, which has already been carried out in many parts of the
province, will lead to the launch of a dozen of projects aiming at
saving water, industrializing the agricultural sector, building
high-tech agriculture, and improving the environment.
</P>
<P>
Zhong, a deputy to the current NPC session, said that the area
will become a major grain, vegetable, cotton and meat production
center if the program goes smoothly. Its economic strength will
double in the early 21st century and people's income can grow
remarkably when the plan comes to an end, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Silk Road was an economic route linking China with the mid-
Asia and Europe several hundred years ago. Its importance waned
after sea routes were developed and the environment deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
The Hexi Corridor, which stretches through Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, Qinghai province and Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, is the throat of the traditional route and a vital section
of the Asia-Europe Continental Bridge, an international railway
under construction.
</P>
<P>
Zhong said that the strategically-important region is abundant
in natural resources, including oil, steel and nickel, and it is
the home to one of China's major satellite launch centers.
</P>
<P>
However, it is industrially and agriculturally underdeveloped,
thus hindering China's overall economic development.
</P>
<P>
Actually, China has shifted its focus to the development of the
western part several years ago. Projects of water conservancy,
environmental protection and energy and transportation have been
set up in the region.
</P>
<P>
The economy growth in the region exceeded the national average
last year, Zhong said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Real GDP Shrinks 0.8 Percent in October-December Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's gross domestic product (GDP)
in the fourth quarter of 1998 shrank by a preliminary 0.8 percent
from the previous quarter in real terms, or declined annually by 3.
2 percent, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The contraction marks the fifth consecutive quarterly fall. It
is the first time that Japan's GDP has declined for five straight
quarters since the Japanese agency began collecting data by the
present method in 1955.
</P>
<P>
Japan's GDP contracted by a revised 0.3 percent in the July-
September quarter, 0.7 percent in the April-June period, 1.2
percent in the January-March term, and 0.9 percent in the October-
December quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The shrinkage in the latest reporting quarter, which was worse
than the average 0.4 percent contraction forecast by Japanese
economists, kept the world's second largest economy mired in its
deepest recession since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
For the October-December period, the 5.7 percent drop from the
previous quarter in corporate capital spending was the main reason
for the retreat, resulting in a 0.9 percent fall in GDP, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The 5.7 percent fall in plant an equipment investment was the
third largest decline ever.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption, which accounts for some 60 percent of the
GDP aggregate, sagged 0.1 percent as in the previous two quarters.
</P>
<P>
Housing investment nose-dived 7.0 percent, following a decline
of 6.1 percent in the previous quarter, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
GDP measures the value of goods and services produced within a
nation. Real GDP figures are adjusted for inflation and seasonal
variations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the GDP data, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary
Hiromu Nonaka said the contraction of the GDP for five consecutive
quarters reflects the "severe state" of the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The top Japanese government spokesman, however, said he is
beginning to see some bright spots and that he expects the economy
to pick up through various stimulus measures taken by the
government.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Sinks After Failed Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar deflated
like a balloon with a slow leak Friday due to lack of staying
power.
</P>
<P>
It closed at 63.42 U.S. cents, more than a quarter of a U.S.
cent lower than Thursday night's finish of 63.68.
</P>
<P>
Concerns over the local currency's inability to push above the
63.93 U.S. cents region weighed heavily on the market and worked
against the Australian dollar over the course of the session.
</P>
<P>
During the day the Australian dollar traded between 63.34 and
63.83 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said he expects
imports grew 1.7 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
"The data will provide pivotal to views on whether economic
strength is continuing or if there are signs of slippage," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank economists said the Australian dollar is
expected to consolidate in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
"With a domestic rate cut not on the immediate horizon, the
Australian dollar will take strength from world commodity markets,
which are showing their most positive signs in months," they
believed.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that the period of economic recovery for the Philippines
"will be relatively short."
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican told reporters while the
country's growth rate in 1999 would be below potential, it would
be significantly higher than those of its Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic reforms implemented by the government
would help ensure that the Philippines makes full use of its head
start.
</P>
<P>
"While the country's recovery is still unfolding, the recovery
period will be relatively short," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country's economy in 1999 would be
significantly better than 1998, as shown by the 22 percent growth
in the export sector in January 1999 as compared to the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, he added, is expected to grow by 3 percent this
year, as against a 6.6-percent contraction in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, U.S. to Discuss Nuclear Technology Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A seven-member U.S. delegation
of customs experts will arrive here next Monday to hold talks with
the Pakistani authorities on export control of nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
During its six-day visit to Pakistan, the delegation will hold
talks with senior officials of the Central Bureau of Revenue and
the Ministry of Commerce to get to know the details on procedures
being followed by the Customs of Pakistan, sources from the
Foreign Office said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also go to Lahore, capital of Punjab
province, Peshawar, capital of the North West Frontier Province,
and the southern port city of Karachi, capital of Sindh province,
to see how the procedures are being followed by the Customs of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani side will apprise the delegation of the rules and
regulations in this regard, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the basic purpose of the delegation's visit is
to see implementation of the procedures being pursued by the
Customs.
</P>
<P>
This visit will be a follow-up to the first round of talks held
last year between Pakistan and the United States at the experts
level on the export control of sensitive technology.
</P>
<P>
Since India and Pakistan conducted their nuclear tests last
May, the United States and other western countries have called for
tightened control to check export of sensitive technology and
urged both India and Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is open to suggestions, the sources said, provided
these are relevant to its system.
</P>
<P>
A European Union delegation also held talks last Wednesday with
Pakistani officials from the Foreign Office on export control of
sensitive technology and offered cooperation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan will keep its export control measures under constant
review and will further tighten them in pursuance of its
unilateral commitment," the EU delegation was told by the
Pakistani side.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has categorically stated that it was forced to test
nuclear devices under its security compulsions and it would not
transfer nuclear technology.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Give Indonesia 669m U.S. Dollars of Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government is
extending 669 million U.S. dollars in soft loans to Indonesia as
part of its "New Miyazawa Initiative," Foreign Ministry sources
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The loans, to be disbursed over a period of three years, will
help finance Indonesia's social safety net program and its health
and nutrition development program, said the diplomatic notes
signed here Friday by the two sides.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Says "Air Armada" Ready to Strike Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO supreme commander General
Wesley Clark on Friday warned Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that the military alliance had a "vast air armada" ready
to strike Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I think Milosevic has to understand that NATO does have the
capability and means to make a very devastating series of attacks
against him should that be required," Clark told BBC radio in
London.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has repeatedly
said it is ready to strike the Serbian military sites in Kosovo if
Belgrade continues to block a peace deal in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
"What we're talking about is using a vast air armada that's
already assembled and standing by," Clark said. "The intent is
that the troops go in at the invitation of both parties."
</P>
<P>
NATO is currently gathering up about 28,000 peacekeeping forces
for Kosovo in neighboring Macedonia, which the West believes is
essential to ensure peace in the province, where 90 percent of the
population is ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the ethnic Albanians and the government in
Kosovo are due to resume in Paris on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry parties had held talks last month but failed to
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group on former Yugoslavia initiated a peace
agreement last year for the parties to consider, promising the
ethnic Albanians substantial autonomy.
</P>
<P>
But both the Albanians and the Yugoslav government were not
satisfied by the deal and said they are not ready to sign it.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov meets Milosevic later on
Friday for talks the West hopes will help secure the concessions
needed for a Kosovo peace deal that Western envoys have so far
failed to win.
</P>
<P>
Moscow remains opposed to the idea that Belgrade should be
forced to accept Western troops.
</P>
<P>
In the last days, several Western envoys failed to persuade the
Yugoslav leader to drop his objections to NATO troops being
stationed in Kosovo -- a key part of the deal initiated by the
Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
Western hopes of putting maximum pressure on Milosevic have
also been undermined by the refusal of the Kosovo Liberation Army
to sign the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the ethnic Albanians had promised former United
States Senator Bob Dole that they will sign the peace agreement,
but they have not signed it yet.

<HEADLINE> France Calls Lafontaine's Resignation "Interior Affair" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- France said Friday that the
surprise resignation of German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine
was "an interior affair" of Germany.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Finance and Economy Dominique Strauss-Kahn
said he regretted the departure of his German counterpart, but is
confident of future cooperation with Lafontaine's successor.
</P>
<P>
"I regret the decision taken by Oskar Lafontaine even though I
respect it," he said in a meeting with the press.
</P>
<P>
He said it is an interior affair of Germany and he was keeping
personal contact with Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that the cooperation with his successor will
be carried out under the best conditions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine will be succeeded by Gabs Eichel, the former
president-minister of the economically powerful state of Hessen
which includes the Frankfurt region.
</P>
<P>
The French minister also recognized that the abrupt departure
of Lafontaine would make things concerning the European Union (EU)
policy more complicated, as Bonn is serving as the rotating
presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
"But there are no insurmountable difficulties," he added.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that France and Germany have the common objective
of seeking growth and combatting unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The French press Friday widely commented on the resignation of
Lafontaine, but did not expect any major upheavals in terms of EU
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Both of the two left-wing and right-wing dailies, Liberation
and Le Figaro, expected German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to
turn to a centrist line after the showdown with the strongman of
his own left camp.

CANBERRA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The booming Australian
sharemarket entered uncharted territory again Friday, closing at a
record high after breaking through Thursday the 2,950-point
barrier for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index rose 10.8 points to 2,961.3
Friday, marking a record high for the second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
"The market finished strongly on a positive note following
another strong lead from overseas markets overnight," said Morgan
Stockbroking's Simon Reed.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 124.60
points to 9,897.44, a new high for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones' Stuart Smith said the local market
held on to most of the session's gains, forgoing much of the
traditional Friday afternoon profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose 6.4 points to 5,328.3 while the
all resources index lifted 18.3 points to 1,025.1.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said solid gains made by heavyweights such as News
Corp., BHP, Rio Tinto, and the Commonwealth Bank underpinned the
market in the latter half of the session.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was a reasonably modest 418.64 million shares
valued at 1.1 billion Australian dollars (698.5 million U.S.
dollars), with 750 rises, 572 falls and 440 stocks steady.
</P>
<P>
At the top end of the resources sector, BHP continued to power
ahead, gaining 21.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
Fellow miner Rio Tinto was also in the good books, surging 70
cents while WMC picked up five cents.
</P>
<P>
Among the leading industrials, Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation gained 18 cents while the preferred stock lifted 15
cents.
</P>
<P>
In the banking sector, the standout was the Commonwealth Bank
which rose 24 cents. Of the other big four only Westpac also made
gains, up 6.1 cents, while the National Australia Bank slumped
29.4 cents and ANZ dropped 10.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications stocks were mostly lower.
</P>
<P>
Telstra sank four cents as the market remained disappointed
that a special dividend was not included in its interim results
delivered.
</P>
<P>
Cable &AMP; Wireless Optus slipped six cents while AAPT bucked the
trend to pick up three cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian gold bullion closed at 293.80 U.S. dollars an
ounce compared to Thursday's close of 293.40.

<HEADLINE> Britain Recalls Ambassador From D.R. Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Friday it was
recalling its ambassador from the Democratic Republic of Congo to
consult on the situation there.
</P>
<P>
The move follows the deportation of five British diplomats and
officials who were accused of spying in Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We are recalling the British ambassador for consultation. We
take (the situation in Congo) very seriously indeed and we are
considering our response," the British Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
Britain welcomed the release of the diplomats and officials but
repeated its view that the Congolese government's actions were "
unwarranted and unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
The officials had arrived in Zimbabwe from Congo on Friday on
their way back to Britain. The Foreign Office said they were
making arrangements for the flight home.
</P>
<P>
The Congo President Laurent Kabila's government on Wednesday
ordered the expulsion of the five, accusing them of spying and
trying to gain access to a military base while carrying cameras
and maps of strategic points in Kinshasa, the capital of D.R.
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Britain denies the officials are spies and said the men had
been planning possible evacuation routes for Britons wanting to
leave the warring country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Britons had been held under house arrest in
Kinshasa before being taken to Harare, capital of Zimbabwe.

SINGAPORE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Singapore
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Friday confirmed that senior officials
from Malaysia and Singapore met here Thursday to discuss a package
of outstanding bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the meeting was a follow-up to that between
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and his Malaysian

Vietnam, whereby they agreed to discuss outstanding bilateral
issues as part of an overall political package.

The spokesman gave no details of the discussions, saying only
that "the officials exchanged views on the items in the package
and agreed to meet again at a later date to continue the
discussions."
</P>
<P>
Relations between Singapore and Malaysia were fraught with
problems last year as the two neighbors publicly disputed over a
series of problems.
</P>
<P>
These problems include a water supply agreement, a Malaysian
checkpoint of customs, immigration and quarantine, railway land,
the withdrawal of Central Provident Fund savings of Malaysian
workers in Singapore, Singapore's over-the-counter market for
mainly Malaysian equities and the memoirs of Singapore Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew.

<HEADLINE> Thai Businessman Calls for Leading Role of Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The agricultural sector in
Thailand should be strengthened and promoted to lead the economic
recovery process of the country, a top Thai businessman said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
To boost the agricultural sector as the country's backbone for
economic recovery, the government should help find new markets
abroad for increasing farm exports, Dhanin Chearavanont, chairman
of Chareon Pokphand Group (CP Group), the country's largest
conglomerate, said at a seminar on ways to solve the economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
With the economy in recession and asset values declining, it is
difficult to attract new funds from foreign investors, said
Dhanin, who leads the CP Group, which is particularly famous for
its agricultural products such as feed and chicken.
</P>
<P>
Thailand should make best use of economic reform loans by
channeling them to the farming sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Thailand has 17 million farmers, who form the
largest segment of the nation's workforce.
</P>
<P>
If the government could boost the purchasing power of the
agricultural sector, it would be an effective economic stimulant,
Dhanin said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested the government shift its focus and priorities to
the farming sector in its effort to boost productivity and income.

<HEADLINE> Thai Rice Said to Have Bright Long-Term Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai rice has a bright future in
the world market as long as the global population is steadily
increasing while rice fields are decreasing, a senior official
from the Thai Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperative Ministry
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Anand Dalodom, director-general of the Department of
Agriculture, said rice would remain in the long run Thailand's
most significant agricultural commodity, given its nature as basic
food in many countries and its reputed quality and taste.
</P>
<P>
As long as the world population is increasing and while rice
fields in many countries are being turned to industrial and
resident areas, Thai rice will continue to enjoy large share of
the world market, he said.
</P>
<P>
His words came after the rice prices in the world market have
fallen by an average of 30 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this is because some rice producing countries
have had bumper crops and the economic crisis in Asia and
elsewhere has lowered demand.
</P>
<P>
Declining international demand has pushed the price of Thai
fragrant rice down to about 7,000 baht (189 U.S. dollars) per ton
from 8,600 baht (232 dollars) per ton in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter, sold 6.2 million
tons of grains on the international market in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has realized the significance of maintaining its
reputation as the world's largest source of high-quality and best-
tasting rice by constantly improving seedlings and farming
techniques, Anand said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that exports of Thai rice are to be
indefinitely welcomed in the international market.

HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks gained 560
points, or 5.47 percent, in the past week and finished at 10,801.
76 Friday, the highest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Boosted by Wall Street gains, the key Hang Seng Index rose 138.
95 points, or 1.3 percent Friday, following a slip of 0.8 percent
Thursday caused by profit-taking, according to dealers.
</P>
<P>
Finance, utilities, properties, and commerce &AMP; industry all
chalked up gains ranging from 0.6 percent to 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The market turnover was 5.459 billion HK dollars (700 million U.
S. dollars), 44 million HK dollars (5 million U.S. dollars) less
than that of Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The share prices rose 149.72 points, or 1.4 percent, to open at
10,812.53 Friday morning and reached a high of more than 10,900

when local conglomerate Swire Pacific announced a 74-percent
plunge in its 1998 profit.
</P>
<P>
Following a sharp increase of 3.31 percent on the previous
Friday, the HSI entered the week's trade higher Monday amid
expectations of a strategic linkup between local communications
giant Hongkong Telecom and American software company Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
Triggered by the announcement of the partnership Tuesday,
technology and banking shares saw further increases through the
first half of the week until the momentum met with profit-taking
on Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs officers
seized more than 120,000 pirated optical discs worth about 2.4
million HK dollars (310,000 U.S. dollars) and arrested 15 people
in an anti-piracy operation Thursday evening, the government
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the operation, the officers raided more than 13 local
shops and seized about 66,000 video CDs, 36,500 music CDs and 20,
000 CD-ROMs, all of an infringing nature.
</P>
<P>
The arrested, aged between 17 and 53, were released on bail,
pending further inquiries.
</P>
<P>
"Our on-going anti-piracy operations demonstrate the department'
s determination and full commitment in combating piracy activities
and preserving the good image of Hong Kong," a spokesman for the
Customs and Excise Department said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hong Kong Customs officers seized 39 million pirated
optical discs worth 1 billion HK dollars (130 million U.S. dollars)
and arrested 1,561 people.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of this year, the officers seized 2.16

<HEADLINE> Swiss Biggest Bank's Profit Grows in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- UBS AG achieved a pre-tax profit
of 4.070 billion Swiss francs (about 2.79 billion U.S. dollars)
for the 1998 financial year, said Switzerland's biggest bank in a
press release on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a tax expense of just over one billion francs (about 685
million dollars), net profit is 3.030 billion francs (about 2.08
billion dollars), equivalent to earnings per share of 14.31 francs
(about 9.8 dollars), said the bank.
</P>
<P>
In spite of difficult conditions, UBS achieved a return on
equity of 10.3 percent. The Board of Directors will recommend a
dividend of 10.00 francs (about 6.85 dollars) per share to the
General Meeting.
</P>
<P>
While in first-half 1998, UBS posted results well ahead of
expectations, the bank said. The second half of the year was
marred by a combination of exceptional events which had an
extensive impact on the results for the year as a whole.
</P>
<P>
For 1999, UBS expects the strong market positioning of its
divisions and the positive effects of synergy to generate
significant profit growth. Excluding gains from divestment, this
increase in profitability should bring UBS close to its longer-
term target range of 15-20 percent return on equity.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Phil Coles, an member of the
International Olympic Committee, announced that he had resigned
from the Australian Olympic Committee for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old Coles, who has been accused of accepting more
than 37,500 U.S. dollars in hospitality from Salk Lack City 2002
Winter Olympic Games bid officials, admitted he had been "careless
".
</P>
<P>
Coles' resignation came just ahead of the expected release
later Friday of an IOC report into the Salt Lake City bribes
scandal.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Friday, Coles said: "There has been
speculation that the IOC report may contain criticism of some of
my actions. If so, I accept full responsibility for them. While I
never intended to do anything that would harm the Olympic movement,
with hindsight I should have been more circumspect in my actions.
</P>
<P>
"I've been careless." Coles said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Coles has already stepped down from the Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) after being named in the

<HEADLINE> HK Swire Pacific Reports 74-Percent Fall in Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's conglomerate Swire
Pacific reported today that its profit plunged 74 percent to 1.763
billion HK dollars (226 million U.S. dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip company's two leading profit contributors,
property and aviation, were dealt a hard blow in 1998, according
to its year-end results released here today.
</P>
<P>
Attributable profit from the property division slumped 70
percent to 1.505 billion HK dollars (193 million U.S. dollars) in
1998 while its aviation sector posted a loss of 108 million HK
dollars (14 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Peter Sutch, chairman of Swire Pacific, said: "1998 was a
particularly difficult year for businesses based in Hong Kong and
the Asian region."
</P>
<P>
Swire Pacific has diversified operations ranging from property
development to industries, trading, marine services and aviation.
It holds 44 percent stake in Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's flagship
airline, which Wednesday reported a loss of 542 million HK dollars
(69 million U.S. dollars), for the first time in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
The significant downturn in revenues for the flagship carrier
was caused mainly by economic contraction in Hong Kong and Asia
and sluggish demand for travel, the company reported.
</P>
<P>
Looking into 1999, Sutch said: "...we can expect 1999 to be
another challenging year." He added that economic conditions in
the majority of the markets remain weak despite the company's
efforts to reduce costs and improve competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Motorbikes Make Traffic Hard in Ho Chi Minh City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Traffic in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh
City has become more and more difficult as the city's registered
motorbike users increased to 1.2 million, not including the
thousands who daily commute from the provinces, the Vietnam News
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
With just 1,800 kilometers of road, the city provides a measly
1.2 meters of road space for each vehicle, compared with a world
average of 13 meters, the English-language daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The mushrooming of motorcycle ownership in the city began in
the late 1980s when attempts to develop the motorcycle industry
were made to "kickstart" the economy.
</P>
<P>
A very limited public transport system and a network of roads
too narrow for anything but the smallest of vehicles to maneuver
have helped the rapid acceleration of motorcycle ownership.
</P>
<P>
Some tourists visiting the city have described its traffic as a
"nightmare."

<HEADLINE> HK to Stage Colorful Celebrations for New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China will join the world in
welcoming the new millennium by staging a variety of colorful,
community-based events in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government hopes the festive activities will help boost
Hong Kong's attractiveness to overseas visitors and strengthen
tourism and development in both the short and longer terms.
</P>
<P>
The SAR's Secretary for Home Affairs David Lan told a press
conference Friday that Hong Kong's millennium programs comprise
seven core events and three capital works projects, plus a series
of activities being planned by non-governmental organizations,
chambers of commerce and district organizations.
</P>
<P>
The three capital projects are an International Wetland Park, a
Chinese Cuisine Training Institute and the Hong Kong Heritage
Museum.
</P>
<P>
Lan said the three projects identified would make unique
contributions to conserving Hong Kong's physical environment,
enhancing Chinese cuisine training and cross-fertilization of
talents with China's inland areas and enriching the territory's
cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ip, secretary for economic services, said at the press
conference that the project to build an International Wetland Park
is intended to start sometime in 2000 to provide conservation,
education and recreational facilities.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong's first major eco-tourism project and one of the
territory's most important wildlife conservation sites, the park's
facilities will include a visitor center, bird hides and trails,
Ip said.
</P>
<P>
On the Hong Kong Heritage Museum which is now under
construction and scheduled for official opening in late 2000, Lan
hoped the community would be able to share the joy of
understanding and appreciating the history and culture of Hong
Kong and South China through facilities provided by the museum.
</P>
<P>
According to Lan, Hong Kong has also planned for an exciting
mix of seven celebration activities that will be kicked off from
late 1999 and run well into mid-2000. These include programs like
a millennium extravaganza, city of sound and light, joint radio
broadcast, shows and exhibitions and other cultural and sports
events.
</P>
<P>
The official said the government has listened to the views of
different bodies in planning the millennium activities and
projects which would not only foster a festive atmosphere in the
run-up to the year 2000, but also provide lasting benefits to the
community well beyond January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, we believe these activities and projects will
boost Hong Kong's attractiveness to overseas visitors and
strengthen tourism and development in both the short and longer
terms," Lan said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Blasts NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia reiterated its staunch
opposition to the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) on Friday, when Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic officially join the transatlantic military bloc.
</P>
<P>
"The expansion will not promote confidence and stability in
international relations; instead, it may result in new divisions,"
the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"We do not welcome the kind of development that does not serve
the interests of the European people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry pledged to "continue using the potential
of the Founding Act and the Joint Permanent Russia-NATO Council to
create true partnership relations" with NATO and "to prevent
jeopardizing the formation of a common Euro-atlantic area of
stability, democracy and cooperation without dividing lines."
</P>
<P>
As a constructive alternative to NATO expansion, the statement
said, Russia is trying to construct a form of European security
which would protect the interests of all countries, members and
non-members of military and political alliances, and is calling on
others to join this work.
</P>
<P>
"A reliable system of European security and stability should be
built on all-European fundamentals, with faithful observance of
international law and the use of the potential of the OSCE; the
most representative and universal all-European organization which
is able to handle all the challenges of the 21st century:
political, economic, military and humanitarian," the document said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow calls on "all interested countries to draft and adopt at
the OSCE summit next November a Charter of European Security; a
document of paramount importance which would extend and define a
vision of a common space of democracy and security as well as
embody practical understandings on the principles of European (
political) architecture and on relations and cooperation between
European and North Atlantic agencies."
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of NATO's expansion, the updating of the
Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty is especially important," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia believes that the parties to the treaty will honor
their commitment to draft, before the end of March, formulations
on key issues for the updating of the treaty and that the all-
important instrument of stability will remain relevant," the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, with the addition of

<HEADLINE> China's Exports May Bottom Out Amid Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We're faced with many difficulties but it's possible for us to
realize some growth through diligence and hard work, Xu told
Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials and experts participating in the fair said that
they have noted some encouraging signs of a possible export
recovery some time this year, such as renewed interest in Chinese
goods of importers from Japan, the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that this year's turnover of 1.206 billion US
dollars for the 7-day fair compares very favorably with the
contract value of 1.9 billion US dollars for a similar fair of
last year which lasted three days longer.
</P>
<P>
China's export growth curve took a dive throughout the course
of last year, but this year the curve has started low and may rise
later, they said.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, MOFTEC Minister Shi Guangsheng today warned of an
overall tough year for exports but vowed to achieve some increase
by whatever possible means.
</P>
<P>
"China's foreign trade and economic situation may be even
harder and more complicated this year (than last year) ... and our
chief task is to expand exports by all possible means to achieve
some growth," Shi said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the Asian financial crisis, which has lasted since
July 1997, China's export growth plunged to 0.5 percent last year
from 20.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that the downward trend has continued
so far this year, with exports declining 10.5 percent in the first
two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Shi cited this year's major difficulties in exports as a result
of the continued effects of the Asian financial crisis, a low
level of demand on the world market, and the resurgence of trade
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
To boost exports, China will use a combination of
internationally-accepted policies, such as increasing financial
support and tax rebates and developing export insurance, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of all uncertainties and difficulties, officials and
experts agree that there are positive factors for China's exports
this year.
</P>
<P>
The world's economy and trade continue to grow and China's
cooperation with its major trading partners is good, Shi said,
adding that China's sustained and relatively rapid economic growth,
hitting 7.8 percent last year, is also a boost to its foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China's share of the world trade market is still small
and therefore there is still great potential to be tapped, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Observers predict that China's decision to allow some private
firms to engage in foreign trade directly and raise the legal
status of the private sector overall, making it "an important
component of the socialist market economy", will pump fresh steam
into exports both in the short and long terms.

</P>
<P>
-- The surprise resignation of Oskar Lafontaine from the post
of finance minister of the German government is the signal of the
failure of the German left, and will let Gerhard Shroeder to take
over the presidency of the Social Democratic Party. The chancellor
is expected to turn to a centrist political line.
</P>
<P>
-- Less than 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, three
former members of the Warsaw Pact are due to formally join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Beyond a shift of
symbol, the turning of Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic to the
West will result in a new map of security in Europe, while Moscow
still regards it as a humiliation.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- With the resignation of Oskar Lafontaine, the strongman of
the Shroeder government, the German chancellor cut relations with
his own leftwing force. Schroeder has criticized Lafontaine for
imposing too heavy a tax on Germany's energy industrialists in the
process of talks on the abandoning of nuclear energy. The exchange
of euro with the dollar rose soon after the resignation of the
German finance minister.
</P>
<P>
-- The adhesion of the three Eastern European countries to the
NATO marks the end of the post-Cold War era in Europe and seals
the European reconciliation. However, the building of the new
European security relationship still has to be decided by
Washington, as Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic were chosen by
the United States as countries to join NATO in the first wave.

<HEADLINE> Prolonged Drought Causes Water to Fall in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A prolonged drought has caused
water levels to fall further in Vietnam's northern central
provinces and the central highlands, media reports here Friday
quoted forecasters as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although light rain and drizzle may fall in March, the drought
in six northern central provinces and two provinces in the central
highlands is likely to continue causing a water shortage for daily
use, production and crop growing, said officials at the National
Meteorology Forecast Center.
</P>
<P>
Water levels are expected to be 30 percent to 50 percent lower
than the average.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the Mekong Delta, Vietnam's major
rice-growing area, faces a critical shortage of water for the
forthcoming summer-autumn rice crop and water in the Red River is
an estimated 20 centimeters lower than the average.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry has asked
officials in the drought-stricken provinces to take urgent
measures to tackle the situation.
</P>
<P>
The officials have been asked to use their budgets prudently in
implementing measures to mitigate the effects of the drought and
ensure householders have sufficient water.
</P>
<P>
About 2 million residents in 14 provinces are short of water
for daily use.

<HEADLINE> Mujakperuo Replaces Shelpidi as ECOMOG Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Defense Headquarters has
started a major reorganization of the command of the West African
peace-keeping force of ECOMOG, media reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Major General Felix Mujakperuo, general officer commanding
Second Mechanized Division in Ibadan, Oyo State, was named the new
ECOMOG commander, Lt. Col. Sam Tella, acting director of defense
information, said in Lagos Thursday.
</P>
<P>
General Mujakperuo, whose appointment took effect from last
Monday, replaced Major General Timothy Shelpidi, who was
redeployed to the Defense Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Tella said that Brigadier General John Onu was named as the new
ECOMOG chief of staff and Nigerian contingent commander, replacing
Brigadier General Gabriel Kpamber who was last July deployed to
the ECOMOG headquarters in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Tella described the posting as purely military, saying "it is
normal, there is no reason for the change."
</P>
<P>
However, The Post Express quoted inside sources at the military
 headquarters as saying it was not unconnected with the dismal
showing of the ECOMOG troops during the invasion of Freetown by
the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean Chief of Defense Staff Brigadier General
Maxwell Khobe said during his visit to Nigeria last month that the
inability of some members of ECOMOG to effect some orders led to
the successful invasion of capital Freetown by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Defense Headquarters has set up a Board of Inquiry to
investigate some allegations levelled against Nigerian officers
under the ECOMOG command who refused to act on time on
intelligence report, saying the rebels infiltrated Freetown.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market has been
rising steadily this year partly due to increased efforts by the
authorities to develop the market, according to stock exchange
sources.
</P>
<P>
Turnover at the Shanghai Stock Exchange grew to 4.49 billion
yuan today, the largest amount since trading resumed on March 1
following the Lunar New Year Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
The exchange's benchmark Composite Stock Index ended today at
1,158.70, up 60 points from the closing of February 9, the last
trading day of last year on the Chinese lunar year calendar.
</P>
<P>
The Component Stock Index of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in the
boom city of Shenzhen closed at 2,928.79 today, more than 160
points higher than the closing of March 1.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the strong performance of the stock market
in recent days to encouraging news from the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Measures making it easier for securities brokerages to raise
funds through normal channels will soon be unveiled, according to
well-informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Measures to step up deposit management and improve the clearing
system have also been positively received, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
They noted that judging from Premier Zhu Rongji's government
work report, the Chinese economy will remain strong this year,
providing a very positive fundamental condition for the stock
market.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- There are alarming reports of
cholera disease killing the people of Bay Region in hundreds when
it has got under control in the region of Gedo in Southern
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit village is Habal Bar, about 80 kms Southwest of
Baidoa Town, where over 120 people have died of the disease in
the past four days.
</P>
<P>
According to the local authorities in the village, more than 80
of the victims are children under eight and the majority are those
who moved from the town of Baidoa for insecurity in the past two
months.
</P>
<P>
M. Nuurreh Hassanow, the chairman of the village who contacted
the journalists in Mogadishu via VHF radio, said 41 people are now
lying in the quarantine facility recently opened by the local
people with many of them in very critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is reportedly rampant throughout the villages of Bay
Region. According to the latest reports, 12 people, of which
seven are children, have died in Robey Gudud village alone, while
56 others, mainly children, have also died in six other villages,
just a few kilometers North of Baidoa town, in the past two days.

cholera victims which are fighting against the serious spread of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
Dr Hussein Abdi Mohamed, a local doctor who arrived from Huddor
town for the cholera victims in Bay region is now among the few
qualified persons trying to cope with the situation with the help
of some nurses.
</P>
<P>

region who are desperate for shortage of food and other supplies,
saying there is not a single aid agency operating in the region
against the disease.

<HEADLINE> Civil Aviation Carries 6.65 Million Passengers In Spring Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's annual large movement of
people returning home for the Spring Festival this year, which has
come to be known as "Spring Season Transport" and began on
February 1, ended today.
</P>
<P>
During the 40-day Spring Season Transport, China's civil
aviation handled 68,603 flights carrying 6.65 million passengers,
an increase of 14.1 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively, over
the same period last year, according to information from the
General Administration of Civil Aviation of China.
</P>
<P>
Travelers during the annual movement are usually migrating
laborers, college students on their winter holidays, and people
working in other regions returning to their hometowns to visit
relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more and more people have been traveling
during this period, and as a result the Chinese government has to
decide the length of the Spring Season Transport period every year
so that the country's transport system will go all out to ensure
that the migration goes smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The civil aviation sector generally went smoothly during Spring
Festival this year, said an official with the administration.
</P>
<P>
Tickets for most dates and flights were readily available, and
some airlines also arranged additional flights and chartered ones
to relieve pressure on some busy routes, the official said.
</P>
<P>
More passengers boarded planes for south China and abroad this
year, and group travelers became major clients for the civil
aviation sector.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Air China Group provided Boeing 747s and
Boeing 777s for their flights to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
China Eastern Airlines also added 256 flights to its
international and domestic schedule, 13.5 times as many as in the
same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Steps up Efforts for Pan-Arab Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is stepping up efforts for
the establishment of a Pan-Arab free trade zone by the year 2007,
the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second economic forum of Arab businesswomen
Thursday, Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili said that
Egypt is currently negotiating with Saudi Arabia to finalize a
deal to set up a joint free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Similar negotiations with Libya are underway as a primary step
to promote trade with Libya and also Morocco and Tunisia, Gowaili
said.
</P>
<P>
The idea of an Arab common market has been circulating since
the 1950s. An Arab summit in 1996 further called for speeding up
creating such a market.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, the Arab League launched a regional free
trade program which is considered as a key step in this
regard. Eighteen Arab countries have agreed to join the program.
</P>
<P>
As a prelude to the market, which is scheduled to take shape by
2007, moves for the establishment of bilateral free trade areas
started among Arab states, including Egypt, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is also seeking ways of promoting exports in other
markets, especially those in African countries, and has joined the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), Gowaili
said.
</P>
<P>
Although Egypt will lose 150 to 160 million Egyptian pounds
(44.12 to 47.1 million U.S. dollars) as a result of phasing out
tariffs among the COMESA members, officials believe that opening
to the markets with 360 million consumers will be beneficial to
Egypt, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government has concluded a deal with EgyptAir, the national
carrier, to open flight routes to 12 African countries and signed
another deal with the African Development Bank to finance the
establishment of maritime transport routes with African
countries.

<HEADLINE> China's DVD Sales To Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- After three year's of slow sales
it is expected that there will be booming digital video disc (DVD)
market in China this year, according to economic analysts.
</P>
<P>
DVD player sales could reach some one million this year, say
delegates attending an international DVD seminar held recently
here.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, DVD player sales in China accounted for only 0.4
percent of the total sales of VCD players and climbed to 2.1
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 30 Chinese enterprises are involved in the
production of DVD players, and with the expansion of the DVD
market, their production costs will be further lowered, which will
bring the market price down to an acceptable level for most
consumers.

<P>
Hanoi, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai will visit Japan from march 28 to 30 at the invitation of his
Japanese counterpart, Keizo Obuchi, according to official media
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The visit aims to boost relations between the to countries. An
official source said the talks between Khai and Obuchi would focus
on economic cooperation, particularly on the use of over 700
million U.S. dollars in Japanese aid to Vietnam in fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
Plans for Vietnam's participation in the Miyazawa scheme would
also be on the agenda, the source said, adding commitments by
Japan to help Vietnam reduce its budget deficit would also be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Japan will also consider helping Vietnam develop Binh Bridge in
Hai Phong City, upgrade Hai Phong Port and set up personnel
training centers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers are to discuss troubles currently their
two countries have encountered due to the absence of a trade
agreement and the MFN status, resulting in Japanese imports being
taxed 50 percent higher than those from countries enjoying the
most favored nation status (MFN).

<HEADLINE> February Price Indexes Edge Up Marginally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report released today by the State Development Planning
Commission and the National Bureau of Statistics attributed the
increases mainly to the following three factors:
</P>
<P>
-- Seasonal price hikes for such products as vegetables,
aquatic products, eggs and poultry during the Chinese traditional
Spring Festival;
</P>
<P>
-- Grain prices rises in rural areas;
</P>
<P>
-- And reinforced infrastructure and water conservancy
construction, which boosted domestic demand to some extent, as
well as the recovering prices of building materials, energy and
means of agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
However, the lingering impact of last year's overall price
drops resulted in February's RPI and CPI coming down by 2.8
percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, over the same period of the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Everyone to Plant More Trees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Forestry today released a circular encouraging everyone to plant
more trees to beautify the country.
</P>
<P>
Today is China's National Tree-Planting Day, and the circular
urged local governments to increase investment in afforestation
and promote economic returns through advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
Since the first Tree-Planting Day in 1982, China has launched
a series of events to mark this special occasion each year.
Statistics from the forestry administration show that thus far a
total of 5.5 billion people have voluntarily planted trees.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, the Fourth Session of the Fifth National People's
Congress approved a decision encouraging everyone 11 years old and
over to voluntarily plant three to five trees every year.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have paid off, said the administration, noting
that China now has 33.79 million hectares of planted forests, and
the forested areas have been raised to 13.92 percent of the
country's land mass, from 12.7 percent at the beginning of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
The forestry administration admitted that China still faces
problems in this sector, such as inadequate forest areas and
degeneration of the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
A recent sample survey made by the administration and the
Beijing-based Horizon Research Co. Ltd. also found that nearly
half of all urban residents did not know the exact date of
National Tree-Planting Day.

<HEADLINE> China Export Faces Tough Challenges: Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The overall situation of China's
export is very tough and difficult this year, Shi Guangsheng,
Chinese minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said
here today.
</P>
<P>
China's export has dropped about ten percent during the first
two months this year, and the drop in processing goods export was
even greater, according to the latest statistics, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although it can not represent the export situation of the
whole year, it does indicate that the export situation is very
tough and difficult this year, and this is a fact known to
everyone," the minister said at a press conference sponsored by
the Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"But China still has much room to expand foreign trade since
many favorable factors still exist," the minister said, citing
factors such as the healthy national economy, successful reform,
and international market space as a result of a moderate increase
in world economy.
</P>
<P>
Shi said China will act in accordance with the requirements put
forward by Premier Zhu Rongji in his government work report last
Friday, sparing no effort to expand export to achieve growth and
to moderately increase import.
</P>
<P>
To expand export, China is expected to ensure credit support
for exporters, develop export insurance, and further optimize the
mix of export products this year.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to "make significant efforts and take
important measures" to encourage more Chinese enterprises to set
up factories overseas and engage in processing and assembling
businesses there, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
China will also put greater efforts into exploring emerging
overseas market, reforming state-owned foreign trade and economic
cooperation enterprises, protecting legal exporting and importing
activities and cracking down on smuggling and other irregularities
such as fraudulent activities in foreign exchange settlement to
create an environment for fair competition.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade turnover fell 0.4 percent to 323.93
billion U.S. dollars in 1998, resulting in a trade surplus of 43.
59 billion U.S. dollars. Export turnover was valued at 183.76
billion U.S. dollars, a slight increase of 0.5 percent over the
1997 figure, while import fell 1.5 percent to 140.17 billion U.S.
dollars worth.

MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Asian financial turmoil
continued to push up the unemployment rate of the Philippines to 9
percent in January 1999 from 8.4 percent a year earlier, the
National Statistics Office said Friday.

Data of the office showed the number of the unemployed

Among the country's regions, the national capital region
registered the highest unemployment rate of 15.7 percent with
Central Luzon ranking second at 10.2 percent, the office said.

BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- "China does not allow its
enterprises to dump their goods in overseas markets, and the
Chinese enterprises do not have the capability to dump their goods,
" said Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference sponsored by the Second Session
of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), Shi said any
country should not use anti-dumping as means to protect its market.
</P>
<P>
Because of their cheap cost of raw material, labor and
processing, China's products are competitive in the global market,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Sino-European economic and trade
relationship will be in China's interests as well as in the
economic interests of Europe," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics, European Union (EU) is the
fourth largest trading partner with the Chinese mainland next to
the United States, Japan and Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
Last year the European Union (EU) removed China from the list
of non-market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the removal from the non-market economy list," Shi
said, "some discriminative practices still remain."
</P>
<P>
"We hope China will be treated as a market economy and Europe
will further open up its market," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Allied forces in Congo (K)
inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels and their supporters over
the past two weeks, while a Zimbabwean soldier was killed and
three others injured, the daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Defense Military Thursday said in a statement
the allied forces killed at least 239 troops of the rebels and
their supporters, including a battalion commander.
</P>
<P>
Besides losing 239 soldiers, the enemy suffered heavy
casualties and fled, leaving behind a large assortment of
military hardware.
</P>
<P>
During one of their sorties allied jets flushed the enemy out
of its tactical headquarters at Bumba. The enemy have since
relocated their headquarters to Akati after the destruction of
their fuel and ammunition dumps during an attack by allied forces,
the military said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy human and material casualties were inflicted on the
invading forces which are persisting in their ill-fated bid to
gain more territory in the strife-torn Congo (K), it said.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces from Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad are
now in Congo (K) to help the Congolese (K) government to fight
against the rebels and their supporters.

<HEADLINE> South Asian Neurosurgical Congress Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The first South Asian
Neurosurgical Congress opened here Friday, drawing 300 specialists
from inside and outside the region under the theme of "regional
collaboration in neurosurgery."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Upendra Devkota, chairman of the organizing committee,
noted in his welcome address that due to medical advance over the
decades, all the organs in human body are now replaceable except
the brain and the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
"Because of our peculiar socioeconomic and geopolitical
situation, we in the South Asian region are not optimally equipped
in terms of resources to deal with the devastating disorders of
the brain," he stated.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Nepal alone, the annual incidence of head
injuries is about 120,000, of which 10 percent are severe,
carrying a mortality rate of about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
"To this, one has to add the annual 1,000 spinal injuries,
2,000 brain hemorrhages requiring surgery, 9,000 brain tumors and
several thousand cases of spinal disorders," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said every year about 15,000 Nepalese people require major
neurosurgery, but no more than 1,000 can be catered to.
</P>
<P>
After discussions, the professionals in South Asia have come to
the conclusion that this area of medical sciences is not receiving
the priority it deserves, he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor V.K. Kak from India said cooperation in health
sciences among the South Asian countries lag behind that in other
areas.
</P>
<P>
Professor Azaz Ali Shah from Pakistan noted the dearth of
resources and high technology in the region. He called for regular
exchange programs and frequent meetings among the countries.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka from South
Asia as well as the United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, Hong
Kong and Singapore are represented at the three-day meeting
organized by the Nepalese Society of Clinical Neurosciences.
</P>
<P>
The society said in a press release that the meeting will act
as a forum for sharing experiences gained so far and planning
future strategy for delivery of effective neurological service,
training and research in the region.
</P>
<P>
It said the participants shall have in-depth deliberations
which will initiate the process of regional collaboration for
development of all facets of neurosurgery relevant to the
realities of the South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The participants are expected to present about 130 papers on
various aspects of neurosurgery like skull base surgery, vascular
neurosurgery, neuronavigation and petroclival meningioma.
</P>
<P>
Nepali King Birendra inaugurated the congress and Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala attended the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition is held on the occasion on publications,
medicines and medical equipment relating to neurosurgery.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants Arrested Citizens in Zimbabwe Treated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has requested
the Zimbabwean government to ensure that its three nationals
arrested at the Harare International Airport last Sunday be
treated in accordance with the laws of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Washington also warned that it will "register its concerns" if
it finds that the suspects are being mistreated, the daily Herald
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources Thursday told the paper that deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. embassy in Harare Earl Michael Irving made the
request at an urgent meeting the embassy sought with Zimbabwean
Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge Wednesday. The embassy wanted to
convey its government's views on the arrest of the trio for
allegedly possessing highly sophisticated arms of war.
</P>
<P>
The embassy reiterated that the three were not affiliated in
any way to the U.S. government, be it formally or informally.
</P>
<P>
Irving said the U.S. government was ready to cooperate in the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
He informed Mudenge that if the weapons were of U.S.
manufacture, the suspected saboteurs would have violated U.S. laws
as well.
</P>
<P>
In response to the issues raised, sources said Mudenge affirmed
to the Americans that the Zimbabwean law would apply to the trio.
He told Irving that the longer it took for the police to get
adequate information from the suspects, the longer the
investigation would last. Their concern about possible
ill-treatment was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it was vital to establish the trio's motives,
adding that the government was worried about the three suspects'
intention.
</P>
<P>
Also of concern to the government were reports that the trio's
passports were issued by the U.S. embassy in Harare.

<HEADLINE> No Report Received on Muslim Group War Threat: Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
denied reports that the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) is
preparing to wage a war against it.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
Friday that neither his office nor the office on national security
and political affairs has received any information about such an
MNLF threat.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how these stories came out. We have been talking
to MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari every day," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier media reports said MNLF leaders, fearing a humiliating
debacle in the elections for the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao (ARMM) in September this year, have seriously begun
preparing themselves to go back to war.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said there was no basis for Misuari, current governor of
the ARMM, to go to war because the government had accommodated his
request not to hold elections in the ARMM in March this year.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier radio interview, Misuari also denied reports that
the MNLF guerrillas are now undergoing training to prepare for a
possible "war" against the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the only training going on is the integration of MNLF
soldiers into the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Private Export Firm Finds Success At Tianjin Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Delide Group Co. Ltd., a private
company that has just been granted the authority to handle its own
exports and imports, signed one million U.S. dollars worth of
contracts with overseas businessmen at the on-going Tianjin Import
and Export Fair.
</P>
<P>
Previously, private companies in China were not allowed to
handle their own exports, and their export business was done by
professional foreign trade companies.
</P>
<P>
"The past practice featured complicated procedures and greater
costs," said Wang Xueli, president of the company, "With the newly
obtained right to handle imports and exports, it is much easier
for us private companies to establish long-term and stable
cooperative ties with foreign businesses."
</P>
<P>
With the expansion of China's opening-up drive, influential
private companies are encouraged to engage in foreign trade
directly with overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation gave 41 private companies the right to handle import
and export business, coupled with some preferential treatment in
exports accomplished by these companies.
</P>
<P>
This has been done because China is adjusting its present
foreign trade structure under which overseas-backed companies play
a major role in foreign trade, in the hope that state-owned
professional foreign trade companies, overseas-backed companies,
and private companies will share the total foreign trade volume of
the country in the future.
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, for instance, 70 percent of the municipality's
exports are done by overseas-financed companies.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, six private companies attended this
year's Tianjin fair, scheduled to close tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> 11 Million Kenyans Live Below Poverty Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 11.5 million people in
Kenya live below the absolute poverty line, Julius Sunkuli,
Minister of State in the Office of the President has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the official launching of the national poverty
eradication plan Thursday, the minister told the participants
that more than 10.3 million of the poor population are based in
rural areas, while over 1.2 million live in the urban centers.

shelter and clothing for a normal life.
</P>
<P>
Sunkuli noted that the majority of people living below the
poverty line were in arid and semi-arid lands in the country's
North Eastern, Eastern and Rift Valley provinces.

Statistics showed that the proportion of the nation's
population below the absolute poverty line in 1994 was 44 percent.

In rural areas, 47 percent were under the poverty line while in
the urban areas it was 29 percent.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Book Launched in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- African Network of People living
with HIV/ AIDS has launched a book on food for people living with
the virus to improve and prolong lives of those infected, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Treatment of opportunistic infections resulting from AIDS was
expensive and was considerable strain on the delivery of health
services in Zambia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Deputy Permanent Secretary of Copperbelt
Province, Darius Hakayobe, who was launching the book recently in
Ndola, capital of the province in north Zambia, as saying food
provided a medicine that was cheap and easy to get.
</P>
<P>
He praised the group for their innovation in coming up with a
book that emphasized on nutrition as the beginning of clinical
self restoration.
</P>
<P>
David Chipanta, national chairman of people living with AIDS,
said the book was a brain-child of the network of people living
with HIV/AIDS with the help of the United Nations Development
Program who funded the project.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian chapter reproduced the book to suit the Zambian
environment and it has been translated into the seven local
languages for it to reach a cross section of the society in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Diet Debates Bills on Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Diet (parliament) on Friday
began deliberations on a set of bills related to the revised Japan-
U.S. defense cooperation guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The deliberations, which were submitted nearly one year ago,
started at the House of Representatives plenary session with the
government explaining the gist of the bills.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the government will take questions from
lower house members of both the ruling and opposition parties,
Japanese government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Full debate on the bills, to be conducted by a special lower
house panel, will begin after the fiscal 1999 budget is approved
next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government is aiming at passing the bills,
designed to implement the updated Japan-U.S. defense cooperation
guidelines, through the Diet by the end of the current Diet
session on June 17, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The bills will allow Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to
provide more logistics support to U.S. forces and conduct rear-
area search and rescue operations for military personnel in
emergencies in unspecified "areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States updated the defense guidelines in
1997 to expand the scope of the bilateral defense cooperation to
cover emergency "areas surrounding Japan."
</P>
<P>
The focus of the deliberations will be on whether Japan's
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), its coalition partner Liberal
Party (LP), and opposition groups will be able to agree on
amendments to the bills.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, which lacks a majority in the House of Councilors even
with the LP's support, must seek support from opposition groups to
get the bills through the upper house.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) and the Social Democratic
Party (SDP) are firmly opposed to the bills, demanding to scrap
them on the ground that they will lead Japan's participation in
war.
</P>
<P>
Other opposition parties such as the Democratic Party of Japan
(DPJ) and the New Komeito party are believed to support the bills
if amendments are made, sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate Thursday passed a resolution calling on
President Bill Clinton to oppose a unilateral Palestinian
declaration of statehood. U.S. and Palestinian officials also
denied Israeli press reports of a possible delay in Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat's scheduled March 23
meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Likud hopes to capitalize on the European Union's
letter which expressed support for the internationalization of
Jerusalem. It planned to cite the letter as proof of the dangers
facing the city, and present the Likud and Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu as the only ones capable of defending Israel's
sovereignty over the whole Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- An opinion poll showed that in the first round of elections
on May 17, Netanyahu would lead with 33 percent of the votes,
followed by Labor leader Ehud Barak, 31 percent. Central Party
leader Yitzhak Mordechai would get 18 percent. In the second
round, however, Barak would beat Netanyahu by 46 percent to 41
percent. In a theoretical situation where Netanyahu and Mordechai
would compete in the second round, Mordechai would get 50 percent
of the votes while Netanyahu get 37 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soybean Price to Drop to Quarter Century's Lowest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. farmers will see the
lowest average price for soybean in nearly a quarter century due
to a global glut, according to the latest report released by U.S.
Agriculture Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The closing price at the Chicago Board of Trade for soybean for
May delivery was 4.78 U.S. dollars a bushel, and the department
predicts 5.05 dollars a bushel as season-average price, the lowest
price since 1975-76, when sales to the Soviet Union hit a pothole.
</P>
<P>
With fewer sales, the U.S. stockpile would swell to its highest
level, 470 million bushels, since the last agricultural recession
of the mid-1980s, market analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Analysts add the gloomy soybean price might dissuade farmers
from planting soybeans.

<HEADLINE> Cattle Prices Fall on U.S. Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Cattle prices fell sharply
Thursday at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange after the U.S.
government increased its estimate of 1999 beef production.
</P>
<P>
Cattle for delivery in April ended 1.1 cents a pound lower at
67.4 cent, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Agriculture Department estimated 1999 beef production
at 25.406 billion pounds, up from its estimate of 25.081 billion
pounds a month ago.
</P>
<P>
"Livestock prices remain under pressure from large meat
supplies," the department said. "With larger forecast beef
production, cattle prices are expected to recover less rapidly
than forecast last month."
</P>
<P>
This was bad news for cattle producers who had hoped for lower
production. In 1998, beef production was 25.760 billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
Cattle producers and industry analysts have been expecting
higher cattle prices this year after a disastrous 1998. Last year,
many cattle producers lost up to 150 U.S. dollars per head as
abundant beef and pork supplies sent cattle prices sharply lower.

ABU DHABI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
is wary of organized crime and is well-prepared to deal with
international criminals, the Dubai-based English daily Khaleej

</P>
<P>
The UAE is not immune from crime and some criminals enter the

The UAE has witnessed some perplexing cases by various
nationalities in recent years, and these criminal activities were
well-organized and pre-planned, he said.
</P>
<P>
The police forces are determined to combat against these
organized crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
As the UAE has become a major tourist attraction, the police

Police training programs are under way and measures are being
taken to ensure that best crime prevention approaches are adopted,
the officer added.

<HEADLINE> New Infrastructure Projects to Boost China's Grain Production (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a new large
number of infrastructure projects in China, including railway and
highway projects, and efforts to return farmland that were created
by filling in lake and river beaches, may finally help boost the
country's grain output, though these projects take up some
farmland for the present.
</P>
<P>
This is the view shared by NPC deputies to the ongoing session
of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top
legislature, and members of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference National Committee whose annual session
ended here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ming, vice-minister of agriculture and a member of the CPPCC
National Committee, top advisory body of the Chinese government,
said that the projects would take up large tracts of area
including some farmland, but water conservation projects and tree
planting or returning farmland into lakes and rivers would finally
contribute to curb the deteriorating ecological environment, soil
erosion, water shortage and desertification.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the acreage of farmland in China
has kept decreasing by 200,000 hectares a year and currently, the
per capita acreage stands at 0.078 hectare, much less than the
world average.
</P>
<P>
Since last summer's devastating flooding which claimed the life
of more than 3,000 people and caused an economic loss of more than
200 billion yuan, the central and local governments have been
determined to tame the relevant rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
Measures are being taken to get rid of the created farmland to
make way to lakes and rivers and unofficial dykes and dams are
also leveled in Poyang and Dongting lakes, the first and second
largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
In Hunan Province, where the Dongting lake locates, 106 dykes
will be abolished, while Jiangxi Province, where the Poyang lake
sits, will enlarge the lake by 1,400 sq. km., equivalent to the
water area lost due to human activities over the past five decades.

<HEADLINE> New Infrastructure Projects to Boost China's Grain Production (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NPC Deputy Professor Zhang Zili from the Anhui University in
east China, said that the projects are being undertaken for the
sake of the local ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation projects and improved farming techniques
also help make a better use of China's potential land resources as
a whole and it will also help increase the country's grain output
in a long run, according to Professor Shen Guifang, a CPPCC member
and a former vice president of the China Academy of Agricultural
sciences.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that in developed nations, technology contributes to
80 percent of farm production output, while in China, it is only
about 40 percent. He expressed the hope that measures will be
taken as soon as possible to enable technology to play a bigger
role in promoting grain production in the course of implementing
the strategy of invigorating the nation through science and
education.
</P>
<P>
At present, China ranks the ninth in the world in the unit
output of paddy rice, with 6,331 kg per hectare, while that of in
Egypt, the world's No. one, reaches 8,567 kg, said CPPCC Member Li
Hanyun, a paddy rice researcher from southwest China's Sichuan
Agricultural University. There is a great potential for China to
tap to increase the unit grain output.
</P>
<P>
"Technology is the key to this," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of water resources is also an important factor holding
the country's grain production output, and big efforts must be
made to increase the utility rate of the water in China whose
utility rate in this regard is only 30 percent to 40 percent at
present, said Zhang Boping, a CPPCC member and a senior engineer
of the China Farm Mechanization Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of China's arable land is medium or low
yielding farmland due to poor irrigation and soil, and the
improvement of such farmland will surely contribute to increasing
the grain output by a big margin, CPPCC members pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Turnover at East China Trade Hits 1.2 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Turnover at the seven-day '99
East China Fair, which ended here on Thursday, totaled 1.206
billion U.S. dollars..
</P>
<P>
Japan accounted for one-sixth of all transactions, up 14
percent from last year, while imports by traders from the Republic
of Korea rocketed 91 percent from last year to 39.8 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The value of signed agreements with importers from Hong Kong,
Macao and Taiwan also increased considerably.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,100 business people from 130 countries and regions
participated in this year's fair, and the number of dealers from
Asia rose 14 percent on a yearly basis, as against a 22 percent
drop last year.
</P>
<P>
"The active performance of Asian traders makes us feel that
signs of economic recovery in East and Southeast Asia have emerged,
" said Zhou Hongli, deputy director of the general office of the
trade fair.
</P>
<P>
The trade turnover at a similar ten-day fair last year was 1.9
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the exports of eastern China, which
includes Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong,
Fujian, Anhui and Jiangxi, were sold to other Asia countries,
according to Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the relatively active trading during the fair
indicates that China's pro-active fiscal and financial policies to
boost exports and improve the export mix have begun showing
positive results.
</P>
<P>
An analysis shows that trading in textiles, light industrial
products, and machinery and electronics all increased.
</P>
<P>
Japanese trader Seiro Watanabe said that textiles produced in
the Chinese mainland are as good as those produced in the ROK and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that exports from Shanghai, Jiangsu and
Zhejiang rose 5.9, 11, and 7.7 percent, respectively, last year,
compared with a 0.5 percent growth rate for the entire nation.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Claims Five Lives in East India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The early onset of heat wave
this year has already killed five people in India's east coastal
state of Orissa where an estimated 3,000 people died of the heat
wave last year.
</P>
<P>
The Times of India reported Friday that all brick kilns were
being ordered to close down, buses might be off the road at
noontime and there were plans to switch to working only in the
morning in the state.
</P>
<P>
And like last year, there is still no explanation for the
"unusual but fatal warming," with the meteorological center in the
area warning about the possibility of yet another heat wave this
summer in the area.
</P>
<P>
With temperature already logging as high as 40.4 degrees
Celsius in the early summer days, streets in coastal cities of the
state start getting deserted around 11 a.m., shops and business
centers close down to beat mid-day heat and the homeless make for
the nearest bus stop or railway station for shelter.
</P>
<P>
As equally panicky and concerned, the daily paper said, state
government had also reacted with its usual mix of instructions and
appeals.
</P>
<P>
The must do list the government was advocating began with the
most predictable: just keep out of the sun and drink as much water
as possible.
</P>
<P>
District collectors had been instructed to close all brick
kilns. which were found to be contributing to the warming and
educational institutions had been asked to finish their
examinations before April.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, abnormal heat wave has also reportedly swept most
parts of central and southern Bengal, with the mercury soaring to
39.2 degrees Celsius earlier this week, six degrees above normal.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people died of heat wave last year in several
states of the country including Orissa, Rajasthan, Gujarat,
Maharashitra and Delhi.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Customs Stems Relics Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide crackdown upon
relics smuggling has led to a sharp decline of relic thefts in
China over the past year, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The number of cultural relics seized by customs officials
across the country dropped from more than 12,000 in 1997 to 5,300
last year, an official with the General Administration of Customs
told the newspaper, attributing the result to tightened checks on
luggage and cargo containers, the favorite means of transport
among traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Yin Pengfei said that many customs officers have learned
identification techniques during seven training courses offered by
experts from the State Bureau of Cultural Relics (SBCR).
</P>
<P>
The drop in the number of smuggled relics was particularly
significant since last July, when China launched a massive anti-
smuggling campaign.
</P>
<P>
Only 51 relics thefts were reported last year, compared with
106 in the previous year, the SBCR said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese law stipulates that cultural relics created prior to
1795, and some rare pieces dating as late as 1911, must not be
taken out of the country.

BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Swimming Association
(CSA) has announced a young-blood squad for next month's Short-
course (25 meters pool) world championships slated for the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
China's top female swimmer Chen Yan, double gold medalist from
last year's long-course (Olympic-sized 50 meters pool)
championships in Perth was surprisingly not listed.
</P>
<P>
Team manager Yang Xinsheng explained that, ever since Chen's
ill-plaqued performance at the Bangkok Asian Games, she has been
in the process of a special treatment for stomach illness back at
her hometown Shenyang in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 male and 15 female athletes of the team are world
champions and runners-up from the previous short-course world
championships in Gothenburg, Sweden, last year's long-course world
championships in Perth and winners at the Asian Games last
December in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
CSA officials had kept themselves low-keyed for China's show at
the first short-course world swimming championships ever held in
Asia, saying that the February 1-4 event in Hong Kong SAR would
only be part of Chinese swimmers' preparations for the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese performance at the three previous short-course
championships had been impressive, which proved that training
sessions in short pools had long been the key part of Chinese
swimmers' tunning-up for major events.

<HEADLINE> North China Corridor Enters New Development Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The corridor is a vital communications line as part of the new
Eurasian bridge, the strategic railway link with Europe. It
abounds in water, mineral, tourism, animal, plant, and solar
energy resources and has a major role in northwestern Chinese
development.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial government development plan, the net
per capita income of farmers there will increase from 2,270 yuan
in 1998 to 4,500 yuan by the year 2003 and agricultural value-
added output will go from 9.2 billion yuan to 18.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To do this, focus will be on developing water-saving, high-tech,
and ecologically-sound agriculture and building small towns and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The corridor has undergone two major development phases since
the founding of new China in 1949: a large-scale water-control
project in the '60s and '70s that helped solve the basic food
problems of local people and the "liang xi" (Hexi and Dingxi)
construction project that began in the '80s that made the corridor
one of the country's important grain producers, giving most
farmers there a better life.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Searchers Confirm Wreckage as Missing Marine Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Air Force search team
Thursday found the wreckage of a Marine Corps jet missing in
Alaska State, but the Air Force said it hadn't found any sign of
the pilot.
</P>
<P>
A helicopter lifted the team to examine the wreckage at about 2,
100 meters north of Mount Deborah, 130 kilometers south of
Fairbanks. The search had been hampered by heavy snow, wind and
low-lying clouds, Air Force spokesman Angel Newman said.
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps F/A-18C Hornet fighter, with only the pilot
aboard, was participating in Northern Edge, a joint military
training exercise, when it was reported missing Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The jet was one of two flying from Eielson Air Force Base near
Fairbanks. The other jet returned safely to Eielson.

<HEADLINE> Young Chinese Swimmers for Short-course World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Swimming Association
(CSA) has announced a young-blood squad for next month's Short-
course (25 meters pool) world championships slated for the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
China's top female swimmer Chen Yan, double gold medalist from
last year's long-course (Olympic-sized 50 meters pool)
championships in Perth was surprisingly not listed.
</P>
<P>
Team manager Yang Xinsheng explained that, ever since Chen's
ill-plaqued performance at the Bangkok Asian Games, she has been
in the process of a special treatment for stomach illness back at
her hometown Shenyang in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 male and 15 female athletes of the team are world
champions and runners-up from the previous short-course world
championships in Gothenburg, Sweden, last year's long-course world
championships in Perth and winners at the Asian Games last
December in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
CSA officials had kept themselves low-keyed for China's show at
the first short-course world swimming championships ever held in
Asia, saying that the February 1-4 event in Hong Kong SAR would
only be part of Chinese swimmers' preparations for the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese performance at the three previous short-course
championships had been impressive, which proved that training
sessions in short pools had long been the key part of Chinese
swimmers' tunning-up for major events.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Issue Big Bonds for Industry Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
issue two big bonds in local currency and dollar this month for
funding country's industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The local currency bond worth 10 billion taka (206 million U.S.
dollars) is for businessmen while the dollar bond worth 200
million U.S. dollars is for expatriate Bangladeshis, Finance
Minister A.M.S. Kabria disclosed while inaugurating a trade fair
in Sylhet city, 208 km northeast of here Thursday, said press
reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
A congenial atmosphere is essential for expanded foreign
investment and improvement of the country's economy, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector was seriously hit by last year's
century-worst floods in the country, with the growth rate
estimated at only 4.7 percent in the current fiscal year (July
1998-June 1999).
</P>
<P>
The government has taken a series of measures to revitalize the
industrial sector.

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- French Open champion Carlos
Moya remained in the hunt for Pete Sampras's number one ranking by
advancing to the quarter-finals of the 2.45 million US dollars
Champions Cup in Indian Wells, California on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seeded Spaniard, the only player out of a handful

</P>
<P>
Yet, sixth seed Marcelo Rios of Chile, who briefly overtook
Sampras last year, was ousted 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 by 11th seed Todd
Martin while Malisse had upset three-time Wimbledon runner-up
Goran Ivanisevic in the previous round.
</P>
<P>
Moya who needs only to reach the final to seize the top ranking,
saying "I think I would be happy if every day it would happen the
same, that I have this feeling if I win two matches, I'm number
one."

Spaniard Felix Mantilla, who stunned Sampras in the second
round, was beaten by American qualifier Chris Woodruff 7-5, 7-5,
who will face seventh seed Tim Henman, a winner of 6-4, 2-6, 6-4
over 10th-seeded fellow Briton Greg Rusedski.
</P>
<P>
Martin next faces big-serving Australian Mark Philippoussis, a
6-4 6-3 third-round winner over lanky Russian Marat Safin.
</P>
<P>
The other quarter-finals pit Moya against 12th seed Karol

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Agrees to Try KR Leaders at Local Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
president of Cambodia's National Assembly and FUNCINPEC party,
said Friday that he does not oppose the trying of Ta Mok and other
former Khmer Rouge (KR) leaders at a Cambodian court.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the New Zealand ambassador to Cambodia,
Ranariddh said it would be too long to wait for an international
tribunal to be set up. "We have no enough time and money to wait,
so we can hold a local trial while asking some foreign legal
experts to take part," he said.
</P>
<P>
It appears to be the first time Prince Ranariddh has expressed
his support for the establishment of a Cambodian court to try the
KR leaders. Ranariddh also insisted it is necessary for the KR
leaders to be tried.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ranariddh said he felt that trying former KR leaders
for alleged crimes against humanity was "unavoidable." "In
principle, we cannot avoid a tribunal. We need national
reconciliation, but we also need justice," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cambodia's opposition party Sam Rainsy Party (SRP)
resolutely opposes the trying of the KR leaders at home.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Friday, the SRP's 15 parliamentarians put in
writing a question to the government about the prosecution of KR
leaders and asked for the holding of a public debate on this
sensitive issue at the National Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Drought Emergency Declared in Texas, U.S. </HEADLINE>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush
Thursday declared emergency in 167 of the 254 counties in the U.S.
state, which has had well below-normal rainfall since this year.
</P>
<P>
"I think we ought to pray for rain," Bush said, as state
officials reported that farmers and ranchers are already being
hurt and reservoir levels are dropping.
</P>
<P>
Bush said federal aid is needed to pay for the transport of
fire-fighting equipment to areas that may soon need it.
</P>
<P>
The Texas Forest Service said fire danger is increasing across
central and western Texas, much of which never recovered from a
summertime drought in 1998, sparking more than 10,000 wildfires
and devastating the state's major crops.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the same point today that we were in May and June
last year," said Forest Service Director Jim Hull, who described
conditions as "desperate."
</P>
<P>
Farmers and ranchers, still struggling from last year's losses,
are reporting new problems. Boll weevils -- beetles that destroy
cotton -- are proliferating because cash-strapped farmers cannot
pay for chemicals to eradicate them. Hay for livestock feed is
also in short supply.
</P>
<P>
If another drought materializes, it will be the third in four
years for the nation's second-largest state.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House voted
bipartisan support late Thursday for President Bill Clinton's
Kosovo policy, foiling a Republican-led effort to oppose sending U.
S. troops to the war-torn Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had warned that such a restriction, even though non-
binding, could have jeopardized already-endangered peace talks due
to resume in Paris next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 219 to 191 for a resolution expressing general
support for the administration's use of U.S. troops, if necessary,
as part of a NATO peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
But it attached some strings -- urging Clinton to report to
Congress on the duration and the cost of such a deployment.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Adds background information U.S. House Supports Clinton's Kosovo Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House voted across
party lines to support President Bill Clinton's Kosovo policy
after a heated debate Thursday night, foiling a Republican-led
effort to oppose sending U.S. troops to the war-torn Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had warned that such a restriction could have
jeopardized the already-endangered peace talks due to resume in
Paris next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 219 to 191 for a resolution expressing general
support for the administration's use of U.S. troops, if necessary,
as part of a NATO peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
But it attached some conditions -- urging Clinton to report to
Congress on the duration and cost of such a deployment.
</P>
<P>
The final approval came after the House turned aside, on a 237
to 178 vote, a proposal by Republican Lawmaker Tillie Fowler to
protest any American troop engagement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Clinton, in Guatemala for a meeting with
Central American leaders, had said the debate was premature at a
time when the peace agreement had not yet been achieved.
</P>
<P>
He has proposed sending up to 4,000 Americans to Kosovo as part
of a 28,000-member NATO peacekeeping force if an agreement is
reached to end the yearlong war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Neither the ethnic Albanian nor Serbia has agreed to sign such
an agreement. U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke returned from Belgrade
on Thursday after failing to persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to accept foreign troops in Serb-ruled Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers expressed fear that the deployment could lead to
another open-ended engagement in the former Yugoslavia like the
one in Bosnia. Even though Clinton said in late 1995 that U.S
troops would be in Bosnia for one year, about 6,900 U.S. troops
remain today as a part of the 32,000-strong peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands
driven from their homes in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up
90 percent of the population.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Rise Sharply at Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Wool prices
strengthened sharply at auctions this week, with moments of
near-panic buying.
</P>
<P>
Prices increased by more than five percent on average at sales
in Sydney and Melbourne and around seven percent in western
Australia's Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Industries Secretariat (AWIS) said the
increase, which follows steady increases over past weeks, was far
higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
"A supply squeeze arising from continuing concerns about the
availability in the short term of finer fleece wool with good
strength ... appears to be the main reason for the sharp rise in
prices this week," AWIS said in its weekly report.
</P>
<P>
"There were moments of near panic buying on Wednesday, but the
pace slowed down significantly on Thursday."
</P>
<P>
Wesfarmers Dalgety said in its weekly report that a price
squeeze had been caused by lower offerings towards Easter.
</P>
<P>
"The sharp jump in prices comes from most interests in the
trade being active and several of the larger exporters competing
aggressively," Wesfarmers said.
</P>
<P>
The AWEX Eastern market indicator gained 26 Australian cents to
finish the week at 528 cents/kg clean.
</P>
<P>
This was based on increases of 25 and 26 cents in the north and
south respectively which resulted in their corresponding regional
indicators ending the week at 540 Australian cents and 517
cents/kg clean.
</P>
<P>
The western region indicator rose by 31 cents to 477 cents/kg
clean.
</P>
<P>
A total of 73,090 bales were offered for sale, with 9.6 percent
passed in, comprising nine percent in Sydney, 8.1 percent in
Melbourne and 10.9 percent in Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
AWIS said that with a relatively small offering of 48,500 bales
in Sydney and Melbourne next week, the market was expected to
remain firm.
</P>
<P>
"But it will face a tougher test in the following week where an
auction offering of close to 100,000 bales could eventuate prior
to a two week Easter recess."
</P>
<P>
An unknown factor in prices after the Easter break is whether
more bales could be released from the grower stockpile because of
the improvement in prices.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Attack Suspects Wanted in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police headquarters
Thursday night sent out an alert to all police stations in the
country for four suspects wanted in connection with a grenade
attack on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ten suspects have been reportedly arrested for two grenade
attacks which occurred after a rally of the ruling People's
Alliance at Kurunduwatte town in Gampola, Central Province, a
local newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police have issued notices calling for their immediate
surrender. The wanted persons include the main opposition United
National Party (UNP) MP A.R.M. Abdul Cader and three UNP Central
Province candidates, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A dusk-to-dawn curfew has been declared in the election
violence-ridden Gampola area where serious clashes broke out
between government and UNP supporters following the attack which
killed one person and injured 31 others.
</P>
<P>
The attack is the first fatal incident since the North Western
Provincial Council poll early this year which was ridden with
election violence. Five more provincial council elections are due
on April 6, and the election campaign is heating up across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The army has also been mobilized to ensure security in the
area, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Habibie's Personal Envoy to Visit S'pore, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President BJ Habibie
is sending Muslim leader Abdurranhman Wahid as a personal emissary
to Singapore to help patch up souring ties between the two
countries, the Business Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Business Times, carrying a report from Jakarta, quoted a
top presidential aide to Habibie as telling the newspaper on
Thursday that the move is also aimed at stemming the growing tide
within the Habibie cabinet to foster closer ties with Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
While the details of the trip are still unclear, Wahid,
popularly known as Gus Dur, is expected to meet Singapore Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew and other Singapore government leaders, the
English newspaper quoted Habibie's economic adviser Frans Seda as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Habibie wants to send a signal to Singapore that despite the
recent friction between the two neighbors, he personally has no
problems with fostering better ties with Singapore, Seda said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the political mood in Indonesia that is turning
against the conglomerates which have close links with Singapore,
Seda was quoted as saying: "It is not against Singapore but
against the conglomerates and people know that they can only
operate with Singapore's backing."
</P>
<P>
Seda said certain members of the cabinet were keen to move
closer to Malaysia given Indonesia's new economic policy of
empowering cooperatives and small and medium-sized enterprises
under the People's Economic Concept.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Indonesia and Singapore started to cool in
early 1998 when Habibie reacted unfavorably to comments by
Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew concerning then Indonesian
president Soeharto's criterion for choosing his vice-president,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties continued to deteriorate after Habibie assumed
the presidency, as the two neighbors often traded criticism and
disputed over a series of bilateral problems.

<HEADLINE> Water Falls Further as Drought continues in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 12 (Xinhua)-- Prolonged drought is causing water
levels to fall further in Vietnam's northern central provinces and
the Central Highlands, official media Friday quoted forecasters as
warning.
</P>
<P>
Although light rain and drizzle may fall in march, the drought
in six northern central provinces and two provinces in the Central
Highlands is likely to continue causing a shortage of water for
daily use, production and crops, said officials at the National
Meteorology Forecast Center.
</P>
<P>
Water levels are expected to be 30 to 50 percent lower than
average.
</P>
<P>
The officials said Mekong Delta, Vietnam's major rice-growing
area, faces a critical shortage of water for the forthcoming
summer-autumn rice crop and the water in the Red River is an
estimated 0.2 m lower than average.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry has asked
officials in the drought-stricken provinces to devise urgent
measures to tackle the situation.
</P>
<P>
They have been asked to use their budgets prudently in
implementing measures to mitigate the effects of the drought and
ensure that householders have sufficient water.
</P>
<P>
About two million residents in 14 provinces face a shortage of
water.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Talks on free trade between
Mexico and the European Union (EU) are proceeding well and they
are expected to conclude within this year, an EU communique
released here on Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, aimed at concluding an accord on economic
association, political settlement and cooperation, are going on
quickly in the third round of bilateral negotiations under way in
Brussels, Belgium, according to the communique issued by the EU
delegate in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the negotiations, Mexico has
presented a long list of excluded industries, among which are the
textile and automobile sectors.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has proposed a slower pace: 40 percent for immediate
liberalization, 6 percent by the year 2003 and the rest within 10
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU hopes to put the pact on "the fast track,"
considering the trade liberalization within the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
An EU official said that the two sides are looking for "a
middle point" of bilateral respect, while meeting the World Trade
Organization (WTO)'s demand of not excluding more than 20 percent
of each sectors from trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will conclude the third round of talks on Friday
and meet again in April in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the EU's trade with Mexico has dropped by half.
Mexico's access to the EU market has also fallen, with 85 percent
of its commerce going to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Effective Means Urged to Protect Consumers' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers need to be
provided with more effective means to protect their rights and
interests, today's China Daily quoted an official with China
Consumer Association (CCA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 54 percent of the respondents to a recent survey
conducted by CCA and the Guangzhou Hualing Air-Conditioning
Equipment Co. said they were victims of substandard food and
consumer goods last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 75 percent of the surveyed consumers
cited fake products as the major cause of problems; 54 percent
blamed deceptive advertising and 39 percent felt cheated when they
bought bad quality products, said Zhang Jiang, director of CCA's
Consultation Department.
</P>
<P>
Asked about ways to settle the issue, more than 45 percent of
respondents said they want the commodity changed as well as an
indemnity.
</P>
<P>
Still, 35.2 percent of the consumers said they would not bother
to have the issue settled, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated a high level of awareness of the rights to
safety among consumers, especially among younger generation with
good educational background.
</P>
<P>
However, consumers have yet to acquire knowledge of relevant
laws and regulations to protect themselves, the survey found.

LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Thursday expressed his commitment to unilaterally declaring a
Palestinian state on May 4 following a meeting with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Arafat said May 4, the expiry of
the five-year interim phase of the 1994 Oslo peace accords, "is
for us a sacred date."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are now engaged in intensive consultations in the
Palestinian leadership and among our friends and interlocutors
internationally."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Downing Street spokesman said that Blair and
Arafat, who was on a one-day visit to Britain, mainly discussed
the Wye River agreement, brokered by the United States last year,
and the forthcoming Israeli elections.

"The prime minister wanted to speak to Yasser Arafat about
where that was going and urged him to implement the Palestinian

process, also underlined Britain's commitment to helping the

<HEADLINE> Petrol and Cotton to Remain Pillars of Xinjiang Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A leading official from northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region said here today that
Xinjiang has full confidence in overcoming current difficulties,
and will continue to focus on petrol and cotton industries in
spite of the sluggish market.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ongoing the Ninth National People's Congress
here, China's top legislature now in session, Chairman of People's
Government of Xinjiang Abdul'ahat Abdulrixit said Xinjiang's
pillar industries of petrol and cotton faced severe challenges of
sluggish market and continuous price drop last year as a result of
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"But we have full confidence in weathering the difficulties we
faced," the chairman said. "The output and sales of petrol already
started to pick up during the second half year of 1998 and expect
to keep the momentum this year as a result of a series of policies
including intensified crackdown on smuggling. Sales of cotton also
turned for the better," he added.
</P>
<P>
This year, Xinjiang, China's largest cotton producer, will
focus on quality in cotton production, and seek higher growing
efficiency but lower cost, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The official said petrol and cotton will continue to play a
vital and irreplaceable role in Xinjiang's economy. At present,
one fourth of the regional fiscal income come from oil and
petrochemical industries, and cotton, as an important income
source for local farmers, totaled more than 1.3 million tons last
year, accounting for one third of the national output and about
six percent of the world output.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang will continue to cater to market demand, focus on
quality and special products and further readjust the industrial
structure to promote the regional economy, the chairman said,
citing the region's special products such as fruit, livestock by-
products and tomato.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism will also receive a boost. Xinjiang is focusing on
developing two tourist routes for the present," he said. Xinjiang
cashed in more than 80 million U.S. dollars on 200,000 tourist
arrivals last year.

<HEADLINE> US Returns Rodman Naval Base to Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Panama City, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Stated started the
return of the Rodman Naval Base to Panamanian government on
Thursday, in accordance with the agenda established in the
Torrijos-Carter treaty signed on September 7, 1977.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares, US ambassador
Simon Ferro, Commander in Chief of America's Atlantic fleet Paul
Reason and Rodman's Commander Robert Bennett attended the
reversion ceremony here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Rodman Naval Base was established on the shores of Panama
Canal in 1943 during the World War II, and served as a naval
service facility.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will continue to return all remaining
military installations in Panama, which is planned to be completed
by December 31 with the return of Panama Canal to Panamanian
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
During the act of a symbolic handing over, Ferro, who is of
Cuban origin and recently named ambassador, emphasized Rodman's
economic importance.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that this project of private investment will serve to
accentuate the canal's attraction as a commercial route and help
the establishing of sea industries, contributing to Panama's
economic growth," Ferro said.
</P>
<P>

integration," President Balladares said during the ceremony. He

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Reaffirms Opposition to Deployment of NATO Troops in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic reaffirmed Thursday his government's opposition
to foreign troops helping to fulfill a political accord on solving
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
There was no need at all to have foreign troops on the
territories of the Federation of Yugoslavia for solving the Kosovo
crisis, he said during his meeting with the mediating Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
</P>
<P>
At their meeting, Jovanovic also briefed Ivanov the
preparations made by the Yugoslav delegation for the second round
of peace talks on Kosovo scheduled for March 15 in Paris, the
Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said foreign troops could be sent to Kosovo to observe
the fulfillment of a political agreement only if the Yugoslav
federal government agreed.
</P>
<P>
He said the second round of peace talks on Kosovo must end with
a political accord, while the necessary assistance provided by the
international community to observe the implementation of the peace
deal should be decided by Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Further armed clashes, in which one person died and six others
were injured, occurred on Thursday in the separatist province.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the Paris peace talks on March 15, attacks by the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) are increasing. Observers believe the
KLA intends to provide an excuse for NATO's military intervention
by stirring up large-scale conflict.

<HEADLINE> Six Bulgarian Medics Still Held by Libya in AIDS Infection Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Five nurses and one doctor from
Bulgaria are still detained by Libyan authorities in the probe of
an AIDS infection case in a Libyan hospital, one month after they
were arrested along with 13 colleagues, a Foreign Ministry
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lyudmil Spassov, head of the ministry's North Africa Department
who just returned from Tripoli, said the six Bulgarian citizens
were in good health and no charges have been brought against them.
</P>
<P>
The 19 Bulgarian medical workers, on an assistance mission in
the hospital in Benghazi, northeastern Libya, were arrested on
February 10 and subjected to AIDS tests after cases of the disease
were registered in that hospital. No legal grounds were given for
the arrests but Tripoli said they were wanted for investigation
into the AIDS infection.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said that these Bulgarians were in trouble
with the Libyan authorities for divulging information of cases of
AIDS, whose existence in Libya had been officially denied by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports had said 15 of the detained were released.
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we were told by the Libyan authorities, and it
is said in an official document, is that the six Bulgarians are
cooperating in the investigation and that no charges have been
brought against them," said Spassov. "With this document the
Libyan authorities guarantee their safety."
</P>
<P>
A Bulgarian working group is now in Libya to look into the
incident while the Bulgarian Ambassador to Libya, Krustyu Ilov, is
expected to be dismissed for failing to protect the interests of
Bulgarian nationals, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry plans to dispatch a charge d'affaires to
Tripoli within 10 days, he said.

<HEADLINE> Legislator Calls for Enactment of Biological Security Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese legislator today called
for the early enactment of a law on biological security, which he
said will help the country to meet challenges posed by the rapid
development of genetic engineering and clone technology.
</P>
<P>
"Mankind has already been able to reform the hereditary
features of a living being and create new species of
microorganisms, crops and animals," said Chen Zhangliang, a deputy
to the Ninth National People's Congress, China's top legislature
in session here since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is even possible to work on the embryo and hereditary
substances of human being, added Chen, 38, a professor of
biological engineering and vice president of the prestigious
Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, many countries in the world have
enacted laws or regulations on genetic engineering and biological
security, which can help decide whether genetic engineering
products can be massively produced or be used by the mankind," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
In China today, many bio-engineering labs including his have
also developed a large number of genetic engineering crops, most
of which have been planted in testing fields for further study,
said Chen.
</P>
<P>
"It is already high time for the state to work out a law in
this field," he urged.
</P>
<P>
What's more important, there must be a law with explicit
stipulations on whether research can be done on human hereditary
substances and genetic engineering of human embryo and how far it
can go, the professor added.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUATEMALA CITY, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President
Bill Clinton and his Guatemalan counterpart Alvaro Arzu held a
private meeting Thursday morning to evaluate bilateral relations
in Antigua.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Arzu exchanged views on issues such as trade, drug
trafficking and migration, a joint communique said.
</P>
<P>
They also talked about reconstruction in Guatemala, which
hurricane Mitch hit last November.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed the peace accords signed by the
guerrilla forces and the Guatemalan government in December 1996,
when Washington promised to give political and financial support.
</P>
<P>
Arzu also asked the U.S. president to reconsider the decision
to resume deportation of undocumented Guatemalans and Salvadorans
living in the United States, as the measure would worsen the
economic situation caused by Mitch.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service announced last
Monday that repatriation of undocumented Guatemalans and
Salvadorans, suspended since last December, would be renewed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is on a four-country tour to highlight U.S. efforts in
helping Central America recover from Mitch effects, which left at
least 9,000 people dead.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day tour, Clinton has visited Nicaragua,
Honduras, Salvador and Guatemala. He also attended a summit
meeting with Central American heads of state.

WARSAW, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Poland's border police have
arrested a 29-member gang which smuggled 3,800 illegal immigrants
to Western countries over more than two years, a police spokesman
announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the gang members were all foreigners living in
Poland. They include Somalis, Bangladeshis, Indians, Afghans,
Jordanians and the Sudanese who dealt mainly with emigrants from
their own countries.
</P>
<P>
The gang usually transported these immigrants from eastern and
southern Poland to Warsaw's suburban areas, and moved them to the
country's western border points, and then shipped them at night to
Germany via the Neisse River.
</P>
<P>
They charged 5,000 U.S. dollars from each immigrant, the police
said.

<HEADLINE> Amending Constitution Guarantees Rule of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua)-- Deputies to the National People's
Congress, China's highest legislative body which has been in
session here since last Friday, are of the unanimous view that the
amending of the Constitution is an important measure to speed up
the process of governing the country according to law.
</P>
<P>
The draft Constitutional amendments set the principle of rule
of law as a basic state strategy which will guarantee that the
democratic system and laws will not change because of the changes
of the leadership, or because of the changes of their views and
focus of attention, they said.
</P>
<P>
This is a historic progress which will be conducive to the
country's long-term stability and prosperity, many deputies
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Fulin, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Regional People's Congress, said the draft
amendments define the non-public economic sector including the
self-employed and private businesses as important components of
the socialist market economy and will enshrine them in the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The move will certainly further boost the healthy development
of the sector," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the deputies called for the early enactment of a
supervision law as well as an effective mechanism for deputies to
exercise their constitutional right to supervise the execution of
the law since power abuse and law-breaking are not uncommon.

<HEADLINE> Wealthier Chinese Spending Less Time on Housework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A recent study has shown that
Chinese living in more economically advanced areas spend less time
on housework than do those living in poorer areas.
</P>
<P>
The People's University study of nearly 5,000 people aged 15 to
75 in 40 Chinese cities was intended to show how urbanites spend
their time.
</P>
<P>
It found that wealthier people in the southern city of
Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, spend 111 minutes on
housework every day, compared with 130 minutes for people in
Beijing, 143 minutes in Nanjing, and 160 minutes in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that when living conditions improve people spend
less time on housework. Beijing residents, for example, spend 46
minutes less on housework than they did 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that people who make less than 200 yuan (
24 US dollars) a month spend 181 minutes on housework every day,
while those earning more than 2,500 yuan spend only 59 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Dini Says Italy Wants to Boost Trade With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said Thursday that Iran is of great interest to Italian firms,
noting that trade with this Middle East nation appear to be "
rebalancing".
</P>
<P>
Hosting a meeting between visiting Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami and leading Italian businessmen, Dini said he hoped that
Iran will soon ratify the accord to boost and protect Italian
investments, which was signed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Italy ran up a trade deficit of almost 600 billion lire (about
350 million U.S. dollars) in the first 11 months of 1998, and it
is Iran's main trading partner after Japan.
</P>
<P>
Dini pointed out that conditions for trade with Iran are
improving, as signaled by last week's deal of one billion dollars
for Italy's oil and chemical giant Eni to develop an Iranian oil
field with the Elf firm of France.
</P>
<P>
Iran is Italy's third largest oil supplier, after Libya and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Dini also noted that it was in Iran's interest to create stable
conditions to attract investment.
</P>
<P>
Italy already has several projects in Iran, led by steel
industry equipment-maker Danieli, which has accrued some 1.2
billion dollars worth of business in the country since the mid-
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Dini hailed the importance of Khatami's three-day visit to
Italy, citing "the high level of the talks" and the fact that they
were "open to all issues of common interest", as well as "the
breadth of contacts and the importance of the documents approved".
</P>
<P>
Khatami, the first Iranian leader to visit Europe since the
1979 overthrow of the Shah, was scheduled to end his visit on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Russia Insists on Belgrade's Consent to Military Forces in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here on Thursday that any deployment of military
forces in the Serbian province of Kosovo must first be approved by
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before flying to Belgrade,
Ivanov said the Kosovo issue must come to a political settlement
as soon as possible. The resumption of peace talks between the
Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Paris on March 15 was particularly
important.
</P>
<P>
"This should end in Paris with the signing of the political
document which envisages granting a broad autonomy to Kosovo,
respecting the territorial integrity of the Yugoslav side," Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's plan to
station peace-keeping forces in Kosovo, Ivanov said that the
International Contact Group on former Yugoslavia had decided on
the mandate of the Rambouillet talks during their meeting in
London, and that was to help the conflicting sides in Kosovo to
strike a political agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said measures to monitor the implementation of the agreement,
including the deployment of military forces, were not a component
of the final documents prepared by the Contact Group, but only a
proposal by some of the countries in the group.
</P>
<P>
When the Serb and ethnic Albanian representatives return to the
negotiating table in Paris, the Russian foreign minister said,
they should sign the document proposed by the international
contact group, namely, the political part of the Rambouillet
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade's position must be taken into account before taking
any measures to ensure the implementation of the peace deal, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"If Belgrade gives its consent for the organization of a (
military) implementation operation, Russia will be ready to
examine its participation," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same press conference, Albanian Foreign
Minister Paskal Milo reiterated his call for a political
settlement of the Kosovo issue and the deployment of NATO forces
to police the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day stay in Albania, Ivanov also met Albanian
President Rexhep Meidani, Speaker of the parliament Skender
Gjinushi and Prime Minister Pandel Majko.

LHASA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- One of the most important jobs of
Nyima Cering, a 31-year-old lama at the Johnkang Monastery, is
telling about its history and religion to Chinese and foreign
tourists.
</P>
<P>
In both English and Mandarin, Nyima Cering, in his red robe,
has been called the "spokesman" of the Johnkang Monastery, which
was built in 647 A.D. in the center of Lhasa, by the local people.
</P>
<P>
He was one of the first group of 9 lamas to study English in
Tibet in 1986 and is now head of the monastery's Foreign Affairs
Office and deputy head of the Tibetan Buddhist Association. Along
with 7 other lamas, he acts as a tourist guide for as many as
several hundred tourists every day and describes its history and
the changes in the region since the reforms of 1959.
</P>
<P>
Tibet had over 380,000 Chinese and overseas tourists in 1998.
The lama attributes these numbers to the country's opening-up and
reform policy that began in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Although he wears a brand new quartz watch, he says that he
likes the religious robe very much and that it will never go out
of fashion. As a monastery spokesman, he wants Chinese and
overseas visitors to learn more about Tibetan culture and
religious beliefs. more

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Predicts Budget Deficit of 58 Mln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government expects
a budget deficit of 500 billion rupiah (about 58 million U.S.
dollars) for the 1998/1999 fiscal year ending March 31, Minister
of Finance Bambang Subianto said.
</P>
<P>
Bambang said actual revenues were expected to be around 215.1
trillion rupiah, 18.5 percent lower than budgeted, while actual
spending was estimated at 215.6 trillion rupiah, 18.3 percent
lower than planned.
</P>
<P>
In a parliamentary meeting to discuss amendments to the
1998/1999 State Budget on Thursday, Bambang said that in order to
balance the budget, the government has taken loans from bilateral
and multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
The international institutions include the World Bank, the
Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
But he added that the international aid was being released
slower than expected.
</P>
<P>
The government had only received 51 percent of the targeted
overseas development funds. The lower amount was particularly
attributed to administrative problems and difficulties, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There has also been a delay in the disbursement of the
external loans," he was quoted by national newspapers Friday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been slow in implementing various economic reform
programs due to several factors, including the fear of corruption,
the Jakarta Post said, adding that this in turn has slowed the
disbursement of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The disbursement of the social safety net fund, for example,
will have to be extended until June because of the slow
implementation of the multi-billion U.S. dollar program, which is
designed to help the poor survive the current economic crisis, the
paper said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Debates on Troop Deployment in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Republican-dominated House
pushed ahead on Thursday with a congressional debate on whether to
deploy U.S. troops in Kosovo, despite the Clinton administration's
objection.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, who called the debate, said it
was his duty as speaker "to ensure that all have opportunity to
openly debate the issue before U.S. troops are sent into a
potentially dangerous situation."
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the debate noted that parliaments of Britain and
Germany had debated the issue and that it was vital to allow the
people, through their representatives, to speak before a deadline
set for the end of the peace talks on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There have been powerful arguments expressed against U.S.
deployment in Kosovo. Many Republicans said that U.S. forces are
being stretched too thin around the world, that the mission would
be too dangerous and that it had no "exit strategy."
</P>
<P>
"We're about to get ourselves in the middle of a civil war,"
said House Republican leader Dick Armey, who opposed the
deployment.
</P>
<P>
Some others said settling Balkan conflicts should be left to
the Europeans and that air strikes against Yugoslav military
positions would be in effect a declaration of war against a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
But Democrats strongly opposed the debate, which could end up
with a vote against sending troops to Kosovo, saying this would
signal to both parties in the Kosovo conflict "a weakening of U.S.
resolve."
</P>
<P>
House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt said that holding the
debate now was the "height of irresponsibility." "We all know we
are at a very delicate moment in the Kosovo peace negotiations,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be debating this matter while our diplomats at
this moment are seeking to convince the parties to this conflict
to lay down their weapons and choose the path of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton, now in Guatemala on his last
leg of the four-day trip to four Central American nations, warned
Congress against doing anything to derail the Kosovo peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the House will act in a way that supports our efforts
to achieve a strong peace agreement," Clinton said at a news
conference in Antigua, Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't end the conflict now, it will spread, and when it
does we will not be able to avoid participating in stopping it,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The House will vote on the U.S. deployment in Kosovo on
Thursday or Friday morning. Any result will have no binding on
Clinton's decision on Kosovo.

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia will host the 2002
women's field hockey World Cup while Malaysia will hold the men's
tournament, the International Hockey Federation (IHF) said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The women's tournament will be held in Perth, Australia, and
the men's event in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, said IHF president Juan
Angel Calzado.
</P>
<P>
The bidding process was a close contest among three cities of
Brussels, Kuala Lumpur and Barcelona for the men's event, while
Perth edged out Brussels for the women's event, Calzado said.
</P>
<P>
The men's 2002 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur's Bukit Jalil National
Hockey Stadium will be a 16-team event for the first time and is
provisionally scheduled for February/March as Kuala Lumpur becomes
the first city ever to host two men's World Cups.
</P>
<P>
Brussels had sought to hold a combined men's and women's event
but missed out with both its bids.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 World Cup, held in the Netherlands, was the first to
combine the men's and women's tournaments.
</P>
<P>
The Perth tournament is provisionally slated for October.

<HEADLINE> Romania Takes Measures to Fight Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government issued
an emergency decree Thursday calling on the whole country to take
effective measures against the millennium bug in order to reduce
any possible damage or costs.
</P>
<P>
The decree said that the state committee set up to cope with
the problem will be in charge of coordination throughout the
country while government departments at various levels are
responsible of solving their own problems.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, state budget units and big companies are to
work out concrete anti-millennium-bug plans and submit them to the
above-mentioned committee within 30 days after the decree takes
effect.
</P>
<P>
The decree also asked other institutions and enterprises to
work out an action plan which gives a list of hardware and
software of their computer systems, estimates the possible risks
and decides on key systems to be solved first.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the action plan has to provide revision and
replacement schemes and estimate the manpower and funds needed to
complete the task.
</P>
<P>
The decree made it clear that all hardware and software
imported to solve the millennium bug will be exempt from customs
duty.
</P>
<P>
With the approach of year 2000, the technical defects with the
date-keeping of the current computer systems might cause severe
damage to national economy, state security and social stability if
no precautionary measures are taken, the decree warned.

<HEADLINE> School Flexibility Plans Pass in U.S. House, Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Schools in the United States
will get greater freedom in how they spend federal education money
under measures passed by the House and Senate Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill -- in a move that angered some Democrats who
nevertheless voted for the measure -- contained a provision that
would allow states to shift money slated for President Bill
Clinton's new-teachers plan to special education instead, possibly
affecting checks heading out this fall.
</P>
<P>
The bill would let states and school districts apply money for
certain federal programs to other programs that serve their
students best. For example, schools could use federal money meant
for science and math teachers to boost reading instruction, if
that's what they need.
</P>
<P>
The bill, the first education measures of this Congress,
initially enjoyed strong bipartisan support, but quickly became a
battleground for each party's efforts to put its own mark on the
nation's education policy.
</P>
<P>
Democrats had wanted the measure to include Clinton's education
proposals, chiefly more money to help schools hire new teachers
and reduce the class size. But Republicans insisted those
proposals should be raised later in the year and not bog down the
bill.
</P>
<P>
In last fall's spending bill, Congress in a compromise approved
1.2 billion U.S. dollars to help schools hire about 30,000 new
teachers in the early grades. Clinton wants a total of 100,000 new
teachers hired over seven years at a cost of more than 11 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
After a week-long deadlock, Senate leaders agreed to allow
votes on the Democratic class-size proposals, only to shoot them
down.

<HEADLINE> Wolves Guard Marbury to Sign Deal with Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Minnesota Timberwolves guard
Stephon Marbury said today he has been traded to the New Jersey
Nets and will sign a contract extension with the team.
</P>
<P>
Marbury told WFAN Radio he was traded to the Nets for guard Sam
Cassell and forwards Chris Gatling and Brian Evans. He added that
he has spoken to Nets owner Lewis Katz and will sign an extension
before the Saturday deadline.
</P>
<P>
Both teams refused to confirm the trade to the radio station
and have yet to return telephone calls made by SportsTicker. It is
believed the Nets will receive other players to satisfy salary cap
rules regarding trades.
</P>
<P>
It is the third straight season the Nets have made a deal on
the deadline day. They have the Eastern Conference's worst record
at 3-15 and were expected to do something to shake things up.
</P>
<P>
It is the second huge deal in as many days.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Lakers acquired All-Star forward
Glen Rice from Charlotte in a five-player deal that sent All-Star
guard Eddie Jones to the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Marbury is in the final season of a three-year,
6.7 million US dollars contract he signed with Minnesota as the
fourth pick in the 1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
He is averaging 17.7 points and 9.3 assists in 18 games,
teaming with All-Star forward Kevin Garnett to lead the Wolves to
a 12-6 mark.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for 1996 first-round picks to sign extensions is
Saturday. The maximum Marbury could receive is 71 million US
dollars over six years.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Budget Gap Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- As a result of its continued
pump-priming efforts, the Philippine government's budget deficit
worsened to 226.50 million U.S. dollars last month, from 178.45
million U.S. dollars in January, the Business World said Friday.
</P>
<P>
But rather than make them worry, government financial managers
were relieved as the actual deficit was substantially lower than
the 384.1 million U.S. dollars programmed for the period, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Treasury was quoted as saying that government
expenditures in February amounted to only 889.03 million U.S.
dollars, 8.7 percent less than the 973.45 million U.S. dollars
programmed for the period.
</P>
<P>
Tighter control on expenditures and containing the budget
deficit will help the government reduce the upward pressure on
cost of funds and prices of basic goods, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Last January, the government exceeded its budget deficit
ceiling of 149.13 million U.S. dollar for the month, which
government officials blamed on payments of accounts receivables
inherited from the previous administration, it said.

SOFIA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has refused to receive a
delegation of legislators from Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania and
Hungary, a Bulgarian delegation leader said on Wednesday evening.
</P>

Assen Agov, chairman of the Bulgarian parliament's foreign

Greek Foreign Minister Georgios Papandreou pledged to convey to
the authorities in Belgrade the message of the Bulgarian,
Macedonian, Romanian and Hungarian legislators that its refusal to
receive their delegation was a mistake.

"We are in favor of a peaceful settlement to the crisis in
Kosovo through an agreement and readiness to accept peacekeeping
forces of the international community which will implement it,"

<HEADLINE> Exports of Rare Animals Rise in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The black market and illegal
export of wildlife and endangered animals in Indonesia have risen
sharply in recent years, the Indonesian Observer reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, legal exports were valued at 1.4 million U.S.
dollars, while illegal exports were predicted 10 times greater,
said Darmawan Liswanto, coordinator of the non-government
organization (NGO) Wildlife Supervisory Network.
</P>
<P>
"We assume the illegal exports reached 13 million U.S. dollars
last year and the condition is getting worse," he said after
meeting with 39 other NGOs on flora and fauna in Bandung, capital
of West Java province, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the illegal trading was committed by livestock and pet
traders.
</P>
<P>
"It all happens because of the weakness of the law
enforcement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has reasonably strict laws and regulations on
protecting wildlife, but their implementation does not run well,
Liswanto said.
</P>
<P>
"The traders usually use any trick to escape with protected
animals overseas," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are 77 endangered species under regulation protection,
from the families of mammals, reptiles, and birds. The animals
should only be moved from their natural habitat for certain
purposes such as medical and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The team from the Wildlife Supervisory Network has discovered
that some wild animal traders use the scam that the protected
animals to be sent abroad are intended for such a purpose. "But
the number they send is more than what is needed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liswanto said that if there was no real action to stop the
trade in wild animals, some species of birds, mammals and reptiles
would quickly become extinct.
</P>
<P>
The 40 NGOs, both local and international, called on the
government to strengthen the implementation of the regulations to
protect wildlife.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The board of directors of Ecuador's
Central Bank resigned Thursday as a nationwide strike protesting
the government's economic policies entered its second day.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank President Luis Jacome, who also quit his post, has
been under attack for allowing Ecuador's currency, the sucre, to
float last month, causing its value to dive sharply by 83 percent.
</P>
<P>
Banks across the country remained closed for the fourth
consecutive day after President Jamil Mahuad ordered an emergency
bank holiday to prevent mass withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two days, police have arrested 235 demonstrators,
using tear gas to disperse protesters, while the government
imposed a 48-hour state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators, led by Ecuador's trade unions, want the
government to change its austerity economic measures, announced by
Mahuad last September, which include cuts for fuel subsidies and a
wage freeze.
</P>
<P>
The strike has paralyzed public transport in the capital city
and led to losses of up to 120 million U.S. dollars to the
country's businesses.

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States will skip
the World Table Tennis Championships next month in Belgrade for
security reasons, USA Table Tennis officials confirmed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
David Huggins, the association's director of communications,
hoped that the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) would
change the venue for the April 26-May 9 championships as it had
also strongly recommended that its ITTF delegates and committee
members not attend meetings in Belgrade.

<P>
"These decisions were reached because our association is
fearful for the safety of the individuals on our team and our
delegation in Belgrade," the USATT said in a letter to world
championship organisers.
</P>
<P>
"These concerns arise because of the current political
situation in the region and our perception that hostilities and/or
terrorist activities may be possible in the near future."
</P>

Germany also decided not to participate in the championships
and Sweden is not sending an official team, although it is

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on Thursday
approved a resolution urging President Bill Clinton to oppose any
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"The president should unequivocally assert United States
opposition to the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state ...
and that a declared state would not be recognized by the United
States," said the resolution passed by the Senate 98 to one.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives was expected to vote on a similar
resolution next week, a spokesman for the House International
Relations Committee said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat was scheduled to meet
Clinton later this month in Washington for talks on the issue of a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said he has the right to declare an independent
state on May 4, the deadline set in the 1993 Oslo peace accord
with Israel for a permanent settlement. But he might delay the
move in light of the May 17 election in Israel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and European officials have urged Arafat to postpone any
unilateral declaration at least until after the Israeli election
as it was feared that his declaration would be a boost for hard-
line Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bid for re-
election.

more than doubled from 1994 to 1998, the Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said losses from tax evasion, theft, extortion,
robbery, embezzlement and other economic crimes were up from 46.6
billion forints (203 million U.S. dollars) in 1994 to 120.4
billion forints (523 million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Budapest, with one fifth of the country's population, has
become a center for economic crime. Half of the total losses from
those crimes involved the capital.
</P>
<P>
Last year, police recovered only 17.1 billion forints (74.3
million dollars) in loss.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chief Prosecutor Gyorgy Kalman told congressmen that
bank robbery and extortion were increasing.

<HEADLINE> Abducted Philippine Police Officer Cleared by Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The rebel New People's Army (NPA)
has cleared abducted police inspector Roberto Bernal of any
criminal wrongdoing and may soon release him, the Philippine Star
newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Philippine National Police chief deputy director Roberto
Lastimoso was quoted as saying that "the release is forthcoming."
</P>
<P>
Lastimoso said Bernal, who was abducted last February 21, has
been acquitted by the NPA's "court" of spying, multiple murder and
drug trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
"He is no longer a prisoner of war but a simple hostage of this
group," he said. "Keeping him further would not do them any good."
</P>
<P>
Bernal was abducted as he was about to arrest a suspected bank
robber. He was reportedly charged by the rebels with being
involved in the killing of six farmers in the province of Sorsogon
and starting an intelligence network against the NPA in 1987.
</P>
<P>
He was accused by the rebels of protecting a group of drug
traffickers in Sorsogon.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Bjarte Engen Vik of Norway
virtually claimed the World Cup Nordic Combined title on Thursday
by finishing fourth in a sprint event.
</P>
<P>
With only two meets left in Norway and Poland, the Norwegian
leads Finland's Hannu Manninen 1.755 points to 1.542 points in the
overall standings.
</P>
<P>
Manninen was third behind Kenji Ogiwara, the Japanese who won
the gold here during the 1993 World Nordic Ski Championships, and
Ladislav Rygl of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Ogiwara topped the ski jumping portion with a 119.5-meter
effort, but was unable to hold off Rygl in the ensuing 7.5-
kilometer cross-country ski race.
</P>
<P>
Rygl was seventh in the ski jumping. His previous best World
Cup result was a second at Lillehammer, Norway, earlier this year.
He is fourth overall.
</P>
<P>
Even if Manninen wins the last two meets, Engen Vik only needs
a pair of top 10 finishes to clinch the overall title.
</P>
<P>
"Only illness can stop me," said Engen Vik.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Shuttlers Dominate All England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women shuttlers
displayed their prowess as expected at the All England Open
Badminton Championships, taking five out of eight spots on offer
of the singles quater-finals here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, their men's counterparts were well beyond
expectation when they were eliminated from the third round in the
day's morning session competitions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women, spearheaded by world number two Ye Zhaoying,
who married recently in Beijing, showed brilliant performances in
the third round, breezing past Asian rivals for the quarter-finals,
which are slated for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ye Zhaoying, gold medalist in the last two editions of the
tournament, outplayed Lee Kyung-won of South Korea in two
identical scores of 11-5. She will meet teammate Gong Zhichao for
a place in the semi-final. Gong Zhicho, runner-up to Ye Zhaoying
in the world championships, defeated Asian Games gold medal winner
Kanako Yonekura of Japan 11-2, 11-5.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese established her status at the Asiad in Thailand
last December when she beat both Ye and Gong en route to winning
the championship.
</P>
<P>
Another Gong from China -- Gong Ruina will have a fierce
showdown with Camilla Martin of Denmark in the quarter-finals.
Gong Ruina, gold medal winner at the Swedish Open last week,
outplayed Judith Meullendijks of the Netherland 11-7, 11-7 and
Martin beat Miho Tanaka 11-1 and 11-6.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Mi, a newly-arised star in the Chinese team, had a hard-
fought match with Indonesian Cindana in the third round Thursday
evening. The second seeded Chinese woman, at the age of 20, sky-
rocketed her place in the world rankings to forth after taking the
Korean Open in January and finishing second at the Chinese Taipei
Open.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set, Zhou Mi adjusted herself a little
bit and took the following two sets, winning the match at 6-11, 11-
4 and 13-10, setting up a showdown with another Indonesian Mia
Audina in the quarter-finals. Audina defeated Mette Sorensen of
Denmark 11-5 and 11-2.
</P>
<P>
The only other place in the semi-final will be decided between
China's Dai Yun and Huang Chia-chi of Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Dai beat Ellen Angelina of Indonesia 11-3, 11-1 while Huang
ousted joint fifth seed Yasuko Mizui of Japan 11-5, 11-1.
</P>
<P>
In the men's section, the Chinese single shuttlers startled the
championships when none of them advanced to the third round.
</P>
<P>
After Chen Hong was ousted in the first round, his compatriots
Chen Gang, Chen Wei and Xia Xuanze were forced to wave their hands
to the tournament after second round competitions while Dannish
and Indonesian seeds had a smooth path for the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark, who stands as the
world number one for almost 12 months with four victories in grand
prix, beat Shrikant Bakshi of Indonesia 15-6 and 15-3 in 20
minutes. He will meet Johan Hadikusuma, also from Indonesia, for
a spot in the top four.
</P>
<P>
Other six quarter-finalists in the men's singles are
Indonesians Budi Santoso, Indra Wijaya and Taufik Hidayat, Dannish
Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen and Thomas Stuer-Lauridsen as well as Fung
Permadi of Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Joint fifth seed Rashid Sidek of Malaysia, who had his right
leg injured, pulled out of the men's singles Thursday morning.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- With 100 days remaing until
the start of the 1999 FIFA World Cup women's soccer championship
on June 19, the organizing committee today announced in Los
Angeles that it has sold 260,000 tickets.
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be an understatement to say we are pleased
with the amount of tickets we have sold with the opening match
still over three months away," said Maria Messing, WWC president.
</P>
<P>
"We expected sales to increase following the Final Draw,
because fans now know which games and teams are coming to their
venues. We just didn't expect that the response would be this
great."
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Final Draw, which was held at halftime of the
first-ever FIFA women's world All-Star match in San Jose on
February 14, sales for the tournament had reached 215,000.
</P>
<P>
Since the draw, less than a month ago, more than 45,000 tickets
have been purchased - over 10,000 tickets per week.
</P>
<P>
If the tournament were to start today, enough tickets have been
sold for an average of nearly 15,300 per playing date of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 17 dates will feature a doubleheader, with the
semifinals at Foxboro Stadium in Boston and Stanford Stadium in
Palo Alto, California.
</P>
<P>
The opening match at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New
Jersey, features the defending Olympic champion United States vs
Denmark and Brazil vs Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The final and third place matches will be held on July 10 at
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, also site of the finals of
the 1984 Olympic soccer tournament and 1994 World Cup.

The Australian:

<HEADLINE> Voters Go to Polls in Malaysia's Sabah State Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Polling for Malaysia's Sabah
state election got underway Friday with 64 polling stations in six
of 48 constituencies in the state open on the first day of the
two-day polls, according to reports reaching here from Sabah's
capital Kota Kinabalu.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,540 voters out of the state's electorate of
726,690 are eligible to cast their votes Friday, according to an
Election Commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
For the remaining voters in 42 other constituencies, polling
will be conducted on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 199 candidates are vying for the 48 seats up for
grabs in the state election, regarded as the most intensely fought
state polls.
</P>
<P>
Of these candidates, more than two-thirds are from three major
parties -- Barisan Nasional (BN), Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS) and
Parti Bersekutu -- each contesting in all 48 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Apart from BN, PBS and Bersekutu, three smaller parties --
Setia, Pasok and PAS as well as 27 independents -- also joined the
contest.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Assembly of the Sabah State, East Malaysia,
whose five-year mandate ends on March 18, was dissolved on
February 22 to pave the way for the new polls.
</P>
<P>
In the dissolved assembly, the BN held 43 seats while the
opposition PBS had four and the remaining one seat was held by an
Independent.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 48 elected seats, the state assembly also had six
nominated assemblymen, three each by BN and PBS.
</P>
<P>
The PBS actually won the last state election with 25 seats for
a simple majority in the previous state election held on February
18 and 19, 1994, but the state government collapsed after only
three weeks in power when most of its assemblymen defected to the
BN which then formed the state government.

LONDON, March 11 (Xinhua) - Britain on Thursday denied that any
of its planes patrolling over the no-fly zones in Iraq had been
hit by anti-aircraft fire.
</P>
<P>
"Coalition aircraft flew their patrols of the no-fly zones
today as usual," a Reuters report quoted a Ministry of Defense
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Although they met with the now routine Iraqi provocation, no
response was deemed necessary and all aircraft returned safely,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, an Iraqi military spokesman said in Baghdad
that its air defenses had "possibly hit" one of a group of Western
planes flying over the southern no-fly zone.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Increase 0.9 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Thursday that a big purchase pushed retail sales to another strong
increase in February.
</P>
<P>
The retail sales, representing about a third of the nation's
economic output, rose 0.9 percent last month to a seasonally
adjusted 236.5 billion U.S. dollars, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The increase, the seventh in a row, followed the robust gains
of 1 percent in January and 1.1 percent in December. Both the
January and December figures were revised higher from previous
estimates.
</P>
<P>
In February, auto sales were particularly strong, up 1.8
percent. And sales of everything else jumped a healthy 0.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said several factors are combining to drive spending
higher, including unemployment near a 29-year low, low interest
rates, record stock prices as measured by the Dow Jones average of
industrial stocks and a substantial increase in federal tax
refunds, compared with last year.
</P>
<P>
Good weather across much of the country probably encouraged
some additional spending as well.
</P>
<P>
Last month, other strong sales gains included furniture, up 1
percent; building supplies and hardware, 1.2 percent; apparel and
accessory shops, 1 percent; food stores, 0.9 percent, the most in
nearly two years; drug stores, 1.3 percent; restaurants and bars,
0.8 percent; and gasoline stations, 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales at department and other general merchandise stores rose
0.5 percent, a decent increase on top of an extremely strong 2.6
percent advance in January.
</P>
<P>
Economists said strong spending might make Federal Reserve
officials uneasy about potential price rises.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Labor Department said Thursday that first-time
claims for unemployment benefits remained under 300,000 for the
sixth straight week for the first time since 1974. Claims edged up
1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 289,000 last week. This reflected
a still healthy labor market.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia to Defend Its Air Space at All Cost: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav air force chief
said on Thursday that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is
prepared to defend its air space at all cost.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting the air force units and air defense units in
the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, Spasoje Smiljanic,
commander-in-chief of the Yugoslav air force, said that the air
force and air defense units already at full alert will defend the
air space of the country, especially that of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav air defense facilities in Montenegro and the
military installations in Kosovo are expected to be taken as the
targets for the initial air strikes which the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) has threatened time and again in the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
The western military alliance has menaced to launch air strikes
against Yugoslav military targets if the Balkan nation would not
meet the demand of the western powers.
</P>
<P>
The commanders of the Yugoslav army and air force have been
inspecting the country's army and air force and air defense units
prior to the start of the Kosovo negotiations that are scheduled
to re-start next Monday near Paris.
</P>
<P>
During an eight-hour meeting with American special envoy
Richard Holbrooke on Wednesday, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic reiterated that his country would not allow any foreign
troops to be stationed in Kosovo to infringe upon the territorial
integrity of his country.
</P>
<P>
NATO is amassing a 28,000-strong force in Macedonia, just
nearby the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, which the western military
alliance has planned to use as an implementation force of any
peace deal to be signed between the Yugoslav authorities and the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average

non-inflationary threats in the U.S. economy.

producing countries were close to an agreement on production cuts
in an effort to shore up the rising oil prices. The same report
pushed the Dow index to the record closing high of 9,772.84 points
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The investors were also happy with reports released by the
Commerce Department and the Labor Department on retail sales and
unemployment separately, which gave no signs that the U.S. economy
is overheating and therefore the Federal Reserve have no reasons
to raise interest rates to cool off the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said in the report retail sales which
represent about a third of U.S. economic output, rose 0.9 percent
in February to a seasonally adjusted 236.5 billion U.S. dollars

</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed by Li Zhaoxing, ambassador of China

<HEADLINE> Security Council Pays Tribute to Late Emir of Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
observed a minute of silence on Thursday in memory of the late
emir of Bahrain, Sheikhh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa at the request
of the president of the Security Council for the month of March,
Qin Huasun of China.
</P>
<P>
"The long and distinguished leadership of his highness leaves
an enduring legacy of pride and honor and of a deep commitment to
the cause of peace and stability in the region," Qin said at the
beginning of the meeting, the first one since the emir's death
from a heart attack last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council met on Thursday to make a
decision on the extension of the mandate of the U.N. Observer
Mission in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Qin also asked Bahrain's permanent representative to the United
Nations, Jassim Buallay, to convey condolences to the family of the
late emir. Bahrain is currently a member of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a
statement, saying that the late emir "for many years had been a
force of stability in a very troubled region of the world."
</P>
<P>
The late emir, who died at 66, led Bahrain to independence from
Britain in 1971. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Sheikhh Hamad
bin Isa al-Khalifa, 49.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Current Account Deficit Surges to Record in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The current account deficit,
the broadest measure of U.S. trade activity, soared last year by
78.23 billion dollars to an all-time high of 233.45 billion
dollars as farmers and manufacturers were hit by the global
financial turmoil, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the imbalance in the nation's current
account swelled by 50.4 percent from last year's 155.2 billion
dollars deficit.
</P>
<P>
The soaring deficit occurred despite the fact that the current
account narrowed slightly in the final three months of the year,
edging down to 63.8 billion from 65.7 billion dollars in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are forecasting another big increase in the current
account deficit this year as recessions in Asia, Russia and now
Latin America cut demand for farm and manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
The current account is considered the best gauge of the
country's international standing because it measures not only
trade in goods and services, but also investment flows between
countries and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Exports of U.S. goods fell by 1.2 percent to 671.1 billion
dollars last year, the first drop in this category in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the decline came from falling farm sales and the
other one-third was the result of a drop in demand for
manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in services, such as airline fares, sales of
insurance and consulting fees, fell to 78.9 billion dollars in
1998, down from a surplus of 87.7 billion dollars in 1997. The
weakness in this category reflected decreases in tourism as
foreigners cut back on their U.S. travel.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in investment income, the difference between what
foreigners earn on their U.S. investments and what Americans earn
abroad, rose to 22.5 billion dollars, up sharply from a 1997
deficit of 5.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fourth category of the current account, unilateral
transfers, which covers foreign aid and pension payments to
Americans living abroad, rose to 41.9 billion dollars, up slightly
from 39.7 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The overall deficit of 233.45 billion dollars surpassed the
old record of 168.0 billion dollars set in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration is worried that record deficit of
current account will cause a backlash against its free trade
policies.

</P>
<P>
The victims have not been identified, but the rescue workers
said that the victims are two women and a man.
</P>
<P>
One of the two survivors was injured and another was pulled out
of the snow unscathed, rescue workers also reported.
</P>
<P>
The avalanche came off a mountain at about 2,700m high in the
Val di Roia, not far from the Italian border with Austria and
quite close to the Austrian resort of Galtuer, where 38 people
were killed by an avalanche on February 24.
</P>
<P>
Italian authorities said the avalanche was caused by the recent
rise in temperatures in the area, warning that the risk of
avalanche will be very high.
</P>
<P>
One of the two survivors said the five skiers had caused the
avalanche themselves by skiing along the edge of a ridge,
off-slide.
</P>
<P>
The victims have been killed instantly by the giant,
fast-moving mass of snow, rescue workers said.

<HEADLINE> U.N.-Mediated Talks on East Timor to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The United
Nations-sponsored talks on East Timor will continue, with
high-level discussions scheduled for next month, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the end of two days of meetings in New
York between him, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and his
Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings they touched upon autonomy proposals for
East Timor, the methods of consulting East Timorese on the subject
and the situation on the island, Annan told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Alatas would present Indonesia's revisions of the autonomy plan
as soon as these are completed", Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting "has reached an agreement that a method of direct
ballot will be used to ask the people of East Timor whether they
accept or reject the autonomy proposal", Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"The specific modalities of how the popular consultation will
be carried out are being worked out", he added.
</P>
<P>
He said a U.N. team will soon visit Jakarta, East Timor and
Lisbon to continue the consulting process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said senior officials of Indonesia and Portugal
will meet again in New York on April 13-14 under the chairmanship
of his personal representative Jamsheed Marker.
</P>
<P>
That will be followed by a meeting between Alatas, Gama and
Annan on April 22.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of 800,000 and area of 15,000
square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975. It
became an Indonesian province in 1976. The United Nations has
since been seeking a "just and comprehensive" solution to the
status of the island.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said on Wednesday that Indonesia needs more time to make
some revisions on the original autonomy package before presenting
it to the East Timorese by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that if the majority of inhabitants on the island
rejects autonomy, then Indonesia would agree to "parting ways"
with the territory.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes School Flexibility Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Thursday
approved a bill designed to give schools more flexibility in
spending federal money.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a companion bill that reached the Senate floor is
likely to pass with some new money for hiring teachers, but far
short of the 1.2 billion U.S. dollars Clinton administration plan
pushed by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Senate broke through six days of procedural
jousting and agreed to vote today on both the bill and amendments
demanded by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Republicans and Democrats have battled over whether the
"ed-flex" bill, which would loosen strings on certain federal
dollars, should include plans to spend at least 1.2 billion
dollars toward hiring 100,000 new teachers nationwide to reduce
class sizes.
</P>
<P>
The House passed the bill without compromises. The Republican
majority voted down two Democratic amendments, one designed to
shield money for poor students from state waivers and another that
would have tightened controls on the states. The Democrats ran out
of time to offer other amendments, such as the class-size
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Under the ed-flex measure, states and school districts could
apply federal money to programs that serve them best, Republicans
said. For example, under state waivers, schools could use federal
funds meant for science and math teachers to boost reading
instruction if that's what they prefer.
</P>
<P>
The class-size plan was started with last year's spending bill
when Congress approved 1.2 billion dollars to hire some 30,000 new
teachers in the early grades. The president's plan calls for
100,000 new teachers costing more than 11 billion dollars over
seven years.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The three Europeans and an Angolan
woman who went missing on Wednesday in Cabinda, north Angola, had
been kidnapped by armed separatists, an Angolan official said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Henrique Futi, deputy governor of the Cabinda Province, told
Luanda Commercial Radio in an interview that the armed separatists
belong to the Liberation Front of Cabinda Enclave. He condemned
the abduction as "a gross violation of human rights."
</P>
<P>
The deputy provincial governor said that the abduction was no
different with the war instigated by the opposition National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that they will not succeed in undermining
national stability and the government will bring them to justice.
</P>
<P>
Two Portuguese, one French and an Angolan national, who are
workers of French service firm Bouygues and Chevron petroleum
company of the United States, went out on Tuesday evening by car.
Their car was found empty and abandoned the following day.
</P>
<P>
Cabinda is an Angolan enclave surrounded by Congo (B) and Congo
(K). With abundant oil resources, it is one of the most wealthy
provinces in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Local residents have fought for independence for years and
organized armed groups, with Liberation Front of Cabinda Enclave
one of the largest.

</P>
<P>
SPD after Lafondaine's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder told press that the stability of his government was
out of question, adding that he would call for a meeting of SPD
parliamentary fraction on Friday and recommend Lafontaine's
successor.
</P>

government, said that they were regret but would remain in the
cabinet, while party leader and German foreign minister Joschka
Fischer cancelled his visit to Paris scheduled on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders hailed Lafontaine's resignation, saying that
it indicated failure of Shroeder's government.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the main opposition Christian
Democratic Union(CDU), said Lafontaine was shirking responsibility
for the damage already caused to Germany by Schroeder's coalition.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) is prepared to open three electronic
community centers in Egypt, as part of a series of digital
projects in Africa, Arab States, Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the UNDP here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, to be started on March 14, is aimed at providing
community access to the internet and training for civil society
groups, the private sector, low-income communities and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
By linking communities to the global economy, the sites are
expected to create new opportunities for economic growth, the UNDP
said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, each center will be equipped with a
server and some 10 Pentium PCs, backed by additional training
computers in each location.
</P>
<P>
Dedicated local internet connectivity will be provided for each
center. Training and skills development programs will focus on
computer literacy, E-mail operations, web page creation and
desktop publishing.
</P>

The centers are located in Sharkeya Governorate with a
population of 4.2 million. It is one of the 26 of Egyptian
governorates and some 2 hours by car from Cairo.
</P>
<P>
UNDP officials believe that such centers can bring information
to the unconnected people of the developing world, especially in
remote and rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Pose No Threat to Eritrea: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The rebels in Ethiopia and the
Sudan are no threat to the Eritrean government, a senior Eritrean
official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"These are small groups and even not groups. They are
individuals," Yermane Gebremeskel, Director of the President's
Office and Presidential Adviser, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Some recent reports said that rebel groups had been established
in the Sudan and Ethiopia, determined to topple the Eritrean
government.
</P>
<P>
"They are no threat of any kind," Yermane said, noting that
these individuals don't have any followers, supporters, and no
support from Eritreans abroad.
</P>
<P>
However, on the Ethio-Eritrean conflict, Yermane said he
doubted Ethiopians' aim is for the contested land.
</P>
<P>
"Officially, the Ethiopians say that they want back the land
occupied by Eritrea, but there is no land occupied by Eritrea," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) framework said that
once Eritrea withdraws from the disputed Badme area, all troops
should be disengaged. And Eritrea has accepted that, Yermane
said.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of regaining the occupied territory taken
control by Eritrea because all contested areas should be
demilitarized" as required by the framework agreement put forward
by the OAU, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Backs Renewal of U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 11 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday voiced
its support for the extension of the mandate of the U.N. Observer
Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) because the UNOMSIL is "the
concrete embodiment of the Security Council's support for the
government and people of Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the statement before the 15-member Security
Council decided unanimously to extend the mandate of the UNOMSIL
for a further period of three months, until June 13, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"In response to the appeal of Sierra Leone and the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), China has provided the
people and ECOWAS members concerned respectively with material for
civilian use and materiel in the form of emergency assistance,"
said Qin, who is also president of the Security Council for the
month of March.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to provide help within our capacity through
bilateral channels," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are glad to see that the situation in Sierra Leone is
finally improving thanks to the efforts of the ECOWAS and West
African peacekeeping forces in particular," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government firmly supports the elected
government of Sierra Leone, and appreciates President Ahmed
Kabbah's determination to achieve national reconciliation
through dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We urge rebels to unconditionally recognize the legitimate
government headed by President Kabbah, put an end to the
atrocities against civilians, lay down arms immediately, and take
part in the dialogue with the government in good earnest so as to
avoid further bloodshed and conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the countries concerned to strictly abide by the
international law, truly respect the sovereignty, political
independence and territorial integrity of Sierra Leone," he said,
"China is gravely concerned about the outside force's support for
and the participation in the rebel forces," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets Up Gas Body to Reduce Wastage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has set up a gas
association to reduce wastage of the country's gas resources,
Special Adviser to the Head of State on Petroleum Matters, Aret
Adams, said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the launching of the Nigeria Gas Association, Adams said
"the increasing focus on environmental issues worldwide with an
appreciation of the need to reduce the emission of pollutants and
carbon dioxide, is an opportunity that our gas industry must
seize."
</P>
<P>
He noted that increasing international environment
consciousness should compel those within the industry to
contribute to harnessing this resource.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has a proven reserve of 122 trillion cubic feet of gas,
and produces 3.4 billion cubic feet of gas annually with most of
the gas production associated with the nation's oil production.
</P>
<P>
About 2.4 billion cubic feet of gas, or 67 percent of the
annual gas production, are being flared in the west African
country due to lack of facilities harnessing the gas resources.
</P>
<P>
As an effort to reduce wastage, Adams said, Nigeria will
undertake the expansion of the country's 3.6 billion dollars
liquefied natural gas project in Rivers State and the West African
Gas Pipeline project which will carry Nigeria's gas to Benin, Togo
and Ghana.
</P>
<P>
After its expansion, the capacity of the liquefied natural gas
project which will come on stream in October this year will be
increased from 5.9 million to 8.7 million tons by the year of
2002.
</P>
<P>
Adams noted that with the establishment of the association, the
process of acquiring gas technology from the 50-member
International Gas Union would be accelerated to enhance the
development of the domestic gas industry.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a national gas policy will soon be
promulgated for the rapid development of the industry.
