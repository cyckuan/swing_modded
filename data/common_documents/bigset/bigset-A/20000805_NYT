 80-year-old marathon runner still going strong  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATIE HOLLAR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As of Thursday, Ed Burnham had run 22,417
miles.
</P>
<P>
   That's just about 2,500 miles shy of running around the earth.
And he has seen a lot of the globe along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham has completed at least one marathon in every state. He
ran in Berlin the same year the wall came down. He raced past Big
Ben in London. He sweated through marathons in Cancun and Cozumel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad for an 80-year-old man,'' Burnham said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Burnham is one of a handful of older runners in Kansas
City. When races have an age division for 80 and over, he is
usually the only participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I do pretty well,'' he laughed. ``If it's 70 and over,
well, it depends.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend Burnham will run in two local races: the 10K KU
Alumni Jayhawk Jog today and the Kansas City Downtown Airport 8K
Tarmac Run on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to run in all local races, because they're usually for
charity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham did not start running until he was 60, when he retired
from his administrative position with the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
</P>
<P>
   At age 70 he completed his first marathon. He said he had been
running about once a month since. His next marathon will be
Quebec's Marathon des Deux Rives on Aug. 27 _ two days before his
81st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year on my 80th birthday I ran the Omaha marathon,'' he
said. ``That was kind of neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnham has had to clear some hurdles in his 20 years of
running. He has suffered a broken ankle and a broken elbow. He got
a stress fracture in his leg. His thyroid quit working properly.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Burnham recovered. With a cast, with pills or with
time, he was back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Good genes and a healthful lifestyle are what keep him going, he
said. And he plans to keep going for as long as he feels like it _
or when his marathon time tops seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, he'll just do half-marathons.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he has some time. Burnham completed his last marathon
in six hours, 26 minutes and 35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Taylor, a local race announcer and the promoter for the
Tarmac 8K, said Burnham was ``a real champion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To run 100 marathons after you're 60 is incredible,'' Taylor
said. ``Just incredible.''

 Details emerge into `Canyon Suite' paintings  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL and MIKE McGRAW  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A box lid. Finger paint. Typing paper.
</P>
<P>
   Those were some of the makings of the Canyon Suite, the
collection of 28 watercolors once owned by the Kemper Museum and
believed to be painted by Georgia O'Keeffe.
</P>
<P>
   And some of their unmaking as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Canyon Suite works were discredited late last year, and now
Kansas City paper conservator Mark Stevenson has disclosed more
details about the reasons why _ many of the works were made with
materials that O'Keeffe never used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more one looked at these the less they appeared to be by
O'Keeffe,'' Stevenson said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   R. Crosby Kemper Jr. and his family foundations bought two dozen
of the watercolors in 1993 for about $5 million from Santa Fe,
N.M., gallery owner Gerald Peters, and Peters later donated four
others to the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   The Kemper Museum hired Stevenson, an independent contractor who
specializes in preserving and restoring artwork on paper, to study
the watercolors after R. Crosby Kemper Jr. was informed last fall
that a scholarly research project about to be published had
prompted serious questions about their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The project, known as a ``catalogue raisonne,'' documented more
than 2,000 verifiable O'Keeffe works and omitted 250 paintings and
sculptures, including the Canyon Suite watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   After the art-world fiasco erupted, Peters repaid the Kemper
Museum and took the 28 watercolors back. Last spring, Peters also
gave the museum a genuine early O'Keeffe oil painting valued at
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Peters has said in recent months that he commissioned his own
scientific analysis of the watercolors and, although he was still
awaiting the results, he expected that some of the works would
prove to be O'Keeffes after all.
</P>
<P>
   And Peters continues to question some of the conclusions of the
catalog scholars, especially their contention that O'Keeffe only
used certain specific papers when she was teaching at a small
college in Canyon, Texas, in 1916 to 1918.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the art community are amazed at their
theory,'' Peters said of the catalog scholars. ``How can anybody
say what anybody used or didn't use in a school classroom?''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson spent nearly six weeks last fall studying the 28
watercolors. In the end, he confirmed for R. Crosby Kemper Jr. the
validity of the research conducted over more than six years that
led to the watercolors' omission from the O'Keeffe catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Judith C. Walsh, a senior paper conservator at the National
Gallery of Art, in Washington, D.C., and others involved in the
catalog project have released little specific information about the
Canyon Suite. It has been known, however, that she found a few of
the watercolors were on paper manufactured later than 1916 to 1918,
when the paintings were purported to have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said he confirmed Walsh's finding that nine of the
Canyon Suite works were on a cheap ``groundwood,'' or manufactured
pulp paper. A couple of the pieces were done on vintage typing
paper and two were on a paperboard that came from something like a
shirt box.
</P>
<P>
   Although O'Keeffe did use an inexpensive newsprint for some
well-known master works and a variety of scratch paper for
sketching, she never salvaged papers or used anything but pristine
sheets for her formal artworks, Stevenson and the National Gallery
researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judy (Walsh) provided the information that O'Keeffe did not
salvage paper,'' Stevenson said. ``She always used fresh paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh and Barbara Buhler Lynes, author of the two-volume Georgia
O'Keeffe: Catalogue Raisonne, were unavailable for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Walsh elaborated on her research into O'Keeffe's
materials in a recent essay accompanying an exhibit of the artist's
works on paper now at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said O'Keeffe used ``the most unobtrusive paper possible''
rather than the sort of textured papers found in several of the
Canyon Suite works.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, only one of the works was on a kind of paper the artist
used in her 80 years of painting, Stevenson said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Canyon Suite work titled ``Tree,'' which was
painted on a thin Japanese gampi paper. Despite its unabsorbent
qualities, O'Keeffe used the paper for a couple of early
watercolors, dated from 1916.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Tree,'' said Stevenson, is hardly her work: ``It alludes
to a couple of known O'Keeffe images, but in a rather cumbersome
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said the researchers also found that one of the
watercolors actually had been painted with a water-based finger
paint that O'Keeffe was never known to have used.

A GAS GIANT BETS HEAVILY ON A SURGE IN DEMAND
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Will natural gas prices stay high? Consumers hope not,
but the Anadarko Petroleum Corp., for one, is betting that they
will.
</P>
<P>
   Prices at the wellhead have leapt 80 percent this year, to more
than $4 per million British thermal units. Further, if colder
temperatures return after the unseasonably warm winters of the last
few years, supplies could be squeezed tighter, sending prices even
higher.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be just the start, argue executives at Anadarko,
one of the largest independent oil and gas producers. They and a
number of other producers and analysts say a fundamental shift in
the natural gas market has brought permanently higher prices. They
cite soaring demand from new electricity generation plants, after
years of weak overall consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Anadarko is making a huge bet on this thesis. Anadarko, based in
Houston, has just acquired Union Pacific Resources for almost $6
billion, gaining drilling rights in gas-rich western Canada and
other places. Last week it announced it would raise capital
spending this year to $1.5 billion, one-third more than earlier
projections.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were not impressed when the Union Pacific deal was
announced in April, but they have come around. Anadarko shares are
now up more than 40 percent for the year. At $49, they are trading
at about 12 times the $4 a share that Robert J. Allison Jr.,
Anadarko's chief executive, expects the company to earn over the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just isn't enough supply, or enough supply excess, to
get soft gas prices again,'' Allison said in an interview last
week. A severe winter will cause spot shortages, he predicts,
potentially causing prices to hit $7 early next year.
</P>
<P>
   William Featherston, an analyst at PaineWebber, says that a
group of 15 gas producers he tracks are expected to post a 75
percent gain in discretionary cash flow _ net income plus
depreciation and deferred taxes _ to $9 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even strong fundamentals are subject to the whimsy of
investors, whose appetite for technology stocks hurt valuations of
so-called old economy stocks in recent years. Lately, the shares of
some big exploration and production companies have moved almost
inversely with the Nasdaq index, rising as the index has fallen.
Even so, some analysts say they have much farther to go. ``The
stocks are reflecting $2.50 gas,'' said Featherston. ``It's a real
disconnect.''
</P>
<P>
   Often found in the same fields as oil, natural gas has far
different economics. By and large, it cannot be transported like
oil _ some is liquefied overseas and shipped to the United States,
but it is very expensive to do that _ so the United States gets
nearly all its gas from North America. It is shipped around the
country through pipelines, mostly from places like the Gulf of
Mexico, Canada, Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, natural gas has little OPEC risk, and prices
are much more closely tied to pure supply-and-demand forces than to
political decisions made half a world away. But that also means
that the United States cannot browbeat foreign producers into
higher production when prices rise, as it has sometimes done with
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oil markets are global, but the gas market is continental,''
said Tom Robinson, a managing director at Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, a consulting and research firm in Cambridge, Mass.
``Producers tend to be full out into the market, and what that
means is that no reserves can be turned on when the market gets
tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some developments could cause prices to fall. A recession, for
example, would check demand. Should oil prices drop, some
industrial users would switch to other fuels. If the industry were
to sharply boost exploration spending, supplies could rise, putting
pressure on prices. That has not happened yet, although there are
now 772 active gas rigs working in the United States, an increase
of more than 50 percent from a year earlier, according to Baker
Hughes Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But in the near term, prices could go higher simply because
there may not be enough gas in storage. Last year, winter demand
caused gas stocks to fall from three trillion cubic feet in
November to one trillion in April, and that was during one of the
warmest winters on record.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, gas stores are already 18 percent lower than
last year, and analysts forecast that stocks may not reach more
than 2.7 trillion cubic feet by November. Another warm winter could
be enough to leave inventories lean by early next year, but normal
winter temperatures could raise demand by 100 billion cubic feet or
more a month, cutting deeply into storage, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a rude awakening coming,'' he said, for homeowners in
the Northeast, where annual gas bills will average $200 higher.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies are tight now partly because demand, until recently,
was unusually soft, lulling the market into complacency. Warm
winters played a role, but there were other factors. The Asian
recession affected American industry's gas use. Low oil prices _
before OPEC moved last year to curtail production _ made other
fuels cheap alternatives. Oil and gas companies held back from new
investment in production in response to pressure from Wall Street
to use cash flow to pay off debt. Domestic gas production has
actually dropped slightly in the last few years, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But now, demand is rising, oil prices are high, and mass layoffs
from the industry's shakeout two years ago have helped create a
labor shortage that has somewhat constrained drilling. Even more
important is the new demand created by utilities and independent
power producers scrambling to build plants to supply electricity to
regions running short of power. With coal and nuclear power out of
favor, almost all of the new electricity generation plants are
gas-fired.
</P>
<P>
   The National Petroleum Council, a group of industry officials
who advise the secretary of energy, expects annual demand in the
United States to rise to 29 trillion cubic feet over the next
decade, compared with 22 trillion this year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, imports from Canada, liquefied natural gas from overseas
and depletion of gas in storage have made up the gap between
domestic production and demand. But what about future demand?
Proven reserves in the United States are about 160 trillion cubic
feet, and those have started to fall. New technologies have allowed
producers to pump more gas out of existing properties, but by and
large the nation's gas fields are maturing, and it is getting
harder, and more expensive, to locate more gas.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives, including Allison of Anadarko, argue that
if federal officials allowed more drilling in places that are off
limits, including certain parts of Alaska and offshore locations in
most of the lower 48 states, reserves might eventually double.
Otherwise, he said, ``you can only squeeze the oil fields so far.''

THQ PLUCKS NEW TITLE FOR NINTENTO TOY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ Calabasas-based video game-maker THQ will
make summer blockbuster ``Chicken Run'' into a title for Nintendo's
Game Boy Color handheld toy. The company said the theme of the
movie was a natural match to the Game Boy market, made up of
impulse buyers and parents of young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think `Chicken Run' was a coup certainly for the
handheld,'' said Germaine Gioia, vice president of licensing. ``It
jumps off the shelf. Big movies help Game Boy sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also see the new title as a natural for THQ, which also
makes games such as Wrestlemania 2000. It just adds to an already
positive investment outlook, said Stewart Halpern, an analyst with
Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another example of what has made THQ the
worldwide leader of third-party publisher of Game Boy games,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the game, the player is the Claymation film's protagonist
Ginger and will, of course, lead cooped-up poultry to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very true to the movie,'' said the game's producer Petro
Piaseckyj. ``You have three to nine chickens following you and
they're very, very stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The game is scheduled for release in October.

INVESTING WITH DAVID W. SIMPSON OF WM GROWTH FUND OF THE NORTHWEST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn:   Wash., Ore., Idaho, Mont.   and Alaska. ) (ADDS headline)  
(ART ADV: A graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) 
 (For release Sunday, August. 6)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like other people who live in Seattle, David W. Simpson is never
too far from Mount Rainier, the highest peak in the Northwest. But
he is often closer than most. On weekends and during vacations,
Simpson leads climbers over the Mount Rainier's glaciers and rocks;
on weekdays, he drives past the mountain on his way to work
managing the $721.1 million WM Growth Fund of the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain is also the polestar of the portfolio, whose
prospectus requires it to be at least 65 percent invested in
companies with headquarters in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana
and Alaska. The remainder must be in companies doing business in
that region. The geographic area may be small, but it has been
fertile territory for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quite diversified in terms of industries, and we've
become something of a hotbed of technology,'' Simpson said from his
office overlooking Puget Sound. ``Many executives leave Microsoft
with enormous amounts of wealth that they use to finance new
businesses, seeding the region with start-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund returned 26.8 percent a year, on average, for the three
years through Thursday, versus 7.4 percent for its peers among
small blend funds, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, 41, can pluck almost any of the roughly 300 public
companies in those five states. He can find long-term capital
growth in start-ups or choose behemoths like Starbucks, Microsoft
and Nike. Small fry make up 60 percent of the portfolio; the
balance is split between midsize and large-cap companies.
</P>
<P>
   His style could be called eclectic. The fund may hold basic
materials companies in forestry and steel as well as red-hot
technology concerns. Unprofitable biotech businesses rub shoulders
with value plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that regional funds are dependent on the
local economy,'' he said. ``But that's not true. What drives the
companies we buy are national and global markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson works with three equity analysts to pick the fund's 70
or so holdings. He aims to keep shares at least three to five
years; the turnover rate is 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He does not use computer screens to scout out purchases. ``I
keep a hit list of new companies that I look at every day,'' he
said, ``and I pay attention to the local news and investment
analysts.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he wants companies to have relatively low debt
and adequate working capital. Although working-capital needs vary
by industry, as a rule of thumb he wants companies with current
assets that exceed current liabilities, and the bigger the margin,
the better. He also checks a company's ``quick ratio,'' which
compares cash and accounts receivable to current liabilities;
again, bigger is better.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, he wants a company to have a price-to-earnings
multiple that is lower than its growth rate, although he will pay
more for technology companies and less for consumer cyclicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to identify a competitive advantage and make sure that
it is protected,'' he said. That advantage may be a brand name
(Starbucks), a technology (Intel or Microsoft) or domination of a
small market niche (Electro Scientific Industries).
</P>
<P>
   Solid management is vital. For big companies, he relies on Wall
Street research to evaluate management's record. ``I'm more active
talking to management of smaller companies,'' he said, ``because we
can gather information that's not well understood on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he look for? ``I like them to be able to articulate
business strategy in a sensible way,'' he said. ``And I prefer
management that can answer my detailed questions on the spot,
because it means they have their finger on the pulse of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson recently added shares of Paccar Inc., a Bellevue, Wash.,
company that sells heavy-duty trucks. ``The stock was very
inexpensive, because an industry downturn is under way
domestically,'' he said. ``But the company is more global than
perceived.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has some debt but low fixed costs because it
assembles trucks from components rather than manufacturing them
from scratch, he added. That has helped earnings during the
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   He first bought shares in 1991 at $16.96 and recently added more
in the low 40s. They closed on Friday at $41.9375, or almost seven
times Wall Street's earnings estimate of $6.27 a share for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also expanded its position in Monaco Coach, a
manufacturer of recreational vehicles in Coburg, Ore. ``We're
playing into a strong demographic trend,'' he said. ``Young
retirees love these things, and the market should be very strong as
baby boomers reach retirement age.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock price is down because of rising interest
rates and fuel prices, he said, but the company is debt-free and
management is adjusting production. He started buying in July 1999
and has paid an average of $12.94. The stock now trades at
$15.8125, or more than six times the consensus 2000 earnings
estimate of $2.48 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is the Corixa Corp., which he bought at the
initial offering in 1997 at $13 a share. It closed on Friday at
$38.875. Corixa, a biotechnology company in Seattle, is developing
vaccines for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Its chairman and chief
executive, Steven Gillis, was co-founder of Immunex, another
biotechnology company in Seattle. Simpson said he had ``confidence
in his grasp of the business and science of managing a biotech
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian regulators recently approved the company's melanoma
vaccine, and approval by the Food and Drug Administration is
expected by year-end, he said. Wall Street's consensus estimate is
that the company will lose $1.62 a share this year. Nevertheless,
Simpson is optimistic about the long-term prospects.

LOS ANGELES DROPPED BALL ON 'OO EVE &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles' $6 million millennium celebration
turned into a fiasco because of poor leadership, bad planning and
inadequate fund raising, according to a city audit released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Inexperience in staging public events and bad weather added to
the embarrassing spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   City Controller Rick Tuttle said the New Year's Eve celebration,
which paled in comparison with those of other major world cities,
was plagued from its start in July 1997 by having four different
groups and three different leaders involved in the planning. It
finally was taken over by the city's Cultural Affairs Department in
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was confusion throughout the project, including who was
in charge, fund raising and sponsorship, limitations on the events,
and last-minute additions of new elements to the events,'' the
audit said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was rain during the day on New Year's Eve,
dampening enthusiasm and attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should have been planning for inclement weather, either
rain or heat,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cultural Affairs Director Al Nodal, however, argued there
is not much that could have been done about the weather since all
the events were outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   More than 87,000 tickets were given to residents to attend one
of the five community events held around the city. Officials
estimate attendance at 18,700, with the largest number - some 5,000
- attending the Van Nuys Airport festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to have sky divers dropping from airplanes throughout the
day were shelved because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the most heavily hyped event - a laser light show at the
Hollywood sign - failed to come off as projected because of
opposition from area residents who feared traffic jams and the
possibility of fires. That left officials with only a lighting of
the individual letters of the hillside landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle also was critical of the various groups for failing to
provide proper documentation on spending to help in the audit.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan said he agreed with the findings that
there were lessons to be learned from the events, but said he still
considered it a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millennium celebration was successful in several ways and
it met the city's objective to offer five family-focused community
festival events,'' Riordan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city developed important private-public sector
partnerships in putting on these events. And the city received
valuable positive worldwide exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who had called for the audit
immediately after the events, would not comment until she has had a
chance to review it.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the problems and criticism, the audit said there
were positive aspects to the events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City of Los Angeles offered its citizens and visitors a
choice of five site events, all at no cost to participants,
providing convenience and creating a neighborhood setting,'' the
report said. ``The activities available were family-oriented and
provided in a safe environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the report said the working partnerships with private
groups and other levels of governments were first-of-their-kind
efforts for the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles has no history of holding a New Year's Eve
event,'' it said. ``It takes time for a tradition to be cultivated
and for participation to increase. The five community events ...
could be used as the groundwork for continued events. The city may
also want to consider having one large event in a central
location.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuttle said the Hollywood sign lighting ceremony was designed as
a television event rather than one to gather crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) did not demonstrate a willingness or capacity to put on a
citywide public gathering intended to gather a large crowd from the
entire city in one area,'' the audit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the city wishes to develop a tradition of celebrating the
New Year that would compare with that of Times Square in New York,
it may need to re-examine this approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it is important to note the Los Angeles celebration
would be at a time when much of the world has already retired for
the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   In conducting the audit, Tuttle said it proved difficult to get
information from the private groups involved, including the Los
Angeles 2000 Youth Foundation, which was created as a fund-raising
arm.
</P>
<P>
   Former Deputy Police Chief Mark Kroeker was placed in charge of
the group and was paid $129,000 for his services. What became
unclear, the audit said, was what the foundation was to do in its
role and how effective it was in attempting to raise money for the
millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the confusion at the time, many producers said they
were initially told not to worry about fund raising. However, in
the last five months leading up to the events they were forced to
scramble to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, private sources contributed $2.4 million for the
events, with the city - including the Department of Airports, the
Harbor Department and the Department of Water and Power - kicking
in the remaining $3.7 million.

GORE SPENT PART OF VACATION WRITING SPEECH, ADVISERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for rewriting)  
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Democratic National Convention just a few days off,
Vice President Al Gore spent part of his beach vacation in North
Carolina writing his own speech accepting the presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters on Thursday that he had spent several hours
a day writing the address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been drafted to tell him he should show it to other
people sooner rather than later,'' said Martin Peretz, Gore's
onetime Harvard professor and longtime friend. ``And I dread saying
it because I dread his response.''
</P>
<P>
   Peretz, who is better known as the editor in chief of The New
Republic, declined to say who had drafted him for the job, though
he hinted it was Karenna Gore Schiff, Gore's oldest daughter and
one of his closest advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff did not say whether she had asked Peretz to prod her
father into involving the professionals, but said that her father
was hard at work on the address that he will deliver at the
convention, which begins Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Schiff said, the entire family was at the dinner
table until nearly 10 p.m., nibbling on the remains of her dad's
favorite Chinese dish, Szechwan beef, and ``listening to him talk
through some of the paragraphs he had written.''
</P>
<P>
   After returning to New York, Schiff said, she spoke with her
father on the phone on Thursday. ``He read me a few new paragraphs,
which I thought were the best yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a candidate to write a speech of this importance by himself
is virtually unheard of in presidential politics. George W. Bush,
the Republican nominee, put his speechwriters through a number of
drafts, but like most candidates did not do any writing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, though, is a former newspaper reporter who by all accounts
wrote every word of his 1992 book, ``Earth in the Balance.'' The
eulogy he wrote for his father's funeral in 1998 was widely
considered the best speech he ever gave.
</P>
<P>
   And it is hardly out of character for Gore, who has been known
to totally rework the speeches written by his staff, to have taken
on the speechwriting duties.
</P>
<P>
   He was heavily involved in the writing of his addresses to the
1992 and 1996 Democratic conventions. He also often does things on
his own; this is the candidate, after all, who designed his own
``Gore 2000'' campaign logo.
</P>
<P>
   Because this speech is considered crucial for Gore's election
effort, it is not surprising, either, that there might be concern
about making sure the vice president hears from the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   But, even if the pros have not seen a draft of Gore's speech, he
has at least talked to them about it. Last Saturday, Bob Shrum and
Carter Eskew, his top consultants, met Gore in North Carolina to
discuss the address.
</P>
<P>
   While on vacation, Schiff not only critiqued her father's
efforts but also worked on the nominating speech she is to give.
``It feels like a really important toast at a wedding,'' she said,
``and I have to dig through my head for anecdotes.''

FINLEY HAS NO REGRETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Chuck Finley signed a three-year, $27 million
contract with the Indians last winter because, he said, he thought
they had the best chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Now Finley's Indians are not only looking up at the White Sox in
the AL Central race, they are behind the Angels in the wild-card
race. It's not what Finley expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an interesting year,'' said Finley, who will start
this afternoon's game against the Angels. ``If you asked me in
February if I thought we'd be 10 games out of first place, I would
have said `C'mon, man.' But that's how it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley hasn't purchased a home in the Cleveland area, and he
doesn't even rent an apartment. He's staying in a downtown
Cleveland hotel. Asked if he had any regrets signing with the
Indians, Finley said: ``It's easy to say, `Look at the Angels,
they're five out and playing well.' But this (Indians) is a
legitimate team. There's still two months left to make a run at
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's start will be Finley's second against the Angels this
season. He beat them on May 31, giving up three runs (two earned)
and nine hits in a 7-3 Indians victory in Cleveland. But he said
facing the Angels in Anaheim (Aug. 25-27) will be strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be weird,'' he said. ``Facing them here was different,
but going back there ... especially going in from the first-base
dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   There are things about Cleveland that Finley enjoys,
particularly the double-play combination of shortstop Omar Vizquel
and second baseman Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like Cirque du Soleil out there,'' Finley said,
``without the music.''
</P>
<P>
   HILL STILL STARTS: If Ken Hill's spot in the starting rotation
is in jeopardy, manager Mike Scioscia isn't letting on. But the
velocity on Hill's fastball was down in his last start Wednesday,
possibly a sign that his arthritic right elbow is bothering him.
And his ERA (6.52) is worst among the starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff was not real crisp the other day,'' Scioscia said.
``But Ken battles. ... Every pitcher going through the season is
going to lose a little velocity. With Ken Hill, the key is
command.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hill, command of his pitches becomes even more important
when he lacks velocity. But Scioscia won't focus on Hill alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all our starters command (is) important,'' he said.
``Obviously it's a concern, but we can't just target Ken Hill. The
starters have to be driven to keep it where they want it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have options if Hill doesn't improve. Matt Wise
(currently in the bullpen) and Ramon Ortiz (at Triple-A Edmonton)
are both pitching well.
</P>
<P>
   SITTING DOWN: Ron Gant was not in the starting lineup for the
second game in a row, primarily because a right-hander (Steve
Woodard) was starting for the Indians. While with the Phillies,
Gant hit .217 vs. righties, .365 vs. lefties. Orlando Palmeiro got
the start at DH Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with him about it,'' Scioscia said. ``We've had guys
productive there (Palmeiro and Scott Spiezio). We were looking for
a guy to add to that, not replace that.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Angels, Gant is 0 for 8 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   POTENTIAL MOVES: Pitcher Jarrod Washburn is eligible to come off
the disabled list Sunday, then pitch either Monday or Tuesday
against the Red Sox in Anaheim. To make room on the roster, the
Angels will have to move somebody off.
</P>
<P>
   Wise is a candidate to go, but with the pitching struggling as
it is, they might want to keep Wise and send down someone off the
bench. If that's the case, Edgard Clemente is the likely candidate
to go. Another possibility is pitcher Derrick Turnbow, a Rule V
draftee. Turnbow has been bothered by a sore knee and could wind up
on the DL. &QL;

JOHNSON: LET'S HAVE SOME FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe Davey Johnson missed his calling. Maybe the
Republicans should have invited him to Philadelphia to liven up
things.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sounded like a man stumping, or at least in need of a
good podium, as he settled into the Dodgers dugout prior to
Friday's opener against the Brewers and gave a state-of-the-team
address.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Friday's game, the Dodgers play 32 of their final 57
games at home. Trades are done. Players are finally healthy. The
suspensions almost complete.
</P>
<P>
   And they're in a pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of where this club is,'' Johnson said. ``We have an
opportunity to have some fun from here on in. It's only fun if you
win and in a pennant race. It ain't fun any time else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a pretty good feeling on this club. Some things are
going our way and we have to build a little momentum and see where
it takes us.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said everything that has happened to the Dodgers this
season ``has put us in position to play like a championship club.
The feeling on this club is that we have a lot to do yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't played our best ball yet.''
</P>
<P>
   WELCOME HOME, NOW WIN: Right-hander Ismael Valdes is scheduled
to make his first start at Chavez Ravine in his second coming as a
Dodger on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes battled injuries early in the season and won only two
games with the Cubs before his unexpected trade back to the Dodgers
but returns with a club needing production from the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, however, said he feels no extra burden to produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's normal,'' he said. ``I'm not going to try and do any more
than I'm capable.''
</P>
<P>
   If some in the organization privately questioned his tenacity,
Valdes said he returns a different man, if not pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got married, I matured,'' he said. ``I had a great
experience in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   STRETCH IT: Johnson is unsure how many innings right-hander Matt
Herges will go in his first start, scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably go 70-to-80 pitches,'' Johnson said. ``Maybe
more. He's strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd pitch him one night, come back with him the next day. He's
pretty stretched out.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Antonio Osuna will takes Herges' spot as the long
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some trouble with the fourth and fifth spots (in the
rotation) all year,'' he said. ``I hate to mess with the bullpen.
We finally got it to where it's very functional.''
</P>
<P>
   A FAMILIAR NOTE: Former team owner Peter O'Malley, now president
of the Little League Foundation, continues his efforts to promote
baseball internationally. O'Malley is in Kutno, Poland, today to
take part in the dedication of a new 4,000-seat Little League
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Musial, whom the stadium is named after, and Poland
president Aleksander Kwasniewski are also scheduled to participate
in the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Utility player F.P. Santangelo served the second
day of his five-game suspension for his involvement in the Wrigley
Field incident. ... General manager Kevin Malone is in Round Rock,
Texas, this weekend to scout Double-A San Antonio. ... The Dodgers
lowered the flag to half-staff and had a pregame moment of silence
in honor of former club executive Bill Schweppe, who was buried in
Anaheim on Monday. ... Tonight is the annual Hollywood Stars
pregame. Autogates open at 4:30 p.m. and the stadium at 5 p.m. &QL;

BIBBY SIGNS CONTRACT EXTENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC basketball coach Henry Bibby ended months of
negotiating Friday by signing a three-year contract extension that
is intended to keep him at the university through the 2004-2005
season.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is being added on to the existing two years of Bibby's
original contract. He is expected to be paid about $375,000 next
season and the extension should eventually push him over the
$600,000 mark, which would place him in the upper echelon of
Pacific-10 Conference coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored that USC and (athletic director) Mike Garrett have
given me the opportunity to continue building upon the success
we've had with this program,'' Bibby said. ``Each year we've gotten
better and better. This extension solidifies the direction in which
Trojan basketball is headed. It's an exciting future and I'm proud
that USC wants me to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There might some debate over whether Bibby will actually be
around by the end of the contract. He spoke with University of
Memphis officials about its then-vacant job last winter and he has
previously been interested in the Clippers' coaching position.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby had agreed to a verbal extension with USC officials in
March, but negotiations broke down and there was virtually no
contact in April and May. The two sides agreed in May, however,
that a deal could be worked out over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby signed his new contract prior to fielding what should be
his strongest team in his four-plus seasons. The Trojans have been
ranked in several early top-25 polls.
</P>
<P>
   USC returns all five starters from last year's 16-14 team and
seven of their top eight players. In addition, USC signed prep
All-American shooting guard Desmon Farmer of Flint, Mich., along
with point guard Robert Hutchinson and shooting guard Gennaro
Busterna. Also, 7-foot-3 freshman center Luke Minor will be
eligible after redshirting last season.
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable the Trojans could be chosen to finish among the
top three teams in the Pac-10 next year. And USC has gotten off to
a fast start in recruiting this summer, with commitments from twin
brother guards Errick and Derrick Craven of Bishop Montgomery in
Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby has led USC to three winning seasons and a pair of
postseason appearances (the 1997 NCAA Tournament and the 1999
National Invitation Tournament).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy with the progress of the Trojan men's basketball
program under Henry Bibby,'' Garrett said. ``This contract
extension is a reflection of that. Now, we're looking for continued
development in his program; all indications are that we should be
seeing such success in the coming years.''
</P>
<P>
   The university is also publicly committed to building an
on-campus arena and hopes to begin groundbreaking before the end of
the year, although it still is in the process of raising the
necessary funds.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Former USC assistant Paul Mokeski, who attended Crespi
High in Encino, has an Aug. 10 hearing in Wisconsin for misdemeanor
possession of cocaine. He could be sentenced to up to one year in
jail and fined $5,000 if convicted. &QL;

   Astros' Holt walks away from line drive to face
</P>
<P>
   By SCOTT KAISER
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Staying with the pattern of this disheartening season,
Astros pitcher Chris Holt had to leave Friday night's 7-6 victory
over Montreal after getting hit in the face by a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros leading 5-4 in the fourth inning, Holt retired
the first two batters before Expos center fielder Peter Bergeron
lined a 1-0 pitch off Holt's left cheekbone.
</P>
<P>
   Holt tried to shield his face with his glove, but he took a
direct hit and crumpled to the ground. Blood was evident as he
remained on the grass for several minutes before gamely walking off
the field under his own power.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was scary,'' said Astros third baseman Chris Truby.
``I've seen it a couple of times (after the game) on TV, but it's
really scary out there. That's probably the scariest thing for a
pitcher and for the guys on the field. When you see his face, it's
something you just don't wish on anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt was taken to the hospital for X-rays, which surprisingly
revealed only a bruised left cheekbone. Astros officials said his
status is day-to-day, which means Holt may be able to make his next
scheduled start against the New York Mets on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of getting the swelling down and to where he can
get comfortable on the mound and throw again,'' manager Larry
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident brought back memories of July 15, 1998, when Astros
closer Billy Wagner was hit on the left side of his head by a ball
off the bat of Arizona's Kelly Stinnett. Wagner was briefly
hospitalized and spent nearly a month on the disabled list.

   Said Dierker: ``I didn't see it happen like I did with Billy,
because I was blocked by one of the vertical bars in the dugout. So
I didn't know if it deflected off his body or glove. It wasn't as
scary to me until I got out there, but then it looked worse because
his face was so swollen up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, I knew it wasn't worse, because Billy was dazed
when I got out there, and Chris was coherent. You could tell by his
answers to (assistant athletic trainer) Rex's (Jones) questions and
by the fact that he was moving around and looked like he was antsy
to get up.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt's injury extended a brutal stretch physically for the
Astros. Earlier this week, catcher Mitch Meluskey (right biceps
tendinitis), pitcher Shane Reynolds (two degenerative disks in his
lower back) and second baseman Craig Biggio (two ligament tears in
his left knee) were sidelined, with Biggio lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Holt) doesn't look good,'' said Biggio as he hobbled out of
the Astros' locker room on crutches. ``He's lucky (it wasn't
worse).''

   ATLANTA _ Tamara Allen wanted to like what she saw. She was in
the market for a president. She voted for Bill Clinton in two
elections, and for Ronald Reagan before that. But she reacted to
the Republican National Convention with disappointment and venom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astounded at the falsity, the facade of it all,'' said
Allen, an executive assistant for Hands On Atlanta, a nonprofit
service organization.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from her home in Grant Park, a predominantly black,
gentrifying neighborhood of Atlanta, Allen, who is black, was
heartened at first by the number of women and those belonging to
minorities on stage in Philadelphia. But then, she said, she went
``from being disappointed to being angry.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican Party hoped that assembling a festival of
diversity on the convention podium would convince voters that its
party had a grand new diverse face, conversations with voters in
four places in America this week indicated that it was not entirely
succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Voters interviewed here and in New York, Milwaukee and Los
Angeles had a wide array of reactions to the convention. Some found
things to approve of, like the gathering's patriotic fervor or what
they saw as Gov. George W. Bush's ``presidential stature.''
</P>
<P>
   But the one theme that ran consistently through many of their
observations was that they did not necessarily accept at face value
the rainbow image the Republicans were projecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this mega-infomercial, but not nearly as
entertaining,'' Allen said. ``Give me Ginzu knives.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, over four days of intermittent convention viewing in their
homes, three women undecided about their votes were less than sold
on Bush and were waiting to see whether the Democrats in Los
Angeles would be more captivating.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the women, Latara Jackson, 19, who will vote for
president this year for the first time, was at the end leaning,
however slightly, in the Democrats' direction. An intern with the
U.S. Department of Labor, she is a student who describes herself as
having conservative views. But after watching the convention's
opening night, she found herself leaning away from the Republican
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a last attempt to basically come out as just
very tolerant,'' Jackson said. ``It was like they were trying too
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, an admirer of retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, was
disappointed by his speech, which she found insincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a last-ditch effort, and I was kind of
disappointed that he would be a part of that,'' said Jackson, who,
like Powell, is black.
</P>
<P>
   She did not appreciate what she described as Bush`s rude remarks
about Vice President Al Gore's personality and character: ``He kind
of made personal jabs at him. I think he did that to kind of get
away from the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's vow to prohibit the kind of late-term procedure that
opponents call partial-birth abortion left Jackson feeling his
stance had been watered down. ``In reality, we know he thinks all
abortion is wrong,'' she said. &UR;  &LR; (Bush has said he is not against
abortion in cases of rape or incest or when a woman's life is in
danger.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole convention dealt with no issues at all,''
she said. ``Any attempt to deal with any issues was very weak, just
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   While she believed Bush appeared presidential, if she had to
vote tomorrow, Jackson would select Gore for what she saw as his
sincerity and his drive to try to do what he thinks is best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would define myself more as a Republican than a Democrat,''
she said. ``But I just couldn't vote for this Republican,'' mostly
because of the remarks he made against his opponent, but also
because of the Philadelphia celebration's efforts to include
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really late, like at the last minute,'' she said. ``It
was a really bad attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jane Kruzan, 72, a retired director of a volunteer
placement agency, said she was beginning to think she could forget
about some of the issues she felt strongly about, in order to vote
Republican, as she often does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment, gun control and campaign finance are
certainly not being answered in these three days, but I'm impressed
with the types of people promoting Governor Bush,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to the debates,'' said Kruzan, who
is white and lives in Decatur, an Atlanta suburb. ``I'm not ready
for the ballot box. I would not feel comfortable going tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt the same after hearing Bush's acceptance speech, which
she found comprehensive and impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he certainly articulated his views very well,'' she
said, ``but I will have to admit that the truth is in the
details.''
</P>
<P>
   She was glad he mentioned the environment, though it was too low
on his priority list for her, and she was not impressed by his plan
to enforce existing gun-control laws rather than push for stronger
ones.
</P>
<P>
   In all, she said, her opinion of the candidate rose during the
convention, particularly after she saw people who might serve in
his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, Allen sat back from the television and
played with her hair pensively. ``Today I'm just sad about my
choices,'' she said. ``I'm concerned now. Yesterday I was still
kind of waffling, but today I'm really sad. I don't know who I'm
going to vote for, and I love voting.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when Bush vowed to support a ban on the abortion
procedure, Allen, who is in her mid-30s, said he lost her vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you go,'' she said. ``OK, so, it's over for me. He just
told me I don't control me. He just told me that I don't count.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll wait and I'll see what Gore has to say,'' Allen
said Thursday. ``He better be honest. I mean just real stuff, not
all of this kind of `rockets' red glare,' lyrics from the anthem,
fields of waving grass and grain.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the convention had pushed her away from voting for
Ralph Nader, whom she admires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have voted for Nader before I saw this, but seeing
Cheney made me so afraid,'' she said. ``He doesn't represent half
the people or a quarter, he represents the upper echelon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I came out of this with anything, it's that I want a
debate. Bad. I can taste it I want it so bad,'' she said.
</P>

   &UR; Milwaukee &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Republican National Convention from his living
room, James Greer, a 54-year-old lawyer and an independent, found
himself awash in pleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   It was Laura Bush, the wife of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who
set the tone. ``She has a softer way,'' Greer said. ``She's really
a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Like movie critics, or perhaps Olympic judges, Greer and six
other Milwaukee residents watched the Republican convention this
week, giving marks for style and substance, ready to catch any
stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all of them _ a die-hard Republican, a devoted
Democrat and varying shades of independents _ agreed that while the
convention was lacking in suspense, it was also free of missteps.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, one resident, Brian Colon, 27, a computer
programmer, found comfort in retired Gen. Colin L. Powell's message
that many Americans deserved help.
</P>
<P>
   Another resident, Chiquita Lee, a 63-year-old homemaker and a
Republican, who is black, found it pleasing to watch Republicans
``of different colors _ this convention was really reaching out.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris Wright, a 36-year-old computer systems analyst, also
expressed approval that Republicans ``realize that demographics are
changing, and that they need to widen the umbrella.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kathleen Wyman, a 59-year-old real estate
agent, found the Republican efforts at racial diversity a bit
forced. ``Are these people really representative of the new
Republicans?'' Wyman said, muffling a chuckle. ``Of course they're
not.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Carolyn Castore, 47, the feel-good tenor of the opening
night was lacking in substance. ``It's like baby food,'' Castore
said, ``no flavor, no texture and designed to be easily
swallowed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the convention's second night, Greer offered praise as he
listened to speeches by Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Condoleezza
Rice, Bush's chief international affairs adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing Republicans do well is patriotism,'' he said. ``They
have a knack for waving the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon, so impressed by McCain, exclaimed: ``I wish I had this on
tape!''
</P>
<P>
   But others were not convinced that McCain was speaking from his
heart. ``McCain gives a very good speech,'' Wyman said, ``but I
would bet that in his heart of hearts, he doesn't believe what he
says about Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee was taken with Lynne Cheney, the wife of Dick Cheney, the
vice-presidential candidate. ``She showed her devotion and love for
her husband,'' she said, ``while still showing that she was her own
person.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wright, it was the videotape of past presidents, especially
Ronald Reagan, that rang bells. ``It was really very moving,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, when Cheney introduced himself to voters,
the reviews from the Milwaukee residents were mostly favorable but
hardly inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Lee found Cheney's speech to be a bit heavy on cliches. ``I
think he has to grow on you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Colon said, ``It was just a speech, not so good, not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wyman found Cheney's talk to be ``rational and to the
point.'' ``I can see this ticket being very attractive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Castore said Cheney's role was to shore up the conservative
base. ``Until he spoke, the messages had been so progressive, that
I was starting to feel sorry for the Republicans,'' she said. ``But
Cheney, with the whole morality issue, seemed to be bringing back
the base.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee residents paid most attention, not surprisingly,
to the speech by Bush on Thursday night. Most of them considered
the speech a success.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``looked presidential,'' Wyman said, and he ``comes across
better than his father ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   In some places, she said, it was almost Reaganesque, ``the way
he talked about real people and made things very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer noted that Bush ``didn't have his smirk,'' and said the
candidate scored points by presenting himself ``as a human,''
especially when making references to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Lee remarked on Bush's ``charisma, the friend-next-door
appeal,'' and applauded his plans on education.
</P>
<P>
   For Castore, the praise was grudging. ``As a speech it was OK,
but I thought his attacks on Gore fell flat,'' she said, referring
to Vice President Al Gore. ``A lot of what he said, it sounded
good. But I don't know what it means. It lacked so many
specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Colon, who had started the week not certain whether he
would vote for Bush or not, the speech was a clincher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just loved it,'' Colon said. ``I'm ready to march right out
and vote for him.''

</P>
<P>
   Maurice Vanegas is precisely the kind of person George W. Bush
has been straining to speak to this past week. He is a Latino and a
small-business owner, he hews to the political center, and he is
undecided about his vote this November. But after watching the
Republican convention, Vanegas is also a skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Bush is very noble and he wants to do the right
thing,'' said Vanegas, who is 31 and operates transportation and
real estate businesses. ``But as far as making me want to vote for
him, I'm still not there. As a Latino immigrant, being a bigger
superpower isn't something that appeals to me, and I don't mind
paying taxes or worry about a big tax cut. We just want opportunity
and a country with a big heart.''
</P>
<P>
   When Condoleezza Rice, a foreign policy expert, spoke on Tuesday
night, Vanegas said, he found her engaging but peripheral. ``How
much stronger do we need to be as a superpower?'' he asked. ``As a
Latino and an immigrant, that isn't something that appeals to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dick Cheney was introduced by his wife, Lynne, who
mentioned his interest in fly fishing, Vanegas was turned off.
``How many of us even thought about going fly fishing?'' he asked.
``I don't think many of us have the luxury of thinking about that.
I'm interested in work.''
</P>
<P>
   Another immigrant, Mario Matute, 40, who is voting in his first
presidential election, said he was impressed that Bush spoke some
Spanish and was at least interested in wooing Latinos. Matute
emigrated from El Salvador and runs a job development program.
</P>
<P>
   But after the convention appearances of two black speakers,
retired Gen. Colin Powell on Tuesday and Rice on Wednesday, Matute
said, he paid more attention to the color of the faces of the
delegates. ``Powell sounded mainly on the side of the Democrats by
addressing education and the racism that still exists in the
country,'' Matute said. ``They scored high with that. I think he
spoke from the heart, but if you looked at the faces there, it
didn't match. That was a disappointment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the convention, which he described as generally
impressive, he said: ``I want to believe that they are a new party
and more inclusive, but it didn't look real to me, especially when
it came to policies. I wanted to hear more about immigration policy
and jobs, not tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   With its white majority long gone, a soaring immigrant
population and a heavy reliance on small businesses, Los Angeles is
the kind of nascent metropolis of the future that both parties need
to capture to win the White House. Conversations with a handful of
residents found that most of them, even ardent Democrats, had been
impressed by Bush's sense of optimism. But there were also
questions about how new the party could be with its conservative
core intact _ a core that is still perceived by many people here to
be less sympathetic than the Democrats to immigrants and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Inouye, a mortgage banker, said that she had been turned off
by what she perceived to be a lack of moral rectitude in the
Clinton White House and that she had found much to like in the
Republican platform, even though she supports abortion rights. But
in response to Cheney's sometimes harsh speech, she said that some
of the attacks had been inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics shouldn't be so polarized,'' she said. ``Bush was
confident and optimistic, not negative. That may be his edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention itself was a spectacle that left many cold. Some
people who work in Hollywood, of course, saw it as a cynical act of
manipulation, and they had their own suggestions for appealing to a
broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should lock everybody in the convention hall like
`Survivor,''' said Robin Schiff, a television producer and
screenwriter. ``The last person alive is the candidate. It's
Republican `Survivor.' Now that's a convention I would watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Doherty, a television producer, is that rarity in
Hollywood, an avowed Republican. His views evolved throughout the
week. Early on, he expressed concerns about his party's chances. He
said he had been very impressed by Sen. John McCain's speech, but
that it had only emphasized what he perceived as a lack of talent
elsewhere in the party. ``I'm very frustrated because we have some
real problems with our image,'' he said. ``There's a charisma
problem. We don't have the most exciting A-list talent pool.''
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, however, O'Doherty expressed enthusiasm for the
convention as a successful show. He said he felt that Cheney's
speech had energized the convention for the first time. He
applauded Bush as a leader with good ideas in his speech, and he
said the party had focused on the positive with a high moral tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did exactly what his mission was,'' O'Doherty said of
Bush's speech on Thursday night. ``He had to convince the swing
voters to come over, and that's what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Doherty's writing partner, David Israel, is a Democrat, but he
found some common ground. ``I think the biggest thing he had to do
was to not appear smug, and he did that,'' Israel said. ``I think
he's a likable guy, and he didn't say anything you could disagree
with. But I still don't know what he's really going to do.''

   &UR; New York &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Political science students at New York University recognize
obscure de Toqueville quotations and argue the merits of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty vs. the Strategic Defense Initiative.
So when the Republican Convention rolled around they were an astute
audience, eager to analyze what George W. Bush set out to
accomplish and how well he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The students _ four from the undergraduate honors program and
three doctoral candidates _ differed on whether the convention was
``brilliant marketing,'' in the words of one, or ``insulting
propaganda,'' in the words of another. But all agreed it was a
textbook example of ``median voter theory'' and ``triangulation,''
insider jargon for capturing swing voters by show-casing the
popular issues of the opposition and burying the unpopular issues
of its own fringe, as Bill Clinton's Democrats did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the theme of inclusion is a blatant plea to
nontraditional Republican voters,'' said Ramsey J. Green, 20, as he
watched a rainbow coalition of speakers cross the podium in
Philadelphia. ``It seems as though they have finally realized that
their reputation as white, wealthy and Christian will not appeal to
socially liberal suburban voters and therefore prevent them from
enjoying the policies of a Republican president.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who will vote in his first presidential election, most
likely for Al Gore, veered between calling the tactic a ``sick
Republican scheme'' and saying that the convention had ``gone
extremely well'' for the party. Green argued with himself about
whether the Republicans were ``trying to pull the wool over my
eyes'' or ``making a serious attempt to change the party's
traditional ethnic and financial makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted, as Gov. Bush completed his acceptance speech to a
hail of confetti, that the candidate had probably ``cajoled'' many
non-Republicans to vote for him in November. But he said they would
probably ``be let down come the implementation of the real policies
of a Bush administration,'' which would revert to form. But Green
said that the tone of the convention was a healthy development for
the party and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the political aisle, Costas Panagopolous,
a doctoral student who ran unsuccessfully for the Massachusetts
Legislature while a Harvard undergraduate, also saw the Republican
show of inclusion as a plus.
</P>
<P>
   Panagopolous, 28, who ran as a Republican but has since
re-registered as an Independent, said that ``I do think it's a
strategy _ for now. But if they win the election, they'll know it
works and this will have been a first step. It has to start
somewhere. And there comes a point where perception becomes
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Panagopolous, with his experience as a candidate and a resume
filled with jobs in marketing, seemed to unnerve other students
with his unabashed admiration for the ``rebranding'' by the
Republican party. ``It's no different than repositioning Hush Puppy
shoes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sona Nadenicheck, a doctoral candidate devoted to academic
research, not the hurly-burly of politics, gasped: ``But that's not
who they really are!''
</P>
<P>
   Nadenicheck's husband and fellow student, Matt Golder, jumped
in. ``The goal is to get elected,'' he said, soothingly, comparing
the Republicans to the Labor Party in his British homeland. ``It
took the Labor Party 10 years to change their image,'' Golder said,
declaring by the end of the convention that the Republicans had
surely ``been effective at winning over some undecided voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The students were not equally engaged by the four-day
proceedings. Alissa Elliott, a 20-year-old with a bent for
international relations, watched hours of C-Span each night, as she
cooked dinner, ironed and answered e-mail and took detailed
exception to the foreign policy positions of several speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Panagopolous, also a nightly devotee, dissected the
ramifications of Bush's proposed tax cuts and lamented the
candidate's silence on international trade and domestic economic
indicators. Green seemed to have seen virtually every speaker,
Republican National Committee video and mariachi or Motown band.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Martin Wolf, 19, skipped the first night because a
broken fish tank had shorted out his television set, and he
considered Bush's speech, which he grudgingly watched, a ``waste of
my time.'' Nadenichek, 28, said she would have ignored the Bush
speech and worked on a conference paper were it not for her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt had the TV on and we have a small one-bedroom
apartment,'' Nadenichek said. She was scornful of the Republican
performance throughout, but said it was more interesting than it
might have been because Golder brought a fresh eye to this American
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   All of the students noted, admiringly, the Republicans finesse
at highlighting the improprieties, sexual and otherwise, of the
Clinton White House and tarnishing Gore in the process. They also
thought it deft to call attention to the nation's prosperity, the
Democrat's crowning achievement in the past eight years, while
characterizing it as an opportunity wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush tried to point out what is morally wrong with the
executive administration today while pointing out what is right
with the economy,'' Green said. ``Theoretically, I guess this means
all Bush has to do is win the election, move into the White House,
do no harm to the economy and remain faithful to his wife. Sounds
like a pretty easy job.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Gov. George W. Bush came roaring out of the Republican
National Convention on Friday by plane, train and automobile,
intent on sustaining whatever momentum he seized from the four-day
political extravaganza in Philadelphia and focused on a group of
swing states that Democrats won in both of the last two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, now officially the Republican presidential
nominee, traveled from Pennsylvania to Michigan, with several stops
in Ohio in between, to reiterate his vow to bring a new harmony and
integrity to Washington, rejoice in the unity that he said the
Republican Party had achieved and just plain grin. It was clear
that Bush had been pleased with the convention, and with his own
performance there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how energized I am,'' Bush told a crowd of
hundreds along a stretch of train tracks near downtown Pittsburgh,
where he began the westward whistlestop tour that consumed the bulk
of his day. In a classic campaign tableau, he stood on a kind of
balcony, draped in red, white and blue bunting, at the back of the
rear car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be long now,'' Bush said, repeating a line from his
convention speech that forecast the ouster of President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore and the arrival of a Republican
administration in their stead. ``Give us a chance to change America
for the better, and it won't be long now.''
</P>
<P>
   For this post-convention tour, Bush introduced a new slogan,
``Change the Tone,'' reflecting his pledge to purge Washington of
its partisan acrimony.
</P>
<P>
   But like parts of the remarks that both he and his running mate,
Dick Cheney, delivered at the convention, their comments together
on the cam- paign trail Friday occasionally L amounted to partisan
appeals. At a rally in Akron, Ohio, Friday night, Cheney said he
wanted ``to give our kids and our grandkids the kind of White House
they can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all gotten a little tired of the Clinton-Gore
operation,'' Cheney said. Then, taking a line from his convention
speech, he add- ed, ``Help is on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the earlier stop in Pitts- burgh, the crowd chanted: ``No
more Gore! No more Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   The dissonance in Bush's day extended not just to tone in
general but also to the specific topic of inclusion. At a prayer
breakfast this morning in Philadelphia, he made a point of saying
that ``the gateway to heaven has many different paths.'' But one of
the invited guests, Cardi- nal Anthony Bevilacqua, archbishop of
Philadelphia, explicitly con-L demned abortion and implicitly in-
dicted marriage between homosex- uals. The cardinal said that
``mil- lions of children have been slaugh- tered'' and, in the
context of what he saw as a trend toward redefining marriage,
maintained that society was plagued by ``sexually unbridled
permissiveness.'' On his campaign plane Friday, Bush said that he
was not indulging in negative campaigning, against either Clinton
or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say I'm going to bring honor and dignity to the White
House,'' Bush said, ``that's what I'm going to do. And if people
draw conclusions other than that, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to some pointed jokes about Gore in his convention
speech, Bush added: ``The idea of needling the opponent with good
humor _ that's what American politics should be about, as opposed
to trying to tear people down and distort. And I'm going to
continue pointing up differences, and I will do so in a respectful
way and occasionally put a needle out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Several polls taken toward the end of the convention suggested
that Bush had latched onto an effective strategy and was enjoying a
better ``bounce'' from the event, and from the attention that it
garnered, than candidates sometimes do.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A bipartisan survey conducted during the convention by Voter.com
found a 10-point bounce for Bush, leaving him with 49 percent and
Gore with 31 percent. Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, had 6
percent, and Pat Buchanan, the likely Reform Party candidate, had 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because those polls were so promising, the Bush campaign
actually sought to soft-pedal them, so that Republicans would not
be lulled into an outsize optimism about Bush's prospects, and so
that the inevitable tightening of the race between Bush and Gore
would not be portrayed as a downturn for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``Listen, there's going to be all kinds of polls and
speculation between now and Election Day and I understand that and
that's why I think it's so important for us to be patient and keep
our eye on the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   A campaign spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, ``You've got to wait
a few days, let the bounce settle. Al Gore has much more room to
bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign's confidence was evident in its itinerary:
just as Bush had traveled to the convention by visiting a series of
states that Republicans had not won in a presidential election
since 1988, it was traveling out of the convention in the same
fashion. After stops over the next few days in Ohio, Michigan and
Illinois, the campaign is heading next week to California, Oregon
and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To help hold onto the sense of momentousness from the
convention, Bush traveled with his wife, Laura; his running mate,
Dick Cheney; Cheney's wife, Lynne, and a larger group of his senior
advisers than he typically does. And he hit more than half a dozen
cities on the train, which started in Pittsburgh and ended in
Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The stops came as frequently as every 15 to 20 minutes, and Bush
kept his remarks extremely brief, electing general expressions of
emotion over specific allusions to policy. Time and again, he
reflected that his favorite moment of the convention was the speech
by Laura Bush on Monday night, and he remarked on what a beautiful
smile she had.

ALASKA AIRLINES GROUNDS JETS TO RECHECK TAIL MECHANISMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 5th graf explaining number change) 
By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Alaska Airlines said Friday that it had canceled 48
flights in the past two days after grounding 17 of its 34 MD-80
aircraft for inspections. Those planes are the same model as the
one that crashed off the Southern California coast in January,
killing 88 people, when a part in the tail section malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska said it acted after finding that a measurement tool made
by the airline to monitor wear on the tail part had produced
inconsistent readings, meaning that it might have failed to detect
unacceptable wear in a control mechanism called a jackscrew. A
factor in the January crash is believed to have been problems with
the plane's jackscrew, which had been checked with a tool made by
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Alaska, Dave Marriott, said that as of late
Friday afternoon, the airline had checked all 17 of the grounded
planes with a measurement tool made by Boeing, the plane's
manufacturer, and had found the tail parts to be within acceptable
tolerances. The planes were returned to service by Friday evening,
Marriott said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska had said on Thursday night that it was grounding 18
aircraft, but changed that to 17 after learning that one jet had
been checked with a Boeing tool.
</P>
<P>
   The airline canceled 19 flights on Thursday night and 29 Friday,
and rebooked passengers on other flights or other airlines. Alaska,
based in Seattle, averages 500 flights a day and is a major carrier
between the Pacific Northwest and cities in California.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has 92 aircraft, 34 of which are MD-80s. Another
Alaska spokesman, Jack Evans, said half of the MD-80s had been
recently inspected using tools made by Boeing, and were not
grounded. The MD-80 maintenance manual says that motion in the
jackscrew should be measured using a tool made by the aircraft
manufacturer or an ``equivalent substitute.'' Alaska mechanics had
inspected several of the other MD-80s using a tool made in the
carrier's machine shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airline found that the measurements could vary if the
carrier's tool was improperly positioned,'' Alaska said Friday in a
news release. The airline said it had notified the Federal Aviation
Administration and had begun ``reinspecting the jackscrews on the
affected aircraft using the tool made by the aircraft
manufacturer.'' The airline suggested there was uncertainty as to
whether its tool was considered an ``equivalent substitute.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the FAA, Diane Spitalieri, said that checks had
determined that other airlines were using a mix of tools, some
built by the McDonnell Douglas division of Boeing, and others made
by the airlines. Spitalieri said the agency had not found any tools
that produced inconsistent results, but more tools remained to be
checked.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing assumed production of the MD-80, which is a more recent
variant of the DC-9, after it took over McDonnell Douglas three
years ago in a $16.3 billion merger. There are roughly 2,000 MD-80s
and DC-9s in service around the world.

SOME SURVIVED PHILLY FEST, SOME DIDN'T
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The delegates have taken their stuffed elephants
and ``Liberals Make Me Sick'' buttons, and gone home.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, and his running mate,
Dick Cheney, are coming off the high.
</P>
<P>
   And the drugstores are selling hangover remedies like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, there was lots of celebrating by the GOP when the
Republican National Convention wrapped up here. It was a love-fest
from start to finish, and it went off without a hitch. From Bo
Derek to Bob Dole, delegates and big donors alike got their money's
worth, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will be remembered for a lot of things, mostly
for the fact that Americans, and networks, admitted they like
``Survivor'' better. Why not? On that island, they were eating the
rats and voting each other outta there &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But Philadelphia had its own tribal winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   And here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WINNERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Dubya:  &LR; Could the coronation have been any grander? Could &LR; 
the feel-good have been any goodlier? &LR; The man from Midland put his
stamp all over it, and his masses ate it up. Dubya, they luvya.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --George Herbert Walker Bush:  &LR; Four years ago, Daddy didn't
merit the convention limelight. Now the party doormat has turned
hero. Babs is looking good, too.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --Condoleezza Rice:  &LR; Nitpickers say she's too polished. But
whooping it up over Steve Young or discussing foreign policy, two
words come to mind: class act.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; --Abel Maldonado:  &LR; Santa Maria GOP assemblyman provided salsa,
delivering the most authentic speech of the convention  &UR; en &LR; 
 &UR; espanol. Que Viva! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Ralph Nader:  &LR; Green guy ends up with a floor pass, and sends
Republican security teams into environmental crisis. You go, boy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Laura Bush:  &LR; Under pressure to produce, Mom came through
with some down home cookin'.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Vicente Fernandez:  &LR; Awesome Mexican music idol does the
impossible: gets Republicans to sing mariachi music in unison.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- J.C. Watts:  &LR; What's up with this guy? If he got any more
face time, he'd have his own miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOSERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Bob Dole:  &LR; ``There's still time for a recount?'' Don't think
so, Bob.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Dick Cheney:  &LR; Electrifying? Charismatic? Uh, like a
marshmallow sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Newt Gingrich:  &LR; Former GOP icon spotted in the back parking
lot wearing a ``Got Satan?'' T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Bush brothers:  &LR; Neal, with that old savings scandal, and
marvelous Marvin, so _ are they orphans? And Jeb _ smart,
bilingual, tech-savvy, big gov, big state. Why the mere hand-waving
duty?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- GOP elected women:  &LR; Relegated to kitchen hostess duties, or
hidden in the wings. Christi Todd? Kay Bailey? Baby, are you out
there?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- Jim Rogan, Tom Campbell, Rick Lazio:  &LR; Battling for their
lives in three of the most high-profile congressional races in the
country. But a speaking slot in Dubyafest? Nooo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- The GOP motto:  &LR; ``Renewing America's Purpose _ Together.''
Huh?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -- The media:  &LR; Frozen out of big fund-raisers, isolated from
the delegates in third-rate hotels with no mini-bars. And that
never-ending nightmare: a no-conflict convention.

RANGERS FADING QUICKLY AS BLUE JAYS RALLY FOR WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Remember David Clyde?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1973
amateur draft, the only time in club history they've had the top
pick of the draft. He didn't quite work out, but, who knows, the
Rangers might have better luck next year.
</P>
<P>
   Did somebody say wild-card race? Take a closer look at the
standings. The Rangers are much closer to the worst record in the
American League, and the No. 1 draft pick, than they are to the
wild-card leader, and it seems to be getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers let a 5-3 lead slip away by allowing seven runs in
two innings and fell to the Toronto Blue Jays, 10-8, last night at
SkyDome. The loss was the Rangers fifth in their past six games and
not only are they 9 1/2 games behind the Oakland Athletics in the
wild-card race, but they are just six games ahead of the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, owners of the worst record in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' Rangers second baseman Luis Alicea
said. ``Today was a good example. We played hard, we were ahead in
the game, they took the lead, we tied it, then they came back and
won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrin Fletcher delivered the game-winning hit, a two-run double
with two out in the bottom of the eighth inning. The Blue Jays had
taken an 8-5 lead in the bottom of the seventh with five runs off
Matt Perisho and Francisco Cordero before the Rangers rallied with
three in the top of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But reliever Mike Venafro couldn't keep it tied. With two outs,
he gave up a single to Tony Batista and hit Jose Cruz before
Fletcher, after fouling off three consecutive 2-2 pitches, grounded
one down the third-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said before the season that with all the
Rangers' young players, they could end up being much better in the
second half than the first half. But he knows now that's not going
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that changed when \RRuben\S Mateo got hurt, \RGabe\S
Kapler got hurt, \RPudge\S Rodriguez got hurt and we traded
\RDavid\S Segui,'' Oates said. ``All of those factors have changed
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Oates is trying to win with a roster filled with young
players who have some talent, but make key mistakes. Right fielder
Ricky Ledee dropped a fly ball in the fifth last night that led to
two unearned runs. Perisho, leading 5-3, walked the leadoff hitter
in the seventh. Cordero kept trying to blow hitters away and ended
up throwing hittable pitches down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Oates knows it's going to be hard, and he said bluntly: ``I'm
resigned to it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make sure the veteran players understand they
were young players once, they were rookies and they made
mistakes,'' Oates said. ``The goal is to win as many games as we
can, but we've got to give them a chance to play. I'm not into
development at the major-league level, but we've got to be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be difficult, not only for Oates, but for a team that
has played hard up to this point. The schedule keeps getting more
difficult with 32 of the next 55 on the road and an August schedule
against traditional powers New York, Boston and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   This could get ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't will the team to win,'' Oates said. ``I'm not that
powerful. All I can say is we'll give a good effort. We still have
to play one-third of the season. You hired out for 162 games. If
they don't play hard _ which I don't expect, because we've been
busting our tails _ then we can fix that too.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Rusty Greer said, ``I can't foresee the future but I
think there's going to be some ups and downs. It's up to the
veterans to go out and stabilize the club, take it upon ourselves
to lead the way. We're going to have to play hard and get some
breaks, but that doesn't mean we can't go out and play good
baseball and win some games.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise they could be searching for the next David Clyde. nn

PLAN FOR TIMES SQUARE SINATRA STATUE GETS UNDER SKIN OF SOME
PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
  (CHANGES quote to paraphrase in 9th graf)   
 By DEAN E. MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Francis Patrick Duffy got a spot in Times
Square in 1936 for his heroics on the battlefield and the streets
of Hell's Kitchen. George M. Cohan followed in 1959 as a tribute to
one of show business' greatest song and dance men.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says there is room for one more famous
bronze guy out there on the crossroads of the world. The mayor and
his office have taken a shine to Frank Sinatra, whose last big hit,
in 1980, was ``New York, New York.'' The late entertainer's
daughter, Nancy Sinatra, has found a sculptor and promises to come
up with the money. There is even talk of an interactive Sinatra,
who would croon on command.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy Sinatra is thrilled; this is her dream,'' said Charlotte
Cohen of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, who has been
involved in the plans. ``Everyone would love to see it done
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hushed refrain playing around Times Square is not so
gushing or welcoming. Start spreading the news, it goes. Not Here,
Not Here.
</P>
<P>
   No one really wants to say so, at least not loudly enough to irk
Giuliani or offend the Sinatra family, but the plan to erect a
statue of Ol' Blue Eyes on a traffic island at 44th Street and
Broadway (across the street from the site off the old Paramount
Theater, where Sinatra made his first real splash in 1942) has
acquired some enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The local community board, along with some Times Square
developers, isn't crazy about the idea of a new tourist attraction
in a place where the sidewalks are already overwhelmed by crowds.
And the theater moguls say the square's 100-year-old theatrical
tradition would be shortchanged by showcasing a singer and film
actor who started in Hoboken, N.J., made a quick sensation at the
Paramount Theater and then followed fame and fortune west of the
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone bristles at the thought of Giuliani as arbiter of
Broadway celebrity. The community board and other local groups have
written a letter to the mayor asking for a meeting. They hope, at
least, to get the statue moved to a less central location.
</P>
<P>
   `The real issue for a lot of us is, what is the association with
Broadway?'' said Michael Presser, executive director of Inside
Broadway, the theater industry's educational program with New York
City schools. ``We see an extremely popular artist and legend, a
man of great achievement, but we don't necessarily see someone who
has been closely associated with New York theater. We feel he is
due an honor, but we also question this particular spot in this
particular neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra fancied himself top of the heap in the city that doesn't
sleep, but if the grumbling around Times Square is to be believed,
New Yorkers would like less Las Vegas and Hollywood in their
traffic-island idols. Times Square may be the center of the
universe, but it is also a stronghold of Midtown provincialism: On
the Great White Way, Sinatra, real or cast, is regarded as
decidedly off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office won't hear of it. Indeed, Anthony Carbonetti,
Giuliani's chief of staff, says they have not heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   Any opposition to Sinatra?
</P>
<P>
   ``That hasn't come up,'' Carbonetti replied.
</P>
<P>
   Does Sinatra deserve to be front and center in Times Square?
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think so,'' he said. ``But I am an
Italian-American who grew up listening to Frank Sinatra, and my
father would disown me if I said anything to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Sinatra insurrection is being staged largely in
whispers and behind closed doors is not entirely surprising.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, it is downright embarrassing for naysayers to
confess their misgivings in public. It is not easy to explain
objections to a 10-foot monument to one of America's greatest pop
singers, regardless of his New York pedigree. Times Square is
already home to a pro-wrestling restaurant and the retailer Toys
``R'' Us plans to build a 60-foot-tall indoor Ferris wheel across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the problem of City Hall and a mayor who, as one
Times Square community leader put it, is easy to make cranky.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Sinatra went directly to Giuliani with the statue proposal
shortly after her father died in Los Angeles in May 1998, city
officials said. Carbonetti said she had apparently made the
suggestion years earlier, but was encouraged to come back when her
father was no longer living. Statues in New York, unlike street
names in Sinatra's desert haunt of Palm Springs, Calif., are the
exclusive domain of the departed.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani loved the idea and, as he is sometimes inclined to do,
gave the seal of approval without consulting particularly far and
wide.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra initiated a design competition last August, settling in
December on Neil Estern, an accomplished Brooklyn Heights sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinatra-Giuliani plan was cast in stone _ or more precisely,
bronze _ before most anyone around Times Square got wind of it.
Official notice to Times Square businesses came in January as a
fait accompli from the City Department of Transportation, which
owns the concrete swath of Broadway and Seventh Avenue that Sinatra
will share with the armed forces recruiting booth.
</P>
<P>
   A community meeting with city officials, and possibly Nancy
Sinatra, is in the making. The session was proposed in May by the
leaders of three of the area's most influential organizations:
Community Board 5, the Times Square Business Improvement District
and the Mayor's Midtown Citizens Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Giuliani, the three community groups stayed away
from questioning Sinatra's New York bona fides. Instead, they
raised fears that another attraction in Times Square, already the
human equivalent of an overrun ant hill, would lock up the last
piece of open space in the theater district.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the recruiting booth island doubles as Dick
Clark's stage on New Year's Eve, and it is also used to present
Broadway on Broadway and numerous other public events. It amounts
to little more than a Gotham-sized slice of concrete pizza, but
it's all Times Square has got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily think any statue would be appropriate for
Times Square because we probably have enough going on,'' said David
Diamond, executive director of the Stage Directors and
Choreographers Foundation, who heads the community board's
committee on Times Square. ``But I don't want to discount the
possibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Diamond's suggestion: Put Sinatra's statue in Hoboken and place
a plaque honoring him at 1501 Broadway, the former Paramount
Theater that is now a World Wrestling Federation restaurant. It was
there that thousands of screaming bobby-soxers _ 30,000 of them on
Oct. 12, 1944 _ turned Sinatra into solo music's greatest pop
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   And who should stand in for Sinatra on the recruiting booth
island?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be quoted on any name,'' Diamond said. ``I
don't want to leave anyone out and offend someone.''
</P>
<P>
   But aren't they are all dead anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have estates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office says it has already solved the overcrowding
quandary by instructing Estern to come up with a design that would
allow Sinatra to be carted off for special occasions. The
Department of Transportation also has plans to restrict pedestrian
access to the island to keep fans from spilling into the street and
disrupting traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The city is still undecided about whether the statue should
sing, reserving judgment until the implications for traffic and
nearby office workers can be studied. Estern says no one has talked
to him about adapting his art into ``an elaborate juke box,'' as he
called it, but he is clearly not enamored with the suggestion.
Diamond and others who work in the area share his reluctance,
largely out of fear of overdosing on Sinatra's barreling baritone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to have a public debate, after all this is a
democracy,'' Presser said. ``This is a very public piece of land.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, director of the Percent for Art program in the Department
of Cultural Affairs, said the statue, as a privately financed
project, has not received the intense scrutiny required when public
money is expended. Nonetheless, she said, the statue must still be
reviewed by the City Art Commission for design approval and by the
Department of Transportation for traffic and safety considerations.
It is unclear, however, whether either agency will hold a public
hearing, she said.
</P>

   ``I think if it is something the mayor wants, then I think there
will be a statue,'' said a Midtown developer unwilling to speak if
he were named. ``Is there support? There is support, I guess,
official support.''
</P>
<P>
   Estern, an avid fan of Sinatra who regards the singer as the
perfect fit for Times Square, also thinks the resilient showman
will prevail. Look no further than Sinatra's own ode to the city,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere,'' Estern
recited. ``It's up to you _ New York, New York.''

EXPECTING DNC CRUNCH, CITY WILL CLOSE STREETS EARLY &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The crunch of the Democratic National Convention
will start to be felt Monday by downtown businesses and commuters,
with some surface streets and freeway ramps closing a week before
the big event.
</P>
<P>
   Bracing for potentially violent protests during the Aug. 14-17
convention, most of the jewelry district and many other downtown
businesses will close, while other merchants plan to hire extra
security and stagger work schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``No city department, be it police or what have you, can
guarantee it (safety),'' Peklar Pilavjian, owner of the 500-tenant
St. Vincent Jewelry Center, which plans to close during the
convention, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way business reacts is they just shut down. They say the
heck with it, it's not worth the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Caltrans plans to shut down three heavily traveled downtown
freeway ramps near Staples Center starting Monday, so crews can
begin cleanup work and graffiti removal.
</P>
<P>
   The city has already begun closing surface streets near Staples
as security fencing goes up around the arena's perimeter, which
means downtown commuters can expect two weeks of detours, delays
and distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most people are prepared,'' said Jeff Baugh, who
has observed Los Angeles traffic for 14 years as a traffic reporter
for KFWB-AM (980).
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be. If I work in downtown Los Angeles, this
weekend I'd be sitting at the coffee table, and I'd have the Thomas
Guide in front of me. I might go to Kinko's and blow up (maps) and
make sure I knew that entire area just to avoid problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The ramps scheduled to close Monday are the Pico Boulevard
off-ramp and 11th Street on-ramp on the northbound Harbor Freeway;
and the Pico off-ramp on the westbound Santa Monica Freeway. About
120 detour signs will be posted between Los Angeles International
Airport and Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, small sections of Figueroa Street, Pico and Flower
Street nearest Staples will also be closed. By Friday, the area
bordered by Venice Boulevard, Union Avenue, Hope Street and Olympic
Boulevard will be subject to travel restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   While no additional freeway closings are expected during the
convention, Caltrans will keep a close eye on the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our traffic engineers are going to be monitoring everything so
they can help traffic get around as smoothly and efficiently as
possible,'' said Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli. ``If
problems do develop they'll seek the best ways to work them out to
everyone's satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   During the convention itself, city officials urge downtown
commuters to take public transit. But all Metropolitan
Transportation Authority bus lines that currently pass near Staples
are already being diverted, so bus riders are advised to allow at
least an extra 15 minutes. The nearest Metro Rail station to
Staples is Pico, on the Blue Line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraging ride sharing and public transit,'' said
Frank Martinez, the city's DNC coordinator. ``We're encouraging
working with your employer in terms of flexible hours. You might
want to come in a little early and leave a little early.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies have taken that advice a step further and
decided to shut down altogether during the convention, either
fearing violent protests or because they expect customers to avoid
downtown anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get 10,000 or 20,000 people gathering around for
a demonstration, the potential is always there for it to go out of
control,'' Pilavjian said.
</P>
<P>
   The 275 retail tenants in his building each averages about
$1,000 in business a day, he said - meaning that during the
four-day convention, his tenants alone will lose more than $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Many offices that aren't dependent on retail customers are
advising employees to work at home or take their vacation days.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corporation, said the 35 employees at the EDC are
planning to work at home at least Monday, if not longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll wait to see what happens,'' Kyser said. ``The problem is
it's almost like Y2K revisited. You have so many stories about
what's going to happen and I think everyone is being prudent. They
don't want to risk their employees and customers.''
</P>

real-time traffic flows during the convention - or the convention
in general, see the city's Web site, www.lacity.org.

YANKEES' HERNANDEZ UPSET OVER POSSIBLE SKEPTICS  

</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez said Friday that there are Yankees
coaches who doubted the severity of his injury when he was placed
on the disabled list last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some coaches mentioned behind people's back that maybe I
wasn't as hurt as I thought,'' Hernandez said, without prompting,
through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who appeared to be near tears, added that it hurt him
very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is because they didn't come to my face and say it
to me,'' he said. ``I don't play around with my work.''
</P>
<P>
   On the disabled list because of elbow and back trouble,
Hernandez was asked to whom he was referring: ``Don't ask,'' he
replied. ``I am a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, said he was
surprised by Hernandez's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that we don't do, and I can speak for the
staff, is that we never have doubts about when people are hurt,''
Stottlemyre said. ``We've always gone the extra mile to make sure
people are OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre added, ``I think that's something that's
self-inflicted. I'm sorry he feels that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, spoke with
Hernandez just before Friday night's game against Seattle and said
El Duque would not elaborate or offer more insight into his
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel powerless to deal with it,'' Cashman said,
``because I don't know anything about it. Normally you deal with
things straight up _ if you have a problem with someone, you speak
to them directly about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is scheduled to be activated Saturday to pitch against
the Mariners.

REED'S STRONG START STOPS JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Randy Johnson is everything Rick Reed is not. Scraggly
curls dangle from Johnson's Arizona Diamondbacks cap and fastballs
sizzle from his left arm. The right-handed Reed closely crops what
little hair he has, and his fastballs have none of Johnson's zip.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night at Bank One Ballpark, there was another difference:
Johnson was battered and Reed was brilliant. With 7 2/3 innings of
numbing precision, Reed pitched the New York Mets to a 6-1 victory.
The Mets have won nine of their last 10 games, and have beaten
Johnson the last three times he has faced them.
</P>
<P>
   Reed (6-2) carried a three-hit shutout into the eighth inning,
and he had set down 11 hitters in a row when Kelly Stinnett singled
in the eighth. Two more singles gave the Diamondbacks a run and
knocked Reed from the game, but by then the Mets led comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has terrorized opposing teams for years, and he is at
the peak of his effectiveness. In 45 starts since last May 30, when
he beat the Mets at Shea Stadium, he has a 2.14 earned run average
against all other teams. But in three starts against the Mets,
including the opener of last year's first playoff round, Johnson
has a 6.75 ERA, and Arizona has lost all three games.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before the game why his team has had success against
Johnson, Mets manager Bobby Valentine gave a sportsmanlike answer.
``Our hits have fallen in, I guess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason may be the Mets' aggressiveness as a team,
which runs counter to their usual approach. The Mets are among the
most patient teams in the league, letting pitchers work deep counts
and drawing the fourth-most walks in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   But when teams let Johnson get ahead in the count with his
fastball, they face the task of trying to hit his slider, which is
considered his best pitch. When the Mets beat Johnson in May, the
Diamondbacks' catcher, Damian Miller, said he was surprised at the
way the Mets swung early. But, Miller had to admit, that is how he
would approach Johnson, too. Friday night, the first four Mets who
put the ball in play did so on the first or second pitch they
faced. All it produced was a single, pop out and two ground outs.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases empty and two outs in the second, Johnson fell
behind Jay Payton, 2-0. The count evened at 2-2, Payton hit two
foul balls, then Johnson threw another ball. On the full-count
pitch, Johnson jammed Payton, breaking his bat as Payton looped a
double to shallow left.
</P>
<P>
   It was troublesome, because it brought up Joe McEwing, who has
become a nemesis of Johnson's. Reserve players like McEwing
sometimes succeed against Johnson; they fill in for starters who
take a well-timed day off against the dominating left-hander. Jeff
Reboluet filled this role with Baltimore, when Johnson pitched for
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing got his first career hit off Johnson, in 1998, and had
two doubles and a homer off him this May. With the pitcher on deck,
Johnson pitched carefully to McEwing, and fell behind, 3-0. His 3-1
pitch was a fastball down in the zone _ a good pitch, it seemed,
but McEwing drilled it to the gap in right-center for a run-scoring
double that put the Mets ahead, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets singled twice off Johnson in the third until Todd
Zeile, who is 0 for 10 in his career against Johnson, saw three
pitches and fanned on a slider to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth, the bottom of the Mets' order bedeviled
Johnson again. Benny Agbayani smoked a slider into the left-field
corner for a double. Payton swung at a first-pitch slider and drove
it to right field for a single, putting runners at the corners.
</P>
<P>
   McEwing stood in, and again Johnson suffered. His first two
pitches were balls, and McEwing drove the third to right field for
a sacrifice fly, putting the Mets ahead, 2-0. Payton took second on
a sacrifice and third on a wild pitch, and Mike Bordick walked.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Derek Bell, who looked utterly helpless while
striking out in his first two at-bats off Johnson. This was
Johnson's escape hatch, but he could not take it. He fell behind
Bell, and when the count evened at 2-2, he missed badly with a high
fastball to run the count full. Bell hung tough, fouling off three
pitches before bouncing a routine grounder to short that should
have ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack bobbled the ball, and by the time he recovered and
threw to first, Bell had crossed the bag and Payton had scored.
Johnson was clearly shaken _ he missed inside on four straight
pitches to Edgardo Alfonzo, bringing up Mike Piazza with the bases
loaded and inviting disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has been lethal with the bases loaded, and this time was
no different. He fouled off two pitches with two strikes, then
lashed a two-run single to right that gave the Mets a 5-0 lead.
Johnson had thrown 89 pitches, and he would throw no more: Russ
Springer came in from the bullpen and the Diamondbacks finally got
out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, it was his shortest start since May 19, 1998, when
he lasted three innings in a start for the Mariners.

KNICKS GIVE FORTSON A RIDE BUT NO PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Danny Fortson got to ride in a black limousine, but
that was about it.
</P>
<P>
   There was no star-studded video presentation as there was for
Grant Hill, no yachting excursion as there was for Brian Grant, and
no promise of a major role on the team.
</P>
<P>
   What Fortson, a 6-foot-7-inch power forward for the Boston
Celtics, received Friday was a tour of the Knicks' practice
facility at SUNY-Purchase and this offer: Work hard, play well and
maybe court time alongside Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson and Kurt
Thomas awaits you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're not making any promises or anything,''
Fortson said Friday before touring Westchester County, New York,
with General Manager Scott Layden and coach Jeff Van Gundy.
``They've just discussed with me what the team needs and kind of
left it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Knicks may not have made Fortson feel like the
league's most coveted player, they are interested in acquiring his
services. They offered him the $2.25 million midlevel exception
earlier this week, but Fortson and his agent, Raymond Brothers,
turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   Fortson said he has narrowed his choices to the Knicks and the
Golden State Warriors, who also are offering the midlevel
exception, and that he hopes to decide next week. The Knicks may
welcome the extra time because, while still a long shot, there is a
possibility that they could obtain Grant, the Portland Trail
Blazers forward.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Grant turned down the seven-year, $90 million
sign-and-trade offer that would have sent him to the Cleveland
Cavaliers for Shawn Kemp. Having opted out of the final four years
_ worth $40 million _ of his seven-year, $63 million contract with
Portland, his decision leaves him with few options. One of them,
besides returning to Portland, is to accept a midlevel exception
from another team, perhaps the Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers or
the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Miami will be significantly under the salary cap next season. So
after playing for $2.25 million this year, Grant could receive a
big payday from the Heat next season. It is doubtful that he would
sign with the Lakers or the Knicks because they could not give him
much of a pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Grant, who averaged 7.3 points and 5.5
rebounds last season, will return to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' best hope is that Cleveland, desperate to trade
Kemp, will be forced into taking the best deal available, and will
accept Marcus Camby and Chris Childs from the Knicks in a deal that
would send Kemp to Portland and Grant to New York. Mark
Bartelstein, Grant's agent, has been pushing for that deal, and the
Knicks spoke with him Friday after learning that Grant had balked
at going to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to talk to Brian and see if there's a
possibility of him coming to New York,'' Layden said. ``We're going
to continue to work and try to get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long shot to start with and it's still a long shot,''
Van Gundy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fortson, who hopes the Knicks or Warriors can work a
sign-and-trade deal with the Celtics so he could receive more
money. He said much of his decision will come down to playing time.
That would favor the Warriors, who would start him at power forward
or play him roughly 30 minutes a game off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is going to have a lot to do with my role on the
team,'' said Fortson, 24. ``I have a good opportunity at Golden
State to go in there and play as many minutes as I want. I
definitely have to take that into consideration. I'm not getting
any younger. I need to go out and do some damage while I can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When given the opportunity, Fortson has done plenty of damage.
Two years ago, he averaged 11 points and 11.6 rebounds in just 28
minutes per game for Denver. And he led the league in offensive
rebounds, a category in which the Knicks ranked last in the NBA
this past season. Last year, he averaged 6.7 rebounds in just 15.6
minutes per game for Boston. But despite his rebounding prowess,
his lack of mobility and proclivity to foul has limited his minutes
and stock.
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks' top frontcourt players remain healthy, Fortson's
minutes could remain sparse if he joined them. In his eyes, that
could override their ability to contend for the Eastern Conference
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to win, so that has something to do with it,'' Fortson
said. ``But at the same time, I care about myself as far as
developing into a good player, so I have to always keep that in the
back of my mind _ where I'm going to go and become the best I can
be.''

WALTRIP SAVORS SURPRISING TRIP TO FRONT ROW FOR BRICKYARD 400 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE CALDWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Twenty-four delightful and exhausting hours
later, Darrell Waltrip said his right hand was killing him, adding
as he flexed his hand that he could deal with the pain that only
politicians on whistle-stop tours can really know.
</P>
<P>
   So many people were so happy for Waltrip after he made the front
row for Saturday's Brickyard 400 with a surprisingly speedy
qualifying run that they offered jubilant, hearty handshakes deep
into Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the handshakes were a little too hearty. The popular,
self-deprecating, high-voltage veteran said he was actually tired
when he showed up for work this morning, and he joked that he
thought his hand would fall off if one more person shook it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in a way, he said he had not felt this invigorated in a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   When Waltrip's qualifying run was over Thursday afternoon, he
stood in front of the main grandstand at Indianapolis Motor
Speedway and did a crowd-pleasing reprise of the dance he borrowed
from Ickey Woods, the former Cincinnati Bengals running back, when
he won the Daytona 500 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Now Waltrip, 53, midway through a discouraging final season on
the Nascar Winston Cup circuit, has a chance to start a race at the
front of the pack, not the back. This was how his ``Victory Tour''
was supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip has not won a race in eight years, and has not finished
better than 22nd in any Winston Cup race this year, but he has
vowed to do the most with this chance to win, because this chance
might be his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like they say, a blind hog should be able to find an acorn
every once in a while, and I thought this old blind hog would be
able to find an acorn or two,'' Waltrip said as he sat on a jack in
his garage this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think we'd be great,'' he said, ``but I didn't think
we'd be as bad as we've been sometimes. But I don't think we'll go
back to the same place and make the same mistakes now.''
</P>
<P>
   By earning a starting place next to Ricky Rudd, the pole-sitter,
Waltrip has given the seventh Brickyard 400 some extra sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield, who was leading the July 23 race at Long Pond,
Pa., until he blew a tire midway through the last lap, slammed the
wall during practice this morning and sustained a concussion that
was serious enough to keep him out of the race. His place is to be
taken by Kyle Petty, who failed to qualify in his own car.
</P>
<P>
   The chase for the Winston Cup championship is on low boil. Dale
Jarrett has climbed over Dale Earnhardt into second place in the
Winston Cup standing and is just 53 points behind the leader, Bobby
Labonte. But Earnhardt, hungry for his eighth Winston Cup
championship, has sounded particularly eager to win this race.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt even found time to tease his nemesis Jeff Gordon, the
one-time wonderboy and two-time Brickyard 400 champion from nearby
Pittsboro, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon turned 29 Friday, and Earnhardt said, ``He's finally
become a man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows I'll get him back some time,'' Gordon said in
response.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, who plans to join the Fox network next year as a racing
commentator, does not have the benefit of time.
</P>
<P>
   That made his 180.923-miles-an-hour qualifying run Thursday
electrifying. Rudd sounded somewhat disappointed that he took the
pole position away 24 minutes later. Waltrip has not sat on the
pole for a race since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that Darrell had one of the best runs he's
had in many, many years,'' Rudd said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The run was encouraging enough for Waltrip's young team. He said
he considers himself to be a teacher for his team, which includes
Larry Carter, a first-year crew chief. The lessons have mostly been
unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip has not qualified for three races this year and is 38th
in the points standing.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said Friday that one of his goals was simply to get
Waltrip through his final season without serious incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to win one for him now,'' Carter said. ``We've just
got to get everything right for him _ the way it should be. I think
we've made a lot of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than worrying about merely making the race in the final
round of qualifying _ as Waltrip has had to do in all but three
races this year _ Carter and Waltrip used a two-hour practice this
morning to get ready for the race. That, Waltrip said, was a
luxury.
</P>
<P>
   But to those who have said he has stuck around too long,
becoming sort of a Willie Mays with horsepower, Waltrip offers a
tart reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to do what I do on Sundays,'' he said. ``And
it'd be very easy for me to say: `OK, I'm not competitive anymore.
I quit.'''
</P>
<P>
   He will be quitting soon enough. He has one more chance to win
one more race, which would be his 85th and would put him ahead of
Bobby Allison alone in third place among Winston Cup drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip said he loves this place, loves its rich history, loves
driving here. He will not guarantee victory, but he said he does
not plan to embarrass himself, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to fall back to last place,'' he said,
smiling.

RUNNING STAG READY AFTER 35,000 MILES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ In search of fun and pots of gold,
three jolly Englishmen have traveled to France, Germany, Dubai and
Hong Kong, as well as Massachusetts, Kentucky and New York. They
fly, of course, but it is a horse that leads them to these locales.
His name is Running Stag, and he has logged more miles than many
heads of state, hitting new soil with ground-burning speed.
</P>
<P>
   He has clocked more than 35,000 miles in the past year alone
and, for the third time in that span, has made the journey from his
base in Epsom in England to the United States, this time to take on
the country's best older horses in the Whitney Handicap on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to his owner, Richard Cohen, and trainer, Philip
Mitchell, their 6-year-old colt gets terribly bored galloping on
the soft grass in his native land. In fact, in 19 races on turf, he
has won only once.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching for a way for Running Stag to find the winner's circle
as a 3-year-old, Mitchell put him in a maiden race on the dirt at
Lingfield, England. He won by seven lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best dirt horse in Europe,'' Mitchell told Cohen,
which was akin to the trainer declaring himself the best cricket
player in New York _ turf racing dominates the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell had a plan. Just as Running Stag took flight on the
dirt, he and his horse were going to take to the air in search of
what he called ``pots of gold,'' or richer races on his preferred
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's reply was simple: Why not? ``I like having fun for
starters and was game to see a bit of the world,'' said Cohen, 64,
who is enjoying his first week of retirement from his international
furniture, carpet and electrical company.
</P>
<P>
   So Mitchell sent Running Stag and an assistant trainer, Roger
Teal, to Belmont Park for the 1998 Woodward Stakes. The invader
finished a surprising third to the marquee horses of that day, Skip
Away and Gentleman. By 1999, Running Stag had become a respected
foe in the older-horse handicap division with a loss by a nose to
Behrens _ one of his rivals on Sunday _ in the Massachusetts
Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   He followed that with victories in the Brooklyn at Belmont and
the Grade II Saratoga Breeders' Cup here. Overall, he has earned
over $1.5 million in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The cost and mechanics of shipping Running Stag back and forth
was a tiny investment, given the far bigger payoff of winning
bigger purses. How do they ship and for how much?
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the first six seats out of first class,'' said a
deadpan Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   For an $8,000 round-trip ticket, Teal walks Running Stag into a
cargo plane, stands and holds him during takeoffs and landings, and
then sits in a chair nearby. ``He drinks and eats and naps just
like any other international passenger,'' Teal said. ``It's really
remarkable how calm he is.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons for running in the United States. The
races in America set up better for Running Stag's front-running
style. In Europe, horses tend to lope during the early part of the
race to preserve themselves for a late dash. And the constant
pounding on dirt can take its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, we have to do too much up front in races,''
Mitchell said. ``But to train over here all the time is too much.
We can gallop him through woods back home, work him on grass.
American racing is hard on a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   In 38 races, Running Stag has demonstrated that he is far from
fragile. On his last trip to the United States, in May, he ran
three races in two weeks _ winning an allowance race at Belmont and
capturing the Grade II Massachusetts Handicap the next week before
tiring in blistering June heat to finish sixth behind the Whitney's
morning-line favorite, Lemon Drop Kid, in the Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Odds-makers have made Running Stag a 6-1 outsider in the
$750,000 Grade I Whitney. Mitchell and Cohen hardly care. They were
sent off at 25-1 last December when Running Stag finished second in
the Hong Kong Cup. It was after that race, as well as a few pints,
that Running Stag's rider, Shane Sellers, urged them to try the
mile-and-one-eighth Whitney. ``He staggered up to me with a big
glass in his hand and said the race set up for us,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   So they're here trying to wring out the last of the big times in
their equine odyssey. Cohen had to miss the last jaunt to the
United States because he was having angioplasty surgery. ``They
told me it was important,'' he said with a wry smile. ``Both of us
are getting old. Running Stag will go to stud soon and I'll sit
back and watch his progeny run. At home, we all have wives and
children who'd like to see us more.''

MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL: ARTISTRY UPSTAGES PERIOD INSTRUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some early music ensembles are rather self-righteous
about using only historically authentic instruments. But the most
gratifying of such ensembles are those that enable you to forget
that period instruments are being used at all, because the playing
is itself so musical and interesting. That's what happened during
Thursday night's concert by the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment at Alice Tully Hall, part of the Mostly Mozart
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1986, this acclaimed early-music orchestra
from Britain has been self-governed by the players. They regularly
engage fine conductors to work with but just as often play by
themselves, as on this occasion when the violinist Catherine
Mackintosh, in the concertmaster's seat, served as the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only long rehearsals and camaraderie can produce the kind
of in-sync coordination, lucid phrasing, rhythmic incisiveness and
expressivity that these players demonstrated, starting with their
buoyant performance of a beguiling rarity, the short Symphony No. 8
by the 18th-century British composer William Boyce.
</P>
<P>
   The countertenor David Daniels, making his Mostly Mozart
Festival debut, was the orchestra's guest, a most appropriate one,
for, like the ensemble's use of period instruments, Daniels'
utterly natural singing enables you to forget that he is a
supposedly rarefied kind of vocal specialist. In four demanding
arias from Handel operas, he was in excellent voice.
</P>
<P>
   On the long high note that begins the first phrase of ``Aure,
deh, per pieta,'' from ``Giulio Cesare,'' he presented a textbook
demonstration of ``messa di voce,'' the vocal technique in which a
sustained tone begins softly, builds in sound and diminishes to the
original soft dynamic. This was no feat of vocal gymnastics, but a
heart-stopping expressive touch, one among many.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Daniels sang ``Venti, turbini'' from ``Rinaldo,'' an aria
in which the brilliant, lickety-split coloratura passages for
singer are often doubled by bassoon.
</P>
<P>
   And Andrew Watts, the orchestra's impressive bassoonist, matched
Daniels note for note, earning a well-deserved ovation of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels concluded with two arias from ``Partenope,'' giving a
dramatically urgent performance of ``Sento amor,'' then a deeply
poignant account of the sublime ``Ch'io parta,'' which was nearly
ruined by a coughing fit in row N.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only an encore would satisfy the cheering audience.
Daniels sang Handel's most familiar aria, ``Ombra mai fu,'' but
with a dignity and simplicity that made it fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baroque England and the Spell of Italian Music'' was the title
of the preconcert lecture and the theme of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Besides presenting a supple performance of Handel's Concerto
Grosso, Op. 6, No. 8, and an engaging account of a suite from
Purcell's music for ``The Virtuous Wife,'' the orchestra played a
little-known Concerto Grosso in D Minor by Pietro Castrucci, a
composer Handel discovered on a trip to Italy in 1715 and promptly
brought back to London with him to serve as the concertmaster of
his opera orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   This year the Mostly Mozart Festival has more guest ensembles
participating than ever. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment
has set a high standard for subsequent artists to meet.

STANDARDS SET FOR BIDDERS TO TAKE OVER SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When executives of Inside Broadway, a nonprofit arts
education program, learned that the New York City Board of
Education planned to turn over some of the city's worst-performing
schools to private hands, they decided to take a chance.
</P>
<P>
   That was until Friday, when school officials mapped out the
requirements for prospective bidders. Applicants must have
experience in running schools with more than 450 students and
budgets of at least $1.5 million, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Broadway worked with 150 schools last year, producing
shows, distributing Broadway tickets to schools and taking actors
into classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those are bad qualifications,'' said Paul Naish,
executive business manager of Inside Broadway. ``But the newspaper
ad didn't specify what experience we needed. I have never run a
school. I've run arts programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Naish was among about 100 vendors from across the city and the
nation _ including Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Boston; and Providence,
R.I. _ who crammed into a hearing room at the Board of Education
headquarters in Brooklyn to learn of the requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But only a handful of vendors _ like Edison Schools, the largest
commercial school-management company in the United States, and its
competitors Victory Schools and Advantage Schools _ had the
experience to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the smaller vendors complained about the requirement
that bidders have experience in running schools with more than 450
students. But Judith A. Rizzo, the deputy chancellor for
instruction, was unapologetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what I'm looking for,'' Rizzo said. ``I want to know
that you can run a school the size of a school in the Chancellor's
District. I want to see if you can do the deal.'' The Chancellor's
District is the special school district that the Board of Education
established for struggling schools.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Schools Chancellor Harold Levy issued a request
for proposals to help the board convert the failing schools into
charter schools in the fall of 2001. The move would release the
schools from many of the state and local regulations that now
govern them. If the schools' conversions to charter status are
approved by the state Board of Regents, the schools' new managers
will be able to renegotiate some union contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not specify how many or which schools would be
turned over to private management. But officials said it was likely
to focus on about seven schools and could include as many as 20 in
its first year, depending on the number and quality of
applications.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 schools qualify for the program _ about 40 of which are
elementary and middle schools and the rest high schools. They are
on the state's list of ``schools under registration review''
because of their poor performance and are in the Chancellor's
District.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The requirements also call, among other things, for applicants
to do a significant amount of community outreach, and for parents
of 51 percent of the students in a school to vote for a charter
conversion, in a process that would take months.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education would pay the management company on a
per-student basis to operate a school. State law requires an
allocation of only about $6,630 a student, not including money for
federal benefits and other special programs.
</P>
<P>
   While Advantage Schools expressed concerns about the condition
of the buildings, it planned to bid to operate some of the schools.
It operates schools in Philadelphia, Washington, Phoenix, and
Newark, N.J.

RICHARD HILL, CHILD PSYCHIATRIST, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: No byline)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Richard K. Hill, a child psychiatrist at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, died Thursday in New York. He was
64 and lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a bone marrow disease, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   He was affiliated with the medical center until 1995. That year
he also retired as a psychiatric consultant to the New York family
court system in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who was born in Salt Lake City, graduated from the
University of Utah in 1957 and received his medical degree at
Northwestern University in 1961. He completed his training at Mount
Sinai Medical Center and practiced adult and child psychiatry in
Manhattan from 1968 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Ann; two daughters, Dr. Kirsten
Avery of Raleigh, N.C., and Amy Hill of Brooklyn; two sons,
Christopher and Thomas, also of Brooklyn; and a brother, Robert, of
Waynesville, N.C.

HELEN QUINN, 76, THE QUEEN OF STANDEES AT THE MET OPERA, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Helen Quinn, who for more than 30 years presided
firmly over the Metropolitan Opera patrons who lined up every
Saturday morning to buy standing-room tickets for the next week's
performances, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was
76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was food poisoning, said Josephine Rowe, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Often called the Queen of Standees by the hundreds of people who
compliantly allowed her to take charge of the ticket queue, Quinn
was herself a veteran of standing-room lines at the Met. In 1943,
having just finished high school in Manhattan, she attended a
performance of Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' at the Met and was
instantly hooked on opera. Soon she was attending five or six
performances a week, almost always as a standee.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, on her own initiative, she more or less imposed a
system on the standee process that the throng of regulars was
apparently happy to abide by. Standing-room tickets for the week go
on sale at 10 a.m. on Saturday. Under Quinn's system, as opera
buffs arrived, many as early as 4 a.m. or 5 a.m., they wrote their
names on a numbered list on her clipboard, then went home or to a
coffee shop across the street, leaving Quinn to wait in their
place.
</P>
<P>
   Around 9 a.m., the expectant standing-room ticket buyers would
return, and Quinn began barking commands with a vocal power that
many a hefty dramatic soprano would covet. Happy that someone was
in charge, the opera buffs complied. Quinn tolerated no dissent,
even from the Luciano Pavarotti fans, who tended, she said in a
1994 interview in The New York Times, to be the most pushy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pavarotti people can be a little ferocious,'' she said.
``If I had to live with a group of people the rest of my life, I
would pick the Wagnerites. They're the most patient. Domingo people
are a close second. The Pavarotti people are at the bottom of the
list. I don't mix with them personally. They're loud in their
deportment, they talk among themselves and they want extra places
for their friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting ahead in the line was absolutely verboten, as Wotan
would put it: ``When I see someone crashing the line,'' Quinn was
quoted as saying, ``I pounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Her tactic was to expose the intruder to the orderly faithful.
``Believe me, it works,'' she said. ``It's the most humiliating
experience for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who was born in New Jersey on April 15, 1924, was rather
circumspect about her private life. At 14 her family moved to New
York City. After graduating from high school, she took her first
job as a key-punch operator for Columbia Pictures. In the early
1960s, when she heard that a new Metropolitan Opera House would be
built, she moved to an apartment on West 57th Street to be close.
She lived there until her death.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a sister, Jean Magrow of Oceanside, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   After Quinn had for some time been running the standing-room
line, a procedure to which the Met gave tacit approval, some
regular standees urged her to begin collecting tips for her
efforts. She decided to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that running the line was my contribution to the
Met,'' she said. ``But people kept saying to me: `Helen, wise up.
You're performing a public service.'' ' Most patrons offered her a
dollar as they turned in their slips, but those who did not
received the same consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, who has been Quinn's partner in running the standing-room
line since 1995, said she planned to continue the work alone.

A WAVE OF ILLICIT DRUGS ROLLS IN, AND A SLICE OF SUBURBIA REELS 
</HEADLINE>
   by ANDREW JACOBS   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRICK, N.J. _ The sign, in front of the local high school here,
is an unavoidable warning to anyone driving through this sprawling
township on the Jersey Shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deal Drugs in Our Communities and Go to Jail!'' it shouts in
6-foot-tall letters.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Brick Memorial High School, Kenneth S. Gregorio
probably often saw the sign, erected by the local prosecutor, as he
drove to his mother's home or to the gym where he regularly worked
out. Gregorio, 23, a Monmouth University junior on probation for
two drug arrests, knew the warning was not an idle threat.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Saturday, July 29, shortly after he and his best
friend, Brian J. Juliano, were arrested and charged with the
possession and intended sale of 49,000 tablets of Ecstasy, Gregorio
removed the drawstring from his sweat pants and hung himself in a
cell in the Neptune police station.
</P>
<P>
   Juliano, 23, who, under a newly toughened state law, faces a
possible 20-year prison sentence for the intended distribution of
Ecstasy, was released Thursday on $240,000 bail. His lawyer, Ray
Scotto, said he was so traumatized by his arrest and the death of
his friend that he checked into a hospital after his release. ``I
don't think he knows what hit him,'' Scotto said.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for law enforcement officials in this
fast-growing swath of New Jersey, which once thought itself far
removed from urban trends _ like the dance-club culture that favors
techno music and an amphetamine commonly referred to as E.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become a real hotbed for Ecstasy use,'' said Terrence
Farley, director of the Ocean County Narcotics Strike Force. ``It's
so pervasive, you can get it anywhere kids gather. I'd say it's the
worst drug problem to hit here since the cocaine epidemic'' of the
1980s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who monitor illegal drugs on the Jersey Shore say Ecstasy,
which has been well entrenched in New York City for years, truly
arrived here only last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 2
million tablets are smuggled into the United States each week,
largely from Northern Europe, and that 750,000 of those are sold
and consumed in the corridor that extends from New York to bustling
seaside resort towns like Belmar and Seaside Heights. It is an
alluringly profitable drug, costing less than 50 cents per pill to
synthesize and selling for about $20.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's haul, with a street value of $1.5 million, was
the largest Ecstasy seizure ever made by a municipal police force,
the authorities said. They said they believe most of the tablets
were headed for the local clubs that flourish in the summer months,
some attracting revelers as young as 13 to alcohol-free ``teen
nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff is being gobbled up like candy,'' Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities have said that Gregorio's suicide
might have been an effort to avoid facing a potentially long prison
term. Until last month, when Gov. Christie Whitman signed a law
making Ecstasy possession and distribution a first-degree crime,
tantamount to holding or selling heroin or cocaine, those caught
with large amounts of Ecstasy often served little or no jail time.
Until 1986, the drug was not even illegal in most states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knew he was going away for a long time,'' said Sgt.
James Riccio, commander of the Brick Police Department's drug
enforcement unit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to determine whether the two men
operated their business alone or with others, but they said the two
most likely distributed the pills to local dealers. Federal drug
agents who analyzed the seized cache said they believe that it
originated in the Netherlands or in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Described by friends as easygoing, gregarious and well known for
a shared devotion to fitness, Kenneth Gregorio and Brian Juliano
did not have reputations as vicious drug traffickers, although
Gregorio had been convicted on drug-related charges before. ``Ken
was more than a dime-bag dealer, but he wasn't a big-time dealer,''
said Sgt. James Riccio of the Brick Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Classmates at Monmouth University, the two had transferred
together from Ocean County Community College and spent much of
their free time together. ``They seemed to be the best of
friends,'' said Bob Chuva, the manager of Work Out World in Tinton
Falls, where both men exercised as often as six days a week. ``They
rarely came in without the other.''
</P>
<P>
   After working out, the two men would often stop by Extreme
Blendz, a juice bar, to chat and eat. Kevin Smith, who often served
the men their protein shakes and chicken parmesan wraps, described
them as seriously devoted to fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't partiers,'' he said. ``They were working out so
hard and so into being healthy _ that's why I can't believe Kenny
would do that to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to prosecutors, Gregorio, voted ``most
unpredictable'' by his high school class, had a self-destructive
side. In 1996, a year after graduating from high school, he was
arrested and charged assaulting a Neptune police officer and
resisting arrest. In July 1998, the police in Brick caught him with
steroids, a pound of marijuana and scales. Less than a year later,
he was arrested again, this time with Ecstasy and $8,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Sakowicz, a spokesman for the Ocean County prosecutor, said
Gregorio served 45 days in jail on the drug charges, all of it on
weekends so the punishment would not interfere with his studies as
a communications major. From time to time, he also worked as a
construction worker and as an exotic dancer, according to family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Novak, a Lakewood lawyer who represented Gregorio on the
drug charges, described him as a studious, well-mannered gentleman.
``He would bring his homework to court and do it in the hallway,''
he said. ``He was very ambitious, the kind of guy who might make it
to the Fortune 500 if given a few breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Juliano, who grew up in nearby Howell, is a criminal justice
major and did a brief internship with the West Long Branch Police
Department. Last summer, a Neptune police officer stopped him for
making an illegal U-turn and found $30,000 in his car. Novak, who
also represented Juliano in that case, said the money was proceeds
from the sale of a used car. The authorities failed to obtain an
indictment, and returned the money to Juliano.
</P>
<P>
   A tip led the authorities last week to a Neptune self-storage
center, where they found a duffel bag stuffed with 30 pounds of
Ecstasy. Juliano was arrested Saturday night after he came to the
storage unit and tried to open the locker. Gregorio was arrested a
short time later at his apartment in Asbury Park.

   The next day, detectives escorted a handcuffed Juliano to his
Tinton Falls town house where, in a combination safe, they found
$131,700 in cash, a loaded 9-mm gun and hollow-point bullets. A
neighbor who saw Juliano arrive on Sunday said he looked as if he
had been crying.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who asked that her name not be used, said his was the
only house on the block with an alarm system. ``People would come
and go frequently,'' she said. ``Some would stay for a while and
others would be gone in minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, about 80 people came to Gregorio's funeral at St.
Martha's Church in Point Pleasant. In his eulogy, the Rev. Michael
Manning told the story of the prodigal son, reminding the mourners
that even sinners are loved by God. As he spoke, Gregorio's
girlfriend clutched his photograph and sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set later that day, groups of teen-agers strolled
along the boardwalk in Seaside Heights and talked about their
clubbing plans for the night. Most everyone had heard of the big
Ecstasy raid, although few said it would change their attitude
toward the drug or their ability to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Hunka Bunka, a club in Sayreville that was holding an
event for clubgoers ages 13 to 18, hundreds of teen-agers in Lycra
and brightly dyed hair waited for their turn to be patted down by
the bouncers. Since a recent string of Ecstasy arrests at the club,
security has become unforgiving. Baggy jeans are banned and every
pack of cigarettes is thoroughly searched.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many said they had no trouble buying Ecstasy outside and
inside the club. Ben Coran, 18, of South Amboy, said he sold the
tiny tablets from time to time. ``Like anything in life, if you
want it, it can be done,'' he said. ``Deals on the inside are the
best, but how the stuff gets in there is a trade secret.''

EDITORIAL   OBSERVER:THE REPUBLICANS CALL A CEASE-FIRE ON CITIES
</HEADLINE>
  By BRENT STAPLES  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican Party signaled a shift in attitude toward cities
when it chose Philadelphia for this week's national convention. The
party in recent years has used big urban centers as metaphors of
moral decay and examples of faulty Democratic stewardship. But the
choice of Philadelphia revealed the GOP's intent to abandon an
anti-urban rhetoric that had proved alienating to moderate suburban
voters.
</P>
<P>
   It also reflects a growing awareness among Republicans like Gov.
Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey
that urban centers are crucial to state economies and must be
recovered, even if the up-front costs are great. In attempting to
rebuild crucial city centers, Ridge and Whitman have both moved
beyond the traditional Republican gospel that views local control
as sacred and intervention from above as political heresy.
</P>
<P>
   The need for strong, state-level intervention has become
especially apparent to Ridge, who has been faced with some of the
most stubborn redevelopment problems in the country _ not just in
Philadelphia, which is rebounding after 40 years of decline, but
also in the neighboring city of Chester, Pa., an industrial
powerhouse in the 1950s and 60s that has gone largely untouched by
the recovery and was until recently in danger of becoming a ghost
town. I grew up in Chester during the boom years and went back to
visit during this week's convention. The city has begun to inch
forward, with new roads, housing and infrastructure, but only after
heavy, heavy lifting by the state government in Harrisburg.
</P>
<P>
   Chester was the site of William Penn's first landing in the new
colony of Pennsylvania in 1682, and became a successful mill town
soon afterward. It boomed in the 1940s, when the war-stoked economy
spawned steel mills, shipyards, textile mills and a range of heavy
industries that made Chester a magnet for the great migration of
black people moving into the industrial North from the rural South.
Chester's Sun Shipyard employed 40,000 people from around the
region, in a city whose population totaled a mere 66,000. But the
yard lost roughly 10,000 jobs per decade and then closed in the
1980s, with catastrophic effect on Chester and its surrounding
municipalities. Skilled laborers fled as quickly as they could,
leaving behind the poor, who turned in great numbers to the drug
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The decay was worsened by a corrupt and long-lived Republican
machine that brought graft and administrative ineptitude to new
lows. The machine's founder was the legendary Republican boss John
J. McClure, a natty dresser in a vest and high buttoned shoes whose
power in Chester and surrounding Delaware County rivaled Boss
Richard Daley's in Chicago. McClure was a Republican kingmaker who
helped to choose Pennsylvania governors and to whom even Richard
Nixon paid homage as an aspiring president. McClure ruled, through
patronage and punishment, from 1930 to his death in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   His successor was Jack Nacrelli, a tough machine politician who
ruled Chester as mayor from 1968 to 1979, when he was convicted of
racketeering. He returned from jail to dominate the city into the
1980s. According to the 1991 report from the Pennsylvania State
Crime Commission, which investigated organized crime throughout the
state, Nacrelli exercised his most intensive patronage efforts
through the school board, which quickly deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican machine was impervious to state intervention into
the 1990s. But faced with enormous decay, mounting crime and a
corrupt school system that has consistently ranked at or near the
bottom in the state, Ridge has led state intervention on several
fronts. Once Chester was declared in distress, the state took over
its fiscal affairs, including economic development, and has
overseen everything from rebuilding city sewer systems to housing
redevelopment to building new roads to actually buying a building
for the Police Department and replacing its rundown cars.
</P>
<P>
   Public housing projects have been torn down and replaced with
the first new housing built in the city in decades. Chester has
seen the first glimmers of post-industrial business, with one new
high-tech park just opened and others on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   The hollowed-out school system poses the steepest challenge of
all. At the governor's instigation, the legislature has passed a
radical new plan that allows the state to dissolve the school
system if it wishes, replacing it with a charter system or any
other system of its choosing. Results from the new legislation have
yet to be seen. But the system is coming under close fiscal
scrutiny for the first time in at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The giant cranes over the long-dead shipyard still stand rusting
and unmanned, a testament to prosperity gone by. But redevelopment
plans are under way for the first time in memory and there are
other encouraging signs of revival _ police cars that actually run,
sewers that drain the streets, and street signs in vast stretches
of the city that had none. The irony of the moment is that the
rebuilding effort in this city and others has fallen to
Republicans, who have historically shunned this kind of
intervention, leaving fallen cities like Chester to the mercy of
the market.

   Two Truby homers help Astros top Expos
</P>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took the Expos' best shot _ literally _ and delivered
a couple of their own Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Truby hit a pair of home runs, and the Astros offset the
loss of righthander Chris Holt with a 7-6 come-from-behind victory
before a crowd of 38,502 at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   Daryle Ward added a three-run homer as the Astros rallied from
4-0 and 6-5 deficits.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros ended a two-game losing streak with only their sixth
win in 27 one-run games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman broke a 6-all deadlock with a single to left field
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have as many guys out as we do, you have to depend on
some young men coming of age,'' said manager Larry Dierker of the
injury-ravaged Astros, who have seven players on the disabled list.
``Berkman has been doing it all year long, Ward was doing it early
and has been hitting well lately, and Truby kind of came out of
nowhere (Friday).''
</P>
<P>
   Despite four home runs in the game _ three by the Astros, who
set a club record for round-trippers at home in a season _ the
biggest blow came during the fourth inning when Holt took a line
drive off the left side of his face. X-rays were negative, and Holt
was diagnosed with a bruised left cheekbone.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won their season-high third straight game at home and
are 6-3 at Enron Field since July 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos started early Friday, sending nine batters to the
plate against Holt during a three-run first inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee Stevens' two-run single up the middle, a walk to Geoff
Blum and a single by Chris Widger loaded the bases. Tomas de la
Rosa hit a broken-bat grounder past the mound, and Astros rookie
shortstop Julio Lugo attempted to make a barehanded grab but
couldn't complete the play in time.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Vladimir Guerrero led off with a triple to the
center-field gap and scored when Lugo's relay throw sailed into the
Montreal dugout, extending the Expos' lead to 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The lead didn't last long as the Astros erupted for five runs in
their half of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Eusebio singled to lead off the inning, and Truby followed
with a two-run homer off Javier Vazquez. Two batters later, Bill
Spiers singled to left field, and Berkman later singled to center.
Ward, who started at first base, then hit a three-run homer off the
right-field foul pole to give the Astros a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always clutch to see the other guys getting the big
hits,'' said Ward, who hit an eye-level pitch for his 15th home run
of the season. ``It kind of filters down through the whole lineup
and makes you say, `I've got to step it up, too.' To see the rest
of the team hitting, you don't want to be the only one not doing
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Silence fell upon Enron Field with two outs in the fourth when
Peter Bergeron sent a 1-0 pitch back toward the mound and off the
left side of Holt's face. The 28-year-old pitcher lay face down on
the ground for a few minutes, blood visible, before walking off the
field on his own power.
</P>
<P>
   Holt allowed five runs and seven hits in 3 innings. Wayne
Franklin replaced him, allowing one run and four hits in 2 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos tied the game at 5 when Wilton Guerrero hit a two-out
single off Franklin in the fourth. Geoff Blum put the Expos ahead
6-5 with a home run to left field in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Houston rallied to tie the game in the sixth when Truby hit his
second homer of the game. The Astros have hit 83 home runs at home,
breaking the old mark of 82 set in 1998 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday, Truby had gone 81 at-bats since his first _ and
only _ homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been kind of scuffling a little bit. I feel like I
haven't been doing anything the last few weeks,'' Truby said.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took the lead for good in the seventh. Lugo tripled
on a fly ball to right field that Vladimir Guerrero misplayed at
the wall, and Berkman singled to left off reliever Steve Kline
(1-4).
</P>
<P>
   Montreal had runners at first and third with two outs in the
eighth before closer Octavio Dotel got out of the jam with a
strikeout of Vladimir Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's providing us with something important, nailing down wins
(in the late innings),'' Dierker said of Dotel. ``He was frustrated
as a starter when he would come out after six innings, and
sometimes we were ahead and sometimes we weren't. He wasn't getting
a lot of wins. Knowing how competitive he is, you can see how he
cherishes being in (there in) the ninth inning under pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel pitched the final 1 innings for his fifth save and hasn't
allowed a run in 12 relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian-born Astros reliever Jason Green (1-0) picked up his
first major-league win. He held the Expos to two hits over 1
innings.

THOMAS R. OTTENSTEIN, 70; BUILT BELITTLED TOWER AT GETTYSBURG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Fla.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas R. Ottenstein, the developer whose observation tower
overlooking Gettysburg's historic fields drew tourists and wrath
until it was felled by government fiat last month, died Aug. 3 at
his home in Washington. He was 70 and also had a home in Delray
Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   The 307-foot galvanized steel tower with four observation decks
opened in 1974 on private land on the fringe of the 6,000-acre
Gettysburg National Military Park. It spawned what often seemed
like unending legal battles and controversy ever since Ottenstein
first conceived it 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lucrative attraction, as tourists rode its elevator for
a panoramic overview of the grounds where 53,000 Americans were
killed within three days in July 1863. Visitors enjoyed visual
displays and a recorded dramatization with bugle calls, gunfire and
cavalry charges in an air-conditioned ``classroom in the sky,'' as
Ottenstein called it.
</P>
<P>
   To others, especially historians, battlefield preservationists
and some neighbors, it was a sacrilegious eyesore defiling a site
consecrated by history, an insult to the tragedy of Pickett's
Charge. More mundanely, some derided it as an Eiffel Tower with a
pumpkin head.
</P>
<P>
   Parties to the fray included the State of Pennsylvania, which
opposed it; Adams County, which at the time had no zoning code and
wanted compensation for the real estate taxes that the park did not
pay, and federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ottenstein could note that the National Park Service had already
allowed the park to be girdled by a honky-tonk strip of motels,
drive-ins, fried-food restaurants and assorted tourist traps.
Adding to his problems was a court fight over property rights.
</P>
<P>
   Pickett's Charge, which probably changed the course of the Civil
War, left 10,000 Confederate soldiers dead or wounded in a futile
assault on a line of 6,000 Union troops. But the tower also was
very close to where Abraham Lincoln in November 1863 dedicated a
national cemetery on the site with one of history's most famous
addresses: ``Four score and seven years ago. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Among the earliest foes of the tower project were the surviving
veterans of the Army tank corps from Camp Colt, in the shadow of
the tower. There, a young captain named Dwight D. Eisenhower
commanded 10,000 World War I tank corpsmen in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   A change in the law placed the tower inside the park in 1990.
The Park Service said its demolition with an explosive charge last
month was part of an effort to rid the battlefield of commercialism
and restore what Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called ``sacred
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Litigation remains pending over how much compensation the
government owes for that eminent-domain action.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ray Ottenstein was born in Washington and graduated from
Syracuse University and Georgetown University's law school. He
served in the Army from 1954 to 1956 and went into the family's
newspaper distribution business before becoming a well-to-do real
estate developer.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Nina Judis Ottenstein;
two daughters, Marla Ottenstein and Doria Reese, and two sons,
Grant and Todd, all of Washington; a brother, Victor, of Solana
Beach, Calif.; and six grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: CHALLENGING MR. MILOSEVIC
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 5: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic is running for another term as Yugoslavia's
president in an unfair election that he will most likely win by any
means necessary. Nevertheless, the opposition should run against
him. No one believes that Milosevic will leave office simply
because voters tell him to. But if the opposition can unite on a
single presidential candidate for the elections in late September,
it can at least revitalize its popular support and shake some of
the apathy that is paralyzing Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition will certainly run candidates in local elections.
Anti-Milosevic candidates won in more than 30 municipalities in
1996, although protesters had to occupy the streets for months in
order to get Milosevic to recognize the victories. These local
officials give the opposition control of some funds and broadcast
media, in addition to political stature and a base for organizing.
The posts are crucial to keep. The opposition should also run
candidates in the federal Parliament to reduce Milosevic's
near-total control.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has taken no chances with his own re-election.
Recently he has shut down many of the remaining independent media
in Serbia, and has been intimidating opposition politicians and
independent activists through violence and abuse of the courts. His
ubiquitous propaganda allows him to remain the most popular
politician in Serbia. But he is helped by a petty and ineffectual
opposition. Polls, however, show that if the opposition united
around a single candidate, that person could win. Even if there is
little chance the winner would be allowed to take office, this
would energize the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend there is a convention of the Serbian Renewal
Movement, whose leader, Vuk Draskovic, is the main obstacle to a
united opposition. Draskovic has in the past cut deals with
Milosevic and sabotaged opposition unity, acts that should
disqualify him as a candidate this time.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has said that his party will not participate in the
elections if Milo Djukanovic, the president of Serbia's tiny sister
republic of Montenegro, stays out as well. But Djukanovic, who has
led his republic in a mutiny against the Yugoslav president, has a
better reason for boycotting. He is already under the constant
threat of attack from the Yugoslav army stationed in Montenegro _
an attack that Washington fears may come soon. The presidential
election will be staged with new rules that are part of a recent
constitutional coup by Milosevic, which greatly reduced
Montenegro's influence in the presidential election and over all.
</P>
<P>
   If the opposition does contest the election and Milosevic wins,
countries such as Russia, Greece and Italy should not use his
``victory'' as a pretext to improve their relations with Serbia.
They well know he keeps power through repression. Nor should
Milosevic look forward to a change in American policy if Gov.
George W. Bush becomes president. The Republican platform says
there should be no negotiations with indicted war criminals such as
Milosevic, and that Washington should seek their arrest, trial and
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Contesting Milosevic for the presidency requires opposition
unity. Democratic opposition parties were able to beat Vladimir
Meciar in Slovakia and Franjo Tudjman's party in Croatia only when
they overcame their internal squabbles. Milosevic is more
malignant, but that only makes unity even more necessary. &QL;

   ARAFAT-ARABS (Cairo, Egypt) _ On the face of it, Arab support
for the Palestinian position has never been so seamless. Or so it
would seem as the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has
crisscrossed the Middle East to garner support from his
counterparts and build a defensive line for his position on a peace
deal with Israel. One after the other, Arab kings and presidents
have said they stand behind Arafat, no questions asked, as he holds
out for Palestinian sovereignty over Arab East Jerusalem and the
right of return for Palestinian refugees. But behind the
uncompromising public statements, more pragmatic approaches are
also being discussed seriously for the first time on those

   NY-SINATRA-STATUE (New York) _ The Rev. Francis Patrick Duffy
got a spot on Times Square in 1936 for his heroics on the
battlefield and the streets of Hell's Kitchen. George M. Cohan
followed in 1959 as a tribute to one of show business' greatest
song and dance men. Mayor Rudy Giuliani says there is room for one
more, Frank Sinatra, whose last big hit, in 1980, was ``New York,
New York.'' But the hushed refrain playing around Times Square is
not so gushing or welcoming. No one really wants to say so, at
least not loudly enough to irk Giuliani or offend the Sinatra
family, but the plan to erect a statue of Ol' Blue Eyes on a
traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway has acquired some
powerful enemies. The local community board, along with some Times
Square developers, isn't crazy about the idea. And theater moguls
say the square's theatrical tradition would be shortchanged by
showcasing a singer and film actor who started in Hoboken, made a
quick splash at the Paramount Theater and then followed fame and

   IRONY-RECONSIDERED (Undated) _ So is irony a bad thing or a good

   REAL-LIFE-TV (Undated) _ Watching ``real life'' moments from the
television shows, ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother,'' I felt an
all-too-familiar twinge. Plato described it as the contradictory

<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ The Lakers might have at last found a taker
for their $2.25 million salary-cap exception, but it won't fill
their greatest need _ help in the frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers continue their search for a rebounding big man,
they are closing in on a deal to bring New Jersey Nets swingman
Kendall Gill to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Gill has balked at a $4.4 million offer to re-sign with New
Jersey and is considering less lucrative deals, several New York
newspapers reported. On Friday, an NBA source told the Daily News
that Gill is indeed close to signing with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A time comes when you'll take less elsewhere if you have to.
That time has arrived,'' Gill told the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the 6-foot-5 Gill, a natural shooting guard who
played small forward for the Nets, would seem to give the Lakers a
glut of guards. They return starters Kobe Bryant and Ron Harper and
reserve Derek Fisher and still hope to re-sign Brian Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   But Gill's presence would give the Lakers some flexibility. If
Glen Rice leaves, as expected _ either as a free agent or in a
sign-and-trade deal _ Gill could replace him; or Gill could start
at guard, with the 6-7 Bryant moving to small forward.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's presence also would allow the Lakers to reduce the aging
Harper's minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year veteran, Gill played the last four-plus seasons with
the Nets, following stints with Seattle and Charlotte. He averaged
13.1 points, 3.7 rebounds and 2.8 assists last season and
registered 1.83 steals per game _ ninth in the NBA. He was the NBA
steals leader in 1998-99, with 2.68 per game. &QL;

DODGERS HOPE GOODWIN FOLLOWS IN LOPES' SPEEDY FOOTSTEPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We would claim poetic license and say the Dodger
Stadium basepaths once torn up by Davey Lopes lie abandoned and
overgrown with weeds, but that would be unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Unfair to the grounds crew, which works hard to keep that
historic dirt looking sharp. Oh, and mildly unfair to a generation
of Dodgers players.
</P>
<P>
   Young men have continued to run and play on those basepaths in
the two decades since Lopes packed up his churning spikes and moved
on to become a coach _ and now the manager of the Milwaukee
Brewers. A few of those young men could even steal a base.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, the L.A. franchise that employed the
National League's leading basestealers eight times in the 1960s
(Maury Wills) and 1970s (Lopes) has abandoned the art of the theft,
not unlike the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an afterthought,'' Lopes said Friday upon his return to
Dodger Stadium with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin aims to return that lost art to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, the former Dodgers prospect reacquired Monday in the
trade of Todd Hollandsworth to the Colorado Rockies, is the long
overdue heir to Lopes' base-stealing crown.
</P>
<P>
   His story is a study in what has become of the running game in
the era where, as Goodwin says, ``Guys don't come up saying, `I
want to steal 100 bases,' they come up saying, `I want to hit 100
home runs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, from an academic family, got an inkling he was fast
afoot in high school at Fresno Central, where he split time between
baseball and track. But he wasn't the fastest kid in the
schoolyard. He says he didn't realize how fast he was until college
at Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   One day a Bulldogs flanker, Andre Alexander, challenged the
baseball player to a race. A third man put up the prize money.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden we were lining up in the parking lot and
everybody was gathering around,'' Goodwin remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin won the race. Alexander went on to play two seasons in
the Canadian Football League and one in the World League.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin went on to sign with the Dodgers in 1989. You'd think
baseball would take a guy with his speed and immerse him in the
finer points of basestealing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, it wasn't until after he was waived by the
Dodgers and went to the Kansas City Royals in 1994 that he got some
meaningful lessons. And the lessons came not from a coach but from
a teammate, Vince Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman taught him how to take a lead and get a jump. He taught
him to use videotape to study the pickoff move of the next day's
pitcher. The following year, Goodwin stole a career-high 66 bases
in 88 attempts for the Royals, and over the past five years he has
been the major leagues' steals leader with 243.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to imitate Lopes' fast feats depends now on his
batting (only .208 outside hitter-friendly Coors Field at the time
the Rockies traded him) and his continuing education in the ways of
National League pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Goodwin played six professional seasons before
he was tutored in basestealing didn't surprise Lopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very few people that have the knowledge to teach a
player of that magnitude the art and science of basestealing,''
Lopes said before the Brewers and Dodgers opened a three-game
series Friday. ``Coaching the basestealers is usually handled by
the outfield coach, and he may not know that much about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest thing to a basestealing instructor on the Dodgers'
big-league staff is first-base coach John Shelby, who never stole
more than 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become less and less (a part of offenses) because teams
go for the long ball,'' Lopes said of the years since he led the
league with 77 in 1975 and 63 in 1976. ``The economics of the game
dictate that guys who are bigger and stronger get the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers are more content to anchor their baserunners and plan
on the three-run homer. And pitchers have gotten tougher on
basestealers, speeding up their deliveries with slide steps.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, 6-foot-1 and 175 pounds, realized early on that speed
would be his meal ticket. The Dodgers realized just before the
trading deadline that speed was something they missed.
</P>
<P>
   The new leadoff hitter and center fielder vows to do right by
those old basepaths, to be the kind of runner who Lopes says will
steal ``when even the least knowledgeable fan in the park knows
you're going to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't trip over the weeds, Tom. &QL;

WE LOST A TRUE HERO AND A BEAUTIFUL PERSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We lost a true hero and a beautiful person &QL; 
One of my heroes left us this week, and our world is a lesser place
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   You never saw her name in a box score. She never hit a home run
or scored a touchdown. She never won an Olympic medal or led her
team to a title.
</P>
<P>
   She never served an ace at Wimbledon or ripped off her shirt and
showed us her sports bra at the dramatic close of an international
soccer match. She didn't have Anna Kournikova's sexy ponytail _ at
least not when I knew her _ or dated famous NHL stars or appeared
on ESPN's ``Up Close.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she didn't have any hair at all.
</P>
<P>
   But she was one of the most beautiful people I've ever met.
</P>
<P>
   In her 12 short years, Kelly Davidson proved to those who knew
her that she was a champion at the most important game of all _
life.
</P>
<P>
   Her funeral was held yesterday in Austin after she succumbed to
a battle with cancer that lasted almost half of her young life.
</P>
<P>
   My Webster's defines ``succumbs'' as to ``yield to superior
strength or force ... to be brought to an end by the effect of
destructive or disruptive forces.'' That's the best way I can think
of to put it, because Kelly never surrendered, never gave up, never
quit fighting to simply live her life like any other child.
</P>
<P>
   You probably didn't know Kelly, not personally anyway, but you
likely saw her and didn't realize who she was. She was ``adopted''
by two-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong a couple of years
ago and has appeared on some of his TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Her sweet smile as she bicycled with Armstrong lit up the TV
screen.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kelly that Armstrong singled out for a special greeting
at the end of his victory in one of the stages of last year's Tour
de France. And when he made an appearance on ``Good Morning
America'' after the race, they'd arranged a special hookup with
Kelly at Cook Children's Medical Center. Armstrong, a cancer
survivor himself, saw to it that Kelly was presented with a new
bike.
</P>
<P>
   Lance and his wife, Kristin, visited Kelly to say goodbye a few
days before she died Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lance and Kelly met in a McDonald's in Austin 3 1/2 years ago,
naturally drawn to each other because they were the only two bald
people in the place. They laughed. They joked. They exchanged phone
numbers. A few days later, Kelly's mother, Jamie, was shocked when
she picked up the phone and Armstrong was on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to talk to that little girl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We were lucky that they allowed us an occasional peek into what
obviously became a close and beautiful friendship. It was a
mutually beneficial relationship. Kelly would personally help raise
more than $20,000 for the Lance Armstrong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and I crossed paths a couple of weeks before Christmas
last December at the Fort Worth Ronald McDonald House, her home
away from home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Rusty Greer was there to dedicate the House's
Serenity Garden, and Kelly was one of three very sick children who
were on hand to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had an attitude that she was going to get the most out of
life, even if she was sick, and that was refreshing,'' Greer said
yesterday from Toronto, ``because it makes you realize how much
more there is to life than nine innings of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   She was pale, her cheeks were hollow and her eyes were sunken.
Pain and fatigue had beaten her down. None of that could keep her
inner strength and something else _ a sense of peace is the best
way I can think to describe it _ from shining through.
</P>
<P>
   The brightly colored lights on the Christmas tree only
emphasized the waxy whiteness of Kelly's skin and smooth, hairless
scalp, but when she smiled, it was like someone had suddenly turned
klieg lights on in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' she confided at one point, ``but I'm always
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, she broke my heart.
</P>
<P>
   She captured it, too, for I have thought of her often since that
day. I would get occasional e-mail updates on Kelly from the nice
folks at the Ronald McDonald House, or see her TV commercials
again.
</P>
<P>
   We had talked about our dogs _ she had a new puppy named Andre _
and about her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In her dreams she wasn't sick anymore. She could run like the
wind and never get tired. She could keep up with Lance on her bike.
In a few years she would turn 16 and get a new car for her
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A red Mustang convertible,'' she said, flashing that smile
again.
</P>
<P>
   It would have happened, too. You just know it would have,
somehow.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other, more important, plans afoot. Kelly won't be
here for another birthday, or another Christmas, or another Tour de
France and I won't kid you, that's hard for me to understand.
</P>
<P>
   She'd probably explain it all to me, if she could. She had that
way about her, an understanding of the way things worked, that
something special that's so easy to see, yet so hard to describe.
She just touched people's lives just by being herself.
</P>
<P>
   I count myself lucky that mine was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Now I find myself in need of a long walk. I want to feel a soft
breeze on my face while I think of a beautiful 16-year-old girl,
racing down the road in a red convertible, her long hair streaming
in the wind, a smile as big as Texas on her face.
</P>
<P>
   Fly fast, Kelly. Fly just as fast as you can. nn

EMMITT SMITH SHOWS THE JAPANESE THAT ABILITY MAKES YOU TALL IN
FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Emmitt Smith had to travel 6,420 miles to feel tall.
</P>
<P>
   It's a feeling the Cowboys' Pro Bowl running back doesn't get a
chance to experience often in the NFL, where the word ``big'' is
only used to describe his feats running the football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese look at me and think I'm big,'' said Smith, whose
5-foot-9, 209-pound frame is considered ``small'' in the NFL.
``Then when they see some of the other players on these teams, they
look like giants to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who missed the Cowboys' preseason opener against
Pittsburgh with a sprained big toe, is likely to be held out of
tonight's American Bowl game against the Atlanta Falcons because of
the week-old injury. He remains a game-time decision for the 9 p.m.
CDT kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   The toe injury is not considered serious. Smith has been able to
run plays in practice since arriving here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was here in April \Rpromoting this game for the NFL\S,
I found that in some way the Japanese people are kind of surprised
that a guy of my stature can go out and do what I do,'' said Smith,
who is the NFL's leading active rusher (13,963) and third all-time
in league history behind Walter Payton (16,726) and Barry Sanders
(15,629).
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably gives them a little bit of hope that if he can do
it, maybe I can do it, too. Hopefully, that's what they get out of
it,'' Smith said. ``Because I don't necessarily believe that the
biggest guy always wins. David knocked Goliath down, and took his
head off.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Smith spoke with some of the 30,000 people who play
American football in this country. He tried to inspire them with
his words, not just his size.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of size, Smith was handed what he termed a
``loaded question'' from KTVT/Channel 11 sports director Babe
Laufenberg, a former NFL quarterback, on the floor of the Tokyo
Dome:
</P>
<P>
   How does Emmitt Smith feel he would do in running the football
in the NFL behind an all-Japanese offensive line?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too well,'' Smith replied, quickly adding, ``Not
necessarily because of their size but maybe because of their skill
level in terms of the game itself. American players have been
playing football since they were 8 years old. Come on, be fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go through all the stages of the game,'' said
Smith, who began as a third-grader in pee wee football in Florida.
``I grew up playing the sport. A lot of Japanese haven't grown up
playing the sport, just as they haven't had the same coaching and
teaching that we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   American football was introduced to Japan in 1934. The high
school and college programs use NCAA rules, not NFL rules, as a
standard. But the NFL as a spectator sport has quickly grown in
popularity since the first American Bowl game here in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 11 Japanese players have played in NFL Europe,
including three who have been signed to 10-day contracts and will
participate in tonight's game. They include wide receiver Masaito
Itai and linebacker Masafumi Kawaguchi for the Cowboys and tight
end Nachi Abe for the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Smith plays is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys don't want to risk an injury with any of their key
players. But they want to establish a focus that will allow them to
take care of business on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be able to win on the road,'' quarterback Troy
Aikman said. ``It's a mind-set. We have to be more consistent as an
offensive team, because for us to be the team that we ultimately
hope to be, we have to execute and score points. That has been our
point of emphasis the past five months.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Warren will start at tailback for the Cowboys for a second
week in a row if Smith is held out. nn

KANSAS' AXTELL SET FOR AUSTRIAN TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luke Axtell is looking forward to being a part of the upcoming
Big 12 basketball all-stars' tour of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard Austria is really fabulous,'' said the Kansas
senior, one of 12 conference players who are scheduled today to
begin three days of preparation before embarking on the playing
jaunt, Tuesday to Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   But Axtell might be just as eager were the tour taking place on
elementary school asphalt courts with chains for nets. Thetour
marks the former Texas player's return to the competitive court
after a self-imposed five-month hiatus. Citing an undisclosed
medical condition, Axtell took a leave of absence from the
Jayhawks' active roster 20 games into last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling fine, really positive,'' he said. ``I can't wait
to get back to Kansas. I have a lot to prove to myself, a lot to
prove in general. I'm determined to make it through the season and
do the best I can, but I'm feeling really positive about it all
because I have such a head start compared to what I've had other
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Axtell as yet does not want to be specific about why he left the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying anything about \Rthe reason\S yet,'' he said.
``Though I am thinking about \Rdoing so\S when it's not a
distraction _ sometime after the season _ because there are some
really loyal \R Kansas\S fans who have stood by me all through this
and they deserve to know something. I just don't feel up to talking
about it yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this, it was not a sexually transmitted disease,
drug rehabilitation or problems with alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Axtell said he looks to the future with new resolve. In addition
to cutting an original 10-song CD this summer in Austin, which is
slated to be released shortly after his return from the Big 12
tour, Axtell has added a new word to his vocabulary _ discipline.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has devoted himself to a strict off-season regimen
the past few months, something he has never done before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting up at 5:30 in the morning and running with
my granddad. For me, that's pretty impressive. I'm going to come in
this year and be as focused as I can be,'' Axtell said.
</P>
<P>
   Axtell also has worked with a shooting coach, trying to
rediscover the touch that deserted him last season. He has also
been lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the best shape I've ever been,'' Axtell said.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Axtell in the Big 12 squad are Terry Black (Baylor),
D.J. Harrison (Colorado), Jamaal Tinsley (Iowa State), Quentin
Buchanan (Kansas State), Brian Grawer (Missouri), Cary Cochran
(Nebraska), Nolan Johnson (Oklahoma), Andre Williams (Oklahoma
State), Chris Owens (Texas), Bernard King (Texas A&AMP;M) and Cliff
Owens (Texas Tech).
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Patton of Colorado will coach the team. nn

TEXAS TECH AIMING FOR THE SKIES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ New Texas Tech coach Mike Leach said yesterday
at the Red Raiders' media day that he would be disappointed if the
veteran offensive players aren't sharp when they join the freshmen
for the first full-squad workout today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do, I'm going to feel really good about it all,'' he
said. ``I thought we had an excellent spring and I've mentioned
before that I felt like they are the furthest along of any team
I've been a part of as far as picking up the package.''
</P>
<P>
   Leach said that includes last year's group at Oklahoma, where
Leach was the offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as knowing the system, \Rthe players at Tech\S have
picked \Rthe package\S up sooner and gone a little further with
it,'' Leach said. ``These players are more established in their
roles, knowing what they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kliff Kingsbury, who completed 24 of 26 passes for
321 yards and three touchdowns in the spring game, said he wasn't
surprised the players took to the offense so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of veteran receivers and running backs,''
Kingsbury said. ``And everyone was so excited that we were going to
be throwing the ball around that everyone really got into it quick.
There's more excitement than nervousness heading into the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore running back Shaud Williams, who set a school freshman
rushing record with 320 yards on 21 carries against Colorado last
season, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to get going,'' Williams said. ``We've been
working out all summer and have high expectations _ like winning
the Big 12 championship and going 14-0. We put that pressure on
ourselves and want to live up to those expectations.''
\Nsubheds:Walk-on shines Freshman wide receiver Trey Haverty, an
invited walk-on, has shown signs that he might be the ``steal'' of
the incoming class.
</P>
<P>
   Haverty, who caught 68 passes for 914 yards as a high school
junior, broke an ankle in the only contact scrimmage of August at
Richardson Berkner last year. He returned to play in six games and
caught 36 passes for 683 yards. He also played basketball and ran
track, winning the District 6-5A 400-meter championship.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Naval and Air Force academies offered scholarships. He
said neither appealed to him, and his girlfriend's parents, both
Tech exes, urged him to explore walking on with the Red Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trey had his best practice in our fourth practice
\RThursday\S,'' Leach said. ``That's pretty good, considering we
had them pretty sore and broken down by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Haverty (6-foot, 188 pounds) said the ankle is holding up and he
has his 4.52 speed back. \Nsubheds:Injury outlook Mike Leach said
he expects the healthy return of four veterans who had surgery last
season _ including running back Ricky Williams (knee), offensive
guard Jason May (knee) and linebackers Jonathan Hawkins (shoulder)
and Rusty Bucy (knee). None participated in spring scrimmages. Only
Williams might not see full contact initially, but he said
yesterday that the knee is ``97 percent'' healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other 3 percent is mental,'' he said. \Nsubheds:Promising
assistant New Tech defensive coordinator Greg McMackin and special
teams coordinator Manny Matsakis are among 21 top head-coaching
candidates, ``who should be on the list of every athletic director
looking for a savior,'' according to the August issue of ``American
Football Coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Leach, Southern Mississippi coach Jeff Bower and Clemson
offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez were on the magazine's list
last year. Tech called Bower and talked to Leach and Rodriguez when
searching for a replacement for Spike Dykes, who retired.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma defensive coordinator Mike Stoops is the only other Big
12 coach on this year's list. \Nsubheds:Defense hopeful Greg
McMackin's 4-3 defense has created excitement among Red Raiders
defensive tackles, almost on the same level that Mike Leach's
offense stirred the receiving corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach McMackin is one of the best in the business,'' senior
veteran Kris Kocurek said. ``One of the first things he told us was
we're going to have two good defensive tackles, because them
getting upfield and penetrating to the ball is what makes our
defense. That got me excited right from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``His tackles are playmakers and that hasn't been the case since
I've been here. I've been holding up the linemen so the linebackers
can make plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Kocurek, tackle Robert Wyatt and end Devon Lemons anchor a front
seven expected to be the strength of McMackin's defense.
</P>
<P>
   McMackin has previously been coordinator at Utah (1990-92), Navy
(1992-93), Miami (1993-95), the Seattle Seahawks (1995-98) and
Hawaii (1999).

ANGELS HIT HARD ALL AROUND IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Angels were hit hard Friday night, but the blows
they sustained did not end with Jim Thome's game-winning homer in
the ninth inning of the Indians' 11-10 victory in front of 43,182
at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   After closer Troy Percival surrendered the two-run homer by
Thome, he landed on the disabled list with an inflamed elbow.
Percival, who had offseason shoulder surgery, will be examined more
thoroughly in the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only bad news for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitcher Seth Etherton, who gave up eight runs and 10
hits in 22/3 innings, will miss at least one start because of a
tired shoulder. Matt Wise likely will replace Etherton in the
rotation, although Ramon Ortiz remains a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day all around for the Angels, who rallied from a
9-5 deficit and took a 10-9 lead on Adam Kennedy's RBI single in
the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   In came Percival, who has come to know Jacobs Field as his
personal house of horrors. He began the season with a record of 0-3
with three blown saves and a 19.06 ERA here, but broke the string
with a save May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he began the ninth by getting Roberto Alomar on a liner
to center, then walked Manny Ramirez. Then on a 2-2 pitch, Thome
hit a 79-mph curveball into the right-center field seats to finish
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to bounce it,'' said Percival, who has nine blown
saves this season. ``I've got no feel for what I'm trying to do
right now. I can throw hard, that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival hit 98 mph on the radar gun Friday, but it isn't an
indication of how he's feeling. Percival said he hasn't felt right
all season, as he's compensated for his recovering shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been guarding my shoulder by throwing with a lot of
elbow,'' Percival said. ``It's not sound. I'm trying to do it, I'm
trying to be a hero, but it's hurting the team when I can't execute
my pitches. I've tried to make adjustments but right now I can't
make a quality pitch when I need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival said he didn't feel well at all the last time he
pitched, on July 30 against the White Sox. But even four days off
didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough look at the radar gun and hit 99 and come in here
and admit you're not right,'' Percival said. ``The last two years
have been a nightmare for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed reliever Juan Alvarez will be called up from
Triple-A Edmonton to replace Percival on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton's problem doesn't seem as serious as Percival's, but
it's still a blow to the team. He pitched in winter ball right up
to spring training and said he believes all the work has finally
caught up to him. He was checked out by the Indians' team doctor,
who suggested he needed to rest the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said everything was fine, it's just fatigue,'' Etherton
said. ``I've been through this before, but this is the extreme. I
can't throw my fastball over 85 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels hope they'll get help soon in the starting rotation
from Kent Mercker, who threw four innings (0 runs, 0 hits, 0 walks,
4 strikeouts, 52 pitches) in his rehab start Friday night for
Single-A Lake Elsinore. Mercker will make another start Wednesday
before joining the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret when you come to a window of opportunity,
you're looking for production, you're not looking for
development,'' Scioscia said. ``We're not looking for anything but
what guys need to give us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's loss was the Angels' ninth in 13 games, but they are
still only six games behind first-place Seattle in the AL West.
However, they've fallen five games behind Oakland in the wild-card
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standings are academic right now,'' Angels manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``I don't see anyone pulling away. This is probably
the toughest stretch of games we've played. We haven't played well
the last two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense continues to hit, as the Angels had four players
with two hits each Friday. The bullpen _ leading up to Percival _
was good. Mike Fyhrie, Mike Holtz and Shigetoshi Hasegawa combined
for 51/3 innings and allowed only one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You score 10 runs in a game, at some point you think you have
a chance to hold it,'' Scioscia said. ``There are some things we
need to tighten up.'' &QL;

DODGERS COME BACK FOR 2-1 WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ These are the games the Dodgers need to win _ have
to win, really _ if they are to turn this into a pennant run to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   Home against a less-than-overpowering foe. Already playing well.
Ace Kevin Brown on the mound and rolling.
</P>
<P>
   And then just as it appeared the Dodgers might stumble Friday,
blowing a dominating outing by Brown when the Brewers tied the game
1-1 in the eighth, they rallied with Eric Karros' run-scoring
single in the bottom of the inning for a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Brown threw 72/3 impressive innings, tying his career-high with
12 strikeouts and looking a lot like a guy signed for $105 million.
</P>
<P>
   Only to leave without a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that matters is giving the team a chance to win,'' Brown
said. ``I did that. I'd like to have that one pitch back, but I can
handle it a lot better knowing we came back to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were riding Adrian Beltre's home run off rookie Paul
Rigdon for a 1-0 lead when Brown entered the eighth having struck
out the last five Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Brown had felt a ``little
tweak'' in his right side when he batted in the seventh, and Brown
got into immediate trouble when catcher Raul Casanova opened the
eighth with a ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   Casanova advanced to third on pinch hitter Tyler Houston's
ground out to second. James Mouton ran for Casanova, and the
Dodgers brought the infield in.
</P>
<P>
   Brown got Ron Belliard to foul out to Karros at first, and
appeared to get out of trouble when he got two quick strikes on
Marquis Grissom.
</P>
<P>
   But Grissom worked the count full and then lined a run-scoring
single to left. Grissom had three of the six hits Brown allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson quickly came and got Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters relieved, just before catcher Todd Hundley threw
out Grissom trying to steal for the second time on the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who kept threatening early against Rigdon only to
strand six runners in the first four innings, went quickly after
reliever Juan Acevedo.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek opened with a single and took third when Gary
Sheffield grounded out. Shawn Green was intentionally walked to
bring up Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who had stranded two runners in the first when he struck
out chasing ball four, bounced a hard single up the middle just
beyond the bare-handed attempt of Acevedo and a diving Belliard at
second to score the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who said the pain in his side was probably just a cramp,
came away without the win, but the Dodgers had the kind of victory
they needed, staying 2{ games behind the Giants in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters finished the game with a perfect ninth, raising his
record to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate for (Brown), but good for me,'' Fetters said.
``He pitched a great game. Kevin Brown is going to give you a
quality outing every time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have now won five of their last six at home, and
have won the first game of all five series since the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Just the kinds of things that teams that want to be there down
the stretch have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry too much about the big picture right now,''
Brown said. ``Right now, it's about game by game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon, acquired last week from the Indians in the trade for
closer Bob Wickman, was starting his second game for the Brewers.
He went seven innings, allowing the one run on five hits and three
walks.
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo took the loss, falling to 1-4. &QL;

VERIZON OFFERS NEW PLAN IN BID TO PREVENT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verizon Communications Friday proposed a five-year contract to
two unions that have threatened a walkout that would disrupt
technical and customer services to 25 million subscribers on the
East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon spokesman Steve Marcus declined to discuss details
Friday, but confirmed that a proposal that addresses pay and
benefits was submitted at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Workers of America and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represent 85,000 telephone
workers, say they will strike if an ongoing contract dispute is not
resolved by midnight. The parties' two-year contract expires at
11:55 p.m. Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   A strike could disrupt the billing of calls and result in some
phone connection delays for Verizon customers. It would also affect
new installations.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, which was created by the merger of GTE and Bell
Atlantic Corp., said it would disperse about 30,000 managers in the
event of a strike. The managers would monitor the network and
respond to serious repair calls, as well as line disruptions. The
company added that dial tone and basic telephone service would be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said the company is hoping to reach an agreement with the
unions. ``We have submitted a comprehensive contract proposal, and
we are expecting that the issues will be resolved before the
midnight deadline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But union officials said a strike seemed inevitable. ``Major
issues have been left to the 11th hour, but there is not enough
time to work them out,'' said Steve Early, a chief organizer for
the CWA in New England.
</P>
<P>
   He said the proposal does not address job security, access to
new technical jobs, and a union plan that would permit labor
leaders to organize the telephone company's nonunion wireless
employees. Currently, 45 of the 3,500 technical and service workers
at Verizon Wireless belong to a union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the company to agree to remain neutral when people at
Verizon Wireless sign union cards and when those cards are
presented to a third party to be checked,'' Early added. ``Their
contract proposal does not address that or other contract language
that relates to job security. We're also against a five-year
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus described Verizon Communications as a separate entity,
and said any union concerns about labor matters within the wireless
division should be directed to officials at Verizon Wireless. He
said officials at the wireless unit are willing to talk with labor
leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Cindy Flores Davalos, a 24-year-old Mexican with
neon pink hair, speaks native Spanish and minimal English. But in
her job as the editor of a women's ``channel'' at Elsitio.com, an
Internet company here, she operates in a linguistic netherworld
that experts call Cyber-Spanglish.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at her computer, Flores keeps her hand on ``el maus,''
which she uses to ``clickear'' on the icons on her screen. She
loves to ``chatear'' with her clients online, and when someone
sends her an intriguing ``imail,'' she may ``forwardear'' it to a
friend. Her instantaneous e-mail service, AOL's ICQ (named for the
play on ``I seek you''), gets this rave review: ``I love to
ICQuear'' (pronounced eye-see-kay-YAR).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our daily routine obliges us to work in English,'' Flores said
in Spanish. ``The force of English on the computer screen is
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores' linguistic experience is shared by millions of Hispanics
who are adopting computers and the Internet as the tools and toys
of daily life. From Mexico to Madrid and from Tijuana to Tierra del
Fuego, Spanish-speakers are freely importing English
technology-related words into their vocabulary. They ``taipear''
rather than ``escribir a maquina.'' When they save a file, they
make ``el backup.'' And when their computer jams, it is time to
``resetear.'' Pronunciations tend to retain the simplicity of
American vowels _ the first syllable of ``brainstormear,'' for
instance, is usually said brayn, rather than bry-een.
</P>
<P>
   The hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not
new, of course. It has been accelerating for half a century, and
has often irritated Latin nationalists who see the process as
cultural infiltration from the United States, as well as purists
who think the mother tongue of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra is
quite nice in its classic form, gracias. What is different now,
experts say, is that linguistic gatekeepers in much of the Latin
world appear to be throwing up their hands in the face of the
latest English invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a hard-fought battle from the '60s through the
'80s,'' said Jose Carreno Carlon, director of the department of
communication at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. ``But
the nationalists and purists are in retreat, especially because in
the cybernetic world many English words have no easy equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, many computer-related words _ ``click,'' for
instance _ resist neat translation. But Ilan Stavans, a
Mexican-born professor of Spanish at Amherst College who has
compiled a forthcoming dictionary of Spanglish terms, says there is
another reason for the quick welcome given to many English terms
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shift in the cultural climate not only in Mexico,
but all over Latin America and Spain,'' Stavans said, noting that
the left had once held intellectual sway there. ``Before the fall
of the Berlin Wall, everything that came from the imperialist
gringo had to be rejected. But attitudes have become more receptive
to U.S. popular culture, especially among the middle classes. They
don't reject, they absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 10 percent of the 6,000 hybrid terms Stavans has collected
are Cyber-Spanglish, underlining the Internet culture's growing
influence in the Hispanic world.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is expected to have 128 million Internet users
by 2001. There are far fewer users in Latin America and Spain, but
the number is rising rapidly. Some 2.7 million Mexicans will be
wired into the Internet by year's end, says Marc Alexander, an
analyst at IDC, an American Internet market research company, and
Mexican users are increasing by 50 percent annually. In all of
Latin America, there are now 13.2 million Internet users, up from
8.4 million last year. Nine million Spaniards are now wired.
(English is also bending the Portuguese of Brazil, South America's
largest Internet market.)
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth has made cyberspace the linguistic crucible
that a century ago was centered on America's southwest border and
later in cities like Miami and New York, where Latinos intending to
drive their trucks to market began saying ``Voy a manejar mi troca
a la marketa'' instead of the ``Voy a manejar mi camion al
mercado.''
</P>
<P>
   In more recent decades, Spanglish was fed by English-language
movies, radio and television broadcasts, and advertising. In 1982,
President Jose Lopez Portillo tried to turn back the tide by
creating the Commission for the Defense of the Spanish Language,
which campaigned to rid Mexico City billboards of words like
hamburgers and pub.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rejected that purist campaign,'' said Dr. Tarsicio
Herrera Zapien, the professor of classical letters who is secretary
of the prestigious Academia Mexicana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Languages evolve, and we don't need to fight for Spanish if it
is alive,'' said Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   The Academia Mexicana was set up 125 years ago, its statutes
say, to ``seek the conservation, purity and perfection of the
Spanish language'' in Mexico. But in recent years, Herrera says,
its members have put less focus on purity and will likely do
nothing to prevent the use of Cyber-Spanglish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't legislate how people speak,'' said Herrera. ``We
simply catalog Mexican usages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academia Mexicana is one of 20 organizations in Latin
America affiliated with the Real Academia Espanola (Royal Spanish
Academy) in Madrid, established in 1713 to protect Castilian
Spanish from an earlier source of linguistic pollution: words
derived from Quechua, Nahuatl and other indigenous tongues were
being incorporated into Latin American speech.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the use of proper Spanish, the Real Academia has
established a Web site at www.rae.es. It offers an interactive
service, Espanol al Dia, to answer questions about the correct use
of Spanish.

   Mario Tascon, the editor of El Pais Digital, the Internet
version of Spain's largest newspaper, says the Real Academia has
urged Spaniards to resist the English onslaught by seeking correct
Spanish translations of computer-related terms, a practice he tries
to follow as an editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use el atachment,'' Tascon said. ``We use archivo
adjunto, which is longer, but at least it's Spanish. We try to use
el sitio instead of el site, but that's a battle.'' Half the papers
in Spain now routinely use el site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes English words just force their way into general
use,'' he said. ``We try to get people to use `charlar,' for
instance, but they say `chatear' anyway.''

   MEXICO CITY _ Cindy Flores Davalos, a 24-year-old Mexican with
neon pink hair, speaks native Spanish and minimal English. But in
her job as the editor of a women's ``channel'' at Elsitio.com, an
Internet company here, she operates in a linguistic netherworld
that experts call Cyber-Spanglish.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at her computer, Flores keeps her hand on ``el maus,''
which she uses to ``clickear'' on the icons on her screen. She
loves to ``chatear'' with her clients online, and when someone
sends her an intriguing ``imail,'' she may ``forwardear'' it to a
friend. Her instantaneous e-mail service, AOL's ICQ (named for the
play on ``I seek you''), gets this rave review: ``I love to
ICQuear'' (pronounced eye-see-kay-YAR).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our daily routine obliges us to work in English,'' Flores said
in Spanish. ``The force of English on the computer screen is
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores' linguistic experience is shared by millions of Hispanics
who are adopting computers and the Internet as the tools and toys
of daily life. From Mexico to Madrid and from Tijuana to Tierra del
Fuego, Spanish-speakers are freely importing English
technology-related words into their vocabulary. They ``taipear''
rather than ``escribir a maquina.'' When they save a file, they
make ``el backup.'' And when their computer jams, it is time to
``resetear.'' Pronunciations tend to retain the simplicity of
American vowels _ the first syllable of ``brainstormear,'' for
instance, is usually said brayn, rather than bry-een.
</P>
<P>
   The hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not
new, of course. It has been accelerating for half a century, and
has often irritated Latin nationalists who see the process as
cultural infiltration from the United States, as well as purists
who think the mother tongue of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra is
quite nice in its classic form, gracias. What is different now,
experts say, is that linguistic gatekeepers in much of the Latin
world appear to be throwing up their hands in the face of the
latest English invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a hard-fought battle from the '60s through the
'80s,'' said Jose Carreno Carlon, director of the department of
communication at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. ``But
the nationalists and purists are in retreat, especially because in
the cybernetic world many English words have no easy equivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, many computer-related words _ ``click,'' for
instance _ resist neat translation. But Ilan Stavans, a
Mexican-born professor of Spanish at Amherst College who has
compiled a forthcoming dictionary of Spanglish terms, says there is
another reason for the quick welcome given to many English terms
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shift in the cultural climate not only in Mexico,
but all over Latin America and Spain,'' Stavans said, noting that
the left had once held intellectual sway there. ``Before the fall
of the Berlin Wall, everything that came from the imperialist
gringo had to be rejected. But attitudes have become more receptive
to U.S. popular culture, especially among the middle classes. They
don't reject, they absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 10 percent of the 6,000 hybrid terms Stavans has collected
are Cyber-Spanglish, underlining the Internet culture's growing
influence in the Hispanic world.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is expected to have 128 million Internet users
by 2001. There are far fewer users in Latin America and Spain, but
the number is rising rapidly. Some 2.7 million Mexicans will be
wired into the Internet by year's end, says Marc Alexander, an
analyst at IDC, an American Internet market research company, and
Mexican users are increasing by 50 percent annually. In all of
Latin America, there are now 13.2 million Internet users, up from
8.4 million last year. Nine million Spaniards are now wired.
(English is also bending the Portuguese of Brazil, South America's
largest Internet market.)
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth has made cyberspace the linguistic crucible
that a century ago was centered on America's southwest border and
later in cities like Miami and New York, where Latinos intending to
drive their trucks to market began saying ``Voy a manejar mi troca
a la marketa'' instead of the ``Voy a manejar mi camion al
mercado.''
</P>
<P>
   In more recent decades, Spanglish was fed by English-language
movies, radio and television broadcasts, and advertising. In 1982,
President Jose Lopez Portillo tried to turn back the tide by
creating the Commission for the Defense of the Spanish Language,
which campaigned to rid Mexico City billboards of words like
hamburgers and pub.
</P>
<P>
   ``People rejected that purist campaign,'' said Dr. Tarsicio
Herrera Zapien, the professor of classical letters who is secretary
of the prestigious Academia Mexicana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Languages evolve, and we don't need to fight for Spanish if it
is alive,'' said Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   The Academia Mexicana was set up 125 years ago, its statutes
say, to ``seek the conservation, purity and perfection of the
Spanish language'' in Mexico. But in recent years, Herrera says,
its members have put less focus on purity and will likely do
nothing to prevent the use of Cyber-Spanglish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't legislate how people speak,'' said Herrera. ``We
simply catalog Mexican usages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Academia Mexicana is one of 20 organizations in Latin
America affiliated with the Real Academia Espanola (Royal Spanish
Academy) in Madrid, established in 1713 to protect Castilian
Spanish from an earlier source of linguistic pollution: words
derived from Quechua, Nahuatl and other indigenous tongues were
being incorporated into Latin American speech.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the use of proper Spanish, the Real Academia has
established a Web site at www.rae.es. It offers an interactive
service, Espanol al Dia, to answer questions about the correct use
of Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Tascon, the editor of El Pais Digital, the Internet
version of Spain's largest newspaper, says the Real Academia has
urged Spaniards to resist the English onslaught by seeking correct
Spanish translations of computer-related terms, a practice he tries
to follow as an editor.

   CAIRO, Egypt _ Political slogans tend to long outlive their
authors in this part of the world and none is more enduring, or
more musty with age, than the 1950s-vintage catch phrase ``Arab
unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years have passed since all 22 leaders of Arab League
countries last gathered for a summit meeting, which was held here,
in the aftermath of Iraq's surprise invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2,
1990. It was not a pretty sight, marred by food fights between
angry Kuwaiti sheiks and bellicose Iraqi officials, and by
recriminations and vacillation all around.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the urging of the Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like
Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have
renewed the perennial call for a new summit meeting, this time
billed as an emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the
failure at Camp David and to counter the spin from Washington that
the breakdown was due solely to Arab recalcitrance. Chances for a
summit meeting and a new Arab consensus are slim, Arab officials
now say. Still, the chimera of a united Arab front continues to
shimmer on the horizon _ and, suddenly, not just for the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long found the Arabs' fractiousness useful
in promoting bilateral peace talks and maintaining sanctions on
Iraq. But now Edward Walker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state,
has been sent on a tour of Arab states that maintain relations with
the United States; he is asking leaders to persuade Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to accept Israeli and U.S. proposals for a
final peace.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of those proposals is an offer of shared
administration of Arab East Jerusalem, but not of sovereignty over
it. So far, the public reaction to Walker's trip has been
resentment that the United States seems to be calling in its chits
in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, the Arab state of affairs is sufficiently dismal to
foreclose a decisive pan-Arab stand on Jerusalem and the need to
restore Arab sovereignty over its eastern sector,'' wrote Joseph
Samaha, a Lebanese analyst for the international Arabic daily
newspaper Al Hayat. ``But it's not that bad that the Arabs will
concede the loss of the city to Israel forever.''
</P>
<P>
   If a less fragmented Arab leadership would be helpful to
Washington and Israel for the first time in a decade _ and helpful
to Arabs who are nostalgic for the days when, collectively, they
counted for more _ it is also much harder to nail down now.
</P>
<P>
   First, the internal political and economic situation in the Arab
world is more fragile than it was a decade ago, when Washington
could stitch together an anti-Iraq alliance that included most Arab
nations and then proceed to establish its own primacy in the
region, where many countries are beggars for money and arms.
</P>
<P>
   Long-serving military figures who once could simply impose their
will on their people, like King Hussein of Jordan and Hafez Assad
of Syria, are gone. The nations they left behind for their sons and
successors suffer under sick economies with raging unemployment.
Moreover, their heirs are still consolidating power, making them
more sensitive to hints of internal discontent and to the threat,
real or not, of minority extremists who criticize anything that
seems to be catering to Israel or the West.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the new cast of characters in Arab politics is
theoretically more free of the constraints of history than the old.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein and Assad, along with the assassinated Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, were warriors of the Arab-Israeli
conflict. Rabin carried an aura of victory, as the former commander
in the 1967 war, in which Jordan and Syria lost big chunks of
territory to Israel. But their 1967 defeats, and their failure to
regain either the West Bank or the Golan Heights through war or
diplomacy, weighed heavily on the shoulders of the two Arab
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the Syrian and Jordanian leaders also contributed
mightily to the lack of Arab unity. No friends of each other, both
also had hostile relations with Arafat, as did the late King Hassan
of Morocco, another leader who has bequeathed a regime to his son.
</P>
<P>
   While their absence from the scene could be considered helpful
to peacemaking and Arab unity, the legacy they left of failing
economies and ideologically rigid governments may sabotage those
goals for their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baggage of history on their sons is just as great,'' said
Kamel Abu Jaber, a former Jordanian foreign minister who is now
president of the Jordanian Institute for Diplomacy. ``That's the
historical danger of Camp David. It may revive in these young
leaders, who may be willing to compromise, a tendency to refreeze
into rigid attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, the Arab world is also running at different
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic fundamentalist movements, while brutally suppressed in
places like Egypt and Syria, are still alive and well elsewhere.
The ruling family of Saudi Arabia feels under constant threat from
extremists inside and outside the country who criticize it for the
continued presence of American troops on its soil. Fundamentalist
groups opposed to the Saudi policy of cool cooperation with the
West send out streams of e-mails each day accusing the royals of
corruption and decadence.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, a new alliance of Islamists and nationalists has
warned the government against making contacts with Israel or
Israelis. So while people in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt may
yearn for the presumed economic benefits of a comprehensive peace,
the domestic message to the rulers in the Gulf is far different.
``Nobody here cares about the supposed economic benefits,'' said
Ahmed Baghdadi, a professor of political science at Kuwait
University. ``In contrast, the religious movement in the National
Assembly is very strong.''

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ There is hardly a town in Latin America
that does not have a street or school or square named for Simon
Bolivar, the Great Liberator, who freed South America from Spanish
rule nearly 200 years ago. Two countries now bear his name, as does
the currency here in Venezuela, his native land, now officially
known as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Throughout the
region, no figure is more universally revered or quoted.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarkable career as a general and statesman, Bolivar
said many different and often contradictory things. That means that
modern political leaders like Hugo Chavez, who was certified here
Friday for a new six-year term as president, have a whole menu of
positions from which to choose when they seek to legitimize or
justify their own actions.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez himself is something of a mystery to much of the world _
a charismatic populist who is at the same time a military man, a
leftist, a sloganeer and above all an enthusiastic wielder of
power. To try to get a grip on what a complicated leader really is
like, it is sometimes useful to take a look at the heroes and
symbols he tries to exploit. In Chavez's case, the most important
of these is Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   But which Bolivar?
</P>
<P>
   There is one Bolivar, for instance, who praised democracy as
``the most sacred source'' of power, but there is also another who
once proclaimed that ``necessity recognizes no laws.'' One Bolivar
admired George Washington as the ideal ``citizen-hero'' who ``fills
my bosom with emulation,'' while another famously and bitterly
remarked that ``the United States seems destined by providence to
plague Latin America with misery in the name of liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez describes himself as a disciple of Bolivar, and some of
his more ardent followers have gone so far as to suggest he is the
``reincarnation of the Liberator.'' But his vision of Bolivar is
one ``very much adapted to his own purposes,'' said Jesus Sanoja
Hernandez, a prominent political commentator here. Even before
coming to power 18 months ago, Chavez, a former army colonel who in
1992 led an unsuccessful coup attempt, made it clear that ``the
Bolivar he likes is the one who centralized power,'' said Dr.
Guillermo Moron, one of Venezuela's leading historians and experts
on Bolivar. ``The Bolivar that the opposition likes, in contrast,
is the one who respected the law, consulted even his enemies and
tried to create an impartial system of justice for all.``
</P>
<P>
   In a society as deeply divided by class, geography and race as
modern Venezuela, Bolivar, who was born here in 1783, has always
been an important symbol of national unity and identity. ``All
Venezuelans are Bolivarians by definition, because he is the only
great man this country has ever produced,'' said Moron.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez's efforts to appropriate Bolivar as his personal
symbol have worked to further polarize society _ for example, when
he brandished Bolivar's sword as he criticized opponents during the
recent election campaign here. The result is a situation in which,
as the Bolivar scholar Manuel Caballero puts it, ``every enemy of
the government is thereby an enemy of Bolivar and thus excluded
from the Venezuelan community.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because Bolivar is a national icon who is supposed to
be above partisan battles, Venezuelan law prohibits any political
party from including his name in its official title. But Chavez has
at times come perilously close to ignoring that restriction,
originally designating his organization the Bolivarian
Revolutionary Movement and even now calling his program to expand
the role of the military the ``Plan Bolivar 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of his most recent initiatives has been the creation
of what he calls ``Bolivarian schools,'' complete with lunch
programs and medical care for poor children. That program, however,
quickly provoked controversy when it became clear that the
curriculum was to include military training for students and that
textbooks on the history of Venezuela were going to be rewritten to
suit Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivar is not the only hero of Latin American independence to
be subjected to such historical revisionism. Cuba provides perhaps
an even more glaring example: Fidel Castro manipulates the writings
of Jose Marti for his own ends, as does the Cuban exile community
in Miami and even the United States government, through its
broadcasts on Radio and TV Marti.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Venezuela's borders, Chavez's use of Bolivarian ideals
has been even more confusing and contradictory. Bolivar proclaimed
that ``Our country is America,'' and Chavez has repeatedly endorsed
the concept of regional integration. He has pushed for a South
Atlantic version of NATO, only to be met by the skepticism of
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks largely to Chavez, it seems to be the left that is
getting the most mileage out of Bolivar in nearby countries in
Latin America at the moment. The political party recently formed by
Colombia's main Marxist guerrilla group bears Bolivar's name, and
the populist-nationalist colonels who joined with Indians to
overthrow President Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador in January have also
described themselves as followers of Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez also unilaterally closed his country's border to
Colombian truckers and then defied the Andean Community when the
group ruled that such an action was illegal. He has persistently
flirted with the guerrillas who are seeking to overthrow Colombia's
democratically elected government; he has failed to condemn the
recent military coup in Ecuador, and he now seems to want to revive
a dormant border dispute with neighboring Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   So as the 21st century begins, Bolivar, a product of the
18th-century Enlightenment, plays a more important role in the
daily politics of his homeland than Washington or even Jefferson do
in the United States. Yet lurking in the background is the prospect
that the Bolivarian revival Chavez is sponsoring could end up
perpetuating one of the Liberator's most famous prophecies.
``America is ungovernable,'' he said just a few weeks before his
death in Colombia in 1830. ``He who serves the revolution plows the
sea.''

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ There is hardly a town in Latin America
that does not have a street or school or square named for Simon
Bolivar, the Great Liberator, who freed South America from Spanish
rule nearly 200 years ago. Two countries now bear his name, as does
the currency here in Venezuela, his native land, now officially
known as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Throughout the
region, no figure is more universally revered or quoted.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarkable career as a general and statesman, Bolivar
said many different and often contradictory things. That means that
modern political leaders like Hugo Chavez, who was certified here
Friday for a new six-year term as president, have a whole menu of
positions from which to choose when they seek to legitimize or
justify their own actions.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez himself is something of a mystery to much of the world _
a charismatic populist who is at the same time a military man, a
leftist, a sloganeer and above all an enthusiastic wielder of
power. To try to get a grip on what a complicated leader really is
like, it is sometimes useful to take a look at the heroes and
symbols he tries to exploit. In Chavez's case, the most important
of these is Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   But which Bolivar?
</P>
<P>
   There is one Bolivar, for instance, who praised democracy as
``the most sacred source'' of power, but there is also another who
once proclaimed that ``necessity recognizes no laws.'' One Bolivar
admired George Washington as the ideal ``citizen-hero'' who ``fills
my bosom with emulation,'' while another famously and bitterly
remarked that ``the United States seems destined by providence to
plague Latin America with misery in the name of liberty.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ It began with Team 100, a name for a political
club that was purposefully subtle and maybe even a bit coy. One had
to imagine what the 100 stood for: Senators? Dollars? Nickels?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. Team 100 was made up of the $100,000 contributors, the
pinnacle of political generosity back in 1988 when the elder George
Bush invented the Republicans' first elite donor club for a handful
of the party's most generous patrons.
</P>
<P>
   But in presidential politics, donation inflation is at least 50
percent, and last week the Republican convention was overrun by a
stampede of 600 Team 100 members. Their suite at the Ritz-Carlton
was jammed. Those who complained were offered an option: Take out
those checkbooks and give the party $250,000, the entry fee to the
Republican Regents, the party's newest and most exclusive donor
club, whose suite at the Four Seasons had plenty of leg room.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Regents were given receptions with both the elder
and younger George Bushes, a Saks Fifth Avenue fashion show and a
party at Tiffany &AMP; Co. ``There's something to do every minute,''
said Sam Fox, the top-giving Regent (nearly $600,000), who sounded
worn out by the yacht rides and golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The word regent is defined as one who governs a kingdom in the
minority, absence or disability of the sovereign ruler. In this era
of outrage over campaign finance excesses, it seems odd that the
Republicans would choose a name that allows Americans to imagine a
seat next to the throne for the party's $250,000-and-up sponsors _
a list that includes Phillip Morris Cos., the National Rifle
Association, AT&AMP;T and Enron Corp., the Houston energy and
commodities conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The donor group was named by Mel Sembler, the Republican's
gregarious finance chairman, who made a royal fortune building
shopping centers. ``I just thought it had a nice ring to it,'' he
said earlier this year. But a few fund-raisers have quietly
complained that the name opens the party to criticism that it
caters to a blue-blood elite.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats were far more careful, calling their top donor
club Leadership 2000 (for people who give or raise $350,000; there
are 18 members). Other Republican club names also sound benign: the
Eagles, the Majority Council.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Regents is a runaway success. Sembler's goal was to sign
up 100 members by Nov. 7, but there are already 139. Two-thirds are
individuals who say they give not because they want something in
return but because they believe in what the party stands for _ less
government and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   What's next for the Republicans? A $500,000 club? A $1 million
club? Perhaps, a few fund-raisers acknowledged last week. But they
quickly promised that the name would give nothing away. &QL;

<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ To the West, he is an aging despot with
bloody hands, a brutal race-monger who terrorizes white farmers and
black critics and fuels the violence that still churns through the
countryside. But on this continent, many Africans are painting a
strikingly different portrait of Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, 54 percent of blacks in a recent survey said
they supported the invasions of white-owned farms here. In Namibia,
the prime minister praised Mugabe for highlighting the racial
inequities in regional land ownership. And in Nigeria, a newspaper
assailed the West for trying to demonize an African leader intent
on redressing a historical wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners might find this alternative view of Mugabe jarring.
How can the villain also be a hero? How can he be praised for
pursuing an honorable cause if his supporters commit murder? And as
a result, even in the barrage of foreign media coverage about the
crisis in Zimbabwe, little but condemnation for Mugabe is heard.
Other opinions are dismissed as those of apologists, collaborators
or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, the perceptual dissonance reflects mostly the
lingering impact of this continent's painful colonial history on
the modern-day lives of black Africans. The white regimes have been
swept away, but all across Africa, the single most valuable and
plentiful resource _ land _ remains in the hands of tiny white
minorities. ``The media is highlighting the issue of violence,''
said Richard Sakala, a spokesman for President Frederick Chiluba of
Zambia, last week. ``But I don't think they're talking about the
core issue, about how land is distributed in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, white rule ended in Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, but
today, whites _ who make up less than 2 percent of the population _
still control more than half of the arable farmland. The black
majority ekes out a living in overcrowded tracts of stony soil. In
six-year-old post-apartheid South Africa, blacks make up 75 percent
of the population but occupy only 15 percent of the land. In
Namibia, nearly 10 years into independence, some 4,000 whites own
about 44 percent of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The racial disparities are achingly visible in Zimbabwe's
rolling hills and lush valleys. More than 60 percent of the blacks
in this country live off tiny slivers of land, growing their own
food, going hungry when the soil wears out. Old people tell stories
and sing songs about how the best land was taken by British
settlers around the turn of the century. Today, from their meager
plots, these struggling peasants can often see and envy the vast,
fertile farms of the whites.
</P>
<P>
   So while most blacks condemn the political violence, many
welcome the spotlight that Mugabe has drawn to the land question,
his pointed reminder that white settlers stole this land. And even
in the highly urbanized cities, which voted overwhelmingly against
Mugabe's governing party in June's parliamentary elections, that
reality retains its bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, of course, Mugabe has not always been the
champion of the landless. He officially abandoned Marxism in the
mid-1990s and has used the promise of land reform mainly to curry
favor with rural voters at election time. He blames whites for the
slow pace of change, but his own government has lacked the
political will, the administrative capacity and the cash to make
land reform a reality. His government's announcement last week that
it would take over 3,000 farms seemed calculated more to rile white
farmers than to outline an immediately feasible plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some Africans, notably Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, have
sharply criticized Mugabe, calling for an immediate end to the farm
invasions and the violence that has claimed the lives of as many as
30 government critics before the June elections. (Today, black
squatters still occupy about 1,000 farms.) A strike last week by
Zimbabwe's black unions and white business owners to protest the
farm invasions brought the nation to a one-day standstill.
</P>
<P>
   But even those blacks who speak harshly of Mugabe's violent
tactics recognize that the desperation for land is real. And some
suspect that the harsh criticism from the West may be fueled, in
part, by those who want to maintain the status quo. ``The power of
the white settler lobby should not be underrated,'' the East
African, a newspaper based in Kenya, warned in an editorial last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign aid donors and white farmers here agree that 2 million
acres of fallow land should be turned over to black peasants. But
despite the assurances from white farmers that they support land
redistribution, they have repeatedly failed to systematically
identify tracts available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   And Western governments and aid donors say violence on farms
must end before they will provide promised financing. That makes
some people seethe. ``When all is said and done, who are they to
decide that historical injustices should play second fiddle to the
problems on the farms?'' said Sam Moyo, a highly regarded land
expert who is helping Zimbabwe's government negotiate with the
white farmers union.
</P>
<P>
   There are other points of dissonance, too. While Western
officials were cheering the opposition alliance of black union
members, white farmers and white industrialists that swept into
Parliament in June, some South Africans felt a nagging sense of
unease.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of Zimbabwe's new opposition
party, the Movement for Democratic Change, said South African
officials were so suspicious of his group that they asked whether
he had links to the rebel movements in Angola and Mozambique, which
were financed and supported by the white apartheid government
through the early 1990s, in an effort to destabilize the black
governments in those countries. ``They were asking whether I have
relations with Unita or Renamo and I told them no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai says he will oppose Mugabe for the presidency if he
runs again in 2002. No matter what, he says, the man who led
Zimbabwe for 20 years will go down in history as having destroyed
his country.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Western officials disagree. They say if Mugabe
succeeds in returning a significant chunk of land to the black
majority, he will be viewed with some respect on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legacy is not about stabilizing the economy or attracting
foreign donors,'' said a white Western official, who has worked on
economic issues in and around Africa for several years. ``It's the
reason why he sat in a jail for so many years; it's the land,'' he
said. ``And when the dust settles, he will get some sympathy in
Africa. People may disagree about his tactics, but they'll say,
`This guy really did it.'''

   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ To the West, he is an aging despot with
bloody hands, a brutal race-monger who terrorizes white farmers and
black critics and fuels the violence that still churns through the
countryside. But on this continent, many Africans are painting a
strikingly different portrait of Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, 54 percent of blacks in a recent survey said
they supported the invasions of white-owned farms here. In Namibia,
the prime minister praised Mugabe for highlighting the racial
inequities in regional land ownership. And in Nigeria, a newspaper
assailed the West for trying to demonize an African leader intent
on redressing a historical wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners might find this alternative view of Mugabe jarring.
How can the villain also be a hero? How can he be praised for
pursuing an honorable cause if his supporters commit murder? And as
a result, even in the barrage of foreign media coverage about the
crisis in Zimbabwe, little but condemnation for Mugabe is heard.
Other opinions are dismissed as those of apologists, collaborators
or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, the perceptual dissonance reflects mostly the
lingering impact of this continent's painful colonial history on
the modern-day lives of black Africans. The white regimes have been
swept away, but all across Africa, the single most valuable and
plentiful resource _ land _ remains in the hands of tiny white
minorities. ``The media is highlighting the issue of violence,''
said Richard Sakala, a spokesman for President Frederick Chiluba of
Zambia, last week. ``But I don't think they're talking about the
core issue, about how land is distributed in that country.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, white rule ended in Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, but
today, whites _ who make up less than 2 percent of the population _
still control more than half of the arable farmland. The black
majority ekes out a living in overcrowded tracts of stony soil. In
six-year-old post-apartheid South Africa, blacks make up 75 percent
of the population but occupy only 15 percent of the land. In
Namibia, nearly 10 years into independence, some 4,000 whites own
about 44 percent of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The racial disparities are achingly visible in Zimbabwe's
rolling hills and lush valleys. More than 60 percent of the blacks
in this country live off tiny slivers of land, growing their own
food, going hungry when the soil wears out. Old people tell stories
and sing songs about how the best land was taken by British
settlers around the turn of the century. Today, from their meager
plots, these struggling peasants can often see and envy the vast,
fertile farms of the whites.
</P>
<P>
   So while most blacks condemn the political violence, many
welcome the spotlight that Mugabe has drawn to the land question,
his pointed reminder that white settlers stole this land. And even
in the highly urbanized cities, which voted overwhelmingly against
Mugabe's governing party in June's parliamentary elections, that
reality retains its bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, of course, Mugabe has not always been the
champion of the landless. He officially abandoned Marxism in the
mid-1990s and has used the promise of land reform mainly to curry
favor with rural voters at election time. He blames whites for the
slow pace of change, but his own government has lacked the
political will, the administrative capacity and the cash to make
land reform a reality. His government's announcement last week that
it would take over 3,000 farms seemed calculated more to rile white
farmers than to outline an immediately feasible plan.
</P>
<P>
   Some Africans, notably Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, have
sharply criticized Mugabe, calling for an immediate end to the farm
invasions and the violence that has claimed the lives of as many as
30 government critics before the June elections. (Today, black
squatters still occupy about 1,000 farms.) A strike last week by
Zimbabwe's black unions and white business owners to protest the
farm invasions brought the nation to a one-day standstill.
</P>
<P>
   But even those blacks who speak harshly of Mugabe's violent
tactics recognize that the desperation for land is real. And some
suspect that the harsh criticism from the West may be fueled, in
part, by those who want to maintain the status quo. ``The power of
the white settler lobby should not be underrated,'' the East
African, a newspaper based in Kenya, warned in an editorial last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign aid donors and white farmers here agree that 2 million
acres of fallow land should be turned over to black peasants. But
despite the assurances from white farmers that they support land
redistribution, they have repeatedly failed to systematically
identify tracts available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   And Western governments and aid donors say violence on farms
must end before they will provide promised financing. That makes
some people seethe. ``When all is said and done, who are they to
decide that historical injustices should play second fiddle to the
problems on the farms?'' said Sam Moyo, a highly regarded land
expert who is helping Zimbabwe's government negotiate with the
white farmers union.
</P>
<P>
   There are other points of dissonance, too. While Western
officials were cheering the opposition alliance of black union
members, white farmers and white industrialists that swept into
Parliament in June, some South Africans felt a nagging sense of
unease.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of Zimbabwe's new opposition
party, the Movement for Democratic Change, said South African
officials were so suspicious of his group that they asked whether
he had links to the rebel movements in Angola and Mozambique, which
were financed and supported by the white apartheid government
through the early 1990s, in an effort to destabilize the black
governments in those countries. ``They were asking whether I have
relations with Unita or Renamo and I told them no,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvangirai says he will oppose Mugabe for the presidency if he
runs again in 2002. No matter what, he says, the man who led
Zimbabwe for 20 years will go down in history as having destroyed
his country.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Western officials disagree. They say if Mugabe
succeeds in returning a significant chunk of land to the black
majority, he will be viewed with some respect on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legacy is not about stabilizing the economy or attracting
foreign donors,'' said a white Western official, who has worked on
economic issues in and around Africa for several years. ``It's the
reason why he sat in a jail for so many years; it's the land,'' he
said. ``And when the dust settles, he will get some sympathy in
Africa. People may disagree about his tactics, but they'll say,
`This guy really did it.'''

   In India, a Reality Drama for Real &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The line between fantasy and reality is perhaps never as pliable
as in the minds of people who love the movie screen, or so it
seemed in India last week. There, a real-life mustachioed villain
seized a fantasy-life hero and kept millions of people and their
officials in suspense about what might happen next.
</P>
<P>
   The villain of the piece is Veerappan, said by the authorities
to be an aging smuggler and elephant poacher who killed his
daughter and dozens of policemen. He has nevertheless played Robin
Hood to forest dwellers in southern India as he has eluded years of
efforts by the authorities to arrest him. But now he wants to be
allowed to live a normal life, and stop hiding.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, police say, he kidnapped and hid in the jungle one
of India's most revered movie idols _ 72-year-old Rajkumar, who
millions of Indians have seen on the screen as a Hindu god or a
king or a hero in some other garb. The star has made more than 200
films in all.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, the plan is for the real criminal to ransom the
fantasy hero for some sort of a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   The public's reaction was equal to the staggering audacity of
the crime. On Monday and Tuesday in Bangalore, a city otherwise
known mostly for its booming information technology industry, bands
of movie fans erupted in street protests bordering on violence and
brought the city nearly to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   And one novelist, U.R. Ananthumurthy, drew the appropriate
lesson. Bangalore, he said, ``belongs to the modern world system
and thinks it can ignore mass psychology. But it forgets that other
reality that lurks within.''
</P>
<P>
   Drop That Doubloon &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you drop a dollar bill on the sidewalk and do not pick it up
quickly, it is safe to say you have lost your rights to it. If your
sailing ship drops into the sea, though, is it still yours?
</P>
<P>
   Until now, probably not. But the idea of finding and salvaging
lost treasure just got a nasty legal jolt.
</P>
<P>
   In its years of conquering parts of the world, Spain left many a
ship on the ocean floor, often laden with riches, and these
provided juicy targets for adventurers. But with technology making
salvaging easier these days, Spain and other countries want to
reclaim these scraps of heritage _ and loot. And a federal appeals
court in Virginia has now ruled that two ships sunk off that
state's coast still, centuries later, belong to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Treasure hunters are not happy, and the one who found those two
ships is weighing an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ruling stands, it could mean, say, that the British
could lay claim to the superstar of wrecks, the Titanic. On the
other hand, it could also raise trickier issues. After all, much of
that Spanish loot was first stolen from Latin American natives. Who
has the prior claim now?

   After Camp David, Thin Ice for Barak
</P>
<P>
   Israel's fractious parliament gave a little breathing room and a
thumb in the eye to Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his embattled
efforts to reach a compromise on Jerusalem with Yasser Arafat and
nail down the terms of a final peace accord this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In one vote on Monday, July 31, Barak's government survived a
no-confidence motion mounted by opponents of the peace effort. But
in a second vote that day, Barak's candidate for the largely
ceremonial Israeli presidency, Shimon Peres, was defeated in favor
of the opposition Likud candidate, Moshe Katsav. Two days later,
Barak's foreign minister, David Levy, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   A Civil Rights Probe
</P>
<P>
   The Los Alamos National Laboratory, where the atomic bomb was
developed during World War II, has come under investigation by the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal civil rights
agency. The agency is looking into possible discrimination against
Asian and Asian-American scientists, some of whom have charged that
security measures put in place after the arrest of Dr. Wen Ho Lee,
a former Los Alamos scientist charged with mishandling nuclear
data, have focused unfairly on them. The commission began a similar
investigation of another weapons laboratory, Lawrence Livermore,
last year.

   A New Climate Strategy  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Girding for talks that could shape a global treaty to avert
harmful climate warming, the United States said it could not meet
targets only by cutting back on burning coal and oil, which emit
heat-trapping carbon dioxide. It must get credit for the country's
forests and fields, which can sop up the same greenhouse gas.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, Russia and other countries with lots of green acres are
echoing the position. But Europe, largely shorn of forests, says
that's cheating, and some environmental groups, eager for more
solar panels and fewer power plants, agree.

there is no evidence the 1994 Brady Law, which mandates background

   Bungled, but not Political
</P>
<P>
   One year before the 1996 presidential election, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service launched a program to naturalize 1
million immigrants. The timing raised eyebrows. Now a Justice
Department report has found that while the agency bungled the job,
and as many as 180,000 immigrants became citizens without proper
background checks, officials did not improperly meddle with the
program to beef up voter rolls by election day.

   A New Drug Front
</P>
<P>
   The nation's law enforcement community reported that it was
suddenly facing another potential front in its longstanding war on
drugs: a psychedelic drug nicknamed Ecstasy. It has gained wide
appeal among young  &QL; 
people, particularly those on the nightclub circuit, and in the
last 10 months, agents for the U.S. Customs Service have seized a
record 8 million doses at the nation's airports and other ports of
entry.
</P>
<P>
   Still, law enforcement officials seem to be at a loss over how
to combat it. _ By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

   Questions on Brady Law
</P>
<P>
   A study in The Journal of the American Medical Association says
there is no evidence the 1994 Brady Law, which mandates background
checks of handgun buyers, has contributed to the recent sharp
decline in homicide.
</P>
<P>
   That is music to the ears of the National Rifle Association,
which argues that laws don't stop criminals from getting guns.
</P>
<P>
   But gun control advocates say the study is flawed, and even the
study's authors acknowledge that a major reason the Brady law may
not have been effective is its limited scope.

   One of the enduring mysteries of the school shootings in places
like Littleton, Colo., and West Paducah, Ky., is how so many people
could have known so much but done so little to prevent bloodshed.
The Columbine High School massacre, in which 15 people were killed,
took place in April 1999. This May a 13-year-old boy fatally shot a
teacher in Lake Worth, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In case after case, the friends and acquaintances of the killers
had heard boasts, muttered plans for mayhem or seen such warning
signs as a fascination with guns that may have seemed dissonant
even in communities of sportsmen and firearms. But they did nothing
to stop the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The recently released testimony of teen-agers who knew one such
killer provide some explanation. At 14, Michael Carneal killed
three girls and injured five other students when he opened fire on
a prayer group at Heath High School in West Paducah, Ky., on Dec.
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The following excerpts are from depositions of the teen-agers
that were filed in a civil damage suit in McCracken County Circuit
Court in Paducah. The questioner, in most instances, is Mike Breen,
a lawyer for the parents of the three murdered girls, Nicole
Hadley, Kayce Steger and Jessica James. The parents sued more than
50 people, including many of the teen-agers who knew Carneal,
claiming that they could have prevented the killings or, in some
cases, that they had helped plan them. The judge, William L.
Shadoan, dismissed the suits, ruling that only the killer could be
held liable for his crime. Carneal, now 17, is serving a life
sentence after pleading guilty, saying he was mentally ill at the
time of the shooting.

   He was just this goofy kid that just did really silly stuff. And
I liked that, because I'm a silly guy myself. . . . He told me,
once or twice, that he thought it would be cool to walk _ or run _
down the halls shooting people. And he told me once he thought that
it would be cool to go to prison. . . . He told me that he would,
like, get keys to people's houses, and, like, just go up and unlock
the door and, like, steal medication and stuff, and money from
people's houses. . . . You, like, look back and you see all these
little things that he did that were like, sort of like warning
signs, sort of, but you didn't really realize them at the time. . .
. At the time, I thought I knew him, you know. But then, like,
after all this, I really didn't know him at all, because . . .
like, this silly person was just a cover-up of this other guy.

something?'' And I was like, sure. And he showed it to me. And,

   ((He was)) usually quiet, but then sometimes he would get noisy

fit in. . . . He got picked on a lot because he was small and _ I

freshmen got picked on. . . . He wasn't a big part of the jock
population. . . . He just wasn't real tough and big. He was small.
. . .. He was stranger than we are, more strange.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you ever hear Michael talk about taking over the school?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah. Not as in seriously. A lot of kids talk about taking
over the school . . . No one likes school, so. . . . Every school
I've been to, someone would mention we should burn down the school.
It's not strange for someone to not like school. . . . It was
around Halloween, he brought a gun to school that he was trying to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know what kind of gun it was?
</P>
<P>
   A: A revolver? It's silver and the kind that has the spinny
thing that comes out. . . . For some reason, it didn't strike me as
odd.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Really?
</P>
<P>
   A: I just thought, well, he's trying to sell a gun. . . . I
didn't really _ I didn't think, ``Oh, goodness, he's going to kill
someone at school,'' because that just never had happened.

told me that he was doing stuff with credit cards, buying stuff off
the Internet with credit card numbers that were not his. And I
warned him about getting in trouble and getting caught. And I told
him that if he got caught, he had to shower in front of a bunch of
guys, and probably wouldn't like that. That's about all I can
remember of the discussion.

Carneal made it to you?

things like that, you know, not meaning anything by them. You know,
like, ``I really hate this,'' you know. And they don't mean
anything by it. And people don't take them seriously.

murder like this seriously?

later. But I did get there to see what Michael was going to do. . .
. Because he told us, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, that he
was going to do something. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you took him seriously enough, at least to the extent
that you thought he was going to do something that was going to be
worth watching, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you showed up to school early that day so you could see?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: All right. And during the time that you were thinking about
this, between the Wednesday that he made the statement and the

about it and tell them?
</P>
<P>
   A: No.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why not?

would be neat to go in the school and shoot people that you don't
like. . . . And he said, if you're going to take over the school,
you could use those axes. . . . I just went along with him. I said,
``Yeah, if you're going to take over the school, you would have to
cut the phone lines,'' or something. . . . He just did stuff to get
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ((The morning of the murders)) I seen him put ear plugs in, and
((I)) say, ``Hey, it would be funny if you wore those during class
while the teacher is giving a speech.'' And he laughed. And then I
just turned around. And then, when I turned back, he was pulling a
gun out of his backpack.

like. . . . And he said, if you're going to take over the school,
you could use those axes. . . . I just went along with him. I said,
``Yeah, if you're going to take over the school, you would have to
cut the phone lines,'' or something. . . . He just did stuff to get
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ((The morning of the murders)) I seen him put ear plugs in, and
((I)) say, ``Hey, it would be funny if you wore those during class
while the teacher is giving a speech.'' And he laughed. And then I
just turned around. And then, when I turned back, he was pulling a
gun out of his backpack.

COMMENTARY: WHAT ON EARTH WERE THEY THINKING? 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prince Albert is in a can.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody is going to let him out.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has got to be dying.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been going his way. Everything has been going W.'s
way.
</P>
<P>
   One White House official tried to dismiss the Republican
convention, filled with black entertainers and sombrero-wearing
Latino singers onstage and well-fed white guys in the audience, as
``Showboat.''
</P>
<P>
   (Related footnote: In 1962, W.'s uncle Jonathan made the front
page of Variety when he considered reviving a black-face minstrel
show Off Broadway.)
</P>
<P>
   But no matter What Lies Beneath his contrived tableau of
inclusivity, W., in essence, has already had the Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats want to respond in kind, they will have to
stick all their women and minorities in the audience and parade a
bunch of rich old white guys in half-moon glasses checking the
Nasdaq ticker onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, already coiled to the max, must head to the West Coast for
his big week with scenes of a Bush triumph buzzing in his head.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look promising.
</P>
<P>
   If the vice president wants to step out of the president's
shadow, L.A. is not the place to do it. Indeed, it is impossible to
think of a worse city to showcase the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is Bill's town, and Hillary's town.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Al's town, or Tipper's town. (Her relentless jamming
on the drums has not drowned out the memory of her campaign against
dirty rock and rap lyrics.)
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's a palindrome. AL-LA. But how can the Uptight Al Gore
try once more to set free the Real Al Gore if no one is paying any
mind?
</P>
<P>
   Every day brings news of another lavish tribute/fund-raiser
larded on for Bill and Hillary, with Whoopi, Barbra, Cher, Carly,
Harvey, Bette. Best of all is one for Hillary at Kenny Rogers'
ranch, starring Red Buttons.
</P>
<P>
   (Al baby, when your two weak points are a sex scandal and a
fund-raising scandal, do you guys really have to go to the capital
of sex to fund-raise? Not to mention the home of the Buddhist
temple and Monica Lewinsky's birthplace, Rodeo Drive.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, oblivious to such problems, is thrilled to get another
chance to hang with David Geffen. He thinks L.A.'s the most fitting
place for what he wistfully calls ``my farewell convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has even been invited to a fete Sunday for his
sanitized, idealized alter ego, Josiah Bartlet, president of the
luminous ``West Wing.'' (Where vixens never presume to linger over
pizzas in the Oval Office.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Al is trying to hustle the First Couple out of town
after the convention's first night, they're coming several days
early to rattle their tin cups, so they will actually spend more
time in L.A. than the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood players have struggled to transfer their affections to
Gore. But the most fickle town in the world remains steadfastly
loyal to the Entertainer in Chief. The boy from Hope gave the
glitteries all the respect and overnights in the Lincoln Bedroom
they yearned for; plus he's a bona fide groupie.
</P>
<P>
   We had a movie star who was a president and a president who
liked to cut loose with the Rat Pack. But Bill Clinton was the
first president to act as if he would actually rather be a movie
star. He didn't scorn Hollywood values. He aspired to them. He was
the sort of world leader who liked to take a break from a meeting
with Boris Yeltsin to spend quality time with Sharon Stone and
Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, where focus groups also determine how the product is
pitched, has an uneasy sense that Gore is a supporting character,
not a leading man. He's bad box office. And we can only assume he
hasn't taken advantage of offers from worried directors like Steven
Spielberg to help him improve his ``I Walked With a Zombie''
speaking style.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles also makes Gore a juicy target for the Republicans.
The man who ``reinvents'' himself ``at every turn,'' according to
Bush, is going to the capital of reinvention to reinvent himself
yet again.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, W. extolled simple Midland values _ humility,
spirituality, a sense of community and an impatience with pretense.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will give his speech amid Hollywood values _ out-of-control
egos, blatant materialism, a dog-eat-dog ethos and a devotion to
pretense.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who hopes to win by excoriating louche Clinton values,
summed up the president this way: ``So many talents, so much charm,
such great skill. But in the end, to what end? So much promise, to
no great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   What better way to describe Hollywood?

COMMENTARY: DON ' T ASK ALAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Onstage, the song and dance went perfectly. Offstage, however,
George W. Bush's top economic adviser flubbed his lines. On
Wednesday The Financial Times ran an interview with Lawrence
Lindsey in which the former Fed official made much of his
relationship with Alan Greenspan, and appeared to claim that
Greenspan endorses Bush's economic plan. By the next day Lindsey
was furiously back-pedaling, conceding that he had in fact never
discussed the plan with the Fed chairman, and further opining that
``It's not for Chairman Greenspan to endorse one tax plan or
another tax plan, or to endorse one candidate or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably Lindsey _ perhaps a bit rattled by analysts at
Goldman Sachs and elsewhere who have warned that Bush's proposed
tax cuts will drive up interest rates _ was just being sloppy. One
hopes that from now on the Republican team will defend its plans on
the merits _ starting, in the case of Social Security, by
explaining what the plan actually is _ instead of trying to
reassure us that everything is OK because Uncle Alan approves. And
yet there is something more to this story than Lindsey's blooper.
If you ask me, we're hearing too much these days about Greenspan's
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, after all, holds a position that must be filled with
great discretion, because he has a degree of autonomy that is
peculiar in a democratic polity. Neither Congress nor the president
can tell Greenspan what to do: he is a power unto himself.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for that special status. Monetary policy
presents politicians with dangerous temptations _ for example, to
pump up the economy just before an election. To protect themselves
from those temptations, even countries where the central bank used
to take orders from the finance ministry, like Britain and Japan,
have chosen (after hard-learned lessons) to have independent
monetary policy boards.
</P>
<P>
   And no central bank has justified its independence as thoroughly
as the Fed. Greenspan has been lucky to preside over an era when
everything has gone right with the U.S. economy, but he has made
the most of that luck, letting growth rip without reviving
inflation. And twice _ in 1987 and 1998 _ he calmed markets at a
time when a financial meltdown seemed imminent. It's no surprise
that his opinions are sought on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the problem: if the Fed is to be exempt from normal
political control, it must itself be scrupulously nonpolitical, if
only for its own sake. Stuff happens: it's a safe bet that one of
these years the Fed _ perhaps under Greenspan, perhaps under his
successor _ will make a big mistake. If it is perceived as an
institution that carefully respects its limits, that mistake will
be forgiven. But if the Fed chairman has come to be perceived as
just another political player, trying to influence policy in areas
that have nothing to do with his brief, the cries of ``Who elected
him?'' will be hard to answer.
</P>
<P>
   So I get uneasy when I see Greenspan weighing in on issues that
seem remote from his job description. For example, what was he
doing testifying in favor of normal trade relations with China? I
happen to agree with him on the issue _ but trade policy is a long
way from monetary policy, and he should have stayed out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the response to Lindsey's faux pas was inappropriate.
According to Greenspan's spokesman, his ``preference is for high or
rising surpluses,'' but ``if growing surpluses become politically
infeasible to defend, he would prefer that they be allocated to tax
cuts rather than to spending initiatives.'' I guess the first part
of that is OK _ since monetary policy and fiscal policy are
interdependent, it's legitimate for the Fed chief to recommend
fiscal restraint. But decisions about whether surpluses should be
used to cut taxes or provide benefits _ should we eliminate the
estate tax or provide the elderly with drug coverage? _ are surely
matters for the electorate, not for unelected monetary technocrats.
</P>
<P>
   If and when Greenspan becomes a private citizen, his views on
such issues will and should be heard. But as the chairman of the
Fed, he has to be careful: he must avoid any hint that he is
overstepping the boundaries of his position.

<P>
   &UR; COMMENTARY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VECSEY-COLUMN (Undated) _ They busted Robert Brennan in the
shower. It was a gambit right out of ``The Sopranos,'' collaring a
man when he is most vulnerable, soaping himself and singing ``Con
Te Partiro,'' and thinking he's a regular Andrea Boccelli. After he
was dried and dressed and escorted _ polite term _ to headquarters,
Brennan, once a very huge name in thoroughbred racing and
investment circles, was charged with criminal fraud. And none other
than Bill Parcells posted bail. By George Vecsey.
</P>
<P>
   LIPSYTE-COLUMN (Undated) _ Despite the moralizing monologues of
marketers and medievalists (Muggles all), arguing that the Harry
Potter books are Christian, anti-Christian, Freudian, Jungian,
traditional, New Age, their enormous success is obviously based on
Jock Culture. There are striking similarities between Quidditch in
the Harry Potter series and sports in the Chip Hilton books of 50
years ago. By Robert Lipsyte.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-ARATON-COLUMN (Undated) _ It is not as if George W. Bush
needed to convince Bobby Valentine that he could manage the
country. Valentine is a registered Republican who last voted for
the other ticket in 1972, for George McGovern. No, Valentine made
it clear one day last week in his Shea Stadium office that he is a
W. man, all the way to November, the 1992 dismissal in Texas
notwithstanding. A look at the relationship between Mets manager
Bobby Valentine and the man who fired him as the Rangers manager,
George W. Bush. By Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DAY'S EVENTS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BBA-YANKEES-MARINERS (New York) _ Seattle at Yankees, 4:35 p.m.
By Buster Olney.
</P>
<P>
   RAC-JIM-DANDY (Saratoga, N.Y.) _ The $400,000 Jim Dandy for
3-year-olds. By Joe Drape.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FBN-REDSKINS-SNYDER (Ashburn, Va.) _ There are always stories
about Daniel Snyder, the Washington Redskins' owner. Some are true.
Some are tall tales. They swirl around him as if he were living an
Aesop fable. The moral of the stories is, well, mixed. He is a
savior, a braggart, a genius and the big bad wolf all wrapped up in
one. And he wants to win. Snyder, who took control of the Redskins
in the spring of 1999, is a poor loser, and because of that he
might be the best thing to happen to professional football in
years. By Mike Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-MIAMI (Undated) _ After several years of struggling, the
Miami Hurricanes are moving back toward the top of college
football. It is as if the Miami program has been totally
re-created. Butch Davis, the straight-talking former Dallas Cowboys
assistant, is entering his sixth season as the Hurricanes' head
coach, and he has worked very hard to eliminate any resemblance to
the renegade Miami teams that won national titles and had players
who talked as well as they played. By Dave Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ Lead item: The money is dwindling fast.
With one nine-player trade down and apparently none to go, many of
the alleged blockbuster deals are being committed to rumor. The
Great Free Agent Class of 2000 have almost all been signed, and the
Chicago Bulls are still wondering where everyone went. But Jerry
Krause can take heart. If Michael Jordan's old team does not pull
off a monster swap, survives yet another season of fan backlash and
saves its millions, the class of 2001 has much to offer. By Mike
Wise.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ Lead item: The quarterback soap operas
in San Francisco have been legendary, and while what happened
between Jeff Garcia and Steve Young may not make the top five, it
is still interesting. And around the league, both now and
historically, relationships between a starter and backup at
quarterback can often be tense. Other items include Ray Rhodes'
reappearance in Washington and players who dispel the players'
disturbing bad-boy image. By Mike Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ Lead item: A challenger for the
American League West championship and the leader in the AL
wild-card division, the Oakland Athletics are in Chicago this
weekend playing the team with the league's best record, then come
to New York for a three-game series with the Yankees that will end
the most rigorous segment of their 2000 schedule. The Athletics
will have played 10 successive series, a total of 30 games, against
teams with winning records. Will they have lived to tell about it?
Other items: The return of Carl Everett to the Red Sox and the
deal-happy Yankees' ability to hold onto highly-rated prospect
Alfonso Soriano. By Murray Chass.
</P>
<P>
   PERFECT-STORM (Undated) _ The sailor in `The Perfect Storm' got
a bad rap from the movie and the book. By Herb McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-LOBSTER (Undated) _ The lobster industry in Maine
hasn't been decimated like its counterpart in Long Island Sound,
but there are enough red flags about man-made contaminants up there
to cause profound unease and protest among state lobstermen and
community leaders. By Paul Molyneaux.

<P>
   By the evidence of flying headbutts, figure-four leglocks and
The People's Elbow, you might not see The Rock as a GOP kind of
guy. He is usually in black underwear, talking trash, wiggling
eyebrows as expressive as John Belushi's, in his role as the World
Wrestling Federation's hunkiest heel and its reigning champion.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was last week, not at a Wrestlemania or a
Smackdown, but at the Republican National Convention, which shared
two things with the WWF: The event was scripted and the outcome was
never in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock was ``in the house,'' as he likes to say, to deliver
unto the conventioneers a voter registration message and to
introduce House Speaker Dennis Hastert, a former wrestling coach,
strictly an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you smell what The Rock is cooking?'' he asked, a
trademark question (translation: ``If you know what I mean''),
which he first uttered at Wrestlemania XIV in 1998, sitting next to
Gennifer Flowers, who was interviewing him.
</P>
<P>
   See, The Rock  &UR; is &LR;  political. And politic. He  &UR; never &LR;  labeled
the convention crowd at First Union Center in Philadelphia a
``bunch of jabronis'' (that is to say, nobodies).
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen million eligible voters watch The Rock every single
week,'' he said with an oratorial fervor calculated to inspire
young Republicans and voters everywhere to perform their civic
duty. But were they watching? Do the GOP's demos mix with the WWF's
young male viewers? Only if they were hoping to see a steel-cage
death match pitting the tag team of George W. and Poppy Bush
against John McCain and Jesse ``The Governor'' Ventura, who
wrestled when The Rock was a mere pebble.
</P>
<P>
   Just who is The Rock?
</P>
<P>
   His real name is Dwayne Johnson, a 28-year-old, third-generation
wrestler, who is half Samoan and half African-American.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock, a thoroughly rotten character, is short for his former
nom de mat, Rocky Maivia, a nice guy who finished last _ like
Michael Dukakis. He speaks of himself almost entirely in the first
person. As in, ``The Rock says . . .''
</P>
<P>
   His autobiography, ``The Rock Says . . .'' (Regan Books), was on
the New York Times best-seller list for 20 weeks, falling six weeks
short of ``Have a Nice Day!'' by another another wrestler, Mick
Foley (a k a Mankind and Cactus Jack).
</P>
<P>
   In his 283-page memoir, he writes about why The Rock is The
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   His irresistible personality: ``The Rock is charismatic, funny,
smart . . . and completely over the top in terms of ego and
arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   His modest ego: ``With his sculpted physique, honey-brown
complexion, razor-trimmed sideburns and piercing gaze, The Rock
looks like a million bucks _ which is appropriate since that's
almost exactly what The People's Champion will earn for his
evening's labor.''
</P>
<P>
   His serendipitous character development: ``The quirks and
peculiarities evolved organically. I never said, `Hmmm, I need a
gimmick. I need an angle, I need . . . I need . . .  &UR; I need an
eyebrow &LR; ! And then _ I know! _ I'll take the most basic maneuver in
wrestling and turn it into the most electrifying move in wrestling,
and I'll call it  &UR; The People's Elbow &LR; ! Yeah, that's the plan!'''
</P>
<P>
   His ingenious mission statement: ``It's funny, I always like to
say now that The Rock is the kind of guy who won't kiss a baby and
he'll  &UR; throw &LR;  an old lady across the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, get out and vote! &QL;

   DENVER _ Back in 1832, the Anti-Masons were growing so concerned
about secret societies and ruling elites in young America that they
ran a candidate for president, William Wirt of Maryland, a former
U.S. attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Wirt failed to arouse much interest, scoring less than 8 percent
of the popular vote in an election won by Andrew Jackson. But the
erstwhile lawyer started a trend that has continued to this day,
offering voters a third presidential option to the major political
parties of the time. In every presidential election since then but
one (1864), a Whig, Free Soiler, Abolitionist, Greenback or some
such third-party standard bearer has won votes. This year, it's
Ralph Nader for the Green Party and either Pat Buchanan or John
Hagelin for the Reform Party, which holds its convention this week
in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But just what role can these mavericks hope to play? The
historical answer appears to be a small, but occasionally important
one. About the best any of them did was Theodore Roosevelt in 1912,
when he broke from the Republican Party of President William H.
Taft to run as the candidate of the Bull Moose party and won 27
percent of the popular vote. That was good enough to get Woodrow
Wilson into the White House for the Democrats. Similarly, many
Republicans still blame Ross Perot for siphoning off conservative
voters in 1992 and helping Bill Clinton defeat President George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In general, third-party presidential candidates fare better when
they have something to rail against. Martin Van Buren, of the Free
Soil party, did so against slavery in 1848, as did Perot against
globalism and the loss of American jobs. Both lost, but like other
third-party insurgents, they played a vital role in the political
system by expanding it and maybe even preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Communist Party in the 1930s,'' said Richard
Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, a publication that follows
election laws. ``By running thousands of candidates for state and
local offices, it served as a safety valve, directing their efforts
into the system instead of bombing and rioting.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, third parties have also called attention to issues
ignored or avoided by the major parties of the day. The Reform
Party helped to make the economy such an important issue during the
1992 election that, shortly after his victory, President Clinton
held an economic summit meeting. Much the same thing appears to be
at work this year. Nader and Buchanan, who agree on little else,
have each asserted that the Republican and Democratic parties have
effectively merged into a political corpocracy, in which both
parties feed at the trough of big business campaign contributions
and ignore the needs of ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a longtime consumer advocate who won almost 700,000 votes
in the 1996 election, has taken particularly derisive aim this year
at the major party candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, calling them, ``Tweedledee and
Tweedledum,'' although he does not specify who is which.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two outsiders this year, Nader is poised to have the
greater impact on the election. Gnawing at Gore from the left,
where he has considerable support among environmentalists and union
workers, Nader has polled as high as 10 percent in some states,
which could be enough to throw one or two of them to Bush. If that
should happen in California, where Nader is popular among
disaffected Democrats, Gore would have little chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats might consider sending a few million in campaign
funds to Buchanan, a far-right conservative who is polling so low
these days that it hurts Gore by not providing a counterbalance to
Nader. As an ardent opponent of free trade, abortion rights and
U.S. military involvement abroad, Buchanan might have earned wider
support if Bush had chosen a more moderate running mate than Dick
Cheney. But Cheney's past positions on national defense, trade,
abortion and other issues are close enough to Bush's _ and
Buchanan's _ that Buchanan cannot claim to be the conservative
alternative to a moderate Republican ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's one advantage over Bush, as Steven J. Rosenstone,
dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota,
said in an interview, is an outsized personality that allows him to
be ``more vociferous, more outrageous,'' calling attention to
issues he cares about.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be enough this year. In his 1996 book, ``Third
Parties in America,'' Rosenstone wrote, ``Most importantly, third
parties are expressions of discontent with the major parties and
their candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   With the nation enjoying economic prosperity and the world
largely at peace, neither Nader nor Buchanan seems likely to
persuade the electorate that the major party candidates cannot
steer a proper course into the future.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Rosenstone contends, the best third-party leaders
have ``magnetic personalities'' and voting for them is motivated by
any of three factors: ``major party deterioration, attractive
third-party candidates who present a viable alternative to the
major party nominees and an influx of voters with no loyalty to the
two major parties.'' Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota arguably fits
this description.
</P>
<P>
   While it does not appear those factors apply enough this year to
draw more more than marginal attention to Nader or Buchanan (whose
opponent Hagelin has not even registered on recent national polls),
there is some evidence to suggest that Americans increasingly enjoy
having political options. The last two presidential elections were
the first consecutive pair since 1856 and 1860 in which alternative
parties have won as much as 10 percent of the popular vote. To some
political experts, that portends a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're getting more like the British system, where 15
to 20 percent of the votes, as a matter of course, are cast for
other parties,'' Winger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing that happen all over the world,'' he said. ``But
America remains the anomaly. We have this huge, terrifically
diverse country where most people are still just voting for two
parties. But I think it's changing.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FROM RACING TO HOUSE ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They busted him in the shower. It was a gambit right out of
``The Sopranos,'' collaring a man when he is most vulnerable,
soaping himself and singing ``Con Te Partiro,'' and thinking he's a
regular Andrea Boccelli.
</P>
<P>
   After he was dried and dressed and escorted _ polite term _ to
headquarters, Robert Brennan, once a very huge name in thoroughbred
racing and investment circles, was charged with criminal fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that in 1995 Brennan cashed in $500,000 in
gambling chips but did not turn the money over to a trustee, who
had been appointed after Brennan had declared bankruptcy a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan has denied the charge, and several friends of his,
including a former football coach by the name of Parcells, sprung
for the bail of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   People are loyal to Bob Brennan, including Dennis Diaz, who in
1985 opted for a $2 million bonus to race the Kentucky Derby
champion he owned, Spend a Buck, in an arriviste event labeled the
Jersey Derby at the race track Brennan owned, Garden State Park,
rather than honor the tradition of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Despite thumbing his long and handsome nose at the
establishment, Spend a Buck wound up earning $3,552,704, the
highest annual income ever in racing at that point, earned the
Eclipse Award as Horse of the Year, and then retired.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz was busy monitoring the stock market from his Florida home
Friday, but he found time to speak well of Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no relationship other than in racing that year,'' Diaz
hastened to note. ``He was a heckuva nice guy, a very nice person,
candid and honest. I had no bad experience with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read a story about him on the Internet, and that's really
all I know, but I'm just sorry he's going through whatever he's
going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough after 15 years, but Diaz surely cannot forget the
buzz when Brennan came courting in his helicopter. There was an
exciting whiff of marginality to Brennan's penny-stock dealing,
more specific than the whispers that followed another charmer named
Jay Gatsby to his new digs in East Egg.
</P>
<P>
   Greed has been around for a long time, but there are moments
when it seems to be getting worse _ in the houses of cards of the
dot.com world, the manic faces of Wall Street traders, the feeding
frenzy of Manhattan apartment speculators, the scorched-earth zeal
of bankers, lawyers, realtors and developers who would squeeze
gauche little houses onto corners of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brennan was the spiritual godfather of those pests
who call us at home with stock offers. He made it sound almost
patriotic, proclaiming ``Come grow with us,'' as if he were some
kind of latter-day Franklin or Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a federal judge in New York called Brennan ``a big
crook'' for his actions with First Jersey Securities, then a symbol
of opulence, now quite terminally defunct, along with the
aspirations and savings of his followers.
</P>
<P>
   This was the fellow who was going to transform racing, a sport
particularly open to new blood because all it takes is one good
year at the various gaming tables of life to buy a horse or even a
racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, like Diaz, knew he would never be accepted by the
crusty racing establishment, so he played on twisted populist urges
like a Trump of the Swampland. Talking about being one of nine
children, growing up in an apartment in Newark, he called racing
``an elitist sport,'' saying he wanted to make it ``clean, healthy
and wholesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Often he said, ``In this country we can still dream.''
</P>
<P>
   His dream was to land his noisy helicopter smack in the middle
of the 1985 Belmont, which he had scorned by leaving Spend a Buck
home. They waved him off, telling him to land on the fringe of the
complex, but later that day he proclaimed how much he was doing for
racing by subverting the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' he lectured, ``what we're doing is a great argument
for a race track run by the private sector, rather than a
quasi-governmental agency.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added, ``I don't believe in accepting mediocrity just
because it's always been accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded good for a month or two, but eventually he went back
to his real life. This is the first time Brennan has been charged
with a crime, investigators being cautious about indictments in the
P.T. Barnum sucker-born-every-minute world of penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan is not the first sports official to run afoul of the
law. In recent years, Bruce McNall, the man who owned Wayne
Gretzky, so to speak, has gone away for improperly dealing in
valuable coins and John Spano, a temporary owner of the Islanders,
went to jail for being a wannabe millionaire. And one recalls the
campaign contribution problems of a certain George M. Steinbrenner
III, who ultimately required a pardon from President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Several executives in Salt Lake City are in big trouble for
greasing delegates of the International Olympic Committee. In
Australia, Olympic officials were funneling tickets to friends. In
soccer, South Africa recently lost a close election to Germany for
the right to hold the 2006 World Cup, when one delegate abstained,
extremely suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   Given his gall, Robert Brennan would have been right at home in
international sport. In calling for high bail, one assistant U.S.
attorney cited Brennan's expensive tastes, his trips by private
jets and helicopters, and allegations he has money hidden overseas.
There was even talk of a French girlfriend, which means he must be
guilty of something.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brennan is home in New Jersey, presumably tethered by his
high bail, courtesy of his friends, including the football coach.
Who wants Bill Parcells mad at him for skipping bail? For the
moment, Robert Brennan is back to taking showers without getting
busted, and that's progress.

SPORTS COLUMN: VALENTINE AND BUSH, A BOND FORGED THROUGH A FIRING 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not as if George W. Bush needed to convince Bobby
Valentine that he could manage the country. Valentine is a
registered Republican who last voted for the other ticket in 1972,
for George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   No, Valentine made it clear one day last week in his Shea
Stadium office that he is a W. man, all the way to November, the
1992 dismissal in Texas notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were third, two games behind Oakland, which wound up
winning the division,'' Valentine said, his this-is-between-us
smile tempting you to read between the lines. ``But there were all
these higher expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were 45-41 at the time, it was only July, but
Valentine was in his eighth year with a team that had never won its
division. His retrospective, seen from the high ground of a
better-paying job and another playoff race, is that ``they probably
needed to make a change, a little acceleration, even if it didn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Bush, who inherited Valentine when he became the
Rangers' managing partner in 1989, didn't have some coach or
functionary stick his head into Valentine's office and suggest he
pack up, as another George with Republican Party ties has been
known to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I always thought was different than what I expected was
that he worked within the structure,'' Valentine said of Bush. ``I
figured he would be the one to say, `OK, we have a five-game losing
streak, so we're going to wear a different color uniform today.' He
didn't. That is, he recognized that there were part-owners, a team
president, a general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   So Bush had Tom Grieve, the g.m. and Valentine's good friend,
break the news, then summoned Valentine into his office, where the
future governor said, ``If you have any complaints, I want to hear
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone gives you a closed-end statement, what are you
going to say?'' Valentine said. ``I think what I did say was, `I
understand what you're doing, but I don't agree.' And after that,
what I always appreciated was that we spent a lot more time talking
about family, about more important things.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine never did learn if his firing was a Grieve idea that
Bush agreed with or a Bush idea that Grieve had no choice but to
agree with. He settled on its being a ``collective decision,''
which made him more comfortable when the hotel room telephone rang
in Pittsburgh in May at 7:30 a.m. and the candidate said, ``I've
got a meeting this morning, but let's work out when I get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, it turned out, was in town to make peace with John McCain
after their bitter primary campaign. The governor and the manager
hit the weights, just as they used to in the Rangers' clubhouse
before the players would come in. They had lunch, Bush seemingly
more interested in the Mets than in McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, that was another thing that surprised Valentine about Bush.
He was never a sports-talk-radio caller disguised as an owner, not
the type to suggest they trade two utility infielders and his
presidential father's autograph for Don Mattingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually immersed himself in the game, in the organization,
from A ball on up,'' Valentine said. ``Sometimes it would be a
little scary. He would ask if we could use some guy on another
club's bench who really could have filled the need of a
curveball-hitting pinch-hitter. I'd look at Grieve and say, `Did
you tell him that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really liked about him was that he didn't control
conversations. He'd show off his intelligence most with his wit. He
listened a lot but he had a wonderful presence. When he did say
something, it was like E.F. Hutton, and he was usually outside the
status quo. If I had a five-man rotation, he would say, `Have you
thought about going with a sixth starter in the hot weather?'
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when we were losing, not drawing and some of
the investors were worried about the return on their dollar. I just
felt he always knew how to act, that he had good judgment. He knew
the difference between right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Before starting their current road swing through Arizona and
Houston, Bush country, Valentine said he was eager to watch Bush's
acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Philadelphia last
Thursday night. People have been asking him all the time, he said,
why they should vote for Bush, but he doesn't want to sound like
some cable network partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the man better than I know the candidate,'' Valentine
said.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, like Valentine, was an unconventional baseball man,
and a political conservative who canned him with compassion. &QL;

are these: ``Mount your brooms!''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Quidditch. Faster than basketball, rougher than hockey and
trickier than soccer, all of which it resembles, this aerial game
also includes elements of baseball and polo. Each of J.K. Rowling's
four best-sellers features at least one important contest, be it an
intramural match or the International World Cup, and a great deal
of skinny little Harry's acceptance at Hogwarts School for
Witchcraft and Wizardry is based on his talent for the game. No
wonder that Quidditch was ``in Harry's opinion, the best sport in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the moralizing monologues of marketers and medievalists
(Muggles all), arguing that the books are Christian,
anti-Christian, Freudian, Jungian, traditional, New Age, their
enormous success is obviously based (as is everything I discuss
these days) on Jock Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Jock Culture has charms and curses of its own. Struggling to
make choices for his third-year course schedule, ``the only thing
Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch.'' And Professor
Snape, once a classmate of Harry's late father of whom he is still
jealous, snarls: ``A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field
made him think he was a cut above the rest of us. Rules were for
lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in that world, schoolboy sports memories never die. Not
even magic can protect you from the resentments, shaming, violence
of Jock Culture or promise you its heroism, cooperation and fair
play. And Quidditch has all of it.
</P>
<P>
   As most readers of a certain age now know, Quidditch is simple
to understand and difficult to play. For starters, you need to fly
a broomstick. The game is played way, way above the rim. There are
seven to a side, girls and boys together. Each team has a keeper
defending its three hoops on 50-foot poles. Three chasers on each
team pass the red soccer-ball-sized quaffle back and forth until
one puts it through an opposing hoop for 10 points. Meanwhile, the
two beaters on each team are batting two lively black balls called
bludgers away from their teammates and at their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The team star is the seeker, gliding and diving after the golden
snitch, a tiny hummingbird of a winged ball. Once the snitch is in
the seeker's grip, the team gets 150 points and the game is over.
It is possible to capture the snitch and still lose, which provides
the game's bit of strategy. Harry, of course, is a seeker, his
natural talent discovered at 11 in an elementary broomstick class
in the first book, ``The Sorcerer's Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Quidditch can be as corrupt and political as the Olympics. There
are Quidditch hooligans and dirty play. (There are 700 ways of
committing a foul, although the last time all 700 were called was
in 1473; 'tis an old game.) Harry's arm was broken in ``The Chamber
of Secrets'' by a doctored bludger. Top-of-the-line equipment is
essential. Harry moved smartly up from a Cleansweep to a Nimbus
2000 to a Firebolt broomstick in ``The Prisoner of Azkaban,'' and
his game improved dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   One might think that in the heart of every Harry Potter book is
a Chip Hilton book trying to break out.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Hilton, as readers of a certain age know, is the hero of 23
books written from 1948 to 1966 under the byline of a well-known
coach of that era, Clair Bee. Grosset &AMP; Dunlap sold more than 2
million copies of the series before it went out of print, hardly
Harry Potter numbers but respectable for books directed at teen-age
boys, notorious nonreaders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Broadman &AMP; Holman, a Christian publishing house in
Nashville, Tenn., began reissuing the Hilton books. Bee's daughter
and son-in-law, who are high school teachers, have updated some of
the language. Valley Falls now has computers and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   But the encapsulated world still exists. For sports-mad boys of
40 and 50 years ago, the Hilton books offered a world as magical as
the Potter oeuvre, a world of special rules, languages, rituals,
friendships, dangers, fears, in which children grow into
adolescents and learn about becoming adults.
</P>
<P>
   Like Harry, Chip is following in the footsteps of an athletic
father who died heroically. Chip is being raised by a single mom,
who loves him deeply; Harry is sustained, especially in
confrontations with the evil You-Know-Who, by the love of his dead
parents. And like Harry, who is supported by Ron and Hermione, Chip
has devoted pals like Soapy and Biggie. Both boys are famous in
their worlds, although Harry is also rich.
</P>
<P>
   The all-wise Valley Falls coach, Henry ``Rock'' Rockwell, and
the all-wise Hogwarts Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, are both
devoted to their students, frequently under attack by bad elements
and more concerned with safety and growth than winning. Both would
agree with Dumbledore's ``It is our choices, Harry, that show what
we truly are, far more than our abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   (It should be noted that the new version of ``Hoop Crazy''
includes a foreword by Bob Knight, an avowed Hilton fan, who as a
youngster found in the books ``the most meaningful and priceless
examples of what is right and fair about life.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Potter books are more realistic than the Hilton books
regarding parental pressure, fear of failure, mean teachers, hazing
and bullying, and such childhood hexes as acne, crooked teeth and
shyness with the opposite sex. As delicious as the Quidditch scenes
are in the Potter books (I dream of scrawny Viktor Krum performing
the Wrongski Feint for Bulgaria against Ireland in the World Cup in
``The Goblet of Fire''), one goes to the Hilton books for game
action, often with diagrams. There is much to learn about athletic
training and tactics in both series, but given the dearth of
Quidditch fields in America, the Hilton books may be more
practical. Then again, their Manichean take on Good and Evil is not
always helpful these days.
</P>
<P>
   And herein lies the basic difference, beyond wit, depth and
style. The J.K. Rowling character that Chip Hilton most resembles
is the handsome, hard-working, loyal and honest Cedric Diggory, a
Quidditch star who is so sporting that he shares information with
Harry though they are competitors. Cedric is universally loved at
Hogwarts. He's the kind of boy who used to get his own series.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric dies.

THE MIAMI HURRICANES, AND PERHAPS THEIR SWAGGER, ARE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE CALDWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Miami Hurricanes are back. Tell them that at your own risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to go back to old times,'' Dan Morgan, a senior
middle linebacker, said, practically scowling.
</P>
<P>
   They like to think they walk with a swagger that is different
than the old Miami swagger. They have made it back near the top of
the college football polls by struggling, which the old Miami teams
never had to do during that run of four national titles during the
late 1980s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   These Hurricanes have overcome the transgressions of the old
Miami teams _ transgressions that cost the program 31 scholarships
and too much time _ and this Miami team does not seem eager to heap
new transgressions atop old transgressions. All these Hurricanes
want to do is to beat teams like Florida State and Virginia Tech
for the first time in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if the Miami program has been totally re-created. Butch
Davis, the straight-talking former Dallas Cowboys assistant, is
entering his sixth season as the Hurricanes' head coach, and he has
worked very hard to eliminate any resemblance to the renegade Miami
teams that won national titles and had players who talked as well
as they played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can go out and talk a good game,'' the senior wide
receiver Reggie Wayne said. ``We want to go out and play a good
game, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that the Hurricanes have abandoned
trash-talking. This Miami team _ which has a full complement of 85
players on scholarship, returns 14 starters and finds itself in
just about every preseason college football top 10 _ has amassed so
much talent that the players simply do not want to mess up a good
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see us in a very positive light right now,'' Davis
said. ``Maybe this year, it's not based on the past. Maybe it's
because we have enough athletes to put ourselves in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The right tackle Joaquin Gonzalez, a junior, said this is the
first time in his collegiate career that the Hurricanes have felt
some pressure to accomplish something big. Gonzalez said Davis told
them to behave as if they had been there before, but the fact is,
Miami has not had a team of national-championship caliber for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Miami lost 31 scholarships because of NCAA sanctions in 1995.
The Hurricanes, down to 58 scholarship players, finished 5-6 in
1997, Davis' third year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an eye-opener,'' said Gonzalez, then a redshirt
freshman. ``We had been living off the Miami legend _ hiding behind
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis figured the best way to deal with that facade was to get
rid of it. He instituted rules, and lots of them. His players,
figuring the old way did not work, bought into it.
</P>
<P>
   Two key players missed a mandatory study hall before Miami's
1998 game against UCLA _ Davis suspended them. He hired a new
strength coach. He has supplemented the wide-open passing game that
made Miami famous in favor of a no-nonsense running attack.
</P>
<P>
   With such an emphasis, Davis has accumulated almost too much
backfield talent. The Hurricanes enter the season with four
excellent running backs: Clinton Portis, James Jackson, Jarrett
Payton (Walter Payton's son) and Najeh Davenport. Miami has so much
talent in the backfield that Davis said, jokingly, ``We're going to
run the wishbone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Kelly, the quarterback who led the Hurricanes to a
stunning victory over Ohio State in the 1999 season opener, has
left the program to pursue a professional baseball career with the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays. But Davis was prepared there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly sustained knee and shoulder injuries late in the season,
giving Miami a chance to groom Ken Dorsey, a 6-foot-5-inch
sophomore. Dorsey completed nearly 62 percent of his passes and
finished with a better quarterback efficiency rating than Kelly.
Dorsey started the last three games of the season, all lopsided
victories for the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lessens some of the anxiety and some of the questions you
have with a new quarterback,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a heart like a lion,'' Santana Moss, a senior wide
receiver who could become a Heisman Trophy candidate, said of
Dorsey. ``But he's a young dude, too. We'll have our arms around
him like he's our little brother.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the way the Hurricanes got through the tough times. Many
of them decided to come to Miami because they had been Hurricanes'
fans in the old days.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, the linebacker, said, ``I wanted to be one of the people
who brought the program back to prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   The players quickly figured the only way to do that was to
listen to Davis, 48, who had been an assistant at Miami under Jimmy
Johnson from 1984 to 1988. Davis wants them to play with emotion,
but they knew showboating and taunting were out. Moss said they are
expected to be men first on the field, then players.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-6 season showed them that they needed to work harder in
the off-season. They were rewarded with a 9-3 season in 1998 in
which they ruined the national championship hopes of UCLA in the
final regular-season game. They whipped Ohio State in the 1999
season opener, then rebounded from tough losses to Penn State, East
Carolina and Florida State by winning seven of their last eight
games. The only loss in that stretch was to Virginia Tech, and they
think they learned something from that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it brought us together,'' the senior defensive back Al
Blades said. ``Now we know what the cost is. I think we work as
hard as any team in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the old Miami players felt that way, too, but the
Hurricanes never made a point of publicizing their work ethic. Now
Davis anchors his defense around a soft-spoken-yet-ferocious player
like Morgan, whom Davis said ``is easy to hold up as a role
model.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during the tougher times, Miami was able to sign most of
the top high school players from South Florida and many from
elsewhere in the state. But now Miami can sign national caliber
players from outside the state again. Davis can even be picky. He
said he does not need disciplined players as much as he needs
players with character.
</P>
<P>
   One freshman, D.J. Williams of De La Salle High in Concord,
Calif., could start right away at weakside linebacker at Miami.
Williams is the kind of player who might not have given Miami much
consideration early in Davis' tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they wanted to go through the perception that
the program was going to take a dip,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were around for the dip seem to be glad they stayed.
Blades said any school is subject to lean times. In some ways, the
tough times make the good times all that much more enjoyable, even
if these Hurricanes do not want these good times to be like the old
good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``There definitely have been some growing pains,'' Gonzalez
said, ``but you definitely have to go through some things to learn
about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne said, ``Talking, to me, is nothing if you lose.''  &QL;

ELECTRICITY: GET IT WHILE IT LASTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   For as long as anyone can remember, reliable, cheap electricity
has been taken for granted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore, at least not in California.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the nation's most populous state _ and the
world's seventh-largest economy _ decided to deregulate its
electric industry. New power generators would compete for retail
customers with established utilities, and businesses and consumers
could choose their power suppliers. The competition would lower
everyone's prices.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the theory. Things have not worked out so well
in practice. This summer, power bills have doubled in San Diego,
rolling blackouts have hit San Francisco, and the state has
repeatedly cut off some big customers to protect the rest of its
power grid. The power supply is near collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have in San Diego is an unnatural disaster, a man-made
storm unleashed by the state and federal governments,'' said
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action
Network, a 42,000-member group in San Diego. ``We're hearing
panicked calls from customers saying `I can pay my electric bill,
or I can pay my rent in full.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone agrees that deregulation shoulders a significant
amount of blame for the crisis. The reason is that with
deregulation looming in the mid-1990s, the state's utilities were
afraid to build new plants, while independent power producers only
began planning plant construction two years ago, when the state's
voters confirmed their support for deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with demand rising unexpectedly fast, the state is
critically short of power. And for at least the next two years, the
soonest any significant capacity can be added, there is no easy
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The squeaking gets tighter in 2001,'' said Daniel Nix, deputy
director for energy information at the California Energy
Commission, a state agency that licenses new power plants and
predicts energy demand. If next summer is even slightly hotter than
normal, ``there is a good chance we would have inadequate
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaming deregulation for the current crisis, however, leaves the
more important longterm questions unanswered. Can deregulation
solve the problems it has created, or should it be repealed? And
does California's experience presage other crises as deregulation
moves forward nationwide?
</P>
<P>
   Independent power producers and electricity traders, whose
future depends on deregulation, argue that California is an
anomaly. They say it faces an exceptionally tight power supply
situation as a result of fast economic growth throughout the West
and the state's traditional reluctance to build new plants.
Moreover, they say, power companies are moving quickly to build
plants throughout California and in neighboring states, and the
crisis will subside within a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A deregulated world is the right market for electricity,''
said Ron Walter, senior vice president at Calpine, an independent
power producer in San Jose that is building three plants.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the state's energy commission has been asked to
approve the construction of 14 power plants. Combined with four
already under construction, that would add more than 11,000
megawatts of power, 20 percent of the state's total peak demand.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the response has been similar, said Jeffrey K.
Skilling, president of Enron, the Houston company that is the
world's leading trader of electricity and natural gas. Enron
reports that power companies have announced plans to build nearly
240,000 megawatts in new North American capacity, increasing supply
by more than one-quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within two or three years, the problem will be fixed,''
Skilling said. ``Let the market do its thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But regulators and some other utilities are less sanguine.
Electricity is a unique commodity, they say. First, power
consumption varies widely, with summer peak demand 20 percent or
more higher than average. So meeting peak loads requires the heavy
expense of building many ``peakers,'' plants that run only a few
hours each year, when demand is highest.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is no substitute for electricity. It undrgirds
modern life, and while demand can be marginally reduced by briefly
closing factories, turning off air conditioning and elevators in
office buildings, even those slight reductions cause significant
disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When oranges go up, when they double or triple or quadruple, I
eat apples,'' said Loretta Lynch, president of the California
Public Utilities Commission. ``when electricity goes up, I can't
avoid using it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, electricity is also ``supply inelastic.'' When all the
plants in a region are running at full steam, there is simply no
way to get more power.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors mean that as power demand approaches peak supply
in a deregulated market, generators can charge 10 or 100 times the
normal price for electricity and know that they will find takers.
With the possibility of windfall profits every time there is a hot
summer, the power producers have little incentive to build enough
plants to have a large reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, said Dr. Eric Hirst, an industry consultant who
supports deregulation, smaller reserves would result in lower
prices, because unnecessary plants would not be built. Meanwhile,
overall reliability for most customers will not be affected,
because companies like Enron will seek out customers willing to cut
demand for the few hours a year when supply is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ``big brother spread the cost of extra capacity
among all customers,'' Hirst said. ``We paid for that.''
</P>
<P>
   That explanation does not carry much water in California these
days, said state Sen. Steve Peace of San Diego, who helped write
California's deregulation legislation but is now calling for some
controls on prices. It ignores the huge price spikes that come if
demand runs too close to supply, the power to set prices held by a
small number of generators, and the importance of a reliable supply
of electricity for everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   And Peace notes that, while power companies and economists talk
of competition leading to lower bills, consumers want the stable
prices and reliability they have had for 50 years under regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole market on a national level suffers from an excess
of philosophical engagement and a deficiency of practical
management,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market can either prove that it's disciplined enough and
stable enough to address its problem. Or inevitably, whether it's
the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do, the political
system will cut them off at the pass.''`

in a deregulated market, generators can charge 10 or 100 times the
normal price for electricity and know that they will find takers.
With the possibility of windfall profits every time there is a hot
summer, the power producers have little incentive to build enough
plants to have a large reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, said Dr. Eric Hirst, an industry consultant who
supports deregulation, smaller reserves would result in lower
prices, because unnecessary plants would not be built. Meanwhile,
overall reliability for most customers will not be affected,
because companies like Enron will seek out customers willing to cut
demand for the few hours a year when supply is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, ``big brother spread the cost of extra capacity
among all customers,'' Hirst said. ``We paid for that.''
</P>
<P>
   That explanation does not carry much water in California these
days, said state Sen. Steve Peace of San Diego, who helped write
California's deregulation legislation but is now calling for some
controls on prices. It ignores the huge price spikes that come if
demand runs too close to supply, the power to set prices held by a
small number of generators, and the importance of a reliable supply
of electricity for everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   And Peace notes that, while power companies and economists talk
of competition leading to lower bills, consumers want the stable
prices and reliability they have had for 50 years under regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole market on a national level suffers from an excess
of philosophical engagement and a deficiency of practical
management,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market can either prove that it's disciplined enough and
stable enough to address its problem. Or inevitably, whether it's
the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do, the political
system will cut them off at the pass.''`

AN OWNER WITH ENEMIES, AND A PASSION TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. _ There are always stories about Daniel Snyder, the
Washington Redskins' owner. Some are true. Some are tall tales.
They swirl around him as if he were living an Aesop fable. The
moral of the stories is, well, mixed. He is a savior, a braggart, a
genius and the big bad wolf all wrapped up in one.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants to win. Snyder, who took control of the Redskins in
the spring of 1999, is a poor loser, and because of that he might
be the best thing to happen to professional football in years.
</P>
<P>
   No owner since Oakland's Al Davis or Dallas' Jerry Jones has
shaken up professional football like the 35-year-old Snyder, who
plans to outwork and outspend his competitors. This off-season he
undertook the most aggressive free-agent spree ever, paying $40
million in signing bonuses to assemble what amounts to an all-star
team. Because of free-agent pickups like Deion Sanders and Bruce
Smith, both future Hall of Famers, many in the league believe the
Redskins are the Super Bowl favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the National Football League has taken notice, not
only of Snyder's fat wallet, but also of his brashness, and some
say, his outright arrogance. Snyder may not be a renegade like
Davis, who sued his own league, and Jones, who sought to dismantle
the NFL's revenue-sharing system, but his aggressiveness is causing
the same kind of allergic reaction among his fellow owners. He
particularly irked some owners by being the first to charge fans
admission to training camp practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is true,'' Snyder said, ``I'm aggressive, I'm
entrepreneurial, I want to win. I want to win fast and now. All of
this is true, absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've run a lot of businesses and I've been very
rational,'' he said. ``And I've been in a lot of competitive
environments and this is just another competitive environment where
if you want to win you really need to be aggressive. If you're not,
you won't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Mara, the Giants' co-owner, who is in the Hall of
Fame, has said in the past that he is no fan of Jones, and during a
recent interview Mara made it clear he was not a member of the
Snyder fan club, either.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had met Snyder, a rival owner in the National
Football Conference East, Mara responded: ``Yes, we've met. I
wouldn't use the word charming with him, but he's been fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with a lot of what he has done, and I don't want
to get specific about what I don't like,'' said Mara, the first
owner to publicly criticize Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is entitled to do what he wants, because he paid $800
million for the team. A lot of us old fogies wish we had made as
much money as he has at that age. But I wonder if he is the type of
person who will only look out for himself, instead of the
well-being of the entire league.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought Snyder was a younger version of Jones,
Mara joked, ``Please don't say that.'' Then with a serious tone,
Mara said: ``Let's hope he doesn't become an older Jerry Jones.
That would be unfortunate. But I think he's headed in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara's comments were typical of those from other team owners,
many of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity, and illustrate
Snyder's plight. While trying to make the Redskins winners again,
he must be aggressive, but in doing so, he is angering many of the
people with whom he must coexist, partly because he goes against
some NFL traditions, partly because he has rubbed some the wrong
way with his cockiness. Only Davis and Jones are referred to with
the same kind of venom by the NFL's elite.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder represents a new breed of NFL owner. As millionaires get
younger, and more begin to buy their way into professional
football, they will move with the kind of urgency that made them so
rich so quickly. Snyder earned his first million by the time he was
20, and by 31, he was the youngest chief executive of a company on
the New York Stock Exchange. He is president of Snyder
Communications, a direct-marketing firm, and before there is a
speck of gray in his hair, he may have a Super Bowl ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins were once a model team in the glory days of Joe
Gibbs, but they have made it to the playoffs only twice since their
last Super Bowl appearance in 1992. Wanting the Redskins to shed
their veil of mediocrity, Snyder has turned the team upside down,
moving with all the tenderness of a thunderstorm. He has fired some
two dozen employees, including General Manager Charley Casserly.
The team's contract negotiator, Joe Mendes, quit late last month,
citing thee need to take a break. From what, he did not say, but to
work for Snyder, or to compete against him, requires skin as thick
as concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to the stories, told throughout the league, by
owners, coaches, general managers and former and current Redskins
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Like the one about Snyder yelling himself hoarse in dressing
down coach Norv Turner in the trainer's room immediately after a
loss at Dallas last October. Turner came out of the meeting
ashen-faced. Snyder, who said that jobs were on the line, added,
``I'm going to get my voice fixed, and then I'm going to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   During one practice, Snyder is said to have called one of the
team's personnel men a ``dumb idiot'' in front of other members of
the organization after the man made a derogatory remark about a
player Snyder liked. Snyder denied the story.
</P>
<P>
   And this off-season Washington was interested in Seattle wide
receiver Joey Galloway, but the Seahawks froze out the Redskins and
traded Galloway to NFC East rival Dallas. Incensed, Snyder, with
only one year of league experience, called Mike Holmgren, the
Seattle coach and general manager and a 20-year NFL veteran, the
story goes, and chewed him out.
</P>
<P>
   Truth or fiction? Holmgren refused to give details of his
conversation with Snyder. Snyder said only that the two men
``kidded each other pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   During one of his first league meetings, Snyder met the Detroit
Lions' vice chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., son of the team's
owner, and made an obnoxious remark about Ford's family business,
the automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said through a spokesman that he could not recall the
story. An owner who spoke on condition of anonymity said that he
was standing next to Ford and heard the conversation and that
Snyder did indeed say something that irritated Ford. Snyder called
the story ``total garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have done,'' Snyder said, ``has been twisted into
great pretzels. I don't go into the locker room before gams ever.
I don't stand on the sideline like Jerry Jones. I don't watch film
with the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories overshadow Snyder's contributions to his team. He
has unified a formerly divided front office and coaching staff. He
hired the talented Vinny Cerrato to replace Casserly. He increased
the number of blacks in the organization. He fixed a disgraceful
parking problem that caused fans to wait hours to get in and out of
the stadium he owns, FedEx Stadium, and he replaced substandard
practice fields.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, because of his sweat and more than $15 million out of
his pocket to finance the needed stadium changes, he has made
watching a Redskins game more enjoyable for fans, and the
organization more of a home for coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all he has made everyone accountable,'' said Bruce
Smith, a former Buffalo player, ``from the top to the bottom. As a
player you have to respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, his supporters say, has other positive attributes.
Because he grew up in a multicultural setting in suburban Maryland,
they say, he has an easier time relating to black team and league
officials, who often complain that some owners speak
condescendingly to them. One black league official said Snyder was
the first owner to ask him out for a beer.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is invaluable in another way _ he has what players call
juice. Today's NFL has no dynasties. And fascinating characters
like Mike Ditka, Lawrence Taylor and Refrigerator Perry are gone.
Stars such as John Elway, Dan Marino and Steve Young have retired.
Now some of the greatest football debates are about the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is giving the league personality, several owners
conceded, and a much-needed kick in the shin, by forcing everyone
else to work harder and to be more creative to keep up.
``Competition never hurt anybody,'' Mara said. ``The moves he is
making, yes, they hurt the league in a sense, but on the other
hand, it is good to shake things up every once in a while. The
worst thing is being comfortable, and he is disturbing our
comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder deserves credit for quickly building what looks to be a
championship-caliber team. In 1998, the season before Snyder took
over, the Redskins were 6-10. Last year they were 10-6 and won the
NFC East before losing in the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April, Washington drafted Penn State linebacker LaVar
Arrington ($34 million contract) and Alabama offensive tackle Chris
Samuels ($30 million); both are having excellent training camps and
will be starters. Snyder signed veterans Mark Carrier (five years,
$15 million), Jeff George (four years, $18 million), Smith (four
years, $23 million) and Sanders (seven years, $56 million).
</P>
<P>
   Snyder and his staff quickly assembled not just talent, but also
depth. Nothing quite like it has been done before. It is true that
eventually the signings may seriously affect the team's salary cap,
just as the San Francisco 49ers' maneuverings in the 1990's have
hurt them now. One owner who has analyzed Washington's cap contends
that after next season, the Redskins will have to do major salary
restructuring and dump players to stay within the cap, now $62.2
million. Snyder denied this.
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder is not afraid to take chances. There are teams that
are perennially stuck near the bottom of the standing but rarely
make aggressive moves to break out of the funk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Snyder can taint his positive efforts by going too far, the
same way Davis and Jones have before him. For example, Snyder, in
an attempt to market the Redskins brand beyond Washington, began
advertising in Baltimore, violating a gentleman's agreement not to
advertise in each other's market. David Modell, the Baltimore
Ravens' president, said the Ravens might retaliate with airplane
ads over the Redskins' training camp in Ashburn.
</P>
<P>
   No one should think Snyder is without supporters, however. He
said he had a good relationship with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue,
and just last week the Carolina owner, Jerry Richardson, visited
the Redskins' complex, observing the changes Snyder has made.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be surprised if several years from now, many teams are
charging fans to watch training camp practices. It is, after all, a
copycat league. ``Did you see that trophy case out there?'' Snyder
asked. ``My goal is to add as many trophies as I can. I plan on
being here a long time.''

<P>
   It's summertime and the living is easy, or at least it is
supposed to be. Every August, exhausted policy-makers, tired
traders and burnt-out journalists flee their high-powered jobs for
two weeks of R&AMP;R in the Hamptons, at Martha's Vineyard or on the
Maryland shore. Pity these poor power players; they're just looking
for a few days of sun and sand with the kids before returning to
the frenzy that will begin again the day after Labor Day. But if
the 1990s are any indication, August can be the cruelest month for
those who cherish international calm and stable currency markets.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in some ways, is worse than usual, if only because
the political conventions have put a major crimp in August
getaways, as they do every four years. But they cannot seriously be
considered in the same category as what has been happening in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the record for August crises in the last decade _ it
truly is a remarkable collection of calamities,'' said James
Steinberg, the recently departed deputy national security adviser
in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the mother of all August crises with Saddam's
invasion of Kuwait at the beginning of the decade in 1990,'' he
said, ``along with several other Iraqi provocations during
subsequent Augusts. There were also the embassy bombings in Africa,
various Balkan ordeals and the Atlanta Olympics terrorist bombing
in 1996.'' That last actually took place at the end of July, but
the reaction and investigation demanded attention well into August.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg's list covers various national security emergencies,
but it doesn't have to end there. Crises in the globalized
financial sector have also been striking with irritating regularity
in August, which was once synonymous with portfolio stability.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government defaulted on its debt in August 1998,
setting nerves on edge among money managers. The so-called
Committee to Save the World convened regularly by conference call
from vacation locales that summer, with Robert Rubin, who was then
the Treasury secretary, and Lawrence Summers, his deputy at the
time (and now his successor) holding the fate of the world in one
hand and a bonefishing rod and tennis racket, respectively, in the
other.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture is not all bleak. Advances in technology have
enabled crisis managers and journalists to communicate with
encryption or log on and file during even the most challenging
international crises. This can lead to unusual sightings on some of
the nation's beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a guy on a Hampton beach a few years ago who was
building a sand castle one minute with his daughter, and the next
was screaming at the top of his lungs into his cell phone that he
had to have the numbers on Nigerian debt immediately,'' said Dane
Neller, the CEO of the New York-based gourmet food chain, Dean &AMP;
Deluca. ``He used his daughter's little yellow shovel to transcribe
the financial figures in the sand, breaching the castle's moat in
the process.''
</P>
<P>
   James Adams, the very British former Washington correspondent
for the London Sunday Times, recalls a fellow becoming so engrossed
in an August article he was composing on a blanket on a beach in
Weekapaug, R.I., that he lost track of the advancing tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very messy business indeed,'' Adams said. Sand and
sea water are now more worrisome hazards to beach users with
technology than sharks or stinging jellyfish.
</P>
<P>
   However, sometimes a crisis demands more than simply phoning in.
For many power players in Washington and New York, the only thing
worse than a crisis in August that demands their attention is a
crisis in August that can somehow be managed or covered without
their direct participation. There is no greater shame for a true
insider than to arrive at a chic Martha's Vineyard dinner party
only to find that the competition has been urgently called back to
the city, while he or she is left to sunburn and stew about the
unfairness of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one key for any self-respecting crisis manager on
vacation is maintaining a flexible outlook that can be summed up in
two words: refundable tickets.
</P>
<P>
   One Washington spouse, asking not to be identified for fear of
jinxing this year's annual getaway, confided that ``during one
Middle East flare-up a few summers back, my husband insisted on
driving four hours back to the White House situation room for a
30-minute meeting at which most of the participants were wearing
either khakis or tennis togs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say,'' she added, ``we had a few Augusts back then
where we had a failure to recreate.''

<P>
   In a business culture that has long fixated ambivalently on the
image of computer wizards brewing technological revolution in their
garage, the back-story to the pair of digital copyright battles
being waged in federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster case in San Francisco involves a 19-year-old college
student who created a program allowing him to swap music files with
his friends. The program became so popular so fast that the major
record labels claim it has led to widespread music piracy,
threatening their ability to turn a profit and the incentive of
artists to create music.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD trial in New York began with a Norwegian high school
student who cracked the encryption program protecting Hollywood's
digitized movies from unauthorized copying. Leading movie studios
argue that unless a judge stops a Web site publisher from
distributing the 16-year-old's decryption code, they will soon
suffer the same fate as the record industry.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who you believe, these are either tales of David
vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim at the
establishment. But no matter which side you're on, both cases have
underscored the unprecedented ability of individuals armed with
digital technology to upset the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very much looking at a biological model of an
epidemic,'' said Esther Dyson, publisher of the technology
newsletter Release 1.0. ``On the Internet, a product doesn't
require a central host and it doesn't require central distribution,
it just spreads. It's new in business. It's been going on a long
time in viruses.''
</P>
<P>
   As more people connect to the Internet, with faster connections,
the information released on it takes on ever-greater momentum and
scale. Services like Napster are seen as only the beginning of a
technological siege for industries founded on traditional notions
of intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many Internet watchers, Dyson among them, believe that
companies that put information online, from music to books to
software, may have to resign themselves to relinquishing control
over that material. The fact that you copyrighted something simply
may no longer entitle you to control it or get paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an idea whose time has come,'' said John Perry Barlow,
the vice chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and author
of an essay ``The Economy of Ideas,'' which in 1994 predicted a
fundamental shift in the way intellectual property is valued.
``We're dealing with a profound historical shift in the economy
that has been enabled by technology.''
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially what happened in the Napster and DVD cases,
and though federal judges saw fit to issue injunctions in each
case, that may be irrelevant in the world of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling moments in the Napster saga came
between the time Judge Marilyn Patel issued a temporary injunction
effectively shutting down the service and the stay that was granted
not quite 48 hours later by a higher court. Despite Patel's clear
statement that Napster was likely to be found guilty of
contributing to copyright infringement, millions of individuals
swarmed to download music from the service, or learn about
alternative services that provide the means to swap music files.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the DVD decryption code patched together by Jon
Johansen in Norway has been posted on hundreds of Web sites besides
the one that Hollywood has taken to court, many of which say they
are simply upholding their right to share technology information.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, technology and its users are undermining
traditional institutions, while asserting a populist sense of what
is ethical that may well clash with what is legal. That has raised
questions that go well beyond the outcome of the court battles.
</P>
<P>
   What happens, for instance, if Patel in San Francisco and Judge
Lewis A. Kaplan in New York come down on the side of the
entertainment industry, but the distribution of both copyrighted
music and a computer code that cracks legally protected encryption
continues undeterred?
</P>
<P>
   ``Law is very vulnerable when it makes orders that don't get
enforced,'' said Charles Nesson, director of the Berkman Center for
Internet and Society at Harvard University. ``Law consists of two
things, the coercive power to impose a sanction on someone who
violates it and the willingness of people to obey the law without
actually putting it to the test. The more you undermine the
credibility of law with the people who are governed by it, the more
you need sanctions to keep order.''
</P>
<P>
   But can any court arrest 20 million Napster users around the
world? Intellectual property has always depended on both legal and
physical barriers to copying, Nesson noted. With the physical
barriers all but removed, the reliance of copyright holders on the
law may be straining it beyond its capacity to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   These information-sharing technologies are still in their
infancy. Napster's file-swapping progeny, like Freenet and
Gnutella, dispense with any vestiges of central information
altogether. Everything from video games to Scientology texts are
being traded over such networks, which hit the Internet just a few
months ago. And the inventors of even newer ones with names like
MojoNation and COLAVision were demonstrating their wares last week
at a hacker convention in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what has become known as ``peer-to-peer'' technology,
such services have vastly simplified the ability of individuals to
trade files of any sort among themselves, and to decide for
themselves whether or not to obey copyright law. Most seem to be
choosing the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use Napster, I'd be crazy if I wouldn't,'' wrote one
14-year-old in an e-mail message after Patel issued her preliminary
injunction last month. ``It lets me sample the songs from a CD and
I get to see if I want to buy the CD or not. I don't find it to be
any damaging to any musicians. I actually think it is helping
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In part because that attitude may herald a shift in the law and
in part because the music industry will face other, less
centralized networks using similar technology, many legal experts
and economists believe that the record labels would be better off
adapting their business models than suing Napster for copyright
infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still very much a common-law culture,'' said Lawrence
Lessig, a law professor at Stanford University who has submitted a
brief urging that Napster not be shut down. ``If the law does not
accord with the view of the common kid, then the law will change.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of the Napster refugees flooding the Gnutella mailing list
with set-up questions last week seemed terribly concerned about the
outcome of the San Francisco case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can someone please inform me on how to start everything up,''
read one typical post by a new user, ``I wanna get to mp3's.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Susan Estrich, the manager of Michael Dukakis'
unsuccessful 1988 campaign for president, was rattling off ways Al
Gore could use the Democratic convention to rebut George W. Bush's
accomplished performance last week when she stopped short and
laughed at herself. ``Most people won't be listening to any of
this!'' she exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Estrich may be on to something. It is true that Bush went a long
way toward achieving two essential goals: to recast the Republican
Party's image as sunny, nonthreatening and compassionate, and to
demonstrate that he was not the untested political ingenue that the
Democrats have labeled him.
</P>
<P>
   But equally significant, at least as far as Gore is concerned,
was Bush's success at orchestrating a convention that was
uncontroversial and, for the most part, dull. At a time when public
interest in political conventions is already in decline, the GOP
convention may have in effect been an anti-commercial _ Don't Watch
This! _ for Gore's convention next Monday in Los Angeles. Gore is
getting a lot of advice on what he should do to spark his campaign,
but it's not going to help his already uphill effort if no one is
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the convention didn't draw many viewers, its essential
message _ a blurring of ideological differences between Republicans
and Democrats _ was seeping out. A candidate doesn't have to be
watched to be effective. As recent interviews with the voting
public have made clear, it's not how many were watching but who:
the opinions of those who do watch filter down to the public at
large. Others turn to news coverage on television and in local
newspapers. Convention viewership, however, was generally lower
than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush delivered a lively acceptance speech, and Dick
Cheney, his running mate, went on the attack. But dissent was so
discouraged that hours would slog by without any indication that
this was a partisan gathering, much less a Republican one. The
production, often as relentlessly upbeat as a Pepsi commercial,
sent million of potential viewers (and potential voters) scurrying
to find more compelling fare on television.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention was important to Bush, who entered it
ahead in the polls, but the Democratic convention is crucial for
Gore's hopes of moving from his residence on the grounds of the
Naval Observatory to the White House next January. The gathering
next week is likely to be one of the last high-profile
opportunities that this very familiar political figure has to get
voters to reconsider him, outside of the expected debates. Oddly,
it is now Gore, who has spent a lifetime in government service,
rather than Bush, who is in the position of having to make the
speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of viewership aside, there is no shortage of advice on
what Gore should do and say once he gets to Los Angeles. Indeed,
there is a surprising amount of agreement among Democrats and
Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush needed to demonstrate that he had both intellect and an
engaging personality, Gore probably needs to show the reverse: to
demonstrate that he is something else than the brainy if drab No. 2
who has stood off to the side of the national stage for the past
eight years. Accordingly, Gore's campaign has assembled a heavy
package of biographical tributes ( Gore, you will learn, served in
Vietnam) in their undying hope that to know Gore is to like him.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the orchestrated fluffiness of the Republican
convention is being seized by Gore's advisers as a tactical
mistake. And in response, a strategy is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the Republican convention avoided issues, we ought
to have an issues-oriented convention,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y. ``And everything should be related to prosperity. I am of
the view that that is our strongest suit. And I would pound that
theme in.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Gore is intending to do. His advisers say
convention speakers in Los Angeles, and the vice president as he
campaigns en route, will offer detailed discussions of one
Democratic initiative each day, starting with Social Security. They
are already encouraging reporters to draw contrasts to what they
describe _ with a touch of envy _ as Bush's ``cotton-candy
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that this might evoke an image of Gore as the
dreary, pedantic candidate at a blackboard, holding a piece of
chalk. That said, Gore may not have much choice. ``Bush has a more
appealing personality than Gore and the Republicans have put on an
appealing convention in terms of image,'' said William Kristol, the
publisher of the conservative Weekly Standard. ``They need
desperately to make this a campaign about issues, rather than
image. And here they have been given something of an opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore's advisers are taking solace in the fact that
Bush spoke first, giving Gore the last word. For example, in what
was probably the central political formulation of Bush's speech,
the Republican argued that President Clinton and Gore squandered
eight years of prosperity. It opened the way for Gore to respond
with what his aides asserted was abundant evidence to the contrary
_ as well as to remind voters of what the economy was like under
the George Bush who preceded Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore now has an opportunity,'' said Michael McCurry, the
former White House press secretary under Clinton. ``They're going
to have to go back and remind people of what they've done for the
past eight years.''

   Estrich may be on to something. It is true that Bush went a long
way toward achieving two essential goals: to recast the Republican
Party's image as sunny, nonthreatening and compassionate, and to
demonstrate that he was not the untested political ingenue that the
Democrats have labeled him.
</P>
<P>
   But equally significant, at least as far as Gore is concerned,
was Bush's success at orchestrating a convention that was
uncontroversial and, for the most part, dull. At a time when public
interest in political conventions is already in decline, the GOP
convention may have in effect been an anti-commercial _ Don't Watch
This! _ for Gore's convention next Monday in Los Angeles. Gore is
getting a lot of advice on what he should do to spark his campaign,
but it's not going to help his already uphill effort if no one is
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the convention didn't draw many viewers, its essential
message _ a blurring of ideological differences between Republicans
and Democrats _ was seeping out. A candidate doesn't have to be
watched to be effective. As recent interviews with the voting
public have made clear, it's not how many were watching but who:
the opinions of those who do watch filter down to the public at
large. Others turn to news coverage on television and in local
newspapers. Convention viewership, however, was generally lower
than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush delivered a lively acceptance speech, and Dick
Cheney, his running mate, went on the attack. But dissent was so
discouraged that hours would slog by without any indication that
this was a partisan gathering, much less a Republican one. The
production, often as relentlessly upbeat as a Pepsi commercial,
sent million of potential viewers (and potential voters) scurrying
to find more compelling fare on television.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention was important to Bush, who entered it
ahead in the polls, but the Democratic convention is crucial for
Gore's hopes of moving from his residence on the grounds of the
Naval Observatory to the White House next January. The gathering
next week is likely to be one of the last high-profile
opportunities that this very familiar political figure has to get
voters to reconsider him, outside of the expected debates. Oddly,
it is now Gore, who has spent a lifetime in government service,
rather than Bush, who is in the position of having to make the
speech of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of viewership aside, there is no shortage of advice on
what Gore should do and say once he gets to Los Angeles. Indeed,
there is a surprising amount of agreement among Democrats and
Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush needed to demonstrate that he had both intellect and an
engaging personality, Gore probably needs to show the reverse: to
demonstrate that he is something else than the brainy if drab No. 2
who has stood off to the side of the national stage for the past
eight years. Accordingly, Gore's campaign has assembled a heavy
package of biographical tributes ( Gore, you will learn, served in
Vietnam) in their undying hope that to know Gore is to like him.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the orchestrated fluffiness of the Republican
convention is being seized by Gore's advisers as a tactical
mistake. And in response, a strategy is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that the Republican convention avoided issues, we ought
to have an issues-oriented convention,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y. ``And everything should be related to prosperity. I am of
the view that that is our strongest suit. And I would pound that
theme in.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Gore is intending to do. His advisers say
convention speakers in Los Angeles, and the vice president as he
campaigns en route, will offer detailed discussions of one
Democratic initiative each day, starting with Social Security. They
are already encouraging reporters to draw contrasts to what they
describe _ with a touch of envy _ as Bush's ``cotton-candy
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that this might evoke an image of Gore as the
dreary, pedantic candidate at a blackboard, holding a piece of
chalk. That said, Gore may not have much choice. ``Bush has a more
appealing personality than Gore and the Republicans have put on an
appealing convention in terms of image,'' said William Kristol, the
publisher of the conservative Weekly Standard. ``They need
desperately to make this a campaign about issues, rather than
image. And here they have been given something of an opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Gore's advisers are taking solace in the fact that
Bush spoke first, giving Gore the last word. For example, in what
was probably the central political formulation of Bush's speech,
the Republican argued that President Clinton and Gore squandered
eight years of prosperity. It opened the way for Gore to respond
with what his aides asserted was abundant evidence to the contrary
_ as well as to remind voters of what the economy was like under
the George Bush who preceded Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore now has an opportunity,'' said Michael McCurry, the
former White House press secretary under Clinton. ``They're going
to have to go back and remind people of what they've done for the
past eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The other George Bush, by the way, was in the convention hall
almost as often as the most conscientious delegate, sitting in a
VIP section that included a who's who of Republican warhorses:
among them, 87-year-old Gerald Ford, former Cabinet officials under
Presidents Bush and Reagan, and Cheney, who served as defense
secretary under President Bush. This aging if distinguished tableau
of power offers another point of contrast that Gore intends to make
at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake they made is the they posited themselves in the
past,'' said Rahm Emanuel, an adviser to both Clinton and Gore.
``And that's from the moment of the Cheney selection forward. The
thematic of the campaign is future versus past.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is well aware, an aide said, that none of this will matter
if no one is there to hear his tree fall. His campaign has begun to
try to deal with that: Gore will, for example, do hard-driving,
telegenic events during the day intended to get him on the network
news, and is considering a range of interviews with unusual
sources, from MTV to Jay Leno, reminiscent of what Clinton did in
1992. The daytime events are designed to get the vice president on
the television news every night, with the convention serving as
something of a late-evening coda that reinforces the message of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Gore now is grabbing the the public's
attention. Even someone like Estrich who has lived and breathed
politics for more than 20 years had little interest in tuning into
the high point of the Republican convention, Bush's speech. In the
midst of an interview last Thursday, she noted that she had
arranged to have drinks that night with another Democrat involved
in planning Gore's convention. Their appointment, she said, was
scheduled at the time Bush would take the stage to offer his vision
for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch his speech?'' she said. ``Why? I'll watch a clip in the
morning.''

FORMER SOVIET JEWS FIND UNEASY PEACE IN GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Violetta Botwinikova is a new-wave Berliner, brisk and
chic, a 24-year-old entrepreneur, Moscow-born, Jewish _ and very
much at home in an adoptive land that changed history by producing
a killing machine for Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Her nails are sculptured ellipses _ Botwinikova is a beautician
with a sideline in the bistro business _ and her manner smooth as
her nail polish. ``I came to Germany in 1990 because my family
could stay here, simple as that,'' she said, poking a spoon into a
frothy cappuccino. ``I cannot live in Israel. I need a European
lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   After a decade here, Botwinikova speaks German easily, the
Russian accent dancing lightly on sentences of hermetic Teutonic
perfection. She is proud to be a Jew, she says, and comfortable in
a Germany that has given her freedom and money. ``Israel is too
provincial,'' she mused, smiling. ``And there are too many Jews
there.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing number in Germany, too. With Europe generally
closed to legal immigration, the quiet influx into Germany of Jews
from the former Soviet Union constitutes one exception. The Central
Council of German Jews says it now has 85,000 members, up from
29,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   With a further 20,000 to 30,000 Jews known to be living here
without registering with the council _ Botwinikova is an example _
Germany's Jewish population has recently surpassed 100,000 for the
first time since Hitler dispersed and destroyed a prewar community
of over 500,000 Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal feeling is that the re-establishment of a Jewish
community is a kind of victory over the Nazis and what they tried
to do,'' said Manfred Becker, a senior Berlin city official dealing
with religious affairs. ``This is the point, even if such
immigration costs money. We feel a sense of moral obligation on the
German side.''
</P>
<P>
   But how far should these obligations go? It is clear that
ambivalence and hostility also exist over Jewish immigration in a
German population whose full range of feelings over the new
arrivals is unknown for the simple reason that they have never been
consulted.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a bomb exploded in Duesseldorf, injuring nine
immigrants, six of them former Soviet Jews. Nobody has claimed
responsibility; the police insist it is too early to say
anti-Semitism lay behind the attack. But the next day a makeshift
synagogue in Potsdam was daubed in ``Sieg Heil'' graffiti, and
politicians have expressed alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Violent anti-Semites are no more than a small fringe of German
society. But an awkward moment has clearly been reached in
German-Jewish relations. Jews are pouring in, at least 5,000 of
them a year, supported by annual state payments of tens of millions
of dollars, even as German impatience with Holocaust-induced
obligations is rising.
</P>
<P>
   With a recent agreement for a multibillion-dollar payment to
Nazi-era slave laborers and three major Jewish institutions under
construction in the new capital of Berlin, many Germans have a
feeling of ``enough already,'' in the words of Michael Blumenthal,
the director of the Berlin Jewish museum that will open next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have arrived at a very complex psychological situation that
is not always pleasant,'' Blumenthal said. ``What I sense among
many Germans is a feeling that we have done all this, and the Jews
should be grateful to us and not keep asking for more, not take
advantage of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Such feelings are rarely expressed publicly by Germans because
they are officially taboo. Martin Walser, a prominent writer, broke
that taboo in 1998 when he declared that he was tired of Auschwitz
being used as ``a moral cudgel'' or ``a tool of intimidation that
can be deployed at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   He was widely disavowed. But Paul Spiegel, the president of the
Central Council of German Jews, said he increasingly met fellow
Germans who warned him ``not to remind us every day of what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's Jewish population, which has doubled to over 12,000 in
the past decade, now receives more than $20 million a year from the
municipal budget for the upkeep of Jewish buildings and schools,
security and other matters. By contrast, the Turkish population of
170,000 receives virtually nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Jewish community, the German side must avoid the
impression that it holds the money purse closed,'' Becker said.
``But we are discreet about the sum we pay. We do not want it to be
a headline because we know it could cause resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   With Berlin's debts over $30 billion and many city programs
being cut, potential for resentment is high. Just how high is
unknown because, Becker continued, ``nobody dares take an opinion
poll in Berlin or Germany about Jewish immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Suppose only 55 percent were in favor,'' he replied.
``Imagine the outcry. My personal estimate is 70 percent would
approve, but our society lacks the courage to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Boris Feldmann, a Jew who reached Berlin from Riga in 1991, and
who lost three grandparents to the Nazis in World War II, is not
too worried about what Germans may think of him. ``You should ask
me how I felt in Latvia as a Jew,'' he said. ``In a place where you
could lose your job if you went to synagogue.''
</P>
<P>
   In common with many of the Jews arriving in Germany from the
east, Feldmann is a little impatient with questions about German
anti-Semitism and the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed through the prism of Stalin's crimes, and against the
backdrop of Soviet anti-Semitism, Germany can seem like a land of
freedom with a terrible history, but perhaps no more terrible than
that of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I go on radio shows with Russian Jews in New York,''
said Feldmann, who publishes a successful range of Russian-language
newspapers in Germany. ``They ask me how I can live in Germany. But
the Holocaust is in the past. You cannot live endlessly thinking
the people on the street are related to that madness.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Feldmann was in the Soviet Army. He was stationed in
Kaliningrad and when the rise of the Solidarity union in Poland
threatened to sweep away the Communist government, he was
dispatched to the Polish border. A Soviet invasion seemed imminent,
and Feldmann would have fought, although he despised the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In this experience, he finds a lesson, for he believes many
ordinary Germans lived with similar dilemmas under Hitler. Not the
fanatics, not the SS, but the average German. And so he is inclined
to be understanding.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, are Alexander and Ljudmila Sumin, the Jewish owners of
a construction company who arrived in Berlin from Estonia in 1991.
When somebody scrawled ``Arbeit macht frei'' _ the words above the
gate to Auschwitz _ on their son's exercise book in school, they
told themselves there was good and bad in all countries and the bad
had predominated in Tallinn in the form of repeated hounding of
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Schoeps, an expert on German-Jewish affairs, noted that
Jewish veterans of the Soviet Army and veterans of the Wehrmacht
recently held a reunion in Berlin at which they contentedly pored
over wartime mementos. ``This may be hard to understand from an
American perspective, but these Soviet Jews feel liberated in
Germany,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Germany has reached out to people like Feldmann. Ever
since the last East German leader, Lothar de Maiziere, began
welcoming Soviet Jews in 1990, and former Chancellor Helmut Kohl
adopted a similar policy after unification, Jews have been received
here with a welcome almost as generous as that reserved for
``ethnic Germans'' _ people of German stock coming mainly from
Russia who have automatic right to German citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Once visa requests are approved, and 5,000 families a year now
receive such approval, Jewish immigrants receive work permits,
residence permits, full welfare benefits, including medical and
dental care, a place to live, free schooling for children and
German lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Synagogues are being built: New ones recently opened in Dortmund
and Kassel and one is under construction in Dresden. There is a
five-year waiting list among Jews in the former Soviet Union who
have applied to come to Germany, most of them simply seeking a
better economic future although they are officially described by
Germany as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years, the Jews are eligible for German passports.
No wonder, then, that there is a thriving trade in false Jewish
papers in Moscow, for these papers amount to an elusive passport to
a European Union otherwise accessible only to ``asylum seekers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the Jewish immigrants are privileged,'' said Barbara
John, the Berlin official who oversees the city's large immigrant
population. ``This should be seen as a form of reparation. Jews
were murdered and we feel better if we do this.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Germans plainly feel angry. Throughout Europe, the
arrival of immigrants causes more resentment than in the United
States partly because the newcomers are eligible for many social
benefits, giving some people the feeling that foreigners are taking
their tax money.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors are involved here. Many of the arriving Jews
have taken up residence in the former East Germany, where Jews were
almost unknown for most of the postwar years, official Communist
propaganda scarcely alluded to the Holocaust, the population was
told it had fought on the right side against Hitler's
``capitalist'' government, and the Communists regularly used
scapegoats to buttress their views.
</P>
<P>
   So it is natural enough that anti-Semitism has found fertile
ground in cities where unemployment is as high as 20 percent and
any handouts to foreigners are liable to be targeted in the
propaganda of neo-Nazi movements.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Knochenhauer, a Jew from St. Petersburg who works for the
Central Council of German Jews in the state of Brandenburg, near
Berlin, said, ``The Duesseldorf bomb was no surprise. There is a
lot of anti-Semitism here, open and subliminal. Many people in the
east still have no idea what a Jew is.'' Even in the west, regular
contact with Jews remains unusual for most Germans.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, she prayed in an improvised Potsdam synagogue _
plans to build a permanent one await approval and financing _
daubed with the words ``Sieg Heil'' and ``Juden.'' It was a painful
experience, proof to her that for Jews, in the end, Germany amounts
to a ``macabre choice.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 36, she has spent half her life in Russia and half her
life in Germany, after marrying an East German in 1983. But she
does not feel at home in Germany and is certain she will move on
once her teen-age daughter has finished school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I have done everything to try to make it work here,''
she said. ``And Germany has tried hard too. But it does not work.
This is a people that destroyed itself in 1933, killed itself, and
it cannot come back from this death. So they live on a superficial
level in which Jews are symbols of something, but not people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish repopulation of Germany is at an early stage. It is
too soon to say what German patriotism, if any, the children of the
new immigrants will feel. The gulf between the feelings of Feldmann
and the feelings of Knochenhauer is evidence enough of the complex,
diverse emotions involved. And a Germany still adjusting to
unification has not openly confronted its sentiments at this
improvised Jewish immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Karsten Voigt, a Social Democrat and Foreign Ministry official,
called the return of the Jews ``my party's and my generation's last
triumph over Hitler.'' But recent developments suggest it may be
premature to speak of victories. The ``normality'' so restlessly
sought by Germans in their relations with Jews remains elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Germans are committed to Jewish immigration and many
are uncomfortable,'' said Deidre Berger, the head of the American
Jewish Committee in Berlin. ``Some see a way to make good the past,
but some think there is a Jewish conspiracy to blackmail them and
the world has made Germany feel guilty long enough.''

<P>
   (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   POL-CONVENTIONS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ George W. Bush went a
long way at the Republican convention toward casting himself and
his party in a favorable light. But the event was, for the most
part, dull. Bush produced what was in effect an anti-commercial _
Don't Watch This! _ for Al Gore's upcoming Democratic convention.
Gore is getting much advice about what he should do to get his
candidacy on track, but it's not going to matter much if no one's
watching. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a business culture that has
long fixated ambivalently on the image of computer wizards brewing
technological revolution in their garages, the backstory to two
digital copyright battles involving Napster and DVDs being waged in
federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring. They are either
tales of David vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim
at the establishment. Both cases have underscored the unprecedented
ability of individuals armed with digital technology to upset the
status quo. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST-NEWS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's August, and things are
supposed to be slow and easy for public officials, business people
and journalists. But if the 1990s are any indication, August can be
the cruelest month for those who cherish international calm and
stable markets. A look at major news events that took place in
August in recent years. By Kurt M. Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD-PARTIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at third-party movements
in the history of U.S. presidential elections. They have seldom
played significant roles, except as occasional issue raisers and
spoilers. In a sense, third parties have played a vital role in
America's political system by expanding it and maybe, in a peculiar
way, preserving it. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIC-DEREG-REVIEW (Undated) _ Cheap, reliable electricity
was long taken for granted in the United States. Not anymore, at
least not in California. Four years ago, California decided to
deregulate its electric industry to promote competition, lower
prices and better service. This summer, power bills have doubled in
San Diego, blackouts have hit San Francisco, and the state has been
forced to cut off some big customers to protect the rest of its
power grid. The power supply is near collapse. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-ROCK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Republican National Convention
had two things in common with a World Wrestling Federation match:
the event was scripted and the outcome was never in doubt. The
champion known as The Rock was there to deliver unto the
conventioneers a voter registration message and to introduce House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, a former wrestling coach. By Richard
Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-DONORS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ It began in 1988 with Team
100, made up of $100,000 contributors, when the elder George Bush
invented the Republicans' first elite donor club. Last week the GOP
convention was overrun by a stampede of 600 Team 100 members, who
were invited to take out those checkbooks and give the party
$250,000, the entry fee to the Republican Regents, the party's
newest and most exclusive donor club. By Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   KILLER-KID-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Friends and acquaintances of
youths who kill often have heard boasts, plans for mayhem or seen
such warning signs as a fascination with guns. But they did nothing
to stop the crimes. The recently released testimony of teenagers
who knew one such killer, Michael Carneal of West Paducah, Ky.,
provide some insight.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SPANGLISH-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ As Spanish speakers around
the world adopt computers and the Internet, they are importing
English technology-related words into their vocabulary. The
hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not new; it
has been accelerating for decades, irritating Spanish language
purists as well as Latin American nationalists who see the process
as more cultural infiltration from the United States. What's
different now is that authorities in much of the Latin world appear
to be throwing up their hands in the face of the latest English
invasion. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ARABS-REVIEW (Cairo) _ At the urging of the
Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have renewed the perennial call
for a summit conference of Arab leaders, this time billed an
emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the failure at Camp
David and to counter the U.S. spin that the breakdown was due
solely to Arab recalcitrance. The chimera of a united Arab front
continues to shimmer on the horizon _ and, suddenly, not just for
the Arabs. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   BOLIVAR-VENEZUELA-REVIEW (Caracas) _ Throughout South America,
no figure is more revered and quoted than Simon Bolivar, who freed
the region from Spanish rule nearly 200 years ago. But Bolivar said
many different and often contradictory things. That means that
modern leaders like Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have a whole
menu of positions from which to choose when they seek to justify
their own actions. By Larry Rohter.

   ZIMBABWE-MUGABE-REVIEW (Harare) _ In the West, Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe is seen as a bloody despot and race-monger
who fuels the violence that churns through the countryside. But in
much of Africa, he is viewed as a hero trying to redress historical
wrongs. To many Westerners, these two conflicting views seem
impossible to reconcile. How can Mugabe be praised for pursuing an
honorable cause if he kills innocents along the way? By Rachel
Swarns.

for Sunday, Aug. 6, moved Saturday.

<P>
   (Moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   POL-CONVENTIONS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ George W. Bush went a
long way at the Republican convention toward casting himself and
his party in a favorable light. But the event was, for the most
part, dull. Bush produced what was in effect an anti-commercial _
Don't Watch This! _ for Al Gore's upcoming Democratic convention.
Gore is getting much advice about what he should do to get his
candidacy on track, but it's not going to matter much if no one's
watching. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a business culture that has
long fixated ambivalently on the image of computer wizards brewing
technological revolution in their garages, the backstory to two
digital copyright battles involving Napster and DVDs being waged in
federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring. They are either
tales of David vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim
at the establishment. Both cases have underscored the unprecedented
ability of individuals armed with digital technology to upset the
status quo. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST-NEWS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's August, and things are
supposed to be slow and easy for public officials, business people
and journalists. But if the 1990s are any indication, August can be
the cruelest month for those who cherish international calm and
stable markets. A look at major news events that took place in
August in recent years. By Kurt M. Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD-PARTIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at third-party movements
in the history of U.S. presidential elections. They have seldom
played significant roles, except as occasional issue raisers and
spoilers. In a sense, third parties have played a vital role in
America's political system by expanding it and maybe, in a peculiar
way, preserving it. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIC-DEREG-REVIEW (Undated) _ Cheap, reliable electricity
was long taken for granted in the United States. Not anymore, at
least not in California. Four years ago, California decided to
deregulate its electric industry to promote competition, lower
prices and better service. This summer, power bills have doubled in
San Diego, blackouts have hit San Francisco, and the state has been
forced to cut off some big customers to protect the rest of its
power grid. The power supply is near collapse. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-ROCK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Republican National Convention
had two things in common with a World Wrestling Federation match:
the event was scripted and the outcome was never in doubt. The
champion known as The Rock was there to deliver unto the
conventioneers a voter registration message and to introduce House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, a former wrestling coach. By Richard
Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-DONORS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ It began in 1988 with Team
100, made up of $100,000 contributors, when the elder George Bush
invented the Republicans' first elite donor club. Last week the GOP
convention was overrun by a stampede of 600 Team 100 members, who
were invited to take out those checkbooks and give the party
$250,000, the entry fee to the Republican Regents, the party's
newest and most exclusive donor club. By Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   KILLER-KID-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Friends and acquaintances of
youths who kill often have heard boasts, plans for mayhem or seen
such warning signs as a fascination with guns. But they did nothing
to stop the crimes. The recently released testimony of teenagers
who knew one such killer, Michael Carneal of West Paducah, Ky.,
provide some insight.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SPANGLISH-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ As Spanish speakers around
the world adopt computers and the Internet, they are importing
English technology-related words into their vocabulary. The
hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not new; it
has been accelerating for decades, irritating Spanish language
purists as well as Latin American nationalists who see the process
as more cultural infiltration from the United States. What's
different now is that authorities in much of the Latin world appear
to be throwing up their hands in the face of the latest English
invasion. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ARABS-REVIEW (Cairo) _ At the urging of the
Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have renewed the perennial call
for a summit conference of Arab leaders, this time billed an
emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the failure at Camp
David and to counter the U.S. spin that the breakdown was due
solely to Arab recalcitrance. The chimera of a united Arab front
continues to shimmer on the horizon _ and, suddenly, not just for
the Arabs. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   BOLIVAR-VENEZUELA-REVIEW (Caracas) _ Throughout South America,
no figure is more revered and quoted than Simon Bolivar, who freed
the region from Spanish rule nearly 200 years ago. But Bolivar said
many different and often contradictory things. That means that
modern leaders like Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have a whole
menu of positions from which to choose when they seek to justify
their own actions. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   ZIMBABWE-MUGABE-REVIEW (Harare) _ In the West, Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe is seen as a bloody despot and race-monger
who fuels the violence that churns through the countryside. But in
much of Africa, he is viewed as a hero trying to redress historical
wrongs. To many Westerners, these two conflicting views seem

   QB Rivalries in 49er-Land
</P>
<P>
   If there is anyone who understands the difficulty of following a
legend, it is the quarterback Steve Young. In the early 1990s,
Young and Joe Montana were in a heated battle for the starting job
in San Francisco. Montana was struggling to overcome injuries and
refused to be a backup. He eventually finished his career in Kansas
City, and just last week was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Young
went on to win a Super Bowl with the 49ers and will also someday be
inducted.
</P>
<P>
   But on his way out the door, Montana made it known that he and
Young were not exactly friends. ``Steve is on a big push for
himself,'' Montana said in a 1991 interview. ``And any time you
have a competition, there is always that certain amount of
animosity towards each other. I can say we only have a working
relationship. That's all it is. After that, he's on my team, but as
far as I'm concerned, he's part of the opposition. He wants what I
have, and I have to approach it that way. There is no other way to
deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Young vowed that if he was ever in a situation
where a younger player was behind him, he would not treat that
player the way Montana treated him.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Young got the chance to make good on those
words, but if you believe the current 49ers quarterback, Jeff
Garcia, Young failed.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback soap operas in San Francisco have been
legendary, and while what happened between Garcia and Young may not
make the top five, it is still interesting. And around the league,
both now and historically, relationships between a starting
quarterback and his backup can often be tense.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said this week that he wishes Young, who retired during
the off-season, had been more supportive last year. Young was the
only returning quarterback, and behind him were Garcia and Steve
Stenstrom. When Young sustained a season-ending concussion in Week
3, Garcia became the starter. Garcia said that at that point,
Young's attitude became quite chilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure not being in the role he was normally used to being
in, as far as being the starting quarterback and the guy everybody
else can count on, that really changed his mindset,'' Garcia said.
``In doing so, I didn't really feel there was a whole lot of
activity from him in helping us young guys. He was dealing with his
own thing, so he kept to himself in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia understands part of why Young was distant. It was a
difficult time for Young who, because of a series of concussions,
faced the end of his career. Those times are always the most
difficult, and they can wreck a player's emotions, turning someone
as classy and friendly as Young into more of a loner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than questioning during games, asking him what we could
do to hopefully have some success on the field, other than that, it
didn't seem like _ I don't know _ that's sort of a difficult area
to describe,'' Garcia said. ``I think everybody's going to approach
those situations the best way they know. If I'm in those shoes, I
approach it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at his situation last year and realizing that it
got to the point he wasn't going to be back as a player,'' Garcia
said, ``I would have liked to have seen more of the coach come out
in him. Especially when dealing with new guys on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   So Young's personal soap opera had come full circle. He survived
Montana's jabs, only to act, according to Garcia, not exactly
personable years later when injuries were forcing him to
contemplate his mortality as a player.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's words caused a stir in 49ersville, and prompted a
meeting between Garcia and coach Steve Mariucci, who chastised
Garcia for chastising a team legend. After the meeting, Garcia was
complimentary of Young. That is called damage control.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Garcia should prepare for what could be a long
season. The 49ers are a wreck, the victims of manipulating the
salary cap for far too long. They have little talent and even less
depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll surprise some people,'' Garcia said. ``That's the
attitude I'm taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes Finds a Supporter
</P>
<P>
   When Ray Rhodes was fired as coach of the Green Bay Packers
after last season, one of the people who remained a big fan was the
Washington owner, Daniel Snyder. He brought Rhodes to the Redskins,
made him the defensive coordinator and thinks Rhodes will soon
become a head coach again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Ray to take advantage of what I think is a great
opportunity here,'' Snyder said. ``I think ultimately Ray will be
one of the great head coaches in football. I really believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes has been fired twice in the past 20 months, in Green Bay
and before that in Philadelphia. Yet there has never been a
question about his skills as a coordinator. He remains perhaps the
best defensive mind in the game. Now, Rhodes is trying to turn
around a defense that was ranked 30th last year and nearly mutinied
under Mike Nolan, now the defensive coordinator with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things Rhodes did was change the scheme, which
asked linemen to hold up blockers, while the linebackers made the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This defense allows everyone _ not just the defensive line _
but everyone to be a little more free and allow our football skills
to take over,'' said Dan Wilkinson, a defensive lineman. ``It was
frustration across the board last year, because were asked to do
things that we didn't think made too much sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Better Role Models
</P>
<P>
   Professional football players have made a lot of off-field news
recently, much of it negative. They have been arrested on charges
of everything from driving while intoxicated to murder.
</P>
<P>
   But there are players in the game who do positive things. Tampa
Bay linebacker Derrick Brooks, for example, took 19 disadvantaged
teen-agers from the Tampa and Orlando Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs on a
12-day trip to South Africa as a reward for good grades.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis Colts' running back Edgerrin James donated $250,000
to his alma mater, the University of Miami. Philadelphia Eagles
quarterback Donovan McNabb is giving $100,000 to Syracuse
University, his alma mater, for a new locker room in the school's
football complex. In addition to his gift to Syracuse, McNabb is
also financing scholarships at his former high school and a
business loan program through his hometown church.
</P>
<P>
   And Tennessee's Eddie George, who recently signed one of the
largest contracts ever for a running back, took 20 credits this
spring at Ohio State University toward the completion of his
undergraduate degree.

ANALYSIS: BUSH'S ECONOMIC PLAN GIVES FAMILIAR A TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDITORS: This replaces the bush-econ-assess that was sent Aug. 3
and then held. This version has been rewritten.)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The economic agenda presented to the Republican
National Convention and the nation on Thursday night by Gov. George
W. Bush stuck closely in many ways to Republican orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Its centerpieces were tax cuts and the creation of personal
investment accounts within the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   It emphasized that the solutions to some problems, like the
growing numbers of people without health insurance, rested not with
government bureaucracy but with the private marketplace. And it
promised a budget that would provide more money for the military.
</P>
<P>
   But there were twists.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the convention, Bush and his team sought to counter
the idea that Republicans stand for sweeping tax cuts that are
fiscally reckless and a boon only to the country-club set. Tax cuts
were showcased in Philadelphia as a prudent way to spur
entrepreneurship, give a lift to people looking to reach the middle
class, and provide an economic pick-me-up should the long business
expansion begin to flag.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the Republican call, much heard after Newt Gingrich led
the party to take control of the House in 1994, to shrink the size
and influence of government by starving it of revenues. Bush went
so far in his speech as to single out his support for federal
programs like Head Start.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most notably, Bush made clear how he intended to handle
one of his trickiest political tasks: making a case against an
incumbent vice president whose administration is presiding over an
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ignoring it, or getting into a battle over who
deserves the credit, Bush said the real issue should be what the
nation chooses to do with its prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use these good times for great goals,'' Bush said,
pledging in particular to ensure the solvency of Social Security
and Medicare. ``For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration
has coasted through prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Bush was trying to do for Republicans on
economic policy what President Clinton has done for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   By emphasizing elimination of the federal budget deficit and the
national debt, Clinton sought to erase the perception that
Democrats were the party of profligacy and high taxes. In the end,
doing so gave him more freedom to press for substantially more
spending on the issues at the core of the Democratic agenda,
especially health and education.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush seems intent on dispelling the idea that
conservative policy is inconsistent with helping people who have
not already made it economically, and his tax plan contains
elements specifically intended to help the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush is by no means apologizing for the fact that his
proposals to cut all income tax rates would do what such proposals
always do: provide most of their benefits to the people who make
the most money.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush is certain to draw heavy fire from Vice President Al
Gore. Democrats said that the focus in Philadelphia last week on
helping single mothers, struggling family farms and Hispanic
entrepreneurs was nothing more than camouflage for the usual
conservative effort, embodied by the Bush campaign as much as by
the Republican majority in Congress, to reward the wealthy people
and powerful interest groups that finance Republican campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, they said, Republicans are going about it in a way that
would squander the projected federal budget surpluses and leave
nothing for priorities like adding prescription drug coverage to
Medicare or modernizing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats look at the Bush tax plan and see 43 percent of the
benefits going to the top 1 percent of households by income, those
making more than $319,000 a year, according to Citizens for Tax
Justice, a liberal-leaning research group.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence B. Lindsey, Bush's chief economic adviser, said
Republicans remained focused on the incentives that tax cuts
provide to earn and save more, whether for a waitress earning
$18,000 a year or the entrepreneur who wants to be able to pass a
painstakingly built business along to her heirs without being
subject to a hefty federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   After several years in which their agenda seemed to generate
little public enthusiasm, Republicans have taken heart from polls
showing that support for tax cuts is growing.
</P>
<P>
   But to the extent that he emphasizes the substance of economic
policy _ and all signs last week were that he is more interested in
emphasizing character and leadership _ Bush risks not only inviting
an onslaught from Gore over class politics and fiscal rectitude,
but also focusing voters on the fact that the Clinton-Gore years
have been pretty good for most people.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, Bush's running mate, illustrated that risk, no
doubt inadvertently, in his speech to the convention on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anyone, Republican or Democrat, seriously believe that
under Gore, the next four years would be any different from the
last eight?'' Cheney asked.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at 4 percent, inflation under control, incomes
rising across the board and most indicators of social well-being
improving, Democrats gathering for their convention in Los Angeles
this month will no doubt be eager to show that Cheney was right:
that on those counts, Gore's election would mean more of the same.

   JCC-AFTERMATH (Granada Hills, Calif.) _ In the 12 months since a
gunman shot and injured five people at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center, the center has been striving for normalcy. The

L.A.'S FOSTER KIDS TURNED OUT ONTO STREET WHEN THEY TURN 18 &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At any given time, an estimated 500 to 1,000
youths are homeless in Los Angeles County after turning 18 and
leaving foster care, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Bock, director of the county Department of Children and
Family Services, said the major reason is the lack of affordable
housing - not the failure of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and the teen-agers themselves disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles County has a very poor history helping children
who leave long-term foster care,'' said Andrew Bridge, executive
director of the Alliance for Children's Rights. ``When you have a
system where nearly half the kids who leave long-term care are
homeless within two years, that's an indictment of the way the
system has cared for those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Those children include Matthew Snyder, now 23, who has been
homeless since he was 18 and released from foster care in North
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do whatever I can to survive. I go to drop-in centers,
collect food and blankets, and squat at night in abandoned houses
and under freeways.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent night, county Street Outreach Services social workers
Julie Hildreth and Jan Sully found Snyder on the streets of
Hollywood and began to work with him to get him housing and a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have an exact figure of how many kids are out there.
There are many children out on the streets,'' Hildreth said.
</P>
<P>
   Bock said Los Angeles County is no worse than other foster-care
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any secret that the foster care system is
experiencing many challenges, not just in Los Angeles, but
nationally,'' said Bock, who took over the department last July.
``There is much to be done to improve services to young people when
they leave the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County child advocates estimate 30 percent to 40
percent of the 1,700 to 2,000 youths emancipated each year at age
18 end up homeless, compared with 25 percent to 40 percent
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California, Los Angeles, Center for Child and
Family Policy Studies recently studied the problem, interviewing 24
former foster youths who left the system in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The study discovered the ``chaotic, violent, risky and dynamic
world the foster youths enter upon leaving care,'' wrote authors
Walter M. Furman and Rosina M. Becerra.
</P>
<P>
   It found six of the 24 reported periods of homelessness, one
traveled with ``gypsies'' working at fairs throughout the West and
many ``couch surfed'' - sleeping on acquaintances' couches - before
finding a more permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the youths expressed frustration with the foster
care system, saying they felt like ``we`re just a file waiting to
be put away,'' ``nobody wants you, you're a leftover'' and ``I
thought it was just like you were emancipated, you're homeless,
you're 18, we don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of recent federal and state grants, the county can
now give money to United Friends of Children, which provides
transitional housing to about 220 youths at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is set up now is a big improvement over what existed five
or 10 years ago,'' Furman said. ``I give the county a lot of credit
for moving toward the development of a system that has paid
attention to this issue. They have been a statewide leader,
although they haven't done as much as they could have.''
</P>
<P>
   One young man remembers the difficulty he had transitioning from
foster care to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I would break into parking lots with cars and sleep
in the old cars,'' said Ebrhamm Owens, 22, of Los Angeles. ``I
really preferred vacant houses - just the fact that there was
carpet and not a cold floor and not being outside.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he spent four years living on the streets before he
found a program that helped him get an apartment. He now works as a
peer counselor at the Community College Foundation, an organization
that helps former foster youths.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, released from the foster care system in 1996, said the
system failed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you grow up in the system, you don't get to experience
and learn what it's like in the real world,'' he said. ``When you
get out there, you are totally shocked and left by yourself. Now,
they have programs. Before, there was nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Help can be found with groups such as the Culver City-based
United Friends of the Children, which finds housing for the youths.
With a $2.5 million budget today, the organization is able to
provide homes to 220 youths at a time, including housing for 20
youths in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Youths in need of housing can call (310) 338-5431.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible to cast these kids off,'' said Sandra Rudnick,
chairwoman of the group. ``Most of them have tremendous potential.
They have real inner strength. They are not delinquents. They just
had a real lousy start in life.''

YEAR AFTER SHOOTING, JEWISH CENTER RECOVERS ITS SMILE &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA BARTHOLOMEW 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   GRANADA HILLS, Calif. _ Counselors sport Day-glo hair. Kids
erupt with woodwind cheer. And parents drive out of the North
Valley Jewish Community Center assured their children are safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12 months since an gunman shot and injured five people
Aug. 10 at the center and killed a mail carrier in Chatsworth, the
center strives for normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   The only evidence of change are security guards who stand
sentinel at the padlocked iron gates. Otherwise, it's a normal day
at camp. No one talks about accused gunman and admitted racist
Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. or his possible motives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here aren't looking back,'' said Michelle Schipper,
director of the JCC in Granada Hills. ``We continue to move
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a triumph over evil - good will win. The
community has pulled together. We have won.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center, attendance is up, programs and memberships have
increased and laughter - as always - is in the air. An arts
curriculum has been added and the New Valley Symphony has made the
JCC its home.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from tightened security, the only obvious acknowledgment
of the tragedy that struck a year ago is a Unity Garden emerging on
the centers' front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings have prompted other changes, however.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying public momentum from the incident, Gov. Gray Davis
signed into law an assault weapons ban and gun control bills
requiring trigger locks for safety and added regulations at gun
shows and banning so-called Saturday night specials throughout the
state.
</P>
<P>
   A toll-free hotline for schools and day care centers was
established to advise how to beef up security. And an advisory
panel on hate crime was established that recommended further
legislation against hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Though the number of hate-based crimes in Los Angeles has
increased, possibly because of better reporting, the Granada Hills
shootings has greatly increased awareness on the part of city
services, City Councilwoman Laura Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These terrible things can happen, anywhere, everywhere in our
city,'' Chick said. ``They have to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Flashback to Aug. 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On that day a stranger entered the center and wounded Isabelle
Shamoleth, the longtime receptionist; Mindy Finkelstein, a teen-age
counselor; James Zidell and Joshua Stepakoff, then 6; and
5-year-old Benjamin Kadish.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Santos Ileto, a Filipino-American postman, was gunned
down in Chatsworth during what appeared to be the same spree.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, a neo-Nazi from Washington state, was charged with the
shootings and could face the death penalty if convicted during a
trial set for February 2001.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, Furrow admitted to targeting the JCC
as a ``wake-up call'' for Americans to start killing Jews, and said
he murdered Ileto because he was a federal employee who was not
white.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ileto's family has lectured on the pain of hate
crime and growing incidents of it toward the Asian community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to lose someone from a medical condition,''
said Ismael Ileto, 37, Joseph Ileto's older brother whose father
died of a heart attack just before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another to lose one from a heinous crime, from a vicious
act of violence. We never experienced anything like this before, we
never even thought about ... us as a target.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, those injured at the Jewish Community Center
have largely recovered, Schipper said. Shamoleth, ``the backbone of
this place,'' returned to work the day she got out of the hospital.
Two out of the three injured children are back on the playground.
</P>
<P>
   Only Kadish, who was given a colostomy as a result of his
injuries, has gone to another camp. ``He's doing much, much
better,'' said his mother, Eleanor.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Weber, a social worker for the Jewish Family Service that
has helped many of the JCC families work through their trauma, said
most realize ``life can be controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are no guarantees against random violence, she said,
there is comfort in added security and crime prevention.
Nonetheless, some children still experience bad dreams, disturbed
sleep and eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, she said, ``you're not afraid of people shooting
you, of seeing blood on your teacher, of seeing your parents
terrified,'' she said. ``The difficulty is knowing you were singled
out because of your ethnicity and religion.''
</P>
<P>
   As a response to the shootings, the Los Angeles Police
Department has increased its presence at schools and community
centers. Its many divisions use video footage of its quick response
as training films, an LAPD spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish community leaders said that while security has been
beefed up in synagogues across Los Angeles, it is important to
reach out to other faiths in an effort to destroy the hate culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids are shot, whether it's in a community center or a
drive-by shooting, your really discover the importance of life -
and the importance of family,'' said Michael Hirschfeld, executive
director of the Jewish Community Relations Committee. The committee
is a member of the Jewish Council Federation, which oversees the
JCC.
</P>
<P>
   Personal responsibility is also vital, said Rabbi Harold
Schulweis of Valley Beth Shalom in Encino. ``The emphasis needs to
be on godliness, rather than God,'' he said. ``God needs allies on
Earth - and that's our responsibility. And that's the lesson for
all of us.''

CONVENTION OFFICIALS EMPHASIZED THE LOCAL ANGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For WLTV, the Univision station in Miami, covering the
Republicans in Philadelphia was like getting a seat at a national
banquet. Each day, the outlet was given the access it needed to
tailor its Spanish-language newscast via daily interviews with,
among others, Al Cardenas, the chairman of the Florida delegation,
and Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 11 p.m., there was a highlight and later we localized the
issues and went live with a local delegate,'' said Bernadette
Pardo, the station's senior political correspondent. ``The coverage
ended up much more productive because there was a larger local
emphasis.''
</P>
<P>
   On the airwaves in Atlanta, prominent Republicans like Colin
Powell, Dick Cheney, Elizabeth Dole and Newt Gingrich were not mere
fixtures on network news programs, but also appeared in profile
pieces and sat for interviews with local anchors and reporters. On
Chicago's top-rated WLS, members of the Bush family chatted with
Linda Yu, an anchor.
</P>
<P>
   And in Boston, the final night of WCVB's coverage from
Philadelphia featured one of its reporter-anchors, Natalie
Jacobson, proclaiming in a way that put a familiar local face on
convention-floor exuberance: ``What a night for George W. Bush!
What a convention!''
</P>
<P>
   The major networks may have complained loudly about a dearth of
breaking news and even cut back their coverage this year of the
four days and nights in the First Union Center. But no such griping
was heard from the local electronic news media, whose broadcasting
needs convention officials tried to satisfy to a degree unmatched
by previous party gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Using a battalion of bookers, the Republicans put 200 Bush
surrogates at the disposal of radio stations, Web sites and
especially local television outlets. They provided free satellite
time to stations that did not book their own, and concentrated
heavily on contacting outlets in markets in crucial states like
Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Michigan, with offers to
put Republican talking heads on their news programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ranged from congressmen to Condoleezza Rice,'' Nels Olson,
the convention's master scheduler, said of Bush's top foreign
policy adviser. ``She was going on local shows, even the Internet.
The idea was to get as many people out there as we could talking
about George Bush. This is my third convention in this job and in
terms of sheer volume, this is two or three times the volume we did
last time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of real news, or even real debate, what dominated
American news pages and airwaves last week was the sound of one
party clapping. How that played depended greatly on how much each
of the 1,600 news organizations at the convention, and myriad
others that watched from afar, was willing to go beyond the happy
talk and examine the nature of Bush's appeal and the issues that
defined his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said she was
impressed by the meticulousness with which the Republicans were
collectively putting on one face for the news media. On a stroll on
the convention floor before a session one evening, she came upon a
copy of the ``message points'' for talking to the media that
convention organizers had placed on every delegate's seat.
</P>
<P>
   The document was nine pages. ``I haven't seen anything this
detailed,'' she said. ``It's nicely structured to brief an activist
to make a case. Usually it's a two-page `message profile' with
sound bites in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson? ``The Republicans know what their message is,'' she
continued. ``They are able to outline it and outline the line of
defense, given the likely Democratic response.''
</P>
<P>
   An upbeat message seemed to be delivered pretty uniformly from
one end of the country to the other, from the pages of The Honolulu
Advertiser (``State GOP leaders say Bush will do well in Isles,''
said a Friday headline) to The Portland Press Herald (``Mainers
Uplifted by Bush Message''). Bush's acceptance speech on Thursday
night was not only the most prominently reported event of the week
but also the most favorably received. Commentators as diverse as
Jacob Weisberg of the Webzine Slate, Margaret Carlson of Time
magazine and the conservative columnist Robert Novak all gave it
admiring notices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The address, by Bush's chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson, was
loaded with quotable lines, and the media turned some into
overnight classics. Among the most often cited, a reference to
President Clinton: ``So much promise, to no great purpose,'' and a
dig at Vice President Al Gore: ``I am not running in borrowed
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the largest city in the governor's home state,
coverage of the convention was voluminous, particularly by the
strictures of local television news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been covering conventions a lot of years, and I never
remember one where so many local people were playing a role,''
observed Nancy Shafran, news director of KPRC, an NBC affiliate
that sent six staff members to Philadelphia. The convention led the
newscast every night, and on Thursday, the program was expanded.
``There was so much to cover it couldn't fit in the typical
35-minute show,'' Shafran said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's three network affiliates sent reporters to the
convention, but devoted a lot less time to what was going on.
Thursday night, in fact, none led the 6 o'clock programs with
political news; at 11 p.m., the speech moved up to the off-lead
position on WNBC. ``But first,'' Chuck Scarborough, the anchor,
announced as an introduction to a piece about a death from E. coli
bacteria, ``a family copes with tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   KNX, an all-news radio station in Los Angeles, site of the
Democratic convention next week, sent two reporters to the
gathering in Philadelphia and broadcast reports from there for 9 to
10 minutes every hour. And talk radio in Boston, a Democratic town,
was nonetheless consumed with the topic on the night of Bush's
speech. ``The crowd tonight would applaud and go crazy,'' said Jon
Keller, a WBZ radio commentator reporting from the convention
floor, ``if he held up a piece of French toast.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense that the response was preordained is probably what
turns off many potential viewers and listeners. Though the number
of people who tune in or log on to convention coverage locally is
hard to measure, nationally the viewership was down. On the three
major networks, for instance, an average of 16.6 million viewers
watched the 1996 Republican convention on a given night; this year,
the number dropped to 16.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the consummation of the `showbizification' of politics,''
Martin Kaplan, associate dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Southern California, said of the
convention. ``Whether it was better entertainment than `Survivor,'
that the audience has already voted on.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost invariably, the local stations had agendas in
Philadelphia customized to stories in their own backyards. Glen
Horn, executive producer of WFOR, a CBS affiliate in Miami, said
his reporter, Elliott Rodriguez, covered a meeting Bush held with
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of it had the bite of a juicy crime story. ``I
don't think that it had any great surprises,'' Horn said. ``Does it
even have the drama of conventions gone by? No. But it's part of
our history and for that reason alone we pay special attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, WLS, Chicago's ABC affiliate, found a home-grown angle
with a little mischief in it. The station covered a bomb scare in a
Philadelphia hotel triggered innocently by ticking alarm clocks in
a box. The clocks, it turned out, belonged to the Illinois attorney
general, Jim Ryan, who planned to give them away as Republican
mementos. Fans attending a ``Star Trek'' convention had to be
evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a shot with a Vulcan in it,'' said Eric Lerner, the
station's news director. He liked the story so much he ran it
twice.

IN FREE-AGENT MARKET, IT'S WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The money is dwindling fast. With one nine-player trade down and
apparently none to go, many of the alleged blockbuster deals are
being committed to rumor. Solid but unspectacular free agents like
Danny Fortson and Aaron Williams have been given presidential
suites by teams hoping to procure their services for minimal
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Great Free Agent Class of 2000 have almost
all been signed _ including Williams, who agreed to terms with the
Nets on Friday _ and the Chicago Bulls are still wondering where
everyone went and why they had to settle on Ron Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Krause can take heart. If Michael Jordan's old team
does not pull off a monster swap, survives yet another season of
fan backlash and saves its millions, the class of 2001 has much to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber, Dikembe Mutombo, Michael Finley and Antonio Davis
will have opportunities to be free agents. Depending on whether
several players opt out of deals, there are also Anthony Mason,
Tyrone Hill, Corliss Williamson and Jerome Williams to add to the
Bulls' talent-challenged roster.
</P>
<P>
   If Washington buys out Rod Strickland over the last year of his
deal in 2001-2, he would be a free agent going into next season.
</P>
<P>
   Several players are still on the market this summer, but not all
may take the $2.25 million exception being offered by teams.
According to a Pacific Division executive, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, many player agents are telling general managers to
find more creative ways to sign their clients _ given that the
exception will most likely balloon to $4.5 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   With annual allowed increases, a contract beginning at that
number could turn into a multiyear, $30 million deal next season.
That means instead of Fortson or Williams, the exception could go
to a free agent next season like Shandon Anderson, Doug Christie or
Christian Laettner.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible 2001 free agents who could secure those kind of
deals include Shawn Bradley, Erick Strickland, Bryan Stith, Chris
Gatling, Clarence Weatherspoon, Anthony Carter, Aaron McKie, Malik
Rose or Grant Long.
</P>
<P>
   Players will actually be weighing their contract offers from
their current clubs against a midlevel exception, meaning it may be
harder for teams to hold on to their best role players.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Webber is going to reap the largest reward. For
everyone who decried the end of the $100 million deal, well, it's
back.
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap will most likely be $42 million to $44 million
next season. A player like Webber, the All-Star Kings forward, can
receive 30 percent of his team's salary cap based on his experience
level of seven to nine years.
</P>
<P>
   If the cap were $42 million, Webber could receive $12.6 million
his first season. With annual raises, a maximum deal would total
out to $120.9 million over six years if he stayed with Sacramento.
That is $6 million less than Kevin Garnett's record deal signed in
1997, the one that infuriated owners before the lockout in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Dust Settles
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady smiled gleefully for the cameras
the other day, donning their new pinstriped Orlando Magic jerseys
and putting the focus back on the Magic four years after Shaq
migrated to Los Angeles and left the franchise reeling.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Hill, arguably the most accomplished all-around player
in the game, and McGrady, one of the NBA's rising stars, was a nice
coup, replete with all the attention deserving of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In Charlotte and Miami, they were also parading their new
players. Eddie Jones and Anthony Mason made Miami Coach Pat Riley
smile the same way acquiring Jamal Mashburn and P.J. Brown made
Charlotte Coach Paul Silas happy _ a nine-player deal both sides
deemed fair.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in San Antonio, the Spurs put the finishing touches
on acquiring Derek Anderson. Quietly, the 1999 NBA champions
reloaded. Among 29 teams searching to stay on top or improve, they
may end up as the real winners of the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Filling a huge hole at shooting guard with the best free agent
left on the market, they persuaded Anderson, 26, to play for $2.25
million next season. Anderson, who is 6-foot-5, averaged 16.9
points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.4 assists a game in 64 games for the
Clippers last season.
</P>
<P>
   He is a definite upgrade from Mario Elie, whom the Spurs will
now probably let go via free agency.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, San Antonio signed the one player they could not
lose, Tim Duncan, for three years and $33 million with a
fourth-year option. They also kept two other important pieces to
the puzzle, the aging Avery Johnson and the emerging Antonio
Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   In a whirlwind week, the Spurs inched closer to the Lakers and
Blazers. Persuading a young player like Anderson to play for an
instant contender rather than accept a sign-and-trade deal from the
Clippers to Denver was key.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Mark Bartelstein, agent for the Blazers forward Brian
Grant, was trying to portray his client's decision to turn down a
$90 million sign-and-trade deal that would have sent him to
Cleveland as noble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this speaks volumes about the man,'' Bartelstein said.
``It's incredibly unbelievable, in this day and age, for an athlete
to say so strongly, `It's not about the money.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Let's be clear on this: Grant did not turn down the money as
much as he turned down the notion of playing for the Cavaliers, who
wanted to break their ties with Shawn Kemp more than they wanted
Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Blazers find a team for him soon, Grant's decision to
opt out of a deal still worth more than $40 million may go down as
one of the biggest blunders of the off-season _ up there with the
Bulls' ending up with Ron Mercer and millions still to spend on
players who rejected them.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Bartelstein should be given the benefit of the doubt. A
long list of elite teams still have the midlevel exception left to
sign a player, a contract worth $2.25 million next year. If Grant
and his agent are truly unconcerned with the money, they will leap
at an opportunity to contend for a championship with another team.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West Retiring
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West is expected to quit Monday as team president of the
Lakers. Though he may remain as a team consultant, a four-decade
relationship between a player and a club will most likely come to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Kupchak, the general manager, will succeed West. And coach
Phil Jackson will most likely have more input on personnel
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Few American sports executives can claim the success of West,
just as few Hall of Famers can claim the playing success of West.
He won one championship as a player and six as an executive.
</P>
<P>
   When he was not lofting a half-court shot that found the net in
the finals or earning the moniker Mr. Clutch during his consummate
playing career, he was taking weighty risks in the front office _
risks that paid off miraculously.
</P>
<P>
   Clearing salary-cap room by unloading a multitude of players
during the summer of 1996, West gutted the Lakers in pursuit of
Shaquille O'Neal, even when it was unclear whether O'Neal would
return to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the Showtime Lakers purring and eventually rebuilt the
franchise with wunderkinds like Shaq and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   His health prevented West from attending games this past season.
Once the coolest of customers on the floor, his nerves can no
longer take the tension of a tight game.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to Rod Thorn and Hotrod Hundley, here's
hoping West Virginia's greatest ballplayer can find joy in the game
again, that Zeke from Cabin Creek makes the transition to
retirement more peacefully than fitfully. &QL;

TO BROADEN SUPPORT, MEXICAN VICTOR NOW WOOS HIS OPPONENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The weeks after Mexico's presidential voting have
always been a time for hand-kissing, when supplicants of all
stripes use any opportunity to express rapturous, supine loyalty to
the latest president-elect.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox has turned the traditional rituals upside down,
using the weeks since his victory in July 2 balloting to visit his
vanquished rivals, one by one, to apologize for his slashing
attacks on them during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For Mexicans, there is plenty of charm in what is a display of
humility perhaps as stunning as Fox's election itself. In the month
since he won the election, Fox has outlined a hugely ambitious
program of reforms aimed at modernizing Mexico after a century of
one-party rule. If he wants, as promised, to bring change, he needs
to broaden support.
</P>
<P>
   In neither house of Congress does his center-right party enjoy a
majority. So even as he has been working to solidify the eclectic
left-right coalition that helped him to victory, he has been
mending fences with the forces he vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening he met Francisco Labastida, the defeated
governing party candidate, whom he ridiculed as an ``errand boy''
before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Mr. Labastida of our intention to lodge an apology for
the harsh campaign,'' Fox said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   To foreign eyes, this might seem like simple good sportsmanship.
But in a country where presidents have enjoyed kinglike powers and
often acted with regal arrogance, Fox's magnanimous bearing has
seemed a remarkable shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our presidents have been as infallible as the pope,'' said
Jorge Chabat, a professor at the Center for Investigation and
Teaching in Mexico City. ``So it startles us to see Fox express his
apologies. He's inviting us to see that our rulers are made of
flesh and blood, and this is unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's behavior has broken with his predecessors' patterns in
other ways. Presidents-elect from the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which won every election from 1929 until Fox's
stunning upset, tended to keep their policy plans vague until they
took office. Their transition teams worked in secret. And in public
appearances, they maintained an aloof solemnity and spoke in opaque
terms that often left Mexicans puzzling over what the new ruler was
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, in contrast, has appointed a sprawling transition team,
with dozens of experts studying everything from tax rates to police
training to foreign policy, and their work is unfolding under the
glare of tumultuous media coverage. Fox has spoken bluntly in
interviews with television newscasters, radio hosts or newspaper
reporters virtually every day since his election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one thing _ I think he talks too much,'' said Hector
Aguilar Camin, a novelist who is host on a weekly political
round-table discussion on Televisa, the largest network. ``The risk
is that everybody is going to get tired of him. But it's great that
he's put his agenda out in the open, and I'd bet he has more
support now than when he won the election a month ago. He's
performed very skillfully.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fox does not take office until Dec. 1, but the next political
cycle will get under way with the first session of the new Congress
on Sept. 1. Fox's National Action Party will have 208 seats in the
500-member Chamber of Deputies. That means he will need to attract
43 votes to reach the 251-vote majority needed to pass legislation.
The former governing party will have 209 seats and the main leftist
party 53. In the 128-seat Senate, Fox's party will have 46 seats,
the PRI 60, the leftist party 15, and small parties the rest.
</P>
<P>
   It will take skillful negotiating to gain approval for even a
part of the new president's sweeping plans for remaking Mexico. He
hopes to open up both the electric power and petrochemical
industries to private investment, plans that infuriate powerful
unions. He wants to abolish several cabinet ministries, including
the attorney general's office, replacing that with a United
States-style Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   That would require several constitutional amendments, as would a
recent proposal to remove the prohibition on the re-election of
lawmakers and city mayors, a legacy of the 1917 revolution whose
war cry was ``Effective suffrage, no re-election!'' He has promised
to overhaul the educational system and to provide huge new credits
to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other promises will require hefty new tax revenues,
and when his economic advisers last month offered their first
suggestion for how to raise them, proposing to eliminate sales tax
exemptions for medicines and most groceries, there was an
outpouring of criticism on radio and television talk shows. Fox
quickly retreated, and Mexicans realized they had witnessed the
deft use of a U.S.-style political tactic, the trial balloon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is night and day from the way politics were handled in
the past,'' said Denise Dresser, a political scientist at the
Autonomous Technological Institute in Mexico City. ``Issues like
taxes were discussed behind closed doors by insiders and then
imposed on the public. Fox is showing a willingness to test citizen
reaction to initiatives and change them when there's resistance.
We're seeing the end of the imperial presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Fox still must persuade Mexicans to accept higher taxes, and
his evolving plans for fiscal reform are likely to be the focus of
the most intense debates of his first months in office.
</P>
<P>
   Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an influential Mexico City economic
consultant, argued in a recent report that Fox would face a
cash-flow squeeze far more severe than previously acknowledged
because President Ernesto Zedillo's economic advisers have
understated the financial burden they are leaving behind as a
legacy of a bank rescue from 1995 to 1997, which has so far cost
taxpayers $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate a period of hard learning for the new
government,'' Ramirez wrote. ``They will soon find out the need for
extra revenue is heavily underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox's recent attempts to make peace with his adversaries
suggest that he understands the difficulties ahead. One of the
first came on July 26 when he visited Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the
defeated leftist candidate, to ``present our apologies,'' as Fox
put it later, for calling Cardenas ``a traitor to the fight for
democracy'' during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, at a ceremony in which an electoral tribunal
formally certified Fox's victory, he asked the magistrates to
forgive him for another harsh campaign utterance. In January, when
the tribunal had ruled against him in a campaign dispute, Fox had
called the tribunal's legal arguments ``the grunting of swine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had chalked up that insult to campaign passions,'' Jose Luis
de la Peza, the tribunal president, said on Thursday. ``Obviously
it was an act of considerable nobility for him to offer an
apology.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same speech to the tribunal, Fox also sought conciliation
with gay Mexicans, whom he had offended with several homophobic
campaign remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's build a free and generous Mexico where nobody is
persecuted for their political or religious beliefs, life styles or
sexual preferences,'' Fox said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At daybreak Saturday, temperatures fell into the 40s in parts of
the Northeast as a cool air mass from Canada poured into the
region. Another cool morning is expected Sunday across the
Northeast before warmer and more humid air arrives Monday.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure drifting off the coast will provide New England
with plentiful sunshine, raising temperatures to seasonal levels by
Sunday afternoon. Farther west, a cluster of thunderstorms, on the
leading edge of sultry air, will affect Michigan and Ohio early
Sunday. The inclement weather will reach the Appalachians by the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Strong afternoon thunderstorms will erupt in the western Great
Lakes and Ohio Valley. As the storms circulate speedy air aloft to
the surface, damaging winds will occur in some spots.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the West will be seasonably hot. Isolated thunderstorms
will form near the high peaks of the Rockies.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FIRST STORM
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic hurricane season began a little later than usual
this year when Tropical Storm Alberto was christened near the Cape
Verde Islands off West Africa on Aug. 4. In 70 percent of the years
on record at least one tropical storm has formed by Aug. 1.
Tropical Storm Alberto which is still churning through the tropical
Atlantic took shape at 25 degrees west longitude. It now holds the
distinction of forming farther east than any tropical storm this
early in the season. Cool water near the west coast of Africa often
interferes with tropical storm development in that region. &QL;

GM PINS HOPES ON VEHICLE FOR ROAD WARRIORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Wash., Ind., Texas, Mo., N.J., Conn.)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Trying to capture the spirit of the times, General
Motors occasionally introduces a whole new brand, hoping it will
grow as popular as Cadillac, Buick or Oldsmobile. A decade ago it
brought out Saturns and Geos to tap a national desire for
affordable, sporty, fuel-efficient cars.
</P>
<P>
   Now GM is at it again. Its latest venture: the Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Jeep but far bigger, the Hummer started as a military
transport, the Humvee, which was used in the Persian Gulf war for
everything from launching missiles to ferrying the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War ended, the Humvee's manufacturer is looking to
civilian buyers. It has sold about 1,000 a year, for about $100,000
apiece, to affluent entrepreneurs, limousine companies and a
sprinkling of celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mike Tyson
and the rapper Coolio.
</P>
<P>
   GM recently acquired the Hummer brand, placing a big bet that
the decade-long trend toward ever larger and more
aggressive-looking sport utility vehicles would continue. Besides
selling the current version, GM will introduce at least two smaller
Hummer models over the next three years, at much lower prices than
the current model.
</P>
<P>
   With a national network of Hummer dealerships, and plans to
pursue the New York market in particular, the company expects to
make Hummers as common as BMWs, with sales approaching 150,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see a lot in New York City, places like Manhattan where
your affluent buyers are,'' said Michael DiGiovanni, GM's general
manager of Hummer operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the mass marketing of Hummers raises the same safety and
environmental issues that have dogged the largest sport utility
vehicles: extremely poor fuel efficiency, higher emissions of
smog-causing pollutants than cars, and a variety of risks and
annoyances to motorists in other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Even without its military look or a celebrity at the wheel, the
Hummer would be hard to miss: It is taller, much wider and a full
ton heavier than even GM's largest sport utility vehicle, the
Suburban. Indeed, while it seats only four, the current Hummer
weighs as much as two Jeep Grand Cherokees or three small cars.
</P>
<P>
   GM says its research shows that many prosperous baby boomers
cannot afford the current model but still love its military look.
GM's surveys have found that the Hummer is also the favorite brand
of teen-age boys and the third favorite of teen-age girls, after
only Volkswagen and Saturn. That is especially important to GM
because people tend to form lifelong preferences during their
teens.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer's teen-age admirers include Cooper Schwartz of
Bellevue, Wash. As a small boy, he used to collect model sports
cars _ Corvettes, Porsches and Ferraris. Now 17, he keeps a scale
model of a black Hummer on the shelf next to his bed, and dreams of
the day when he can afford a real Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the fact that the Hummer is a tank; it's like a tank
with fashion, it's like having your own war toy,'' said Schwartz,
co-captain of his high school football team. ``I like something
where I can look down into another car and give that knowing smile
that `I'm bigger than you.' It makes me feel powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Hummer can seem downright overpowering compared with
other passenger vehicles, raising the issue of safety.
</P>
<P>
   The current Hummer has 16 inches of ground clearance, half a
foot more than any other mass-market sport utility, and is designed
to climb over vertical walls up to 22 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations require car bumpers to be 16 to 20 inches
high. So the Hummer's height greatly increases the risk in crashes
that the vehicle will ride over cars' bumpers and door sills and
slam into the passenger compartment. And because the Hummer is so
heavy, it inflicts far more damage in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   While future Hummer models will have somewhat less ground
clearance and weigh somewhat less, they are being designed with a
central goal of ``unparalleled off-road performance.'' So they will
still be tall and heavy enough to pose problems for safety
engineers like Terry Connolly, GM's director of North American
vehicle safety, who said that his office had played little part in
the company's Hummer planning and design.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than other sport utilities, Hummers can block the view
of other motorists. While cars tend to be 5 or 6 feet wide, and
most sport utilities are a little over 6 feet wide, the current
Hummer is 7 feet 2 inches wide, and GM's prototype for a model the
length of the Chevrolet Tahoe full-sized sport utility is 6 feet 10
inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   GM says that the unusual width of Hummers is part of their brand
identity, so that even the smaller Hummers will be extra wide,
making them hard to park as well. The wide stance should reduce the
risk of their rolling over, however.
</P>
<P>
   Among the environmental problems, the Hummers will emit far more
air pollutants than cars. Current federal rules allow large sport
utilities to emit 5.5 times the smog-causing nitrogen oxides that
cars do. While Ford has improved its sport utilities and pickups so
they pollute no more than cars, GM does not plan to reduce air
pollution from its Hummers and other large sport utility vehicles
until required to do so by federal regulations in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is another issue. AM General, the military
contractor that developed the vehicle, says that the current Hummer
gets 13 miles to the gallon in the city and 15 on the highway. The
Hummer manages this mileage only because it has weak acceleration
and burns diesel fuel, which gives 35 percent better mileage than
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to make its next Hummer, like the current one, heavy
enough to be classified as a medium-duty truck and therefore exempt
from federal fuel-economy rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman, said GM would include
Hummers in its voluntary commitment, announced on Wednesday, to
have better gas mileage than Ford for sport utilities in 2005. GM
will have to make its other sport utilities much more efficient to
offset the Hummers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer as a passenger vehicle also troubles some U.S. war
veterans. Hummer buyers typically have not served in the military,
let alone fought in combat. ``It's like someone who always wanted
to be a cowboy and who goes out later in life and buys a hat and a
horse _ well, that doesn't make you a cowboy,'' said Bruce Harder,
a retired Marine colonel who is now director of national security
and foreign affairs at Veterans of Foreign Wars.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan administration's military buildup, a large
factory was built in South Bend, Ind., to manufacture 25,000 Humvee
military transports a year. Production soon plunged below 4,000
Humvees a year, so in late 1992 AM General began building nearly
identical Hummers for civilians on the same assembly line. GM and
AM General broke ground last Monday on a second Hummer assembly
plant in Mishawaka, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   GM will rely mostly on new models to increase Hummer sales,
while continuing to sell the current Hummer, which it is renaming
the Hummer H1. It plans to introduce in 2002 a $45,000 Hummer H2,
to be built in Mishawaka, with maximum sales of 40,000 a year. The
H2 will be the length of the Tahoe but considerably wider.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer H3, the size of midsize sport utilities like the
Chevrolet Blazer or Ford Explorer, is to go on sale the following
year for just under $25,000, as a higher-volume model aimed at a
market of young men. GM has also done a little work on a possible
Hummer H4, which would be slightly smaller and cheaper, but has
made no decisions on it.
</P>
<P>
   John G. Middlebrook, GM's vice president for North American
vehicle brand marketing, said GM would choose some of its most
successful dealers to sell Hummers. ``Like when we started up
Saturn, we have a clean sheet here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GM decided against a Hummer dealership in New York because of
real estate costs. Instead, it plans dealerships across northern
New Jersey and Long Island, N.Y., and at least one for Westchester
County, N.Y., and Fairfield County, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ballew, GM's general director for market analysis, said
that the rising concentration of wealth and income in American
society over the last two decades had been the single most
important social trend for automakers. A very large class of
high-income, fairly youthful households has been created, he said,
and these people care little about gasoline prices and other
expenses of operating a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to aim the H1, H2 and H3 at different markets. The H1
will be marketed to ``rugged individualists.'' These are people who
are irreverent and daring and want to be seen that way by other
people, DiGiovanni said. ``The rugged individualists are people who
really seek out peer approval _ they're really going to go off
road, go out in the desert and come back and tell people about
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keri Quinn, a 44-year-old bachelor and co-founder of a software
company in Dallas who sold his Nissan 300ZX sports car and raided
his retirement account to buy his Hummer, said he went on frequent
off-road driving trips with his friends but also liked the
thumbs-up signals he received from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer H2 is intended for ``successful achievers,''
especially people who perceive themselves as daring risk takers but
tend not to take risks involving their physical safety. ``They're
daring in the sense they may take a big stock-market position, like
buying 20,000 shares of an e-commerce stock,'' DiGiovanni said.
``They really have not much intention of going off road, but it's
really important for them that people tell them how successful they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer H3 will be for young buyers, including those under
25, and is still in the early stages of design. The United States'
top-selling Hummer dealer, Jim Lynch in O'Fallon, Mo., a suburb of
St. Louis, said 10 of the 162 Hummers he sold last year were sold
to people who were buying them for their teen-age children.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Frankel, the Houston owner of a factory that makes what he
described as ``hillbilly'' novelty teeth, said he had bought two
Hummers and planned to buy another for his 9-year-old daughter when
she turns 16. ``I think it's a great first car for a kid,'' he
said. ``They can't destroy it, and they'll be the envy of all their
friends.''

BELARUS IS WARNED TO CONDUCT A FAIR ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER

<P>
   MOSCOW _ A senior official of the Council of Europe has warned
Belarus that the human rights body will refuse to send observers
for parliamentary elections planned in October if the government of
President Alexander Lukashenko fails to ensure that the vote is
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very disappointed by the apparent lack of
progress in creating adequate conditions necessary for holding free
and fair elections in Belarus,'' Terry Davis, the chairman of the
council's political affairs committee, said in Minsk, the capital
of Belarus, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequence of our disappointment is that we will not
recommend to the Council of Europe to send observers to the
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that a final decision on whether European governments
would send observers would be made Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to withhold observers would further alienate
Lukashenko's authoritarian government and deepen the political
crisis in the country of 10 million, where opposition parties
clashed with security forces in large demonstrations last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lukashenko, a former collective farm manager, won election
in 1994 with an overwhelming majority, his original nationalistic
appeal and charismatic sway over the electorate have devolved into
repression of political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry of Belarus issued a statement calling
Davis' conclusions ``unjust and biased.'' The Council of Europe
delegation ``might have seen positive changes that have occurred
lately had they really wanted to see them,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   While Lukashenko has prepared for the elections, opposition
leaders have been subjected to arrest and prosecution on charges
relating to their political activities, leaving them barred from
participating in the vote. Some opposition leaders have simply
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply concerned by reports of human rights violations
and continued persecution and harassment for political reasons,
including sentences and imprisonment of potential opposition
candidates,'' Davis said. ``In the next 27 days, we will watch
Belarus.''
</P>
<P>
   Belarussian opposition parties are threatening to boycott the
elections if demands such as having their representatives join
electoral commissions across the country are not met.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARTA, Djibouti _ About 2,000 Somalis are sitting together here
in the heat, stretching to the limit their genius for talk in
search of a central government for a nation that lacks one.
</P>
<P>
   And after five months _ in cafes, in steaming little rooms or
under the big air-conditioned tent erected here _ they have gone
further than ever in reassembling the stripped bones of the Somali
state, which toppled in civil war in 1991. Hope is running
cautiously high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this is the moment,'' said Asha Haji Elmi,
leader of the women at the peace conference here. ``People are sick
and tired of this culture of war. We need a way out. And the only
way out is to have a national government.''
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons to be skeptical. Twelve attempts have
failed, and the warlords, who have kept Somalia in tatters, are not
on board.
</P>
<P>
   But the Somalis at this conference, in neighboring Djibouti, say
they are determined to reverse the hatred and clan fighting that
have made Somalia the No. 1 symbol of chaos in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have agreed on a national charter _ something like
a transitional constitution _ and within the next week expect to
elect a three-year, 225-member national assembly. They have
tentatively picked a temporary capital, in the southern city of
Baidoa. Already, the campaign for the next president of Somalia, to
be elected here by the assembly members, is in high gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if this process stopped dead in its tracks five weeks
ago, it still would have accomplished more than any of its
predecessors in aiding the reconciliation of Somalia,'' said Lange
Schermerhorn, the American ambassador in Djibouti. ``Now, of
course, it has achieved even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day brings its own drama, and the conference has nearly
collapsed several times. But it is moving shakily along, fueled by
endless talk, free roasted camel and the daily shipment of khat, a
mild stimulant found in a plant's leaves that are either chewed or
used to brew tea.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this round of talks different , Somalis and others
say, is that it is not based on the warlords, who carved up the
nation of about 10 million people with their militias after the
dictatorship of Muhammad Siad Barre fell in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The warlords were the main reason for the failure of the United
Nations operation to feed Somalia during a severe drought in the
early 1990s. In that effort, 18 American soldiers died in 1993,
ending Washington's appetite for sending troops to keep peace in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   That failure has haunted all subsequent efforts at peacekeeping
in Africa, and remains a major reason for reluctance to send
foreign troops into Congo, a broader conflict in a larger nation.
There is no suggestion of sending peacekeepers into Somalia again
as part of the plans to create a new government, though Somalia
presents less challenge for cohesion than most African nations:
Somalis share a common language, religion, ethnicity and nomadic
culture.
</P>
<P>
   For this conference, the warlords were invited, but just as
ordinary citizens or members of their clan. Instead, the talks
have, in theory, been based on the idea of a civil society _
including groups of elders, businessmen, religious leaders,
intellectuals and women.
</P>
<P>
   They have been joined by many of the half-million Somalis living
outside the country _ settling in places like Ethiopia, the United
States, Scandinavia and the Arab countries _ who say they want to
return to a stable home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This actually goes beyond the warlords,'' said Abdurahman
Ibrahim, 47, a former university professor in Somalia who is now a
businessman in Australia. Ordinary Somalis, he said, ``are coming
together and saying: Why do we fight? Why are our women becoming
widows? Why are we obeying people who call themselves warlords?''
</P>
<P>
   The talks have revolved around the country's clans. The clan
system has been one of the major forces dividing Somalia, but,
Somalis here argue, it is the only remaining social institution of
any strength. And so the seats in the assembly have been divided up
by the four major clans, along with some seats for minority clans
and 25 seats reserved for women.
</P>
<P>
   People here say the emphasis on clans has allowed the settling
of old scores, forgiveness for clansmen killed or land taken in war
_ all to the good. But critics argue that any solution based on
clans will merely keep the nation divided.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Djibouti, Ismael Omar Gelleh, who has spent a
substantial portion of his nation's meager resources _ as well as
his own prestige _ on the conference, has strongly argued for an
assembly based on regional representation.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of Somalia's clan-based society and the resulting
problems are evident everywhere, particularly in the division of
seats for the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, for instance, a man named Ali Muhammad
Ahmed, a 40-year-old accountant, lay on a mat under the shade of a
tree in protest. He said he had been on a hunger strike for four
days because his subclan, the Hingeye, had not been given a seat in
the assembly, though a brother subclan, the Warsangali, had been
given a seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will lie here until I receive what is right,'' he said. The
Hingeye, he said, has 600 members in northern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, it's only five people,'' Muhammad Adam, a 43-year-old
architect from the brother clan, said dismissively. ``If you can
find the 600, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam, who lives in England and left his job to attend the talks,
said he was worried about the emphasis on tribe. ``This tribal
thing has caused a lot of problems,'' he said. ``We fear that when
it comes to rebuilding the country _ like schools and hospitals _
people will fight over things along tribal lines.'' If the
conference succeeds, he added, ``I will back it 100 percent, but I
have my doubts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even if the conference does succeed, everyone concedes it is
only the first step on a long road.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a process, not an event, and that's important,'' said
Schermerhorn, the American ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Any new government will have to contend with the warlords, whose
power has diminished in recent years as businessmen and Islamic
groups have pushed for order, but who still have militias.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, the new government will have to deal
with two regions of the old Somalia that have gone their separate
ways since 1991 and established a good measure of order on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   One is Puntland, to the northeast, headed by Col. Abdullahi
Yussuf Ahmed. The other, and more influential, is Somaliland in the
northwest, which has proclaimed itself a separate nation and
lobbied for both international recognition and outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of Somaliland is Muhammad Ibrahim Egal, a prime
minister of all of Somalia in the 1960s and arguably Somalia's most
respected politician. He has refused to take part in the
conference, saying that he will not gamble with the accomplishments
of Somaliland until the south demonstrates stability.
</P>
<P>
   Somaliland also is concerned that many people at the conference
are former members of the Barre regime, which tried to destroy
Somaliland during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Many Somalis here still hope that Egal will join in, perhaps
even taking the position of president. Otherwise, people here say
any new government will have to negotiate with him.
</P>
<P>
   A leading candidate for president, Abdullahi Ahmed Addou, for
years the Somali ambassador to the United States, said that the
charter would allow for changes by the broader population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever will be agreed here in Djibouti is not the Koran,''
he said. ``It is not the Bible. It is not the Torah. It has to be
flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong sense here that if this conference fails,
Somalia is doomed to another decade of disorder. Outside nations
have already all but turned their back on Somalia, and Djibouti has
little else to give.
</P>
<P>
   Some important people are wagering their political futures on
the conference's success, among them Hassan Abshir, the former
mayor of Mogadishu, who until the conference began held a top
position in Puntland. He is now the leader of the conference here,
charged with keeping all of Somalia's determined and divided groups
talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling them the truth,'' he said. ``They have had nine
years. If they go back, never will they come back to another
conference. This is the last chance.''

U.N. PEACEKEEPERS ARRIVE TO GUARD ISRAEL-LEBANON BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ U.N. peacekeeping troops finally began
spreading out in force along Lebanon's border with Israel on
Saturday, after weeks of haggling over just where the border is and
22 years after their presence was first authorized.
</P>
<P>
   Convoys of white-painted armored vehicles began snaking through
the stony hills of southern Lebanon, occupied until May 24 by the
Israeli army and its proxy local militia, shortly after 6 a.m.,
carrying about 700 U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, a smaller vanguard, in platoon strength of
about 30 soldiers each, had taken up six positions along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, the operation was proceeding smoothly, with the
most serious incident being a brush fire that had detonated three
land mines near a newly established position of Indian troops.
</P>
<P>
   But the troop movement was halted after nine hours because the
troop movements were slowed by land mines and by the reluctance of
a number of local landlords to rent out their land for new U.N.
positions, fearing they would not be compensated by the Lebanese
government, said U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, officials said, the troop movement, which is to
resume on Monday went smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrillas, the effective force on the ground, quietly
turned over the fortified strongholds and observation posts they
had taken when the Israelis abruptly departed two months ago,
leaving the Christian-led militia called the South Lebanon Army to
flee in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, drawn from the regions predominately
Shiite Moslem population, had already pledged to cooperate with the
U.N. deployment and the expected sending of Lebanese army soldiers
and police to fill the security vacuum left when Israeli forces
left in May after a 22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the guerrillas are not giving up their weapons, which they
will stash away in their homes and other hiding places,'' a
Hezbollah official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arms of the resistance will remain steadily within reach
in the equation, but they will be kept invisible,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The full deployment of troops from the Indian, Irish, Fijian,
Nepalese and Ghanaian battalions of the command formally known as
U.N. Interim force in Lebanon, or Unifil, is expected to take
several days to a week. The force is being expanded from a strength
of 4,600 to about 6,000 troops. Including a detachment of Ukrainian
soldiers sent to dig up the land mines scattered around the area.
</P>
<P>
   A Lebanese force of 500 soldiers and 500 security police is
supposed to follow the U.N. troops into the south some 24 hours
after the United Nations sets up its posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready for it now but we want to see where Unifil
deploys so our special force knows where to go,'' said Lebanese
Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss.

FRIENDS FIND NEWS MEDIA IGNORING A FUNNY, CHARMING GUY NAMED AL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GORE-DINNER) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ After ``hello'' _ and what he said to
the waitress: Was somebody going to take his hat or was he going to
have to throw it on the floor? _ the first words out of Tommy Lee
Jones were, ``I'll answer any decent question that you have.'' As
though he might have to take his hat back on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had agreed to meet over lunch at the San Ysidro Ranch to
talk about his Harvard classmate Al Gore. But like so many of
Gore's intimates, Jones arrived aggrieved. And before coughing up
any stories from the old days, he had some venting to do.
</P>
<P>
   Even such a wobbly softball question as, ``So, you guys have
stayed in touch?'' got this response: ``We get together when we're
in the same city. Just like real people.'' Asked what Gore had been
like at Harvard, Jones said, ``Funny, a real pleasure to be around.
He still is.'' Jones cursed ``this stiffness thing'' and said that
reporters who attributed cynical motives to his friend ``are busy
writing about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every friend of Gore's, of course, has been through the
years of ``Hard Copy'' and paparazzi that Jones has endured as an
A-list movie star. But virtually all are similarly steamed over the
coverage of his presidential campaign, and just as frustrated that
the public perception of him seems distorted as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to talk about this?'' Jones said, nuking an
attempt to steer the conversation back to Harvard. Clearly, he and
others do. In fact, their complaints have become Topic A in
interviews with Gore's old friends, an assortment of mainly
nonfamous and nonpolitical types he met in school, the Army and
back in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   They do not recognize their Al Gore in the stories they read.
Almost invariably, they want to know why a man they know to be
decent, thoughtful and funny _ they always say funny _ is so often
drawn as not even quite human.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they have answers, too. And beyond their irritation at what
they see as a hostile press corps _ described in a recent article
in The New Yorker as ``palpably seething'' over their lack of
access to him _ these friends are probably better equipped than
anyone to see Gore's own role in the way he is portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Often, they point to his sensitivity and essential shyness.
``Behind closed doors he takes a lot of that stuff personal, takes
it harder than he can show,'' and then further withdraws, said
Steve Armistead, Gore's closest childhood friend, who runs the
roads department in Wilson County, Tenn. ``He does not show his
human side that well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's friends also suggest that there is an element of
willfulness, even a certain defiance, born of an enduring
ambivalence over the whole business of politics, in his unevenness
on the stump. To hear them tell it, he can and does decide when to
turn on the charm.
</P>
<P>
   Several of his friends used almost the same words, ``You've
probably never seen him be funny.'' Yet when contradicted, they
countered that a reporter could not possibly have seen him be
really funny _ ``fall-off-your-chair funny'' as one of them put it.
Fall-off-your-chair funny, they said, is reserved for those he
trusts completely.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Gore's charm is not only a gift he can bestow or
withhold at will, but a compliment to the person who is being
charmed. Put another way, those charmed by George W. Bush feel good
about the encounter, but are not likely to feel it was their own
special warmth or trustworthiness that made the connection
possible. Whereas with Gore, friends and acquaintances typically do
feel that his charm reflects well on them, and that it is to their
credit to have drawn him out.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, ``he'll let you into his soul,'' said Donna
Armistead, Armistead's sister and a nurse living outside Nashville,
who was Gore's first girlfriend. She, for one, says reporters are
not solely to blame for Gore's image problems. ``He's not being
himself,'' she said. ``He's going to have to take a deep breath and
say, `Look, this is me, and maybe I'm not an alpha male all the
time.' He's such a human person,'' she said, and should not be
afraid to show it.
</P>
<P>
   Friendly acquaintances like Mike Roche, who knew Gore in the
Army and now does marketing for Sears in Chicago, are more apt than
his closest friends to see any distortion in the way he comes
across as a function of the fact that the camera just does not seem
to like Gore as much as they do. ``I couldn't believe how stiff and
phony he looked on television,'' Roche said. ``I never saw a phony
second out of the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But his friends are convinced, too, that Gore is still getting
more than his fair share of bad press, a perception backed up by a
recent study by the Pew Research Center and Project for Excellence
in Journalism. Their analysis of news coverage from February
through June showed that most stories about Gore _ 76 percent _
focused on two negative themes, that he is tainted by scandal and
that he exaggerates. In contrast, the largest share of the Bush
coverage _ 40 percent _ reflected Bush's own message that he is a
different kind of politician.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's closest friend, Frank Hunger, a lawyer from Mississippi
who was married to Gore's sister Nancy, began an interview with a
tour of the Gore family photos on the wall in his Washington
office: ``See, there he is in earth tones'' years before he was
accused of being a slave to fashion consultants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get terribly upset that he's been mischaracterized by people
in the media world,'' Hunger went on. ``It sounds defensive to say
he is funny, he is honest, but I get upset when I see some of these
articles and some of these snide comments. I traveled with him in
'92 and it was great and there was not one single story about stiff
and awkward. What the hell happened?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, until the Clinton-Gore administration's second term,
Gore, who is himself a former reporter, had received overwhelmingly
favorable notices, including a series of puff pieces about ``Gore
chic'' in the months leading up to his 1988 presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Bob Somerby, a stand-up comic who roomed with Gore at
Harvard, is so offended, so consumed, by what he sees as the
unfairly harsh tone of the current coverage that he devotes a good
bit of his time to rebutting Gore stories in a Web review he calls
The Daily Howler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of sad because the spin has overtaken reality,'' he
said in an interview. ``The basic images I always challenge are the
stuck-up kid from the hotel, the kid who's not from Tennessee, and
the kid who's always trying to do everything right,'' he said. ``I
don't think anyone should vote for him because he did farm chores,
but he did do them. It's gotten to the point where when I see him
now it's `Oh, that is the guy I used to know.' When you hear
something 100 times you sort of think it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, a number of Gore's friends have stopped talking to
reporters altogether, which may have only compounded the problem,
and contributed to their sense that the Al Gore they read about is
nothing like the guy they know.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's childhood friend Gordon Thompson, a part-time farmer who
works in a tire factory and has visited the vice president in
Washington, said he, too, has just about given up on telling about
their summers on the farm. Those stories do not fit the stereotype,
he said, and almost never make the papers. Now he has caller ID,
and screens for area codes like Washington's 202 that are overrun
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When Gore's friends do talk, though, they frequently mention
what a loyal guy he is. Edward Blair, an old running buddy in
Tennessee, where he now is a U.S. marshal, remembers trying to talk
Gore out of visiting someone they had known as kids who was in jail
on a manslaughter charge. It was 1988 and he was running for
president at the time. ``I said, `How is this going to look?' But
he said, ``If you were in jail, wouldn't you want me to visit
you?'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet they also leave the distinct impression that Gore does not
share his emotions easily outside the Gore family circle.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the subject of how he really feels about the coverage.
Sometimes, he jokes about it. Other times, he intellectualizes it,
referring in a recent interview to ``the hostile takeover of
journalism by deconstructionism. I'm not complaining about it, but
the easy assumption that inner motive is obvious from context is
often just plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his friends' near-unanimous reaction to the way
he is coming across, he smiled _ and quoted a lyric from a song by
The Band, ``I don't have to speak, 'cause she defends me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said this: ``My friends are extremely loyal and I
treasure them more than I can say. I appreciate the fact that they
get their dander up. But we don't talk about it.''

PRESIDENT VETOES MARRIAGE-TAX CUT HE CALLS RECKLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Two days after Republicans wound up their
political convention with promises of tax relief, President Clinton
set up an election-year battle Saturday by vetoing as too costly a
tax break for married couples that is the cornerstone of the
Republican effort.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the Republicans in his weekly radio address of
advancing a series of ``tax giveaways'' that abandon the fiscal
discipline that has helped produce the longest economic expansion
in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't retreat from this opportunity of a lifetime to keep
our economy strong and move our country forward,'' said Clinton,
who signed the veto this morning during a visit to Martha's
Vineyard for a weekend vacation and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm vetoing legislation that represents the first
installation of a fiscally reckless tax strategy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The veto, which Clinton had long threatened, sets the stage for
a renewed partisan fight over tax policy when Congress returns to
Washington after Labor Day. It is a fight that Republicans
especially view as defining the parties in both the presidential
and legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, the spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
said Hastert planned to try to override the president's veto in the
first vote. He said the veto would put pressure on House Democrats,
who are competing for control of the chamber. Still, overriding it
would require a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate;
neither passed the bill by such a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks coinciding with Clinton's radio address, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, anticipated
the veto and rhetorically urged his opponent, Vice President Al
Gore, to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of tax code is it that penalizes marriage?'' said
Bush, speaking on a train platform in Pontiac, Mich., as he toured
the state. ``It's a bad tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet today _ and yet today _ President Clinton is going to
veto that bill. Vice President Gore, you need to tell your partner
not to veto the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, in their own weekly radio address, said Clinton was
turning his back on married couples and perpetuating the view that
the federal budget surplus belonged to the government instead of
the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that special and sacred moment when the bride and groom say
`I do,' they also unwittingly say `I do' to higher taxes,'' said
Rep. J.D. Hayworth of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Al Gore ``still peddle the shopworn slogan that
correcting this injustice is just a break for the rich,'' Hayworth
said. ``But Americans know better. We understand that two spouses
earning $25,000 each are not wealthy by any stretch of the
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have advanced plans to remedy the so-called
marriage penalty, a quirk in the tax code that forces many
two-income couples to pay more in taxes than they would as singles.
But the Republican plan is the broader one, giving an election-year
tax break to nearly all married couples, even those who do not pay
a marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a sticky one for Democrats, who are seeking to walk
the line between fiscal discipline and providing what is a
politically popular benefit. When the Senate backed the Republican
plan last month, providing $292 billion in tax breaks for married
couples over the next 10 years, seven Democrats broke with their
party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is urging a more modest tax-relief package intended to
benefit people of low and middle incomes. He has given himself some
wiggle room, however. Last month, Clinton said he would agree to
the Republican tax reductions for married couples if Congress
backed his proposal for a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
Republicans, who have their own, less sweeping prescription drug
initiative, refused.
</P>
<P>
   The two approaches over how to spend the record federal budget
surplus mirror the turf staked out by the two presidential
candidates. Gore has advocated a more modest tax-relief package
than his Republican opponent. Gore has called Bush's plan risky.
Bush dismisses Gore's stance as government as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took great pains at their convention in Philadelphia
this week to portray themselves as an inclusive party that reaches
out to people of all ethnic groups and income levels. But as
Clinton stumps on behalf of Gore, he knocks the Republicans for
favoring the wealthy and turning their backs on minorities. At a
Friday night fund-raiser for Hillary Rodham Clinton's New York
Senate campaign, he told a group of wealthy donors that Gore would
not leave anybody behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guys are going to give you a bigger tax cut than we
are,'' Clinton told 200 guests at the seaside gathering on
Nantucket. But he said the country as a whole would be better off
under Gore's stewardship, helping rich and poor alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give you lower interest rates and a better stock
market,'' the president said. ``You'll make more anyway. But I
think we ought to all go along for the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton compared Republican plans to spend much of the projected
surplus to a foolhardy person spending sweepstakes money before the
check arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever get one of those letters from Ed McMahon and
Publishers Clearinghouse?'' Clinton asked in what has become one of
his biggest applause lines of late. ``Think about it: `You may have
won $10 million.' Now, if you went out the next day and spent the
$10 million, you should support their program. But otherwise, you
ought to stick with us.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The standoff over tax cuts is a repeat of past end-of-the-year
budget confrontations, which Clinton has shown himself quite adept
at maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the Republicans profess to be relishing the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``House Democrats will have an opportunity to get rid of the
marriage penalty by overriding the veto,'' Feehery said. ``It's
going to be a tough fight. We're going to expose their real
proclivity for higher taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hayworth called Clinton the ``de facto campaign
manager'' for Gore and said the president's veto would hurt his
favored candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the best efforts of the punditocracy to say that tax
breaks don't matter,'' Hayworth said, ``for Mr. Gore's electoral
health, Clinton the campaign manager ought to reconsider.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats praised the president's action as fiscally
prudent. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., called Clinton ``wise to
veto tax cuts that are not directed at the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer added, ``He is right to be concerned that the huge cost of
the Republican tax cuts will bring us back to the days of
intractable deficits.''

BUSH COMES UNDER ATTACK FOR JESUS DAY PROCLAMATION IN TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four months ago in Texas, Gov. George W. Bush signed a
proclamation declaring June 10 to be Jesus Day, and urging all
Texans to ``follow Christ's example by performing good works in
their communities and neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation received little attention at the time, except
for some gratitude from a Christian organization that had asked
many governors to issue proclamations supporting its annual day of
charity, prayer and parades in Jesus' name.
</P>
<P>
   Now what seemed purely ceremonial has turned into a controversy
for Bush. As word of Texas' Jesus Day has spread through e-mail to
Jewish newspapers and church-state separationists, the Republican
presidential nominee has come under attack for insensitivity to
people of non-Christian faiths and a disregard for the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption is that Christianity is the norm for America,''
said Phil Baum, executive director of the American Jewish Congress,
``and that Jews and other minorities are here essentially as guests
at the sufferance of our hosts, in a secondary position, which is
an uncomfortable situation to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Baum called the proclamation ``an egregious and blatant
violation of the spirit of the First Amendment.'' He added, ``Jews,
Muslims, Buddhists, members of other faith groups, and nonbelievers
would have a hard time responding to the governor's call to
practice civic responsibility by following Christ's message on June
10.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has put his Christian faith front and center in the
campaign, has tried to project an image of inclusiveness to people
of all ethnicities and religions. In the past, he has been put on
the defensive for saying that the only way to heaven was through
Christ, and for naming Jesus as his favorite political philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   Now the governor's office has been receiving letters and e-mail
messages from people outraged by the Jesus Day proclamation, or
asking if it is true, said Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is sensitive to those concerns,'' Edwards said,
``but is also mindful of the longstanding tradition of governors in
both parties to honor individuals and organizations for their good
works through greetings and proclamations.'' Bush has also signed
proclamations supporting Bahai centenary day, Holocaust Remembrance
Day, and a Hanukkah celebration in Austin, she said. Bahaism is a
modern religion, originated in Iran, which stresses universal
brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether the proclamation caused offense, Edwards said, ``I
think everyone knows that Governor Bush is a religious person, and
he believes that faith can play an important role in people's
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation, which Edwards said was written by the
governor's staff, begins: ``Throughout the world, people of all
religions recognize Jesus Christ as an example of love, compassion,
sacrifice and service. Reaching out to the poor, the suffering and
the marginalized, he provided moral leadership that continues to
inspire countless men, women and children today.
</P>
<P>
   ``To honor his life and teachings, Christians of all races and
denominations have joined together to designate June 10 as Jesus
Day,'' it reads. ``Jesus Day challenges people to follow Christ's
example by performing good works in their communities and
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation was sought by the March for Jesus, an
Atlanta-based group formed in 1991 that organizes marches and
assistance for the poor in about 500 cities on the same day each
year. The group had previously sought proclamations commemorating
March for Jesus Day, but this year called the event Jesus Day. Ten
governors agreed to issue proclamations or greetings, but some
refused, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pelton, founder and organizer of the March for Jesus, said
in an interview: ``To me it would be a stretch to see that
proclamation as being demeaning toward other religions. It's meant
to point out that the things that Jesus taught are consistent with
what many religions teach. Instead of Jesus being a divisive name
in the community, we are hoping to establish his name as a point of
unity among people.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious groups routinely seek governmental proclamations, and
since such proclamations do not have the force of law, involve no
money from taxpayers, and call for no particular action, they are
very difficult to challenge in court, said First Amendment experts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a federal district judge did issue a temporary
restraining order against the city of Redlands, Calif., for
proclaiming a ``March for Jesus Day,'' saying it violated the U.S.
and California constitutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A declaration of support for religion is not the same as
declaring National Dairy Week,'' said Barry Lynn, executive
director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
``Any time government embraces a particular religious viewpoint it
violates the spirit of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase in the proclamation signed by Bush that ``people of
all religions recognize Jesus'' was proposed by the March for
Jesus, said Pelton, particularly to avoid offense. But it is this
assertion that seemed to most outrage observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of Islam,'' said Bruce Lincoln, the
Caroline E. Haskell Professor of History of Religions at the
University of Chicago Divinity School, ``all the major religions
emerged before Christianity, so there is no place for Jesus in
their original foundations and scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carefully worded this thing to make it look like they've
just got a good guy here, and so the state of Texas can have a
party for him without running into church-state problems,'' Lincoln
said. ``It's patently fraudulent.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERITON, Va. _ Fourteen years old and barely 4-foot-6, Amelia
Gomez spends her days stooped over, pulling weeds and picking red
peppers, often complaining that the pesticides give her rashes.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Velasquez, 13, who picks cherry tomatoes nearly 12 hours
a day, recently arrived on Virginia's Eastern Shore after a two-day
bus ride from Florida's tomato-growing region.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Arispe, 14, whose migrant family divides the year between
Virginia and his native Texas, is so proud of the $160 he earns
each week doing farm work that he says he wants to quit school to
help his family make ends meet. Some days his 11-year-old brother
joins in the picking.
</P>
<P>
   Amelia, Jose and Daniel are among hundreds of child farm workers
on Virginia's Eastern Shore, part of the estimated 150,000 children
16 years or younger who work on the nation's farms, picking fruit
and vegetables. For the most part migrants, these children often
work 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week, facing dangers from
pesticides and risking exhaustion and dehydration from toiling
under the sun.
</P>
<P>
   These children, many labor experts say, are among a steadily
growing group of young field hands and constitute one of the least
visible and most vulnerable workers in the nation. Their plight is
such that Democrats in Congress are planning to introduce
legislation next month to make it harder to hire 12-, 13- and
14-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes my fingers start to bleed, and then they start to
sting from the poison in the plants,'' said Herman Perez, a
14-year-old tomato picker who, with his older brother, arrived from
Guatemala three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Farm worker advocacy groups say many child farm workers are
exploited because they are vulnerable, scared to speak up and
desperate to hold onto their jobs and because many are illegal
immigrants. They are eager to help their families or to pay back
the smugglers who sneaked them across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Child farm workers are often paid less than the $5.15 minimum
wage, sometimes receiving $2.50 an hour. Growers often do not
provide them with toilets and drinking water, and some child
pickers say growers occasionally order them to resume picking even
when the 24 hours required by law have not passed after pesticides
are sprayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people think of agriculture, they think of the agrarian
myth and what a wonderful, nurturing, safe, wholesome environment
to raise a child,'' said Diane Mull, executive director of the
Association of Farm Worker Opportunity Programs. ``In some cases,
that's true, but it's certainly not true for migrant farm worker
kids. They're often breathing pesticides, they're often not paid
the minimum wage and they often end up dropping out of school.''
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers say children often provide them with fake IDs
stating that they are 18. And farmers deny exploiting these
children, saying that they do not overwork them and train them in
dealing with pesticides. In a report in June on child farm workers,
Human Rights Watch criticized what it said was a double standard in
labor laws, noting that children in nonagricultural jobs were not
allowed to work more than 40 hours a week but there was no such
limit for children doing agricultural work.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticized laws that did not prohibit 14-year-old
farmhands from working 70-hour weeks. Federal laws prohibit
children under 18 from doing hazardous work in nonagricultural
jobs, but the laws allow 16- and 17-year-olds to do hazardous work
on farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agricultural employment for kids is bloody dangerous,'' said
John Fraser, director of the U.S. Department of Labor's wage and
hour division, the main agency overseeing child labor laws. ``Only
6 to 7 percent of the jobs that young people take are in
agriculture, yet 40 percent of the work-related fatalities that
young people suffer are in agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   Child farm workers are divided into three groups: unaccompanied
migrants, usually teen-age illegal immigrants from Mexico or
Guatemala; children of migrant farm workers, who often force their
teen-agers to work and sometimes take children as young as 7 into
the fields to pick alongside them; and, last, about 40,000 minors
who are the children of farm owners and who start milking cows and
harvesting at an early age to learn how to operate the farms that
they may someday inherit.
</P>
<P>
   Thin, shy and soft-spoken, Herman belongs to the fastest growing
group of child farm workers, migrants who travel unaccompanied by
their parents. At 6:30 each morning, an old school bus takes
Herman, his 20-year-old brother and 30 other migrants to a
dew-covered tomato field. Herman strains to pull up weeds 3 feet
tall that hinder the harvest. Then from 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., he
picks tomatoes at the rate of 40 cents a bucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't pick nearly as fast as the experienced men,'' said
Herman, who fills eight to 10 plastic buckets an hour while others
do twice that. At 90 pounds, he struggles to toss the full 20-pound
buckets into a truck.
</P>
<P>
   By dusk, he is exhausted, his fingernails caked with dirt, his
fine dark hair matted from sweat. After work, he returns to a labor
camp where he sleeps in a small room with six other migrants. There
are two bunk beds and three mattresses are spread on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Herman says he has no regrets about leaving his family,
his school and his country. ``We're peasants,'' he said, ``and
people in Guatemala can't earn much money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His journey to the United States was grueling. After Herman was
smuggled into Arizona, the smugglers stuffed him, his brother and
30 others into the back of a truck that carried them to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 48 hours, and we didn't have anything to eat,'' said
Herman, who owes the smugglers $1,850. ``It was very hot. There was
no water. Some people fainted. We were very weak when we got
here.''
</P>
<P>
   For a recent 60-hour week, he received a $240 check. That
translates to $4 an hour, but his managers said he received the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security and other deductions were taken out, his boss
said, but many farm workers wonder if their bosses pocket the
deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, poverty drives the two largest groups of child farm
workers _ those like Herman who come from other countries and those
like Jose Arispe, born in Texas but compelled to work because his
father makes less than $10,000 a year doing farm work. On average,
the adult farm worker earns less than $7,500 a year, partly because
many find work for only eight months a year. Their incomes are cut
back further because federal laws do not require that farm workers
receive time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Farm workers' advocates say growers are happy to hire these
youngsters. But many farmers say they prefer not to hire young
workers but are forced to because of a labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmers' view is that workers under age 18 lack maturity
and are not particularly productive workers, and they do things
that are foolish and dangerous, so you prefer not to have them
around the farm,'' said Bryan Little of the American Farm Bureau
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in 1938, it set
more lenient standards for children doing farm work than
nonagricultural work, largely because farm work was seen as
wholesome and family-oriented. Agriculture has changed immensely
since then with the advent of huge corporate farms and of a network
of more than a million seasonal and migrant workers, many of them
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Children's advocacy groups say the laws need to be changed.
``Farm-working juveniles have second-class status _ they enjoy
fewer rights than their nonfarm-working peers, and they are
exploited while the government looks the other way,'' the Human
Rights Watch report said.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, of the Labor Department, said the government was
increasing its investigations into improper use of child farm
workers. Last year it cited 46 farms for violations involving 102
minors. There are 1.9 million farms in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The government is spending more for day care centers for young
migrant children, and for migrant teen-agers, it is financing
special programs, including summer schools, to keep them from
dropping out. But all this may not be enough to keep Jose Arispe in
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not doing well in school,'' said Jose's mother,
Elizabeth. ``He wants to quit school. But I don't think that's a
good idea. But he said he needs to work and contribute money to the
family.''

ADMINISTRATION PLANS CUTS IN MEDICARE PAYMENTS FOR ANTI-CANCER
DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to save money for Medicare, the
Clinton administration is planning to cut payments for anti-cancer
drugs administered to patients in doctors' offices. This could
affect hundreds of thousands of elderly patients.
</P>
<P>
   The move has provoked an outcry from patients, doctors, nurses
and members of Congress, who say the cuts will make it financially
impossible for many cancer specialists to provide chemotherapy in
their offices.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, says
the cuts are justified because Medicare, the federal health
insurance program for the elderly and disabled, is paying too much
for the drugs _ far more than doctors pay for many of the
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the government would reduce the ``excessive
Medicare payments'' later this year, perhaps as early as Oct. 1,
because federal investigators had obtained more accurate data
showing what doctors actually paid for the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said they would send many of their Medicare patients to
hospitals for treatment, causing inconvenience to patients while
increasing costs to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., said: ``I am very concerned about
the impact of these cuts on cancer patients. Many oncologists will
find that it's financially impossible to provide chemotherapy
services in their offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors confirm that they receive more than they pay for some
drugs, but insist that the extra payments are essential to cover
chemotherapy costs not reimbursed by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute illustrates the passions aroused when the fate of
cancer patients gets mixed up in debates over drug prices and
doctors' income.
</P>
<P>
   At least 120 members of Congress _ 69 Republicans and 51
Democrats _ have signed letters to Shalala expressing alarm about
the administration's plans. Many complained that the administration
appeared to be acting unilaterally, without soliciting public
comment, as agencies usually do before making major changes in
federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph S. Bailes, former president of the American Society
of Clinical Oncology, which represents 15,000 cancer specialists,
urged the White House to ``reconsider and rescind these cuts.'' He
estimated that 750,000 Medicare beneficiaries received chemotherapy
in doctors' offices each year. Most have cancer of the breast,
colon or lung.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said he was not surprised at the criticism from cancer
specialists because they derived substantial amounts of income from
Medicare's payments for drugs. He said the White House had asked
Medicare officials to assess whether the cuts would harm access to
care or the quality of care.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Patients should not be hurt in any way, but taxpayers should
get a fair deal,'' Jennings said in an interview last week. ``The
current reimbursement policy is unsustainable. It's appropriate to
reimburse doctors for the cost of the drugs they purchase, but they
should not be allowed to mark up the price by 20, 70 or 700
percent, as they do now in some cases.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study by the Department of Health and Human Services said
that Medicare payments for 22 drugs, including many cancer drugs,
exceeded the actual wholesale prices by 29 percent, or $447
million, in 1996. For eight of the 22 drugs, it said, Medicare paid
more than twice the actual wholesale price.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, most cancer chemotherapy has shifted from
hospitals to doctors' offices. Doctors say the cuts in Medicare
payments would reverse that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare's policy is important for two reasons. At least half of
all patients receiving chemotherapy in this country are on
Medicare, cancer experts said. Private insurers, which cover other
patients, often follow the government's example and could be
expected to lower their reimbursement rates as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a threat to the Medicare program,'' Bailes
said. ``It's a threat to cancer care in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen L. Stovall, executive director of the National Coalition
for Cancer Survivorship, a patients' group, said, ``I'm not
interested in helping the physician make more money, but I am
worried that patients may have less access to care as an inevitable
and unintended consequence of these cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Barton C. McCann, who was the chief medical officer of the
Medicare program from 1986 to 1998, said the cuts ``may have the
unintended consequence of making it financially impossible for
oncologists to treat patients in their offices.'' If Medicare
beneficiaries cannot receive chemotherapy there, McCann said, they
will seek it at hospitals, where care is more expensive, and
``total costs to the Medicare program could rise'' as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare generally does not pay for prescription drugs outside a
hospital, but there are exceptions. Medicare does, for example, pay
for drugs provided ``incident to a physician's service,'' including
cancer drugs given to patients by injection or infusion in a
doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors receive separate payments for the drugs and for the
service provided when they or their nurses administer the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors acknowledge that they can buy some cancer drugs,
especially older drugs, at prices lower than what Medicare pays.
But, they say, Medicare pays much less than what it costs to
administer the drugs. Federal officials agree that the doctors'
``practice expenses,'' including the costs of medical staff,
supplies and equipment, far exceed the amounts recognized by
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For years, doctors say, the markup on cancer drugs has partly
offset the inadequacy of the payments for administering
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1998, Medicare paid doctors the average wholesale price
of cancer drugs. Payments were reduced by a 1997 law, which said
that Medicare would pay ``95 percent of the average wholesale
price,'' but the law did not specify how that price should be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 and again this year, President Clinton proposed a
further cut. He wanted to pay 83 percent of the average wholesale
price. Clinton said that would ``eliminate the physician markup for
outpatient drugs.'' Shalala said the cut would save Medicare $2.9
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has rejected that approach, but Clinton administration
officials said they had found a way to achieve a similar result by
different means. They intend to redefine ``average wholesale
price'' to reflect the lower prices that they now believe are
available to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the government obtained wholesale prices from trade
publications like the Red Book, published by Medical Economics, a
unit of Thomson Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., and Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, said
``wholesale price'' was understood by Congress to mean the price
listed in such publications.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Shalala said, the government will use the data it
recently obtained from catalogs of certain drug wholesalers. The
Justice Department compiled the data in an investigation of drug
pricing under Medicaid, a separate program.
</P>
<P>
   By redefining ``average wholesale price'' in this way, federal
officials said, they can reduce payments for drugs without any
change in federal law or regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most immediate action we can take without
undergoing the formal rule-making process,'' Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss said the question of how to pay for cancer drugs had
been repeatedly addressed by Congress in the last few years. ``It
is,'' he said, ``disturbing that the Department of Health and Human
Services would seek to circumvent those congressional actions by
unilaterally adopting a new definition of average wholesale
price.''

A WOMAN WHO WILL CHANGE THE FACE OF POLITICS IN THE DEEP SOUTH  

</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Karla Drenner will change the face of Georgia
politics, though she would rather not talk about that. She will
talk about her two 4-year-old children and about her interest in
the environment and education. But only reluctantly will she
acknowledge that after the election in November, she will become
the first openly gay state legislator in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Drenner defeated the Democratic incumbent, June Hegstrom, in the
primary last month, and with no Republican or third-party
candidates on the ballot in November, her election from her
suburban Atlanta district to the Georgia House of Representatives
will be a formality.
</P>
<P>
   The only openly gay legislator in the entire South is Glen
Maxey, who has been representing Austin in the Texas House of
Representatives since 1991. When the Georgia General Assembly
convenes next year Drenner will be the first in the Deep South,
which is made up of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina
and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Drenner, who has a doctorate in public policy and 15 years of
experience as a consultant for several companies on environmental
health and safety, edged out her opponent by campaigning hard on
these issues in a district that is 60 percent black and has a small
openly gay minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they cared about was quality representation,'' Drenner
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sloan Wiesen, a spokesman for the Gay and Lesbian Victory
Fund in Washington, which helps gay candidates in campaigns for
political office, said: ``The Deep South is one of the areas where
we still have a long way to go. There still are some people who
would rule out voting for someone just based on their sexual
orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not illegal in Georgia to deny housing and employment
based on sexual orientation, and a law that would bar gay couples
from adopting children has been debated in the General Assembly but
never passed.
</P>
<P>
   These are issues that many gays in Georgia hope Drenner will
work to resolve. She accepts the attention uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a candidate who is gay, not a gay candidate,'' she said.
``I didn't run to become the first openly gay person in the
Legislature. I ran because it was my dream, and I finally had
enough courage to actualize it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Drenner, 38, does not want her public service to be defined
by her sexual orientation, some say she may be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Woolard, who became an Atlanta councilwoman in 1997 and
the first openly gay person elected to public office in Georgia,
said of Drenner:
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to have to create a balance for herself between
being the standard bearer for all gay people, and assuring her
constituents that she's not a single-issue candidate. For gay
elected officials, if you do anything on behalf of the gay
community, it suddenly becomes reflected as your entire agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But gays say they hope that Drenner's visibility as a lesbian
will be an important step forward for gay rights in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Drenner said she was aware of the opportunity, and welcomed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can put a face on a stereotype, I think that in
and of itself creates change,'' she said. ``I think that my being
there will create change. Some of these people may have never met a
gay person before, and at least now they'll have the opportunity.''

MONTREAL'S GAY CELEBRITY CHEF REFUSES ROLE IN GAY PRIDE PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ When Montreal's huge gay pride parade rolls through
downtown on Sunday, organizers expect more than 100 marching groups
and 500,000 people, either watching or walking.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the parade will march without the one Montreal resident
whose recent coming out caused the biggest media frenzy regarding
homosexuality that French Canada has seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find these pride parades ridiculous,'' said Daniel Pinard, a
celebrity television chef, whose congenial disposition masks a
cantankerous spirit. ``I have always hated parades, all these
people singing to the same tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Last New Year's Eve, Pinard said he decided, at age 57, to stop
smoking, to stop drinking, and to make public his homosexuality.
The decision by Pinard, a prominent member of Quebec's celebrity
star system, to speak publicly about being gay set off Quebec's
most publicized coming out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did 11 TV shows, 16 radio programs, and I got 4,000
letters,'' Pinard said recently over dinner, a gastronomic
excursion in which he never sipped wine or lit up a cigarette and
largely talked about what it is like to be gay in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   When the day for his announcement arrived last March, Le Journal
de Montreal, a tabloid that reminds its readers daily that it is
``the number one French daily of America,'' used yellow ink to
highlight the headline on the cooking star's decision to talk of
his ``homosexualite.'' A soap opera star magazine ran his photo on
its cover, and upscale French newspapers devoted dozens of columns
and articles to digesting his decision.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, media attention mushroomed because a familiar
household figure for the last 25 years had decided to talk about
being gay. But in the largely laissez-faire society of modern
Quebec, interest seemed to grow because when Pinard came out, he
came against something: homophobic television comedy shows and
radio talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   While some people in the United States may believe that their
country has an exclusive franchise on radio and television shows
that many perceive as offensive, this city of commuters offers a
wide selection of radio talk show hosts pandering to the perceived
prejudices of their audiences, largely suburban white men trapped
behind steering wheels. In the late afternoons, off-color comedy
shows take over, pitching raunchy fare to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   One television program, ``Piment Fort,'' or ``Hot Pepper,'' had
degenerated, Pinard said, into ``mean programming, where they make
fun of gay people, of short people, of ugly people, of fat
people.'' He added, ``They would insinuate that someone was gay,
knowing full well it would harm him. I was amazed that no one
protested.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinard, a silver-haired man who still burns with resentment over
the day half a century ago when a schoolmate taunted him with an
insulting French term for homosexual, decided to denounce ``Piment
Fort'' on an intellectual talk show, ``Les Francs-Tireurs,'' or
``The Snipers.''
</P>
<P>
   The response was overwhelmingly positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the letters I got, only 10 were opposed,'' said Pinard.
``I had police cars stop, and policemen get out to congratulate
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did his appearances lead to discussions of attitudes
toward gays, but the province started debating the subject of
bullying in general. One letter of thanks came from a 10-year-old
boy who said he was lampooned at school because he stuttered.
Another came from the mother of a short boy whose schoolmates threw
derogatory nicknames at him picked up from ``Piment Fort.''
</P>
<P>
   People involved with producing the show have taken a low
profile, refusing to speak with most journalists. On Wednesday,
Jean Bissonnette, the producer, said in a brief interview: ``We
don't have any comments to offer. We don't want to feed what we
call the Pinard affair. He has his own cause to push.''
</P>
<P>
   Normand Brathwaite, the show's host, boasted last spring to
Journal de Montreal, ``I back up what I say.''
</P>
<P>
   While Canadian television's celebrity chef may have scored
points for tolerance, his outspokenness began to antagonize other
gay people after he started last month to serve as spokesman for
Gai Ecoute, this city's leading gay telephone hot line and social
service referral service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ones who have attacked me, were the gay press,''
Pinard said over a plate of quail at his favorite St. Catherine's
Street restaurant, Le Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's thriving gay press wondered why Pinard should be
considered a gay spokesman when he called Montreal's gay community
a ``ghetto,'' and said that, if there were a pill to become a
heterosexual, he would take it in 30 seconds. On talk shows, he
routinely says he wants to be known for what he does in his
kitchen, not in his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want people to watch me, and think, `There's a gay
who cooks,''' Pinard said, explaining in part why it took him 40
years to come out. ``I prefer for them to think, `Here is a guy
makes food, and who has some funny mannerisms.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the gay label as his overriding identity, he said:
``Ambiguity is the zest of life. I hate it when they categorize you
in a little category.''
</P>
<P>
   These views, gay leaders and journalists contend, are
insensitive to gay people in Quebec who have banded together for
mutual support. Even though Montreal is considered a tolerant place
by tourists, recent surveys indicate that about two-thirds of
Montreal gays have not revealed their sexual orientation to their
co-workers and that a similar portion have seriously considered
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really expressed a lot of disdain for the gay community,
and that created a chill,'' said Yves Lafontaine, editor of Fugue,
a gay magazine. ``He can have his own opinions, but not as
spokesman for Gai Ecoute.''
</P>
<P>
   So at the gay pride march on Sunday, when the large Gai Ecoute
group rolls down the parade route, Mayor Pierre Bourque of Montreal
will be riding atop the lead limousine. The mayor, a heterosexual,
will be filling in for Gai Ecoute's spokesman, the man who set the
city talking this year about homosexuality.

   A's Can Thank Their GM For Their Success
</P>
<P>
   No, Jason Giambi said, he was not responsible for his team's
acquisition of his brother, Jeremy, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy approached me about it,'' Giambi, Oakland's most
productive hitter, said recently, referring to the team's general
manager, Billy Beane. ``He said: `We want to get your brother. What
do you think?' I'm like, `Oh yeah, that'd be awesome.' So he went
out and did it. It wasn't any of my doing. It was all Billy Beane's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics are basically all Billy Beane's doing. A
challenger for the American League West championship and the leader
in the AL wild-card division, the Athletics are in Chicago this
weekend playing the team with the league's best record, then come
to New York for a three-game series with the Yankees that will end
the most rigorous segment of their 2000 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics will have played 10 successive series, a total of
30 games, against teams with winning records, and they will have
lived to tell about it. They began Saturday's schedule with a 15-10
record in those games, having increased their wild-card lead from
one and a half to three and a half games and sliced their distance
from Seattle from three games to one.
</P>
<P>
   Their position is somewhat remarkable considering that, in this
age of payroll disparity, they have one of the five smallest
payrolls in the major leagues. Among the lowest-paid players on
that payroll are Mark Mulder and Barry Zito, rookie starting
pitchers who epitomize the idea that the Athletics are ``all Billy
Beane's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulder and Zito, neither of whom began the season with Oakland,
are pitching in only their second seasons professionally. Mulder
turned 23 on Saturday; Zito is 22. Both left-handers, they will
start in the series against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had a covey of position players who were already
here or would be here in the next year or two,'' Beane said,
explaining the presence of the young pitchers. ``When we went into
the Mulder and Zito drafts, we tried to find the most polished
pitchers so they could be part of this. We passed on some pitchers
who maybe had a higher upside but might not be ready as quickly. We
needed to get pitching prospects here quickly to mesh with the good
young position players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics made Mulder the second player chosen in the 1998
draft; Zito was the ninth the next year. Mulder became a member of
the Oakland rotation April 18 and responded with a 5-2 record in
his first 13 starts. He has since slumped, going 1-5 in his next
seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   Zito is a more recent addition, pitching his first major league
game July 22 and gaining a 1-0 record and 2.37 earned run average
in three starts.
</P>
<P>
   The rotation has another young pitcher, slightly more
experienced than Mulder and Zito. Tim Hudson, 25, is the team's No.
1 starter in his fourth professional season, second in the majors.
He is scheduled to pitch against the White Sox on Sunday with his
12-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   The young position players Beane referred to are abundant,
whether or not Jason Giambi, at 29 with a .325 average, 27 home
runs and 95 runs batted in, qualifies. Shortstop Miguel Tejada is
24, third baseman Eric Chavez is 22, catcher Ramon Hernandez is 24,
left fielder Ben Grieve is 24 and center fielder Terrence Long is
24.
</P>
<P>
   Beane himself is young, 38, a former major league outfielder,
whose wisdom was well ahead of his playing talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sort of retired as a player on spot,'' Sandy Alderson
recalled, ``when he found out the advance scouting position was
open. He applied for the job and did a great job in that
capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson was the Athletics' general manager when Beane played
for them in 1989, the last season of his decidedly unspectacular
career. Starting in the Mets' organization, Beane produced a .219
average in 148 games and 301 at-bats over six seasons. He has
already accomplished more as a general manager, which he became in
October 1997, after Alderson groomed him for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for the game, an
excitement for the game that translated into a great deal of energy
and tremendous work ethic,'' said Alderson, now the top baseball
operations executive in the commissioner's office. ``He just ate
and slept the game. Beyond the enthusiasm, he's as intelligent as
anyone I've ever met in the game. He grasped concepts and really
was receptive to new ideas and different approaches to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   One approach that Beane has learned well is how to construct a
team with a payroll less than a third of the Yankees' pay sheet.
The Athletics have not won anything yet, but the real test for
Beane will come if they do reach the playoffs for a couple of
seasons and the good young players remain good.
</P>
<P>
   Those players will also accrue major league service time and
will reach the point in their careers when they can become free
agents. But the owners, not Beane, will determine the type of
contracts the players are offered.
</P>
<P>
   Beane, meanwhile, will continue searching for good young players
and making judicious trades, such as the two deals he made with the
Mets last July that brought Long to the Athletics to play center
field and Jason Isringhausen to be their closer.
</P>
<P>
   Isringhausen was not a closer in the Mets' system, but Beane saw
the potential long distance. The 27-year-old right-hander has
adapted well to this role, gaining 25 saves in 30 chances this
season. Except for a four-game stretch early in May, during which
he squandered three save chances, Isringhausen has been steadily
effective. His success has served as another example of Beane's
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any doubt when I left that he would do an
exceptional job,'' Alderson said of Beane. ``That's one of the
reasons I felt comfortable leaving.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Everett's Tantrum Costly
</P>
<P>
   The 10-game suspension Carl Everett earned with his temper
tantrum has ended, and none too soon for the Boston Red Sox.
Without their No. 1 power hitter and run producer, the Red Sox won
five and lost five.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, no one knows what Everett might have done in those
games (hitting, not erupting), but during his absence, the Red Sox
averaged 3.8 runs a game compared with 5.4 in the 10 games before
his suspension. Had they been able to score five or six runs a game
in four of the five games they lost, the Red Sox would have won the
games.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, they fell an additional two and one-half games behind
the Yankees without Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The Deal(s) With Surhoff
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone the Yankees talked to in the weeks leading
to the nonwaiver trading deadline wanted shortstop Alfonso Soriano.
If they could have divided their top minor league prospect into
several parts, the Yankees could have had any number of outfielders
and pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos wanted Soriano for Rondell White. The
Baltimore Orioles wanted Soriano for B.J. Surhoff. The San Diego
Padres wanted Soriano for Surhoff. Whoa. How many teams does
Surhoff play for?
</P>
<P>
   Right now only one, the Atlanta Braves, though the Mets would
like to have acquired him for their outfield. But first story
first.
</P>
<P>
   How could the Padres have had Surhoff and traded him to the
Yankees for Soriano? By engineering a three-team deal that would
have also included the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the Orioles would have sent Surhoff to San Diego
for outfielder Eric Owens, catcher Carlo Hernandez and Jeremy
Owens, a minor league outfielder. The Padres then would have
packaged Surhoff with the starting pitcher Matt Clement and the
reliever Donne Wall and shipped the package to the Yankees for
Soriano and several other minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The germ of the three-way deal was the Yankees' attempt to get
Clement for their starting rotation. But the teams couldn't agree
on appropriate payment so Kevin Towers, the Padres' general
manager, asked Brian Cashman, his Yankees counterpart, if there was
another player he could get elsewhere to justify the package of
players the Padres wanted. Surhoff, Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the Padres and the Orioles progressed to the point
where Towers thought they could make a deal. But then Syd Thrift,
the Orioles vice president for baseball operations, asked Towers
this critical question: Are you getting Soriano in this deal?
</P>
<P>
   Why do you have to know, Towers replied. Because, Thrift said.
</P>
<P>
   Because if the Orioles gave the Padres Surhoff and he then went
to the Yankees for the player the Orioles had wanted for Surhoff in
direct talks with the Yankees, Thrift's standing with his employer,
Peter Angelos, would not be worth a broken bat.
</P>
<P>
   So Towers felt obliged to admit that yes, he would be getting
Soriano. End of three-way transaction.
</P>
<P>
   But the collapse of those talks prompted the Orioles to renew
their effort to send Surhoff to the Yankees for Soriano. But the
Yankees refused to change the stance they had held since the
winter: They would not swap Soriano for Surhoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets wanted Surhoff, but when rumors cropped up last winter
that he might be traded to the Mets, Surhoff, wanting to stay in
Baltimore, placed the Mets on his no-trade list. The Braves weren't
on it, so the Orioles traded him to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Soriano, meanwhile, remains in the Yankees' organization. There
had been much talk about the Yankees' willingness to trade him to
the Expos for White, but that possibility turned out to be all talk
and no intention. The Yankees kept dangling Soriano because they
wanted to keep Montreal interested while they searched elsewhere
for an outfielder they would rather have had. Surhoff was their No.
1 choice, but it didn't happen.

ISRAELI PULLOUT TURNS LEBANON MILITIA INTO REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIBBUTZ KABRI, Israel _ Even the crescent moon, redolent of
Islamic religious symbolism as it hangs limpid over the
Mediterranean on a hot summer's night, seems like a curse now to
the embittered Lebanese Christian refugees living makeshift
existences at this lovely old kibbutz a few miles south of the
Lebanese border.
</P>
<P>
   Ten weeks ago the 17 Lebanese families who now live here were
among the 6,500 people who fled in panic into Israel when Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, in his push for Middle East peace, suddenly
withdrew Israeli forces from southern Lebanon after 22 years of
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the withdrawal was acclaimed in Israel, which had lost
more than 1,000 troops in southern Lebanon, it spelled disaster for
some 2,000 officers or men of the South Lebanon Army, the militia
force of Christians, Muslims and Druze that had helped Israel
maintain its grip.
</P>
<P>
   The militia handled many of the occupation's less pleasant
tasks. With their wives and children, they dashed helter-skelter
across the border into Israel in cars laden with personal
belongings, as towns and villages where they were once overlords
were overrun by Hezbollah, the militant Islamic guerrilla group
that harassed the Israeli forces and finally pushed them out.
</P>
<P>
   Now the militiamen and their families are quartered at kibbutz
guest houses, Israeli army barracks and hotels across Israel,
mainly in the rocky terrain that runs eastward from the port of
Haifa to the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Their hope, and Israel's, is that most of them will eventually
be accepted as immigrants by Australia, Canada, Germany, Sweden or
the United States, or a handful of other countries with large
Lebanese communities. So far, though, only about 400 of the
refugees have obtained visas and moved on, while the rest remain in
limbo in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It is a situation replete with difficulties for the militiamen,
and for Israel, as their alliance in Lebanon runs into underlying
realities that always dogged ties between them.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Israel, despite the generous support it has
offered so far, is not a natural long-term home for refugees who
are at once Maronite Christians and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   For another, many of the militiamen and their wives are deeply
bitter about the pullout, believing that Israel should have stayed
on in the occupation zone and given the militia the military
backing to fight on against Hezbollah or, at least, offered more
than the 36 hours' notice of the pullout that the militiamen say
they received.
</P>
<P>
   As they pass their days around plastic tables set out on the
kibbutz's lawns, the Lebanese argue endlessly about their plight
and their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are liars, the Israelis. They promised us all good
houses, and look what we got, two rooms on a kibbutz!'' one woman
said last week as she and her friends discussed the situation with
a visitor; most of them requested anonymity out of fear of
reprisals against relatives still in Lebanon. Another woman, who
asked to be identified by the pseudonym of Leila, responded
angrily.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, not liars,'' she said. ``We are 6,500 people, with
nothing, and it's not reasonable to think the Israelis could find
us all nice big houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Although about 400 of the original refugees have returned to
Lebanon, that option has been virtually ruled out for most of the
others by the 15-year prison terms that Lebanese military courts
have handed out to 800 members of the militia force who took their
chances by staying behind in Lebanon, or simply failed to leave in
time.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences have been far more severe than most of the militia
members expected after an earlier, partial pullout by Israeli
forces from a part of the occupation zone last year. The members
who gave themselves up then mostly got prison terms of a year or
two, or even, in the lesser cases, immediate release.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Lebanese trials, the men have been found guilty of
``collaborating with the enemy,'' Israel, and of ``entering an
enemy state,'' Israel again, which militiamen and their families
visited frequently for training, shopping and vacations before the
pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese prosecutors have said they will stage trials in
absentia for some senior officers who fled, and they threaten
sentences of life imprisonment at hard labor, without parole,
especially for those linked to the torture and death of Lebanese
who were victims of the occupation. These include Hezbollah
prisoners who disappeared or died while in a notorious
militia-controlled jail near the southern Lebanon town of
Marjayoun.
</P>
<P>
   At Kibbutz Kabri, a place of grassy lawns, spreading trees and
flame-red bougainvillea bushes that looks down from rocky hills
toward Haifa, almost all the refugee militiamen are from Marjayoun.
Some were senior officers, majors and lieutenant colonels, others
high-ranking members of the militia intelligence units associated
with the worst abuses against civilians that occurred in the
occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   All now say they were blameless in the killings of civilians and
Hezbollah prisoners. But even if they were, Israel has to deal now
with men who presided, in the occupation zone, over a largely
lawless society where drug running, car theft and extortion made
easy fortunes for the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, Israel finds itself in a double bind, since the
militiamen, many of whom were recruited as teen-agers, and few of
whom have any professional or trade qualifications, will not be
easy to integrate into Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Western embassies in Tel Aviv, including those
of Australia, Canada and the United States, have so far been
grudging in granting immigration visas to militia applicants,
perhaps fearing, in individual cases, that they might be accepting
ne'er-do-wells, or even men wanted for murder or other forms of
mayhem in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the militiamen and their families at Kibbutz Kabri are
living in a modest degree of comfort that refugees elsewhere might
envy.
</P>
<P>
   Each family has a two-room home in motel-like guest
accommodations at the kibbutz. They can eat free meals in the
kibbutz's communal dining room, or cook for themselves with free
supplies _ meat, vegetables, milk and sugar, among other things _
that are delivered to the kibbutz two or three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Each militiaman receives a monthly stipend of about $190, with
$375 for couples, and an additional $37.50 for each child _ a total
of about $450 to $500 for most families.
</P>
<P>
   All the refugees have been given temporary residence status in
Israel, entitling them to free medical care, including
hospitalization. An Israeli army liaison officer assigned to each
group acts as a kind of ombudsman and counselor.
</P>
<P>
   All refugee children who wish to will attend summer camps, and
have places in the fall at Israeli schools that will offer
Arabic-language classes taught from Lebanese textbooks. For adults,
there are Hebrew lessons, an offer that has not, so far, proved
compelling for most refugees, as their goal is to migrate
elsewhere.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli military spokeswoman, who declined to be named,
acknowledged in a telephone interview from her office in Jerusalem
that some of the Lebanese families were upset about their
situation, particularly at the slowness of the Israeli bureaucracy
in finding permanent housing for them, and at the seeming
reluctance of Western countries where many have relatives to accept
them as immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are quite angry with Israel,'' she said. ``But we
are working day and night to take care of these people, and to
enable them to have a good life in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs, for Israel, have already run into millions of
dollars, but there are few grateful voices at Kibbutz Kabri. A
major complaint focuses on the suddenness of the Israeli
withdrawal, which was completed virtually overnight, over six weeks
ahead of Barak's target date of July 7.
</P>
<P>
   This left many militia families rushing to pack suitcases and
driving hurriedly to Israeli border posts, often with Hezbollah
fighters right behind them, threatening to open fire.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the families abandoned cars in their panic, and threw
suitcases across the border fence, causing clothes and other
belongings to fall out and hang pathetically from the barbed wire.
Once in Israel, many were provided with used clothing and other
household necessities by Israelis. Some pooled their money to buy
refrigerators and satellite dishes so they could watch Lebanese
television.
</P>
<P>
   For virtually all of them, it was a hard fall from their lives
in Lebanon, where most had spacious homes, wardrobes full of
expensive clothes, and luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   Among the men, conspiracy theories abound, including one that
posits a secret deal between Israeli commanders and Hezbollah, the
Lebanese guerrilla force. One former militia intelligence officer,
cooking supper on a hot plate, noted that Israeli troops had
completed their pullout without a single casualty.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he suggested, it was a case of Jews _ Israeli
officers _ consorting with the Muslims of Hezbollah against a
secure future for Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the evils of Lebanon, it is Christians who have to pay
the price _ only Christians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the women, though, there seemed to be little interest in
the convoluted politics, just a concern for their families' future.
One woman broke into tears as she spoke to a visitor. ``Tell me, is
there any future for us?'' she said. ``I have lost my home, my
family, all my belongings. I feel destroyed. And now I am in a
strange land, with no future. All I ask for is a little hope.''

EDITORIAL: PUTIN'S POLITICAL GYROSCOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, the new Russian president, has been a man in
motion since his inauguration in May. He has curbed the power of
Russia's regional governors, confronted the business moguls who
control large pieces of the economy, proposed a flat tax and fired
a gaggle of generals. But just where Putin is headed remains
uncertain. So far much of the action seems more clearly aimed at
rebuilding a strong central government than at advancing democracy
and reform.
</P>
<P>
   Given the powerful centrifugal forces that have long tugged
against Russian statehood, and the chaotic and corrupt
administration of many regions in recent years, there is reason to
construct an effective federal government. But as Putin draws power
back to the Kremlin, the temptation to fashion a new autocracy will
be great, especially for a man steeped in the ethic of the KGB,
where he worked for many years. It was encouraging to hear him
renounce a return to authoritarian rule earlier this summer, and to
commit himself to the protection of political and economic
freedoms. Yet nearly every step he has taken has been ambiguous on
precisely that point.
</P>
<P>
   By curtailing the power of Russia's 89 governors, Putin may be
acting to clean up years of misrule by local potentates. Many of
the governors enriched themselves through illegal schemes and
prevented Moscow from collecting taxes in their regions. But in
other regions, the devolution of authority after the collapse of
communism gave enlightened leaders the opportunity to create
democratic institutions and thriving market economies. An
indiscriminate effort to rein in all governors is bound to trample
the good work along with the bad.
</P>
<P>
   The same concern applies to Putin's dealings with Russia's
tycoons. Their economic and political power should be diminished,
but not by unlawful or unconstitutional means and not in a way that
inhibits the media enterprises that many of them own. The
government's dubious criminal case against one of the oligarchs,
Vladimir Gusinsky, was wisely dropped after Putin made known his
unhappiness with the crude attack. But an economic vise is now
being tightened around Gusinsky's company, Media-Most, probably
with the assent of the Kremlin. The goal seems to be to wrest
control of Russia's main independent television station from
Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's economic program embraces free-market principles, and
calls for a long overdue simplification of the tax system. But
Putin seems to think that the government can re-engineer the
economy from the top down, another example of his tendency to
centralize power in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Putin's authority is partly checked. He had to settle
for less control than he wanted with both the governors and the
businessmen. His dismissal last week of six generals allied with
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev suggested he could not fire Sergeyev
himself in a dispute over miltary policy. But as he learns to
wield the nearly dictatorial powers that the Yeltsin-era
constitution gives him, Putin will have to decide whether he
intends to build a durable democracy or just rebuild the machinery
of state. &QL;

FOR SKIPPER, SMOOTH SAILING IN THE WAKE OF A STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   By HERB McCORMICK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   About midway through ``The Perfect Storm,'' the film adaptation
of Sebastian Junger's phenomenal best-seller, the skipper of the
32-foot sailboat Mistral, sporting a jaunty yachtsman's cap and a
highbrow New England accent, makes an offhand remark about his vast
offshore prowess. It's a setup line. He's silly, smug and about to
get walloped.
</P>
<P>
   As readers of the book know, the character is based on Ray
Leonard, the skipper of Satori, a Westsail 32 that was abandoned by
its crew in a North Atlantic gale during a U.S. Coast Guard rescue
operation in the fall of 1991. Portrayed by Junger as a strange
introvert with a fondness for the bottle, Leonard has now been
skewered both in print and by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With each subsequent retelling of his story, the lines that
define who Leonard is and what happened during that terrible,
perfect storm become more blurred. In fact, Leonard is a retired
research ecologist for the U.S. Forest Service, a former college
administrator and an accomplished long-distance voyager with a
Coast Guard license and tens of thousands of miles under his keel,
and he does not fall within the neat, nasty boundaries of his
depictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen the movie and I probably won't until I can
borrow a copy of the video,'' Leonard said last week from the small
home he is building for himself in western Vermont. ``But as for
hats, I just wear a ball cap at sea. It keeps the sun out of my
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger, who did not speak to Leonard for his book, did not
return a phone call seeking comment for this column. But in a 1997
interview about Leonard in The New York Observer, Junger said, ``He
didn't sound like the kind of guy I wanted to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame, because Junger, whose book focuses on the loss
of the fishing vessel Andrea Gail and includes vivid writing about
meteorology, long-line fishing and Coast Guard heroics, missed a
grand opportunity to capture the passion of a long-distance sailor.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, 72, bought his Westsail in 1974, the same year the
rugged little double-ended yacht was featured on the cover of Time
as the perfect vessel for folks ready to chuck it all and head for
the South Seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satori is the Buddhist word for enlightenment,'' Leonard said.
``I was at the midpoint of my career, and the boat gave me new
insight into myself. Whenever I got into a bad fix with her, she
always did better than I thought she would. She was very well-named
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1974 to '91, Leonard sailed Satori hard and often, mostly
alone. The boat was well equipped with designated storm sails, and
Leonard had plenty of chance to use them in roughly 60,000 miles of
sailing. Divorced in 1985, he moved aboard Satori the same year. In
October 1991, accompanied by Karen Stimson and Susan Bylander, two
women he had spent the summer working with, Leonard and Satori set
out from New Hampshire bound for Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the voyage was a nightmare. Several days into
the trip, after receiving a Mayday call relayed by a commercial
vessel, a Coast Guard helicopter plucked Satori's crew from a
roiled sea. While that fact is indisputable, the events leading up
to the rescue remain unclear; there are two very different versions
of Satori's fateful passage.
</P>
<P>
   In Junger's book, which is based largely on interviews with
Stimson, the sailors survive through the initiative of the women,
who are forced to take action when Leonard, ``sullen and silent,
sneaking gulps off a whiskey bottle,'' refuses to do so. In what he
describes as 30-foot seas, Junger reported that Satori was
``starting to lose the battle to stay afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, however, dismisses much of Junger's account. ``I'd
guess the seas were 15 to 18 feet, tops,'' he said. ``Satori had
been in much worse. It was a very uncomfortable ride, but the boat
was sound and we weren't taking on water, except for a few gallons
that came through the hatch. And the drinking bit is just totally
untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was employing standard tactics for weathering extreme
conditions: he had battened Satori down and was content to wait
things out. ``You never head towards shore in a heavy storm,'' he
said. ``It's too dangerous. And the weather forecast said a
hurricane was heading towards Bermuda, so it didn't make sense to
keep going that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said he did not authorize a Mayday call, though he did
give the women permission to radio the Coast Guard to update
Satori's position. And when the chopper did arrive, he considered
staying aboard Satori. Ultimately, when he was ordered to leave, he
complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I knew the crew would have to jump in the water, I wasn't
comfortable about having them go alone,'' he said. ``Also, I knew
if I disobeyed I wouldn't be able to land in a U.S. port for
several years, and I've seen expatriates in foreign ports. I didn't
want to be one.''
</P>
<P>
   Stimson, who was on vacation from her job in Maine last week,
was unavailable for comment. Interestingly, according to a friend
of hers, Stimson now owns a Westsail 32.
</P>
<P>
   What transpired after the rescue supports Leonard's contention
that Satori was still seaworthy when her crew leapt off her
transom. Several days later, the boat washed up on a Maryland
beach. A bag of personal items that Leonard had mistakenly dropped
when he left Satori was still on the afterdeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``A park ranger found my phone number in it,'' Leonard said.
``He called me up and said come get your boat. It was fine. I went
down and had her hauled off, cleaned her up, then sailed her to
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard continued to sail Satori until this spring, when he sold
the boat to a Texas couple. As for the fallout from Junger's book,
which Leonard has read, he said: ``People who don't know me who've
read it have preconceived notions. I've only had one boat delivery
job, and I used to get plenty. I'm not bitter, but I don't think
the book or movie explained what sailing's all about. Bluewater
sailors are sharp, self-reliant, and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Leonard no longer owns Satori, he is still drawn to
the sea. Earlier this year, fulfilling a lifelong dream, he went to
Alaska in search of the same work that took the lives of the crew
of the Andrea Gail. Once there, he signed on aboard a salmon
trawler. Of all things, the sailor became a fisherman.

EDITORIAL: THE SOFT-MONEY CONVENTIONS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 6:
</P>
<P>
   There were two parallel conventions in Philadelphia last week,
one a televised coronation of the Republican ticket inside the
First Union Center, the other an endless parade of off-camera
fund-raising events in hotel suites, private clubs and restaurants
throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   In these genteel settings and others _ including a string of
private railroad cars provided by the Union Pacific Railroad and a
quiet Pennsylvania trout stream, where House Speaker Dennis Hastert
found that donors were biting more readily than the fish _
corporations and wealthy individuals unloaded millions of dollars
in an effort to buy influence with a Bush-Cheney administration and
with Republicans in the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, of course, are not alone in their addiction to
the soft money that has come to dominate the modern campaign
environment. Vice President Al Gore and the Democrats will engage
in much the same tawdry exercise when they convene in Los Angeles
next week. But it is worth pausing for a moment to reflect on the
GOP's week of excess, not least because of the hypocrisy it
exposes.
</P>
<P>
   The convention hall was full of talk about political morality,
about restoring decency and respect and integrity to the Oval
Office, code words for not only President Clinton's personal lapses
but also his casual abuse of the White House _ the private coffees,
the renting out of the Lincoln bedroom and all the other tacky
devices he and Gore used to underwrite their political futures. But
like so much else at this convention, there was a big gap between
words and reality, and while the words promised reform, the reality
was the spectacle of huge sums of money changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, this conclave marked the emergence of a new
group of superdonors known as Republican Regents, wealthy
individuals and corporations that have given at least $250,000 in
the election cycle that began in January 1999. This elite cadre now
consists of 139 members whose largesse makes the 600 or so members
of Gov. George W. Bush's Team 100 ($100,000 minimum) look like
pikers. With checkbooks like these floating around town, little
wonder that the Republican National Committee was able to raise $10
million at a single lunch on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have their equivalent, the Leadership 2000
contributors ($350,000 and up) and the Jefferson Trust (at least
$100,000). At the moment, the Republicans are ahead, having raised
$137 million by the end of June. But with three lucrative months to
go, the two parties together are on pace to raise a half-billion
dollars, about double the $260 million in soft money raised four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money has been making a mockery of the post-Watergate
campaign finance laws ever since the political moneymen discovered
a loophole that allowed unlimited contributions to the political
parties, as opposed to the $1,000 limit on donations to individual
candidates. It is these huge contributions that now dominate the
political environment, poisoning the legislative system, turning
the national committees into giant shakedown operations and the
nation's lawmakers into full-time mendicants.
</P>
<P>
   Many corporations are coming to hate this system and about 30
have broken with it. But plenty of others came to Philadelphia with
open arms and open bars. Even those that no longer write checks,
like Time Warner, throw lavish parties and, in the case of General
Motors, provide limousines and other ``in-kind'' services.
</P>
<P>
   The simple truth of the matter is this. The morality and
integrity that Dick Cheney and Bush invoked so easily last week
will never become a reality in Washington until the present
campaign fund-raising system is destroyed. Bush and the Republican
platform both promise to end soft-money donations from corporations
and labor unions. But they say nothing about the big individual
donors, whose contributions account for at least half of the soft
money the party and its various fund-raising arms have taken in so
far. To his credit, Gore has promised to shut down individual gifts
as well.
</P>
<P>
   It was reassuring to hear Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who did not
mention campaign reform in his address to the convention, tell a
television interviewer later that he would ``tie up'' the Senate
until it approved the bill he has co-sponsored with Sen. Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., to end soft money. ``We will have blood all over
the floor,'' he said, ``until we accede to the demands of the
American people to be represented in Washington again.'' These are
noble, fighting words. But what reform really needs is a president,
any president, who will go to bat for it. This addiction runs deep.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 6:
</P>
<P>
   While most New York fans have been focusing on the pennant runs
of the Yankees and the Mets, those who have ventured to Giants
Stadium this spring and summer have been treated to an even more
stirring drama. That is where the MetroStars, the area's entry in
Major League Soccer, have pulled off one of the most heartening
turnarounds in recent local sports history. The MetroStars have
gone from league laughingstock to a dominant power. Going into this
season's final stretch, the team holds a commanding lead in its
Eastern Division.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars' odyssey from worst to first may not yet be the
talk of the office water cooler. This is, after all, a game still
capable of driving traditional American fans to despair with
limited scoring and the occasional 0-0 tie. But the MetroStars have
averaged 17,674 fans a game this season, the second-highest number
in the five-year-old league.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer at Giants Stadium is a festival of diversity, with
bilingual public announcements and an intermingling of suburban
soccer families, European expats wearing Manchester United or Inter
Milan jerseys, and members of the Colombian diaspora who come to
cheer on their compatriot, Adolfo (El Tren) Valencia, the team's
leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the MetroStars may be better known in Germany than they
are locally, thanks to the acquisition of the legendary German
defender Lothar Matthaeus. The 39-year-old player has been injured
much of the season, but his arrival in New York this spring put the
league on the map, not to mention on German TV.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaeus is more the exception than the rule. Unlike the former
Cosmos of the deceased North American Soccer League, the MetroStars
rely on a core of talented young American players like Mark Chung,
Petter Villegas, Clint Mathis and Mike Petke.
</P>
<P>
   For those fans who need a crosstown rivalry to get the blood
boiling, help may be on the way. MetroStars' investors, John Kluge
and Stuart Subotnick, have exercised their option for an expansion
team in the 2002 season. Both Queens and Long Island are among the
sites being considered.

NEAR ASHEVILLE, N.C., A 1900-STYLE INN RISES AT BILTMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LYN RIDDLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE, N.C. _ A hundred years ago, shortly after George W.
Vanderbilt built a 250-room French Renaissance country estate
outside this western North Carolina city in the Blue Ridge
Mountains, he carefully sketched out plans for a 50-room inn on the
property.
</P>
<P>
   His list began with $3,200 for 449 doors and windows. It ended
with a total: $17,509.29, excluding wallpaper, plumbing, heating
and electrical work.
</P>
<P>
   Today, on a hill on what remains of Vanderbilt's estate, some
two miles from the country home he called Biltmore House, a
213-room inn is taking shape. The Biltmore Co., led by Vanderbilt's
great-grandson William A.V. Cecil Jr., will spend $31 million on an
inn designed with the intent of giving guests a glimpse of what it
was like to stay on the lavish estate about 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 900,000 people visited Biltmore House and its
outbuildings, including a conservatory and a winery. As a tourist
destination, Biltmore now employs about 1,100 people, and it served
as a location for several movies, including ``Richie Rich'' and
``Being There.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard T. Pressley, the chief financial officer and executive
vice president of Biltmore Co., said that market research showed
that 60 percent of the visitors to Biltmore House stay in local
motels, and most stay in midpriced chains with room rates of about
$100 a night. Most visitors are between 35 and 54 years old, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at this project for 20 years,'' Pressley said.
Once convinced it was sound financially, company officials spent 18
months interviewing architects and contractors. They selected
Thompson, Ventulett &AMP; Stainback Associates of Atlanta as its
architect, along with Design Workshop of Aspen, Colo., landscape
architect; Hughes Design Associates of McLean, Va., interior
designer; and W.G. Yates &AMP; Sons Construction Co. of Philadelphia,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The designers took some of their cues from the work of the
distinguished team that designed Biltmore House before the turn of
the century. Richard Morris Hunt, architect for the center part of
the Fifth Avenue facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York, designed the house. Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed New
York's Central Park with Calvert Vaux, created the landscape plan.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the hotel, to be called the Inn on Biltmore Estate,
``the intent was partially to create a building that didn't compete
with the house but gave guests a sense of staying at the house,''
said Scott Sickeler, the project's lead architect. ``What caught me
by surprise was Olmsted and the influence he had over the estate,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The designers sought to give guests the same sort of experience
when driving up to the inn that visitors get on the three-mile
approach road to the house, a road that meanders through five
different North Carolina landscapes. The house is not visible until
visitors get right up to it. In a similar manner, guests will be
given only small glimpses of the inn as they wind their way up the
hillside.
</P>
<P>
   Landscaping, influenced by Olmsted's work, has already been done
to allow a year's growth before the inn's opening, scheduled for
March 1.
</P>
<P>
   The inn faces Mount Pisgah and Mount Pisgah National Forest.
``It is 270 degrees of uninterrupted wilderness,'' Sickeler said.
Other views are of Biltmore House itself, framed by woodlands and
mountains, and of downtown Asheville, several miles in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Biltmore Co. decided to manage the inn itself, rather than
contract with a national chain, because corporate officials wanted
direct control over quality, Pressley said. The company hired as
general manager Michael Chaffin, who previously managed the Stephen
F. Austin Hotel in Austin, Texas, and the Omni hotel, also in
Austin. Biltmore's hospitality division is managed by Thomas B.
Ruff, a senior vice president of the company who previously worked
with Marriott Hotels and Resorts and Hyatt Hotels Corp. Chaffin and
Ruff say their goal is to create an inn that will win top ratings
from guidebooks like those from AAA and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   In-season room rates will range from $160 to $195 a night. Nine
suites will be available, ranging from $900 to $2,000 a night. The
$2,000 suite has 1,400 square feet with a sitting room and one
bedroom with an optional second bedroom. Discount packages will be
available, but prices have not been set, Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   The inn can accommodate small corporate functions, but not
conventions. Its largest meeting room will be the 1,800-square-foot
Vanderbilt Room, and it will also have two smaller meeting rooms
and two banquet rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby will have a large fireplace that mimics the huge
fireplaces of Biltmore House. Vanderbilt was a book collector, and
so the inn will have a library, an unusual feature for a hotel. The
restaurant will be called simply the Restaurant at the Inn on
Biltmore Estate. Guests will also be able to eat in the more casual
restaurant at the estate's winery, just down the hill. Admission to
Biltmore House _ $32 for adults _ will not be included in the room
rates, and the inn will have a gatehouse, meant to keep out the
merely curious.
</P>
<P>
   The company has incorporated some of the signature features of
Biltmore House in the inn's design. Limestone, used on the exterior
of the house, will cover the lobby floor. The roof will be slate,
and oak for the library came from trees on the property, as did the
black walnut floors for the private dining room.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The inn will compete with two other venerable Asheville hotels,
the 510-room Grove Park Inn, which is now building a $27 million
40,000-square-foot spa, and the 36-room Richmond Hill Inn. The area
also has a number of upscale B &AMP; B's as well.
</P>
<P>
   The company will begin taking reservations for the inn in
October, and group events scheduled after April 15, 2001, are
already being booked.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanderbilt connection with the Asheville area began when
George W. Vanderbilt, a grandson of the steamboat and railroad
industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt, visited the North Carolina
mountains in the late 1880s. The area was known for its healing
mineral springs and fresh mountain air. In 1888, Vanderbilt decided
it was the place for his country home. He began buying land,
eventually assembling an estate of 125,000 acres, and commissioned
designs for the house and its landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   The house took six years to build. It covers four acres and
included many amenities unusual for its time: elevators, electric
lights and telephones. The first major event held there took place
on Christmas Eve in 1895, when Vanderbilt, then a 33-year-old
bachelor, entertained dozens of guests who had arrived in five
train cars from New York and Newport, R.I. Through the years,
Vanderbilt and his wife, Edith, entertained many celebrities at
Biltmore, including Henry James, Edith Wharton and John Singer
Sargent.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt died in 1914 during an emergency appendectomy in
Washington, and his widow returned to the estate, where the
couple's only child, Cornelia, grew up. Over the years, Edith
Vanderbilt donated and sold off much of the estate. Some 87,000
acres were deeded to the federal government for what is now Pisgah
National Forest. Another chunk became Biltmore Village, a
commercial area now just outside the Biltmore House gate.
</P>
<P>
   But the house and 8,000 acres have remained in the family
through four generations. It was opened to the public in 1930 at
the request of Asheville city officials who hoped it would bolster
an economy reeling from the Depression. It closed during World War
II and was reopened in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   By 1959, Biltmore House was losing $250,000 a year. William A.V.
Cecil, a grandson of Vanderbilt and then a New York banker,
returned to the family business shortly thereafter and began a
turnaround that many people told him could not be achieved. The
house was placed on the national Register of Historic Places in
1963, and almost a decade later, Biltmore made a profit: $16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best money I've ever made,'' Cecil, now chairman of
Biltmore Co. and the father of the current chief executive, is
reported to have said.

TENSION GROWS IN MALAYSIA AS JUDGE DELAYS ANWAR VERDICT 
 
</HEADLINE>
  By MARK LANDLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Friday was to have been a day of
reckoning for the leader of Malaysia's reform movement, Anwar
Ibrahim. Given the furies that have swirled around Anwar for the
last two years, it could have been a day of reckoning for his
country as well.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, the judge in his trial on sodomy charges
unexpectedly delayed the verdict. Now, a tense air of expectancy
has descended on this city. From office suites to roadside food
stalls, people are debating why the judge did not hand down his
ruling as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theories abound. Some say Malaysia's prime minister,
Mahathir Mohamad, feared that a guilty verdict would draw thousands
of protesters into the streets in a noisy repeat of the battles
that raged after Anwar was convicted of corruption last year.
Others contend that the judge is wrestling with his conscience, and
may stun the country by acquitting Anwar, a former deputy prime
minister and Mahathir protege, of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   To the 500 Anwar supporters who turned out on Friday in front of
the High Court brandishing portraits of the ousted deputy prime
minister, chanting ``Reformasi'' and scuffling with the police, it
was evidence of a government with something to fear from its
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps they did not want a show of support for Anwar,'' said
Chandra Muzaffar, deputy president of the pro-reform National
Justice Party, which was formed, with Anwar as its standard-bearer,
after his first conviction. ``If you look at all the factors, the
regime is not as strong as people think they are.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the sodomy charge, Anwar could be sentenced to
20 years in jail. He is already serving six years for corruption,
and is barred from politics for five years after his release.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's coalition won an unassailable two-thirds majority in
the elections. The 74-year-old prime minister, Asia's
longest-serving leader, has spent much of the last year
consolidating his power by going after new rivals, like Malaysia's
increasingly popular Islamic Party.
</P>
<P>
   While few people here say they believe Anwar is guilty of
sodomizing his wife's chauffeur, as he is charged, his trial no
longer provides a rallying cry for most Malaysians, who have moved
on to other concerns, like getting the most out of Malaysia's newly
energized economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anwar has not been as much in the public imagination over the
last year,'' said K.S. Jomo, a professor of economics at the
University of Malaya. ``But it's not as if Anwar's reduced
visibility has helped Mahathir. A great number of people now
believe this was basically a personal vendetta.''
</P>
<P>
   Together Anwar and Mahathir had turned Malaysia into an economic
star of Asia. But Anwar soon emerged as a threat to the prime
minister, who ruthlessly turned on him. In September 1998, Anwar
was abruptly dismissed, and a few weeks later, dozens of police
officers and army troops burst into his house to arrest him. He was
charged with sexual misconduct and abusing his power by interfering
in a police investigation of his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's trial has raised troubling questions about Malaysia's
once-respected judicial system. The prosecution flailed wildly in
its attempt to prove that he had engaged in ``carnal intercourse
against the order of nature.'' After first alleging that Anwar had
sodomized the chauffeur, Azizan Abu Bakar, ``one night in the month
of May 1994,'' the prosecutors shifted the date to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   When Anwar's lawyers noted that the building in which the act
allegedly took place had been under construction at the time, the
prosecution switched the date again, to 1993. Malaysian law allows
prosecutors to amend charges during a trial. Under
cross-examination, Azizan said the police had ordered him to change
the date.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, 52, strenuously denied the charges, saying he was the
victim of a conspiracy orchestrated by Mahathir. His lawyers
presented alibis for almost all the days of the three-month period
in 1993, during which the sexual misconduct was supposed to have
taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time around, the evidence was very flimsy,'' said Anwar's
wife, Wan Azizah Wan Ismail. ``The feeling one had in the courtroom
was like, `Is this for real?'''

 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every other week, it seems, the authorities convene
another news conference to announce another sweep, another bust,
another gigantic distribution network crushed. Stick your head out
the window these days and you cannot help hearing about Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Seizures of the little white pills have occurred so often in
recent months that it is beginning to feel as if law enforcement
officials are doing little else besides cracking down on the drug.
Mafia turncoats are charged with moving it in Arizona. Israeli
mobsters are caught distributing it in Brooklyn. Even New Jersey
college students are rounded up on quiet campuses, accused of
selling it to their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy, a euphoria-producing psychedelic known to chemists as
MDMA, has been around since 1912, when it was introduced in Europe
as a potential appetite suppressant. It was readily _ if illegally
_ available to those who cared to find it five, 10, even 15 years
ago. So why has the discussion about Ecstasy reached such a fever
pitch now?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the concern about the drug is grounded in fact. It no
longer is used by ``club kids'' alone, but has spread into the
professional world. It turns up in airport searches and nightclub
raids, and law enforcement officials say it is pouring into the
country in precedent-setting amounts.
</P>
<P>
   But the much-publicized crackdown has attained an almost
breathless quality as each new case is touted as the biggest, the
broadest to date, and as newspaper headlines and magazine covers
proclaim the drug to be the scourge of the moment. At a time when
less public attention is being paid to marijuana, cocaine and
heroin, the fight against Ecstasy provides a renewed look into how
the machinery of the drug war works in this country. It also opens
a window on the lingering tensions between the authorities who
prosecute the war and the drug treatment experts and sociologists
who say that a law enforcement approach may result in splashy
stories about arrests but is unlikely to stem drug use or the
public health problems it causes.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement statistics on Ecstasy tell only part of the
story, but that part is powerful. According to New York City
officials, seizures of Ecstasy at Kennedy Airport alone have risen
to 858 pounds in 1999 from 68 pounds in 1997 and 8 pounds in 1996.
Nationwide, federal agents have confiscated 8 million doses of the
drug this year _ dwarfing the 3.5 million pills seized last year
and the 750,000 in 1998, the Customs Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a cadre of the country's top drug officials gathered
in Washington to talk about the Ecstasy trade. The prognosis was
grim. Use of the drug is soaring, they said, particularly among the
young. Moreover, the authorities have said, the popularity of
Ecstasy is slowly spreading beyond the narrow confines of the youth
culture, where a typical user pops a pill or two before an evening
out and rolls through a night of dancing awash in the empathetic,
supersensual haze that gives the drug its name. Ecstasy, they say,
has started infiltrating older, more established castes and has
even begun to pique the interest of minority groups, which have
traditionally ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing Ecstasy all over the country these days in
tremendous amounts,'' said Raymond Kelly, the commissioner of the
Customs Service, who added that his agency had beefed up its
resources in an effort to stop the influx of the drug about a year
ago. ``What's really happening is a convergence of several factors:
Better organizational skills by the criminals who distribute it,
lots of disposable money out there in a healthy economy, and the
promulgation of the myth that Ecstasy use has no downside.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid such worry, however, several experts who are critical of
the crackdown approach to fighting drugs have come forward to say
that while the problem with Ecstasy may be growing, it is not _ at
least for now _ at the panic stage. They draw comparisons to the
supposed middle-class heroin crisis of the mid-1990s, or the
supposed rise in teen-age marijuana use a few years earlier _ drug
epidemics, they say, that never really panned out.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Michael Massing, the author of ``The Fix'' (1998,
Simon &AMP; Schuster), which offered a critical appraisal of more than
30 years of America's efforts against drugs, pointed to a recent
study that showed the percentage of high school seniors who said
they had used Ecstasy in the previous month had increased only to
2.5 percent in 1999 from 1.5 percent in 1998. (That rate is low
compared with marijuana use among high school students, which,
according to other studies, has reached as high as 40 or 50
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Massing added that another recent study had shown that only
1,024 people had sought emergency-room help because of Ecstasy in
1998, compared with 637 people in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tiny numbers _ not the numbers of a national
crisis,'' Massing said in an interview last week. ``The drug war
establishment needs periodic crises to justify their budgets. But I
think that the level of what is almost hysteria about Ecstasy is
out of proportion to what's actually going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Massing say there is equal exaggeration among
the drug's devotees who claim that it provides a benign and
harmless high with little or no debilitating side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ecstasy is often praised by its fans as a drug that
lessens inhibitions, fosters a sense of comradeship and enhances
sexual encounters, some medical professionals say that chronic
consumption is quite dangerous. Prolonged use, they add, can lead
to depression, memory loss and brain damage, while overdose can
cause high blood pressure, fainting, muscle cramps and panic
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is frenzy and there is hype surrounding Ecstasy,'' said
Dr. John Morgan, a professor at the City University of New York
Medical School who researches pharmacology and drug abuse. ``But
there is also still a potential that there is more danger about
this drug than we originally thought.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it appears that the war against Ecstasy has centered
more on law enforcement than public health _ unlike the war on
crack, for example, which encompassed an effort to roust dealers as
well as a strong push to deal with the medical effects of a drug
that was unquestionably damaging and often lethal. Still, as
scientists learn more about Ecstasy's deleterious qualities, there
is a growing movement _ especially among the authorities _ to crack
down on the drug because of its medical dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's killing young people,'' Kelly said. ``If you read a lot
of the early literature on Ecstasy, it was all, `Hey, you're going
to feel great.' But we know that doesn't hold up over the long
run.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, these dangers have not resulted in any
large-scale public health initiative. The reason, Morgan said, is
that scientists are only now beginning to understand the long-term
harm that Ecstasy can cause to the body and brain. ``We're worried
more about what damage might be discovered in the future,'' he
added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a welter of criminal cases involving Ecstasy
have occurred. In February, for instance, Salvatore Gravano, the
Mafia hit man and informer, was arrested in Phoenix on charges of
trafficking in the drug. Just last week, Kenneth S. Gregorio and
Brian J. Juliano, a pair of college students in New Jersey, were
taken into custody after being accused of selling Ecstasy to their
classmates at Monmouth University. Gregorio hanged himself in his
cell hours after being arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The news media _ always eager to spot a new trend _ have
followed the lead of law enforcement officials, and
drug-of-the-moment stories have fueled anxiety and created a
somewhat nervous sense that Ecstasy use has gone terribly
overboard.
</P>
<P>
   There is a nagging temptation to label Ecstasy as the drug of
the '90s and beyond. After all, it has started to supplant other
drugs on the radar screens of the criminal justice system, and its
reputation for creating a genial glow without medical downsides
catches something of the passing decade's desire for guilt-free
gladness in the same sort of way that the nervous surge created by
cocaine caught the restless energy of the decade before.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has become so prevalent that traffickers have begun to
sell adulterated and even fake versions of Ecstasy _ a development
that truly frightens drug experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If law enforcement starts really cracking down on Ecstasy, I
don't think it's going to lessen demand,'' said Marsha Rosenbaum,
who, in the early 1990s, conducted the first federally financed
sociological study on the drug. ``And I worry that sales of the
look-alike substitutes will increase, and they can be more
dangerous than Ecstasy itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the authorities insist that their efforts to stop
the flow of Ecstasy did not create the hype about the drug. They
say they are simply reacting to what has become the hottest
commodity in the market for illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make Ecstasy the flavor of the day,'' said Bridget
G. Brennan, New York City's special narcotics prosecutor. ``We
respond to what's in front of us. We looked around, and all the
sudden, Ecstasy had become the flavor of the day. And there we
were.''

DIXIE UNION TO GET TEST IN HASKELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEANPORT, N.J. _ The disappointment of Dixie Union's
fifth-place finish in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Juvenile was still
with the trainer Richard Mandella when he made his way to the barn
at Gulfstream Park the morning after the race. But even more bad
news awaited Mandella: Dixie Union had just run the worst race of
his career after having won the Hollywood Juvenile Championship,
the Best Pal and the Norfolk, and had also sustained a chipped knee
that would require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of going back to California, he went straight to
Kentucky for the operation, Mandella said.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union, the son of Dixieland Band, made a swift recovery,
and by early spring Mandella was debating whether to hustle him
onto the Triple Crown trail. A streak of bad weather and bad
racetracks made that decision for him. So instead of heading to the
classics, Dixie Union made his first start as a 3-year-old the day
after the Kentucky Derby, far from Churchill Downs, winning a
six-and-one-half-furlong allowance at Hollywood Park in California.
</P>
<P>
   In his next two starts, Dixie Union finished second twice, as
the favorite in both the Lazaro Barrera Memorial at seven furlongs
and the mile-and-a-sixteenth Affirmed Handicap on July 1, showing
improvement each time. On Sunday, he tries to join the fray for the
second season as he faces eight others, including the Belmont
winner Commendable, the favored More Than Ready and the Triple
Crown veterans Captain Steve and Impeachment in the $1 million
Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park. It is a Grade I race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a couple of sprints and a route race,'' Mandella
said. ``Right now, he's a very good sprinter we hope will get one
and one-eighth miles. He's not quite back to where he was, but I am
optimistic he will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union was listed at 6-1 behind the 5-2 favorite More Than
Ready, who ticked off five straight victories as a 2-year-old and
has been consistent this year, if victorious only once. Captain
Steve, winner of the Grade I Swaps in his last start, was made the
3-1 second choice in the field of nine, while the entry of
Commendable and Impeachment was 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Also entered in the Haskell are Thistyranthasclass, the winner
of four straight at Monmouth; Mercaldo; Kiss A Native; and the Ohio
Derby winner, Milwaukee Brew, who has won four straight races.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bunch of real nice horses in here,'' said Kevin
Attard, who will saddle Milwaukee Brew for his father, Tino. ``If
the track plays fair, it should be to our advantage.''

   ASHBURN, Va. _ There are always stories about Daniel Snyder, the
Washington Redskins' owner. Some are true. Some are tall tales.
They swirl around him as if he were living an Aesop fable. The
moral of the stories is, well, mixed. He is a savior, a braggart, a
genius and the big bad wolf all wrapped up in one.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants to win. Snyder, who took control of the Redskins in
the spring of 1999, is a poor loser, and because of that he might
be the best thing to happen to professional football in years.

   No owner since Oakland's Al Davis or Dallas' Jerry Jones has
shaken up professional football like the 35-year-old Snyder, who
plans to outwork and outspend his competitors. This off-season he
undertook the most aggressive free-agent spree ever, paying $40
million in signing bonuses to assemble what amounts to an all-star
team. Because of free-agent pickups like Deion Sanders and Bruce
Smith, both future Hall of Famers, many in the league believe the
Redskins are the Super Bowl favorites.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the National Football League has taken notice, not
only of Snyder's fat wallet, but also of his brashness, and some
say, his outright arrogance. Snyder may not be a renegade like
Davis, who sued his own league, and Jones, who sought to dismantle
the NFL's revenue-sharing system, but his aggressiveness is causing
the same kind of allergic reaction among his fellow owners. He
particularly irked some owners by being the first to charge fans
admission to training camp practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is true,'' Snyder said, ``I'm aggressive, I'm
entrepreneurial, I want to win. I want to win fast and now. All of
this is true, absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've run a lot of businesses and I've been very
rational,'' he said. ``And I've been in a lot of competitive
environments and this is just another competitive environment where
if you want to win you really need to be aggressive. If you're not,
you won't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellington Mara, the Giants' co-owner, who is in the Hall of
Fame, has said in the past that he is no fan of Jones, and during a
recent interview Mara made it clear he was not a member of the
Snyder fan club, either.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had met Snyder, a rival owner in the National
Football Conference East, Mara responded: ``Yes, we've met. I
wouldn't use the word charming with him, but he's been fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with a lot of what he has done, and I don't want
to get specific about what I don't like,'' said Mara, the first
owner to publicly criticize Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is entitled to do what he wants, because he paid $800
million for the team. A lot of us old fogies wish we had made as
much money as he has at that age. But I wonder if he is the type of
person who will only look out for himself, instead of the
well-being of the entire league.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought Snyder was a younger version of Jones,
Mara joked, ``Please don't say that.'' Then with a serious tone,
Mara said: ``Let's hope he doesn't become an older Jerry Jones.
That would be unfortunate. But I think he's headed in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara's comments were typical of those from other team owners,
many of whom spoke only on condition of anonymity, and illustrate
Snyder's plight. While trying to make the Redskins winners again,
he must be aggressive, but in doing so, he is angering many of the
people with whom he must coexist, partly because he goes against
some NFL traditions, partly because he has rubbed some the wrong
way with his cockiness. Only Davis and Jones are referred to with
the same kind of venom by the NFL's elite.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder represents a new breed of NFL owner. As millionaires get
younger, and more begin to buy their way into professional
football, they will move with the kind of urgency that made them so
rich so quickly. Snyder earned his first million by the time he was
20, and by 31, he was the youngest chief executive of a company on
the New York Stock Exchange. He is president of Snyder
Communications, a direct-marketing firm, and before there is a
speck of gray in his hair, he may have a Super Bowl ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins were once a model team in the glory days of Joe
Gibbs, but they have made it to the playoffs only twice since their
last Super Bowl appearance in 1992. Wanting the Redskins to shed
their veil of mediocrity, Snyder has turned the team upside down,
moving with all the tenderness of a thunderstorm. He has fired some
two dozen employees, including General Manager Charley Casserly.
The team's contract negotiator, Joe Mendes, quit late last month,
citing thee need to take a break. From what, he did not say, but to
work for Snyder, or to compete against him, requires skin as thick
as concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to the stories, told throughout the league, by
owners, coaches, general managers and former and current Redskins
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Like the one about Snyder yelling himself hoarse in dressing
down coach Norv Turner in the trainer's room immediately after a
loss at Dallas last October. Turner came out of the meeting
ashen-faced. Snyder, who said that jobs were on the line, added,
``I'm going to get my voice fixed, and then I'm going to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   During one practice, Snyder is said to have called one of the
team's personnel men a ``dumb idiot'' in front of other members of
the organization after the man made a derogatory remark about a
player Snyder liked. Snyder denied the story.
</P>
<P>
   And this off-season Washington was interested in Seattle wide
receiver Joey Galloway, but the Seahawks froze out the Redskins and
traded Galloway to NFC East rival Dallas. Incensed, Snyder, with
only one year of league experience, called Mike Holmgren, the
Seattle coach and general manager and a 20-year NFL veteran, the
story goes, and chewed him out.
</P>
<P>
   Truth or fiction? Holmgren refused to give details of his
conversation with Snyder. Snyder said only that the two men
``kidded each other pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During one of his first league meetings, Snyder met the Detroit
Lions' vice chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., son of the team's
owner, and made an obnoxious remark about Ford's family business,
the automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said through a spokesman that he could not recall the
story. An owner who spoke on condition of anonymity said that he
was standing next to Ford and heard the conversation and that
Snyder did indeed say something that irritated Ford. Snyder called
the story ``total garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have done,'' Snyder said, ``has been twisted into
great pretzels. I don't go into the locker room before games ever.
I don't stand on the sideline like Jerry Jones. I don't watch film
with the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories overshadow Snyder's contributions to his team. He
has unified a formerly divided front office and coaching staff. He
hired the talented Vinny Cerrato to replace Casserly. He increased
the number of blacks in the organization. He fixed a disgraceful
parking problem that caused fans to wait hours to get in and out of
the stadium he owns, FedEx Stadium, and he replaced substandard
practice fields.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, because of his sweat and more than $15 million out of
his pocket to finance the needed stadium changes, he has made
watching a Redskins game more enjoyable for fans, and the
organization more of a home for coaches and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of all he has made everyone accountable,'' said Bruce
Smith, a former Buffalo player, ``from the top to the bottom. As a
player you have to respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, his supporters say, has other positive attributes.
Because he grew up in a multicultural setting in suburban Maryland,
they say, he has an easier time relating to black team and league
officials, who often complain that some owners speak
condescendingly to them. One black league official said Snyder was
the first owner to ask him out for a beer.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is invaluable in another way _ he has what players call
juice. Today's NFL has no dynasties. And fascinating characters
like Mike Ditka, Lawrence Taylor and Refrigerator Perry are gone.
Stars such as John Elway, Dan Marino and Steve Young have retired.
Now some of the greatest football debates are about the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is giving the league personality, several owners
conceded, and a much-needed kick in the shin, by forcing everyone
else to work harder and to be more creative to keep up.
``Competition never hurt anybody,'' Mara said. ``The moves he is
making, yes, they hurt the league in a sense, but on the other
hand, it is good to shake things up every once in a while. The
worst thing is being comfortable, and he is disturbing our
comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder deserves credit for quickly building what looks to be a
championship-caliber team. In 1998, the season before Snyder took
over, the Redskins were 6-10. Last year they were 10-6 and won the
NFC East before losing in the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April, Washington drafted Penn State linebacker LaVar
Arrington ($34 million contract) and Alabama offensive tackle Chris
Samuels ($30 million); both are having excellent training camps and
will be starters. Snyder signed veterans Mark Carrier (five years,
$15 million), Jeff George (four years, $18 million), Smith (four
years, $23 million) and Sanders (seven years, $56 million).
</P>
<P>
   Snyder and his staff quickly assembled not just talent, but also
depth. Nothing quite like it has been done before. It is true that
eventually the signings may seriously affect the team's salary cap,
just as the San Francisco 49ers' maneuverings in the 1990's have
hurt them now. One owner who has analyzed Washington's cap contends
that after next season, the Redskins will have to do major salary
restructuring and dump players to stay within the cap, now $62.2
million. Snyder denied this.
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder is not afraid to take chances. There are teams that
are perennially stuck near the bottom of the standing but rarely
make aggressive moves to break out of the funk.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Snyder can taint his positive efforts by going too far, the
same way Davis and Jones have before him. For example, Snyder, in
an attempt to market the Redskins brand beyond Washington, began
advertising in Baltimore, violating a gentleman's agreement not to
advertise in each other's market. David Modell, the Baltimore
Ravens' president, said the Ravens might retaliate with airplane
ads over the Redskins' training camp in Ashburn.
</P>
<P>
   No one should think Snyder is without supporters, however. He
said he had a good relationship with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue,
and just last week the Carolina owner, Jerry Richardson, visited
the Redskins' complex, observing the changes Snyder has made.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be surprised if several years from now, many teams are
charging fans to watch training camp practices. It is, after all, a
copycat league. ``Did you see that trophy case out there?'' Snyder
asked. ``My goal is to add as many trophies as I can. I plan on
being here a long time.''

   GOP CONVENTION FOLLOW-UP
</P>
<P>
   CVN-BUSH _ PHILADELPHIA _ George Bush's convention took great
strides in rewriting the GOP story from the party of status quo to
the party of reform, from the party of protecting wealth to the
party of providing help, from the party of narrow interests to the
party of inclusion. But even as the party's only openly gay
congressional representative was addressing Bush's convention,
Bush's platform committee was voting not to soften anti-gay
language in the platform. This dichotomy has been evident
throughout the campaign, and the question remains: Which is the
real George W. Bush, and which is the real GOP? (Montgomery, Dayton
Daily News)

   CVN-REAL-GOP _ PHILADELPHIA _ George Bush's convention took
pains to portray the Republican Party as one in transition from the
party of narrow interests to the party of inclusion. But even as
the party's only openly gay congressional representative was
addressing Bush's convention, Bush's platform committee was voting
not to soften anti-gay language in the platform. Amid other such
discrepancies, the question remains: which is the real George W.
Bush, which is the real GOP. (Sherman, Atlanta

<P>
   CVN-GORE _ WASHINGTON _ Now that the Republican National
Convention is history, Vice President Al Gore needs to counter its
effects in two main ways: deliver an acceptance speech in Los
Angeles that counters the style and substance of George W. Bush's,
and choose a running mate who compares well with Dick Cheney.

   VOTER _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Sen. John McCain may have caused Gov.
George W. Bush plenty of headaches in the bitterly contested
Republican presidential primary, but, if Ohio is any indication, he
may have done Bush and all Republican candidates a big favor. The
sparks flying off McCain's Straight Talk Express generated a wave
of interest among voters, particularly Republican voters, that
hasn't been seen in a primary in many years. According to newly
released statewide voter registration figures compiled by the Ohio
secretary of state's office, that wave almost doubled the ranks of
the state's registered Republicans. Democratic registration also
grew, but the registered Republican increase more than doubled the
Democratic gain. (McCall, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

PLANS FOR DUMP SPUR MAINE LOBSTERMEN TO PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., Maine)  By PAUL MOLYNEAUX   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York and Connecticut lobstermen are not alone in fearing
that their precious resource is being threatened by man-made
contaminants. Maine, the nation's largest lobster source, has not
suffered the alarming die-off that decimated the Long Island Sound
lobster fishery this spring, but Maine fishermen, environmentalists
and town officials have seen enough red flags to voice their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Maine's Department of Transportation announced plans
to dump dredge spoils contaminated with lead, mercury, PCBs and
petroleum derivatives, into the prime lobster grounds of Penobscot
Bay. The proposed disposal site, five miles from Vinalhaven, Maine,
an island about 50 miles northeast of Portland, lies within an area
where 19 million pounds of lobster were caught last year _ nearly
40 percent of the state landings. When Penobscot Bay lobstermen and
community leaders heard about the dumping proposal, they came out
in force to protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a scientist,'' said Vinalhaven's town manager, Sue
Lessard, looking at the transportation department's plan. ``But I'm
intelligent enough to know this is not a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the causes of the Long Island Sound disaster remain
uncertain _ last week, New York area lobstermen blamed pesticide
spraying _ some scientists believe contaminated dredge spoils
played a role. Consequently, Maine fishermen have asked regulators
to find new approaches to dump dredge material.
</P>
<P>
   Maine's transportation department did not expect any opposition
when it applied for its dredge material disposal permit _ part of a
port redevelopment project at Mack Point, in upper Penobscot Bay.
At an April hearing on the application, Paul Pottle, the
department's project manager, told the public that the permit
called for dumping 121,000 cubic yards of dredge material and that
the contaminated material would be left at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Lessard, armed with facts, caught Pottle off guard when she took
issue with his statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obtained copies of the permits being applied for,'' Lessard
told Pottle, ``and I'm a little confused as to what I've heard.''
Lessard said the application asked to dispose 375,000 cubic yards
of material at the Rockland, Maine, site, at least 50,000 cubic
yards of it contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Lessard also pointed out that federal rules required the
Rockland site to be monitored every 10 years and that it had not
been monitored since 1989. She, and many others, said that they did
not object to the Mack Point port project, only the proposed
disposal of the dredge spoils. They called for a review of the
Rockland site before any future dumping.
</P>
<P>
   The Mack Point project, high on Gov. Angus King's list of
priorities, has ``a lot of political will behind it,'' Lessard
said. ``If it's a state mission to build this port, we want it
handled responsibly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Vinalhaven, where 75 percent of the year-round residents
depend on the lobster industry for their livelihood, it comes as no
surprise that a furor over the disposal of dredge spoils spread in
coastal areas and led to another meeting in late April. State and
federal officials addressed the concerns of Vinalhaven and other
Maine fishing communities.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Boutilier of the Army Corps of Engineers' New England
office said that the disposal site off Vinalhaven was scheduled for
review this year. ``We'll be seeking input from fishermen on how
best to conduct the site evaluation in order to address their
concerns,'' he said, but he added that the results might not affect
the Mack Point project.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jones, owner of the Vinalhaven Lobster Co., suggested that
a review of the Rockland site should lead to the end of dumping.
``We don't want another Long Island Sound,'' he said. ``We need to
close the Rockland site permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine's commissioner of the Department of Marine Resources,
George Lapointe, urged fishermen and community leaders to work with
the state to find solutions to Mack Point and future dredge
disposal issues. ``Let's get the facts on the table,'' Lapointe
said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ``dumping had occurred at the Rockland disposal
site since the '50s, concomitant with the largest increase in
lobster landings in Maine history.'' Lobster landings have
increased from 22 million to 53 million pounds in the last 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   With the dredge material from Mack Point and several harbor
maintenance projects scheduled to go to the Rockland disposal site,
Maine's transportation commissioner, John Melrose, asked fishermen
to consider the economic repercussions of closing the area's only
ocean disposal site.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's left me sort of unsettled is that much of the
discussion has been focused on the lobster resource,'' Melrose
said. ``You need to consider what will happen to other projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocean dumping of contaminated dredge spoils has become a
nationwide problem, and Melrose acknowledged that ``the long-term
prospects for doing business as usual are not good.'' But for the
short term, he expressed worries that if the Rockland dump closed,
the rising cost of dredge spoil disposal might shut down marine
activity in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation department estimates that each ship entering
a Maine port generates $40,000 to $74,000 for local communities. In
addition, the Mack Point port would link shipping with rail service
to northern Maine, Montreal and maritime Canada, providing goods to
those areas and export opportunities for the region's forest
products.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Bridges, president of the Downeast Lobstermen's
Association, countered that Maine's $70 million lobster industry
also contributes to the state's economy and the tourist industry.
``People don't come to Maine to see ships unloading,'' he said.
``They come to eat lobster, and see us catching them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Stewart, a University of Connecticut marine biologist who
has studied the effects of dredge spoil disposal on lobsters for
decades, believes the lobsters in Long Island Sound succumbed to a
number of stresses, including pesticide spraying and rising water
temperature. ``Although dredge spoils may be having some impact,
they are not at the top of my list as far as the cause of the
die-off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of
Maine-affiliated Lobster Institute, agrees that anything that will
kill an insect will kill a lobster, but he remains cautious. ``We
still worry about dredge spoils,'' he said. Many Long Island Sound
lobstermen had lost boats and homes, Bayer said, as a result of the
economic repercussions of the crisis. ``Is it worth the risk?'' he
asked.

<P>
   Seeking a resolution of conflicting interests, Bridges, Lessard
and representatives from several advocacy groups met with state
officials on June 13. The meeting resulted in some progress, but
the situation remains tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``MDOT agreed to consider reducing the total volume on its
application to, 75,000 cubic yards, and find an upland disposal
site for the contaminated material,'' said Ben Neal of the Island
Institute in Rockland. ``I think it's good that people are talking,
but the jury is still out on what level of commitment MDOT has.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's department of transportation ``agreed to reduce the
volume on the application to 75,000 cubic yards for this round, and
find an upland disposal site for the contaminated material,''
Lessard said. She said she believed the department ``is cognizant
of our concerns and is trying to compromise.'' She added, however,
that nothing had yet been put in writing.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation department's Melrose is hopeful that
affordable ways can be found to use contaminated material, possibly
in the construction at Mack Point. But dredge material will
continue to be generated by other projects, and Melrose wants to
avoid future conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, his department, the Army Corps of Engineers and
Maine agencies have set to work with various individuals and groups
to create a long-range plan balancing environmental and economic
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Lessard and Bridges have faith in the negotiations. But economic
realities continue to drive the Mack Point project, and
contaminated dredge material could still legally be dumped in
waters off Vinalhaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important we don't go down that road,'' Lessard said.
``There's way too much at stake.'' &QL;

ALONE WITH GORE, ALMOST UNRESTRAINED
</HEADLINE>
   (With GORE-MEDIA-FRIENDS) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore's Hank Williams imitation is certainly surprising, and
he did it at dinner, by request _ with his mouth full of food,
actually. ``Have you ever seen a robin cry,'' he twanged, ``when
leaves begin to fall.'' Then, on a roll, he sang a few lines of
Garth Brooks' ``I've Got Friends in Low Places.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no sense that a recent on-the-record dinner with
a reporter can be considered an occasion to glimpse the ``private''
Al Gore, he was the good company his friends swear that he is,
laughing over some of his favorite stupid country lyrics, making
fun of himself for pandering to Roman Catholics, even gossiping a
little.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that the dinner took place at all, unsupervised by
aides, in Gore's hotel suite on the road in New York several weeks
ago, says that he is not always as cautious as he is generally
considered.
</P>
<P>
   He began by saying grace over the herb chicken and roasted
vegetables and remarked that he had always been puzzled by the idea
that a person cannot believe fervently in both God and science. ``I
never saw the slightest inconsistency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking unselfconsciously of his own faith, he said, ``The
separation of church and state is a very healthy principle I would
die for, but this insistence on separating belief from our daily
life is at the root of many of our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed interest in Garry Wills' new book, ``Papal Sin:
Structure of Deceit,'' and because it is critical of the Catholic
Church, said, laughing, ``I guess I won't be able to praise his
work any more with any degree of political safety.''
</P>
<P>
   And he mocked himself, too, in describing his stubborn efforts
to proselytize the astronomer Carl Sagan, saying: ``My great
challenge was to convert Carl Sagan. I moved him from atheist to
agnostic. But I think he was just playing word games with me.''

 &HT;    McCain's run boosts ranks of Ohio GOP
 &HT;    By Ken McCall
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Arizona Sen. John McCain caused Texas Gov. George
W. Bush plenty of headaches in the bitterly contested Republican
presidential primaries, but, if Ohio is any indication, the GOP
maverick may have done Bush and all Republican candidates a big
favor.
</P>
<P>
   The sparks flying off McCain's Straight Talk Express ignited a
firestorm of voter interest that almost doubled the ranks of Ohio's
registered Republicans, according to newly released voter
registration figures compiled by the Ohio Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the March 7 primary, Republican registration shot
up by more than three-quarters of a million voters, from 844,293 to
1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is more than twice the jump Democrats saw.
Democratic registration, prodded by an already-decided, but
still-smoldering contest between Vice President Al Gore and former
Sen. Bill Bradley, grew by 327,270 to reach 1.27 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the largest Republican gains were in counties that have
historically been GOP strongholds, indicating the ``new''
Republicans were likely old Republicans or GOP-leaning independents
who hadn't voted in a recent primary.
</P>
<P>
   The figures also indicate that cross-over voting _ Democrats
switching parties to vote in the Republican primary _ was not
widespread in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the total number of voters who voted in the
Democratic primary in 1998, but switched to the Republican primary
this year was 74,458 or just under 10 percent of the total
Republican registration gain. Those party-switchers amounted to
only 2.4 percent of the primary turnout and less than 1 percent of
the state's registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers say the results give Republicans an
edge going into November because they have more voters motivated
early and that primary voters tend to turn out for general
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more cautious, even skeptical, of the apparent
Republican gain because of the way Ohio handles party affiliation.
In Ohio, a voter must have voted in one of the last two statewide
party primaries to be considered a member of that party. Anyone who
didn't vote in either the 2000 or 1998 primaries is classified in
Ohio as non-partisan, regardless of past political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the March primary, those non-partisans still total
4.4 million or 60 percent of the state's registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ohio Republican Party Chairman Robert Bennett, who is happy
with his party's voter surge, said the non-partisan majority
muddies the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget the largest group is still the non-declared,'' he
said. ``Ohio is still a competitive, two-party state.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, several analysts said, Ohio Republican leaders
have reason to be optimistic about the November election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good news for the Republicans,'' said John Green, a
political scientist at the University of Akron. ``A substantial
group of voters have now revealed themselves as having an interest
in the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is widespread agreement that most of the 516,790
Ohioans who cast ballots for McCain in March were likely already
Republicans or leaning that way, Green said the Republican gain
gives the party an ``organizational edge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you can send these people mail,'' he said. ``You can call
them on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adams, Wright State University political science
professor, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a Republican looking at this you would say this is
a great opportunity,'' Adams said. ``We've got a bunch of people
here who, for whatever reason, came into the party. They made that
first tentative step at least. They're registered as Republicans
and they're ready to vote and how do we keep the McCain Republicans
voting for Bush in the fall?''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, on the other hand, downplay the significance of the
post-primary voter totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers mean absolutely nothing,'' said Ohio Democratic
Party Chairman David Leland. ``They're interesting, but all they
say is that the Republicans had a more interesting primary than we
did and were able to turn out more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County Democratic Party Chairman Dennis Lieberman
also is ``not concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore had sewn up the Democratic presidential nomination before
the Ohio primary, he pointed out, while McCain was still giving
Bush a good run for his money. And locally, Lieberman said, the
Democrats had no interesting primaries to drive voter turnout,
while the Republicans had a primary contest in the 42nd Ohio House
District between Washington Twp. Trustee Joyce Young and Kettering
Vice Mayor John White, who won the election. ``That increased
participation and voter turnout,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County Republican Party Chairman Jeff Jacobson agreed
that much of the registration increase was ``naturally affiliated
Republicans,'' but said a big primary turnout can have a ``ripple
effect'' in the general election, especially in local races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people who show up are more willing to support
their ticket, because they feel like, having voted in the primary,
they made some commitment to it,'' Jacobson said. ``I would suggest
we are not going to have trouble holding the vast majority of
McCain people because they are Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. Green, for one, said the Republicans
may have a harder time than they admit keeping McCain voters in the
fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the surveys we've had are accurate, they're a different
kind of Republican,'' Green said. ``They're more
independent-leaning, maybe a little more liberal, and certainly
more reform-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   The voters who were attracted by McCain's reform agenda will be
``hard to keep,'' Green said. ``It can be done, but the mainstream
Republican Party isn't their cup of tea. That's why they weren't
voting in primaries until McCain came along.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright State's Adams agreed that there's ``no guarantee'' the
McCain voters will turn out for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Adams said the Republicans can do is ``get McCain in
here'' campaigning for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said he expects McCain to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've invited him in and he's been very gracious,'' the state
Republican chairman said. ``John McCain's always been very popular
in Ohio.''
</P>
<P>
   Leland said the Democratic Party won't do anything special to
woo the McCain voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in wooing over the 5 million voters who may be
participating in this election,'' he said. ``What we need to do is
talk about the issues we've been talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said Leland is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have an awful lot of folks who are not declared and
are kind of up for grabs,'' he said, ``which is why traditionally
Ohio has been a bellwether state in presidential elections. It has
that really large undeclared category.''

ROSKO, RADIO DJ WHO BROKE BARRIERS, DIES AT 73
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Pa.)  By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Roscoe Mercer, known for decades to New York radio
listeners simply as Rosko, died on Tuesday. He was 73 and lived in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to his daughter Valerie J.
Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer was the first black news announcer on WINS in New York
and, as Rosko, the first black disc jockey on KBLA in Los Angeles.
He went on to become a pioneer of free-form FM radio in New York
City. On WOR-FM in 1966 and on WNEW-FM from 1967 to 1970, his calm,
husky voice with its hint of Southern drawl and his wide-ranging
programming made him an authoritative companion amid the musical
ferment of the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   He delved into rock, soul, folk and jazz; he read poetry and
conversed with his unseen listeners in almost fatherly monologues.
In one set during the late 1960s, he recited antiwar poetry by
Yevgeny Yevtushenko to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing the
Lord's Prayer, then played Richie Havens' antiwar song ``Handsome
Johnny'' as a lead-in to a news report about bombing in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer was born on May 25, 1927, in New York City and attended a
Catholic boarding school in Pennsylvania as a charity student. His
first jobs were as a government clerk and then a men's room
attendant at the Latin Casino in Cherry Hill, N.J. He began his
radio career as a jazz disc jockey at WHAT in Chester, Pa., moved
to WDAS in Philadelphia, and then to WBLS in New York, playing jazz
in live broadcasts from Palm Cafe in Manhattan. He played rhythm
and blues on WNJR in Secaucus, N.J., in the late 1950s, but after
refusing to cross a picket line at the station during an effort to
create a union for disc jockeys, he was blacklisted for six months.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first black announcer for WINS, and was then hired
as a disc jockey by KDIA in Oakland, Calif. Radio station KGFJ in
Los Angeles sought to hire him away, leading to a precedent-setting
lawsuit that changed the way disc-jockey contracts were written.
For a time in the early 1960s, Rosko was heard live on KGFJ and on
tape in Oakland six nights a week; he spent the seventh in Oakland,
live on KDIA. Then he was hired by KBLA, playing rock and rhythm
and blues at a formerly all-white station.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to New York to work at WBLS. In 1966, the Federal
Communications Commission required radio stations to broadcast
separate content on AM and FM stations, and rock music beyond the
Top 40 rushed to fill the new air time. The disc jockeys Murray the
K and Scott Muni, along with Rosko, moved to WOR-FM to introduce a
new style, with disc jockeys freely choosing the music and speaking
conversationally to listeners.
</P>
<P>
   But in October 1967, WOR-FM decided to change to a restrictive
format. On his last show, without warning the station's management,
Rosko spoke for five minutes about why he was resigning, saying,
``When are we going to learn that controlling something does not
take it out of the minds of people?'' and declaring, ``In no way
can I feel that I can continue my radio career by being dishonest
with you.'' He added that he would rather return to being a men's
room attendant.
</P>
<P>
   But within the month, he was hired for an evening shift by
WNEW-FM, which picked up WOR-FM's format; soon afterward, WNEW-FM
also hired Muni. Rosko stayed at WNEW until 1970, then moved to
France for five years; there, he worked for the Voice of America.
He returned to the United States and was heard during the 1980s on
the dance-music station WKTU in New York; he also did voice-over
work for commercials. Most recently, his voice was heard in
announcements for CBS Sports. In 1992, when he learned he had
cancer, he refused chemotherapy, turning instead to alternative
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Joanna; five children from three
previous marriages, Valerie, William, David, Scott and Melissa
Mercer; a sister, Bernice Reid; and two grandchildren.

CONCERNS RAISED BY MANHATTAN'S SKYROCKETING OFFICE RENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please replace double parentheses (( )) with single
brackets)  
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Office rents, which have been rising steadily for
several years, spiked upward in the second quarter of this year,
leading some real estate executives to express concern that vital
service providers, such as smaller law and accounting firms, may be
driven out of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures compiled by Williams Real Estate Co., the
average annual asking rent for office space in Manhattan increased
16.9 percent in the three months that ended in June, to $54.44 a
square foot. Asking rents have increased 28.1 percent since the
beginning of the year; the year-to-year increase was 35.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in rents is directly linked to the shrinking amount
of space available for occupancy. Williams calculates that the
overall vacancy rate for all office space in Manhattan is 5.1
percent, a decrease of 14.2 percent during the second quarter and a
drop of 47.7 percent from June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And the averages understate the actual shortage of space
available at what many consider affordable rents. In the Midtown
market, 53.5 percent of the space on the market had an asking
annual rent under $50 a square foot at the end of the second
quarter of 1999. By the end of June this year, only 9 percent of
the space was under $50 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A plausible Midtown business address is going to cost at least
$55 a square foot and more likely $60 or $70,'' said Michael T.
Cohen, the president of Williams. ``For a while the financial
district was the last refuge for companies priced out of Midtown,
but it's not a refuge anymore. The space has been absorbed, and the
rents spiked again in the last quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The downtown business district had a 12 percent availability
rate at the end of the second quarter of 1999 and an average annual
rental rate in the low $30s a square foot. By the end of June this
year, the availability was under 6 percent and the average rent
over $40 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vacancy rate is at the lowest point in 20 years,'' said
Steven A. Swerdlow, senior managing director of the New York office
of CB Richard Ellis, a real estate services company. ``And rents
have eclipsed the highs of the early 1980s on an inflation-adjusted
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the market is all the more remarkable because of
the recovery from the financial crises in several parts of the
world in the fall of 1998, said Barry Gosin, the chief executive of
Newmark &AMP; Co. Real Estate, a brokerage and property management
company. ``People were very concerned there would be no liquidity,
but now with the economy healthy and growing, everybody needs
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again the averages mask some of the high points in a market
where prosperous companies needing space to grow compete with one
another for the limited amount available. ``I am negotiating rates
that start at $115 a square foot,'' said Tara Stacom, an executive
director at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, a large brokerage and real estate
services company. ``My father ((Matthew J. Stacom, also an official
at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield)) predicted we would see rates of $100 a
square foot by the end of the century, and people told him he was
crazy. Well here we are and here they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he was concerned that Manhattan would become home to
an elite, with only the biggest, richest companies able to pay the
rent to stay at prime locations. He said it would be bad for the
city in the long term, and bad for his business as well.
</P>
<P>
   Medium-size law firms, those with fewer than 100 lawyers, and
moderate-size accounting firms are coming under intense pressure as
a result of the rising rents. He said that one law firm that is his
client _ which he would not name _ recently agreed to a rent
increase before the expiration of its current lease to avoid being
pushed immediately to the market rate when it rolls over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like to think of New York as a land of opportunity, with a
quilt of entrepreneurial companies of different sizes,'' he said.
``But if only the big, rich companies can afford to stay, that
thins out the city's economic base and leaves it vulnerable in the
long term.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the big picture, Cohen said he had strong
little-picture fears as well. ``I am a purchaser of legal and
accounting services and I get better quality services when there
are many firms competing for my business,'' he said. ``If high
rents thin out the ranks of local services providers, that works to
my disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Swerdlow said he also saw that as a danger. ``There will be
haves and have nots,'' he said. He said that Internet and new-media
companies say they cannot afford to wait for new construction, such
as the million-square-foot building that Forest City Ratner Cos. is
planning at its Metrotech complex in Brooklyn, and so they increase
the pressure in the existing market.
</P>
<P>
   If only the richest companies can remain in Manhattan, ``it
changes the fabric of city life,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, vice
chairman of Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage and services
company. ``It will be different if only the top knowledge workers
and their immediate support staff remain, and the effects will
ripple out to the stores and restaurants.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives said they saw nothing on the horizon to
dampen the office market in Manhattan and said it would continue to
drive tenants to look for alternatives such as Jersey City and the
rest of the New Jersey coast facing the city. Many say they expect
more building in downtown Brooklyn and in the Long Island City
section of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   And the remaining fringes of Manhattan are expected to be
renovated for tenants who cannot overcome a reluctance to cross a
river.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see a lot of activity on 11th and 12th Avenues
between 30th and 59th Street,'' said James S. Meiskin, president of
Plymouth Partners, a brokerage specializing in representing
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   This area is one of the last sections of Manhattan that is
primarily industrial, with garage, warehouses and distribution
centers. But the successful conversion of old factories farther
south in Chelsea to offices for new media and Internet companies
makes it likely there will be demand for office space farther
north.
</P>
<P>
   The high rents for office space are forcing companies to decide
how many people they actually need in Manhattan, and how many might
be just as well based in less costly boroughs and suburbs, real
estate executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the effect it may have on the ambience of the
city, economics are forcing tenant companies to look hard at their
Manhattan operations. ``Every business has to consider why they are
here,'' Tighe said. ``They have to determine what kind of work has
a profit margin that justifies housing a person in Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   As companies split their operations, with only the
high-value-added jobs staying in Manhattan, the boroughs of
Brooklyn and Queens should benefit, she said. ``Queens is going to
be hopping and downtown Brooklyn is going to be active too,'' Tighe
said. ``These areas have not shared in the job growth because, at
least in the past, people wanted Manhattan addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   But even soaring rents are not a deterrent to companies that are
lacking an even more precious commodity: skilled workers to operate
the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two clients who moved out and are trying to move back
in,'' Stacom said. ``They couldn't find the labor they needed and
they're trying to come back because New York still has the right
labor supply.''

HOME COLUMN: NEW OPTIONS FOR MAINTAINING SLATE ROOFS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few homeowners would argue with the premise that a slate roof
adds beauty and value to a house. But while such roofs are often
thought to be virtually indestructible _ some have been around for
a couple of hundred years _ even the best slate roofs age, leak and
eventually have to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average homeowner will look at an 80-year-old slate roof
that's leaking and think, what in the world am I going to do with
this?'' said Joseph C. Jenkins, a slate-roof contractor in Grove
City, Pa., who is author of ``The Slate Roof Bible'' ($35, Jenkins
Publishing, Grove City, 1997). ``And I would say that the most
important thing to find out before answering that question is what
kind of slate you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins explained that while there are a variety of sizes,
shapes, colors and styles of slate used on roofs, most slate roofs
can be divided into two basic categories: hard and soft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard slate will last anywhere from 75 to 200 years, while soft
slate will last only 50 to 125 years,'' he said, adding that as a
result, a homeowner trying to decide whether to repair, restore or
replace a slate roof should first determine whether the existing
slate is hard or soft.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, Jenkins said, colored slates are almost
always hard slate and black slates are almost always soft. (There
are some black slates that are hard, and there are some colored
slates that are soft because they're really black slates that have
been faded by the sun.) In any case, he said, a slate expert _
known as a ``slater'' _ will be able to tell hard slate from soft
simply by tapping on it.
</P>
<P>
   And since most slate roofs on homes in the Northeast were
installed in the early 1900s, Jenkins said, homeowners who have
them generally have a decision to make when the roofs start
leaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's hard slate, you probably should restore it,'' he said,
explaining that even a 100-year-old hard slate roof could have
another 100 years of useful life. ``But if it's soft, it may not be
worth fixing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said that in most cases, leaks in slate roofs are caused
either by broken or missing tiles or faulty flashing. If the
problem is with the tiles themselves, he said, repairs can easily
be made by an experienced slater. ``All you have to do is pull out
the bad slates and replace them with good ones,'' he said,
explaining that a mistake many homeowners make is to wait until
there are several broken or missing slate tiles before calling in a
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like having a cavity in your tooth and waiting to get
more cavities before getting the first one fixed,'' Jenkins said,
adding that even one cracked or missing tile can allow water
penetration that can damage the roof deck.
</P>
<P>
   Leaks caused by faulty flashing, he said, may require a full
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restoration means replacing all the metal parts on the roof,''
he said, referring to the sheets of metal flashing used to seal
areas where chimneys, vents and dormers protrude through the roof
surface. In most cases, he said, the flashing will deteriorate and
fail long before the slate itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restoration is a routine job for an experienced slater,''
Jenkins said, adding that since every job is different, the price
can run from several hundred to several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where a slate roof is beyond repair, replacement may be
necessary. And for preservationists and aesthetic purists, the only
appropriate replacement for an old slate roof is a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slate roof is regarded as the best roof you can buy,'' said
Brian Stearns, president of Vermont Slate &AMP; Copper, a slate roofing
company based in Stowe. ``It's also one of the most expensive roofs
to install.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Stearns said, a slate roof installation _
including the slate itself and removal of the existing roof _ will
cost about $1,500 per square, with each square equal to a
10-by-10-foot area.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the square footage of a roof is usually about the
same as the total square footage of the house. So a
2,000-square-foot house would require 20 squares, and a new slate
roof would cost about $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess that to do the same job with asphalt shingles
would cost about $200 a square,'' he said. ``So the question you
have to ask yourself is whether it's going to be worth spending
that much more money for slate. Then again, if the house had a
slate roof to begin with, chances are that the real estate in the
area might justify it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, some relatively new high-quality roofing
products that look like slate but that cost less than the real
thing. One is Celadon Ceramic Slate, a synthetic roof shingle
manufactured by CertainTeed Corp. in Valley Forge, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celadon gives you the look of slate without having to pay
slate prices,'' said Matt Butler, the owner of Allied Building
Products, an East Rutherford, N.J., distributor of CertainTeed
products.
</P>
<P>
   Celadon tiles, Butler said, are lighter than slate _ making it
possible to use the product on roofs that would not support the
weight of real slate _ and come with a 75-year warranty. And while
considerably more expensive than asphalt shingles _ the tiles alone
cost about $235 a square, not including installation _ they are
considerably less expensive than slate, which costs about $450 a
square, not including installation.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative to slate is Majestic Slate, a product
manufactured by EcoStar, a company based in Chicago. ``For lack of
a better term, what we're making is imitation slate,'' said Kerston
Russell, the company's president. Russell explained that his
product is an injection-molded slate look-alike made mainly of
recycled rubber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use car bumpers, radiator hoses, door moldings and even
some old tires,'' he said. ``And what we end up with is a material
that looks for all the world like real slate without any of slate's
disadvantages.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, while slate is brittle _ and can be easily
cracked or broken if stepped on during installation or repair _
Majestic Slate is flexible and will not chip or crack. Moreover, he
said, the rubber-based composition of the tile makes it possible to
simply nail each tile snugly to the roof deck _ a procedure that is
less labor-intensive than having to carefully nail through
pre-drilled holes in slate without hitting and breaking the slate.
</P>
<P>
   The material cost of Majestic is somewhat less than the material
cost of slate _ the price ranges from $285 to $360 per square. And
the simplified installation procedures generally result in even
greater savings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another lightweight alternative to slate is StoneCrest, a
metal roofing product manufactured by Metalworks, a Pittsburgh
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``StoneCrest is a galvanized steel shingle that looks like slate
and comes in an array of colors,'' said Mark Storti, the company's
manager for marketing and technical support.
</P>
<P>
   The product, which carries a lifetime warranty, is so light it
can generally be installed right over an existing asphalt shingled
roof if the local building code permits. The cost, Storti said,
ranges from $350 to $600 a square, installed.
</P>
<P>
   Information on slate roofs is available on the Web from a
publication called The Slate Roof Quarterly at
www.slateroofquarterly.

 &HT;    Flying to the land of the midnight sun and back
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Even in summer, you just don't swim in
the Arctic Ocean. It's always cold, so you approach it delicately,
respectfully, with one eye on the ice floes dotting the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-morning on July 3, Bud Barton, John Keys and Walt Pierce
carefully picked their way over the rocks and pebbles on the shore
by Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, untied a shoe, stripped off
a sock and dipped a big toe in the shallows.
</P>
<P>
   It was freezing. Goose bumps popped up on their arms as they
quickly dried off their toes and put their socks and shoes back on.
Then they stood looking out over the Arctic Ocean, dull blue-gray
beneath an overcast sky and more than 100 miles within the Arctic
Circle, and it struck them: They'd done it.
</P>
<P>
   What began two years ago as a vague, but determined, idea to fly
to the Arctic Circle culminated that July morning when three men in
jeans and windbreakers, all of them on the golden side of 50, stood
on the shore of the Arctic Ocean, looking out toward the North Pole
and, across the water, Russia. It was a view none of them had seen
before and they'd flown thousands of miles from Green River, Utah,
to see it.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was Jim Hurst's idea. Hurst, 78, of Green River, flew
as a bush pilot for 25 years in the western United States and 20
years in Canada. He retired from flying because of his health, but
as anyone who has ever flown an airplane knows, pilots never really
leave flying. Visions of the wild blue yonder always hover just
behind their eyelids, fresh and potent in the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst wanted to fly to Canada again and reacquaint himself with
the places he knows, visit old friends, soar over vast stretches of
wilderness. Two years ago he began talking about the flight with
Keys, 58, retired from 35 years with the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management and an active Moab pilot. Keys was intrigued and kept
the possibility of an Arctic Circle flight in the back of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, in 1999, Hurst began pursuing plans for the Canada
trip in earnest. He got Keys to commit to the journey _ ``because
it sounded interesting,'' Keys said _ and met Barton, 76, who is
retired from the oil and gas industry, at Green River's Melon Days
last summer. Barton knew of Hurst because of his bush pilot fame,
and invited Hurst to his house for a cool drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we sat on my front porch and watched the river, and Jim
told me he was getting together a trip to the Arctic Circle and
would I be interested,'' Barton explained. ``I told him I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Barton signed on, he asked Pierce, 73, his longtime friend
who lives in Houston, to join the crew as his passenger and the
trip mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   If the crew was unconventional _ Hurst was the only long-time
pilot, Keys got his pilot's license when he was 51 and Barton when
he was 57 _ their planning wasn't. It was thorough.
</P>
<P>
   They ordered maps and flight plans from Aero Training Products
in Vancouver, British Columbia, downloaded information from the
Airplane Owners and Pilots Association Web site, learned Canadian
flight regulations, applied for radio licenses and charted out
several route possibilities. Between September last year and June
this year they compiled tools and polar survival gear, including
tarps, fishing equipment, a bear gun, pots and other essentials.
</P>
<P>
   By June they were ready to take off and planned to leave Green
River on July 1, allotting themselves two weeks for the journey in
case weather detained them or put them off course. July 1, however,
is a Canadian holiday, so the crew decided to leave June 28.
</P>
<P>
   They took off early that morning, Barton flying his 1959 Cessna
182 and Keys his 1965 Cessna 182. The morning was cloudless and
cool as Keys flew from the Moab airfield to Green River to meet up
with Hurst, his passenger, and Barton and Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Taking off from Green River, they headed for Pocatello, Idaho,
and a fuel stop, usually flying within sight of each other and
maintaining radio contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the nice things about this trip,'' Keys said,
``because on long trips you're in the plane for hours on end, so it
was nice to have people to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first day, the flying was easy because the terrain
was familiar: Barton has logged hundreds of hours flying in the
area, especially to Logan, Utah, to bring his daughter home for
weekend visits, and Keys not only spent 35 years with the BLM, but
is a referee for college football games in the Big Sky conference
and usually flies to games.
</P>
<P>
   From Pocatello they flew to Kalispell, Mont., to refuel and
headed over the border into British Columbia. They stopped for the
night in Kamloops.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, over dinner, Hurst began to feel sick. By the end
of the night, his condition was serious enough that his friends
took him to the hospital, where doctors said Hurst shouldn't travel
farther north and should go home.
</P>
<P>
   The four men spent the next day deciding what they should do.
Hurst had no choice but to go home, but he insisted that the three
other men continue north and reach their goal of flying into the
Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wrenching decision, but finally they agreed because
they had become just as committed as Hurst to the goal.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of social workers in Kamloops, they found a flight
home for Hurst and continued on, missing his companionship and
knowledge of the area.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30 they continued north, aborting plans to stop in
Prince George because of bad weather. Instead, they turned back and
stopped for fuel in Williams Lake, British Columbia, staying that
night at the Stork's Nest Inn in Smithers, where storks roost in
the chimneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the best parts of the trip was how good the
flight service stations were and how friendly people were to us,''
Keys said. ``We never had a single problem landing and getting
fuel, and the people at those stations were always really
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   They averaged about five flight hours per day, departing
mid-morning and arriving at that day's destination with enough time
to explore the town and meet people. In Whitehorse, Yukon
Territory, where they stayed July 1, Barton and Pierce went to the
Museum of Transportation, which featured a display about bush
pilots, while Keys walked around town.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight north they generally followed the Alaska Highway,
soaring over mountains thickly carpeted with trees, over rivers and
lakes and, when they were low enough, beaver dams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I was expecting in the way of topography,''
Barton said, ``but there were trees everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they had been flying under cloud cover most of the time
since flying into Canada, on July 2 they had their first, and only,
experience with truly sketchy weather when, after stopping for fuel
in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, they flew into a storm that got so
serious _ their visibility was reduced to zero _ they had to fly up
through the clouds, which would make coming down tricky.
</P>
<P>
   However, Keys said, the flight service personnel in Inuvik,
Northwest Territories, found a hole in the cloud cover for them and
guided them down, and, once they were on the ground, recommended a
fishing lodge where they could have a good meal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the flight service personnel and his wife met the three
men for drinks the next night.
</P>
<P>
   Once they reached Inuvik they officially were within the Arctic
Circle, though it hardly seemed like it because there was no snow
on the ground and looked, in many ways, like Minnesota: flat, green
and covered with thousands of ponds and lakes. They saw pingos,
permafrost formations that are mounds of mud that continually
freeze and thaw, as well as arctic birds and the midnight sun.
</P>
<P>
   They decided they wanted to fly over the Arctic Ocean and stick
a toe in, so the next morning, they flew northwest from Inuvik and
soared half a mile from the coast out over the Arctic Ocean before
landing in Tuktoyaktuk. Barton, Keys and Pierce each got a
certificate for sticking their toes in the Arctic Ocean and a
friendly local gave Keys the tip of a musk ox horn as he walked
back from the shore.
</P>
<P>
   They had flown about 2,500 miles, taking less time than they'd
expected because Hurst wasn't along to introduce them to his
friends and show them the sights, but they were satisfied from
having reached their goal. Now they just had to get home.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Inuvik, another friendly local referred Keys to a
resident artist who carved for him an Eskimo in a canoe harpooning
a whale, which became his prized souvenir of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I just met this man in the grocery store who referred me
to this local artist,'' Keys said. ``Everyone we met was just so
friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   After staying in Inuvik July 3, they began heading south. On
July 4 they stopped for fuel in Norman Wells, Northwest
Territories, and stayed for the night in Fort Simpson, a town on
the Mackenzie River that is the Dene tribe's headquarters and that
Pope John Paul II visited in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Every time they landed on that leg of the journey they breathed
a small sigh of relief because between Inuvik and Fort Simpson
there was nothing underneath them but wilderness, ``so you're
listening to every rattle of the engine, thinking, `Come on, baby.'
''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is amazing we didn't have any mechanical problems at
all, because if we had we'd probably still be up there,'' Keys
said. ``But everything went really well.''
</P>
<P>
   The following day they made it to Fort McMurray, a mining town
famous for its oil sand and, Barton said, was one of the most
modern towns they visited. Much of the time, he said, they were
landing on gravel runways in sparsely populated areas, ``but you
could tell Fort McMurray has mining money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On July 6 they continued south, stopping for fuel in Lethbridge,
Alberta, and marvelling over the sea of cattle feed lots that
stretched to the horizon, Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   They'd been flying under clouds most of the trip, but the
weather began to clear as they got close to the border, Keys said,
and as they flew into Montana they were under blue skies again.
They stayed in Great Falls that night and the next day, after
stopping for fuel in Cody, Wyo., they flew back into Green River.
</P>
<P>
   They were glad to be home, proud of reaching their goal of
flying above the Arctic Circle, but experienced a little of the
letdown that commonly follows the end of a big trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get home you think, `Why? Why did I do this?' ''
Barton explained. ``At first it's a relief to be home, but then
it's almost like a letdown. You think, `What am I going to see new
tomorrow?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this was just so we'd have bragging rights,'' Keys said
with a laugh. ``To me, it is an accomplishment to have flown up
there, to see the midnight sun, and to do it safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Keys said he will return to the Arctic Circle, but next time
he'll go with his wife, Dell, who also is a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm 76 years old,'' Barton said. ``This probably was my
last hurrah. It was pretty good, though. I can say I dipped my toe
in the Arctic Ocean.''

 &HT;    Hotel, motel, B&AMP;B: The difference is service
 &HT;    By Ray Marcano
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I've received several e-mails recently about bed
and breakfasts and whether they hold any advantages over hotels and
motels. The quick, easy answer is: It depends on your taste, and to
some degree, your budget. What are the differences?
</P>
<P>
   _ Hotel: I use this term to describe a full-service hotel that
provides a vast array of amenities. The bellhop handles your
luggage, the concierge sets up dinner reservations, housekeeping is
available 24 hours a day, you can swim in the hotel pool and then
work out in the hotel exercise room. And you can expect to pay for
those conveniences. You'll most likely pay to park, which has
always infuriated me (You're already paying to stay at the hotel
and you have to pay extra for your car?). You're expected to tip
almost everyone who performs a service. If a bellhop takes your bag
out of your car to the front desk, that's a tip; if someone else
takes your bags to your room, that's another tip; if you have a few
hours between check-out and your flight, and store your bags at the
hotel, the person who writes your claim check expects a tip and the
person who gets them out of the room expects one, too. You'll get
room service, which means $10 eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Try this rule of thumb: If staying at a hotel, add 50 percent to
the room rate. That's what you can expect to pay for incidentals
and food if you eat at the hotel restaurants. For many travelers,
this is the only way they'll travel. Budget travelers, though, are
often surprised when they decide to treat themselves to a night at
a nice hotel and find the costs are more than they wanted to spend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Motels: They run the gamut from one-story, no-frills
accommodations in which you get a room and not much else, to
all-suites motels with a nice array of perks. The downside: If you
need extra pillows or towels, forget it because housekeeping closes
at night. If you have the midnight munchies you'll have to drive
somewhere to eat. Pool? Maybe, but it'll be outside. Personal
assistance? Beyond the front-desk person there is none. And, most
motels are away from downtowns. But there are clear advantages, and
the biggest one is price. While you can't find a good hotel for $69
to $79 a night, you can find a first-rate motel for that. Parking
is free and some of the chains offer free breakfast. That's why
budget-conscious travelers often choose this route
</P>
<P>
   _ Bed and breakfasts: They're neither hotel nor motel. You're
staying in someone's home. You get a room, some with private baths,
some without. You get breakfast, though you should always ask what
breakfast consists of. And you get something hotels and motels
can't offer _ an attentive host. Any good B&AMP;B understands the need
for a gracious host who will stay up at night and tell tales of the
area, talk about family and want to know something about their
guest. Staying at a good B&AMP;B is like staying at a cousin's house _
relaxed, friendly, charming. The cost of a night at a B&AMP;B generally
falls somewhere between a good motel and hotel, and may not even
have the amenities of a motel. Some B&AMP;Bs have no televisions or
radios, and the owners don't allow guests to come in after a
certain time (don't want to disturb the others, you know.) So B&AMP;Bs
are for a certain kind of vacation traveler who likes a more homey
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know a B&AMP;B is a good one? In many cases, you don't.
There is no independent rating system, so you don't know if a B&AMP;B
is a one-, two-, three- or four-star. So do extensive homework.
</P>
<P>
   Web site: www.ohiobba.com lists dozens of B&AMP;Bs. www.bbonline.com
has hundreds of B&AMP;Bs throughout the country. Both sites provide a
nice overview of the property and rates. Always call to make sure
the information is current.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER IS ENDING
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, summer is almost over _ at least in travel
terms. Labor Day, the last long summer weekend, is just around the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of taking a trip and waiting for those great
last-minute Internet specials, beware. Many of those ``specials''
notices are already warning travelers that discount fares aren't
good the weekend of Sept. 1-3. In addition, you'll likely find
specials at hotels and car rental agencies skimpy as well.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? If you don't need to travel that weekend, go a
week before or after. You'll probably have a longer list of
specials to choose from. You could always, of course, just pony up
the additional money.

 &HT;    The Fire is Alive
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In all three rooms of a tiny vacant apartment at
a housing project, 20 young boys and girls are hard at work on math
and reading problems, scrawling on worksheets they've flattened
across floors, tables, chairs, even the bannister leading upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   When their work is done, the kids know the real fun will begin:
a chance to make necklaces, keychains and bracelets from the bead
kits that Camp Fire program director Leslie Barr has brought for
today's session.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of children affectionately besiege Barr and her
volunteer assistant, 18-year-old Sujata Bhat, turning in their
finished work or asking for help with a problem. Meanwhile,
toddlers from the neighborhood tumble through the door, wanting to
be part of the fun as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see, we have tons of kids, and we need tons of
volunteers,'' Barr says. ``There is nothing for the kids in this
neighborhood to do. No parks, no recreation. This is it.''
</P>
<P>
   For baby boomers who remember the Camp Fire TV ads of their
youth _ little girls gathered round a campfire roasting wienies,
singing Indian songs and making earnest pledges _ this urban scene
seems a total disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   But today's Camp Fire Boys and Girls (boys were added in 1975)
are more likely to gather in a housing project than at a
campground, and more likely to learn the skills of surviving in the
urban jungle than in the great outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Youth development still is the goal of the 65-year-old Camp Fire
Council of the Greater Dayton Area, but its organizers want the
public, and especially its 600 local alumni of former leaders, to
know that its target audience has changed. In the past three to
four years, Camp Fire has begun to reach out to disadvantaged
children who need to be helped where they live, play, go to school
and worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build on our past, and at the same time find a way
to serve the needs of under-served children today,'' said Linda
Blocher, executive director of the local Camp Fire council. ``But
the problem is, very few people even know about us.''
</P>
<P>
   With a full- and part-time staff of 16, a budget of just
$200,000 and a core of volunteers from senior centers, high schools
and the University of Dayton, the local council sponsors a variety
of programs aimed at promoting self-reliance and social
responsibility among disadvantaged kids ages 4 through 16.
</P>
<P>
   The outreach includes weekly after-school programs for children
ages 7 to 12, where they can find safety, games, field trips and
tutors to help with their homework; life skills classes for
previously homeless children and their parents; volunteer service
projects for children in kindergarten through sixth grade; a young
entrepreneur program in which adolescents start their own business
and sell their own products; self-reliance classes that include how
to survive as a latchkey child, resist peer pressure and avoid
alcohol and drugs; as well as classes in baby sitting and
kindergarten preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Jones, 8, says she never misses the weekly Camp Fire
program at her housing project in Lebanon. ``I like the games, and
we learn things,'' she said. ``We learned how to set the table, and
like last week, we were learning about bullies and stuff . . . You
just walk away from them. You don't talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Wells, the volunteer who heads the after-school program in
Lebanon, says the kids from the surrounding housing project know
each other so well they treat each other like siblings, which
includes a lot of infighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a `no put-down zone.' What does that mean?'' Wells
asked the eight kids putting together puzzles and playing board
games in the neighborhood center.
</P>
<P>
   ``No putting down people,'' answered Jason Romin, 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``No calling people names,'' added his brother Justin, 11.
</P>
<P>
   As the children play together peacefully, it's hard to imagine
that, earlier that morning, several parents had complained to Wells
that the same kids had been fighting at a neighborhood basketball
court. ``Right now they're having fun. They're learning to work
together _ cooperating,'' Wells said. ``It's just a matter of
getting them to follow through 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Phillips, the youth program coordinator for Dayton Urban
Ministries, credits Camp Fire volunteer Mary Yaney with turning
around the ministries' after-school enrichment program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children's behaviors really have changed since (Camp Fire)
has been involved with the ministries, especially their attitude
toward music and different arts and crafts,'' Phillips said. ``When
I first came here two years ago, nobody wanted to do arts. They
didn't want to do anything. Now they can't wait to see Mary, and
they get all excited because she always has some interesting
activities for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministries' Camp Fire group last year won a first place in
arts and crafts at the Ohio State Fair, as well as the grand prize
in the fair's nature theme for its collection of leaves and
wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Fire has developed programs to meet the needs of children
of nearly all ages, including a Young Entrepreneurs program that
introduces kids ages 9 to 13 to the business world by having them
design, market and sell their own products.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the local Camp Fire council launched a biannual
newsletter to try to reach more of the 600 or so alumni in the
Greater Dayton area. Council leaders are hoping that the pleasant
memories of camping, after-school club meetings and role modeling
that they experienced will inspire them to join the organization in
its new mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need their support,'' said Janet Davis, head of the
organization's alumni committee. ``We have to re-educate them in
how we can help the inner-city child. . . . We don't want everybody
to dig into their pockets, but we would like their enthusiasm. We
want to rekindle the spirit that was there.''
</P>
<P>
   If alumni need any anyone to fan their enthusiasm, all they have
to do is talk to 18-year-old Bhat, who has volunteered her time to
the Camp Fire program at a Dayton housing project for the past
three years. The kids know and like her so well now they greet her
instantly with hugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's given me a whole new perspective about the way people
live in other parts of the city that I wasn't aware of at all,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she plans to major in public policy and sociology
when she enters the University of Chicago this fall. ``It's really
given me a whole new direction in life.''

 &HT;    Using Inbox helps make life easier
 &HT;    By Dann Stupp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You can find offers for free e-mail accounts,
Web-hosting space and even Internet access throughout the Internet.
But Excite Inbox (www.excite.com/Info/inbox/welcome.html) is
finally offering something of worth _ convenience.
</P>
<P>
   If you're tired of checking multiple e-mail accounts, you can
configure Inbox to check all of your POP3 e-mail addresses from one
place. Your work, school and personal e-mails can be sent to one
mailbox, eliminating the need to log into numerous accounts.
</P>
<P>
   You can also receive faxes and voice mails (with the help of
Real Player or Windows Media Player) from Inbox. You'll be issued a
hefty 10-digit extension to use with the system's main number (888)
392-4832 (3-EXCITE2), but it's a whole lot cheaper than paying for
a voice-mail service, which can run $10 to $15 per month. Faxes can
be viewed like e-mail, and you can listen to voice mails with a
simple mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   This one-stop communications center works great for the business
person on the go or for any small, Web-based business. And with the
backing of Internet powerhouse Excite, the features are likely to
get even sweeter.

 &HT;    Beat the heat in the dog days of summer
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dogged out from the heat? Get yourself into shape with
a little sun sense by protecting your hair and skin from damaging
ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to stay inside if you have the right essentials
to shield you.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to double up on sunscreen by using a moisturizer
and a foundation that offer SPF protection.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hudson, senior makeup artist with the M.A.C. pro team,
says people with normal skin should look for moisturizers and
foundations that have an SPF 15 protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know 15 over 15 doesn't give you 30, but it still gives
you more protection than the SPF 15 sunblock protection would
alone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Water-based facial spritzes and mists are also good in the
summer heat because they provide instant refreshment without
disturbing makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could use it every 15 minutes and it's not going to hurt
you,'' Hudson says. ``Once you get used to it, you'll get hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Perfect your tan with bronzing and self-tanning lotions that
provide the color you need without streaking. The proper
application could mean the difference between looking like a
lobster or having a healthy glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a definite art to it,'' advises Hudson. ``You've got
to exfoliate first and get any dead skin out of the way. Then it
has to be applied very smoothly and evenly.''

 &HT;    Shades of retro cool: Sunglasses take inspiration from '60s,
'70s
 &HT;    By Ginger McFarland
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shades of Jackie O. sunning herself on the
Mediterranean or dodging the paparazzi revisit us now that
large-lens sunglasses are back in vogue. Brands such as Gucci,
Prada and Armani have reached back into the eyewear archives and
reinterpreted these retro frames to make them look new again.
</P>
<P>
   ``With time, all styles repeat themselves,'' says Drew Meirow,
owner of Planet Eyewear in Atlanta. Meirow noted the most popular
styles are aviators, semi-rimless frames and large rectangle
frames.
</P>
<P>
   Menelik, 32, promotions and marketing director of downtown
nightclub Karma, is rarely seen not wearing one of his dozen pairs
of shades. This trendsetter has been sporting large lenses since
the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shades are part of my personality. I feel naked without
them,'' he said. ``It's easy to throw on a pair of retro lenses and
make a statement without having to wear an entire '70s outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   Menelik, a former fashion design student, added: ``There is a
resurgence of the retro vibe in the music industry, which is
closely tied to fashion now. People want to feel like they are
attached to that ('70s) time period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They reminded me of something old school,'' says Sean Bailey,
24, of Atlanta. He can be spotted wearing his large orange lenses
by Incognito in Little Five Points or clubbing it downtown, or
anywhere he wants to look cool. `` The teacher/artist ``throws 'em
on'' with casual clothing when it's sunny.
</P>
<P>
   Shop around and you'll find that there's a large-lens style
ideally suited to your face size and shape. Bigger may be better,
but no accessory should overwhelm your outfit.

   About midway through ``The Perfect Storm,'' the film adaptation
of Sebastian Junger's phenomenal best-seller, the skipper of the
32-foot sailboat Mistral, sporting a jaunty yachtsman's cap and a
highbrow New England accent, makes an offhand remark about his vast
offshore prowess. It's a setup line. He's silly, smug and about to
get walloped.
</P>
<P>
   As readers of the book know, the character is based on Ray
Leonard, the skipper of Satori, a Westsail 32 that was abandoned by
its crew in a North Atlantic gale during a U.S. Coast Guard rescue
operation in the fall of 1991. Portrayed by Junger as a strange
introvert with a fondness for the bottle, Leonard has now been
skewered both in print and by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   With each subsequent retelling of his story, the lines that
define who Leonard is and what happened during that terrible,
perfect storm become more blurred. In fact, Leonard is a retired
research ecologist for the U.S. Forest Service, a former college
administrator and an accomplished long-distance voyager with a
Coast Guard license and tens of thousands of miles under his keel,
and he does not fall within the neat, nasty boundaries of his
depictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen the movie and I probably won't until I can
borrow a copy of the video,'' Leonard said last week from the small
home he is building for himself in western Vermont. ``But as for
hats, I just wear a ball cap at sea. It keeps the sun out of my
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Junger, who did not speak to Leonard for his book, did not
return a phone call seeking comment for this column. But in a 1997
interview about Leonard in The New York Observer, Junger said, ``He
didn't sound like the kind of guy I wanted to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame, because Junger, whose book focuses on the loss
of the fishing vessel Andrea Gail and includes vivid writing about
meteorology, long-line fishing and Coast Guard heroics, missed a
grand opportunity to capture the passion of a long-distance sailor.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, 72, bought his Westsail in 1974, the same year the
rugged little double-ended yacht was featured on the cover of Time
as the perfect vessel for folks ready to chuck it all and head for
the South Seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satori is the Buddhist word for enlightenment,'' Leonard said.
``I was at the midpoint of my career, and the boat gave me new
insight into myself. Whenever I got into a bad fix with her, she
always did better than I thought she would. She was very well-named
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1974 to '91, Leonard sailed Satori hard and often, mostly
alone. The boat was well equipped with designated storm sails, and
Leonard had plenty of chance to use them in roughly 60,000 miles of
sailing. Divorced in 1985, he moved aboard Satori the same year. In
October 1991, accompanied by Karen Stimson and Susan Bylander, two
women he had spent the summer working with, Leonard and Satori set
out from New Hampshire bound for Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the voyage was a nightmare. Several days into
the trip, after receiving a Mayday call relayed by a commercial
vessel, a Coast Guard helicopter plucked Satori's crew from a
roiled sea. While that fact is indisputable, the events leading up
to the rescue remain unclear; there are two very different versions
of Satori's fateful passage.
</P>
<P>
   In Junger's book, which is based largely on interviews with
Stimson, the sailors survive through the initiative of the women,
who are forced to take action when Leonard, ``sullen and silent,
sneaking gulps off a whiskey bottle,'' refuses to do so. In what he
describes as 30-foot seas, Junger reported that Satori was
``starting to lose the battle to stay afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, however, dismisses much of Junger's account. ``I'd
guess the seas were 15 to 18 feet, tops,'' he said. ``Satori had
been in much worse. It was a very uncomfortable ride, but the boat
was sound and we weren't taking on water, except for a few gallons
that came through the hatch. And the drinking bit is just totally
untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was employing standard tactics for weathering extreme
conditions: he had battened Satori down and was content to wait
things out. ``You never head towards shore in a heavy storm,'' he
said. ``It's too dangerous. And the weather forecast said a
hurricane was heading towards Bermuda, so it didn't make sense to
keep going that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said he did not authorize a Mayday call, though he did
give the women permission to radio the Coast Guard to update
Satori's position. And when the chopper did arrive, he considered
staying aboard Satori. Ultimately, when he was ordered to leave, he
complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I knew the crew would have to jump in the water, I wasn't
comfortable about having them go alone,'' he said. ``Also, I knew
if I disobeyed I wouldn't be able to land in a U.S. port for
several years, and I've seen expatriates in foreign ports. I didn't
want to be one.''
</P>
<P>
   Stimson, who was on vacation from her job in Maine last week,
was unavailable for comment. Interestingly, according to a friend
of hers, Stimson now owns a Westsail 32.
</P>
<P>
   What transpired after the rescue supports Leonard's contention
that Satori was still seaworthy when her crew leapt off her
transom. Several days later, the boat washed up on a Maryland
beach. A bag of personal items that Leonard had mistakenly dropped
when he left Satori was still on the afterdeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``A park ranger found my phone number in it,'' Leonard said.
``He called me up and said come get your boat. It was fine. I went
down and had her hauled off, cleaned her up, then sailed her to
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard continued to sail Satori until this spring, when he sold
the boat to a Texas couple. As for the fallout from Junger's book,
which Leonard has read, he said: ``People who don't know me who've
read it have preconceived notions. I've only had one boat delivery
job, and I used to get plenty. I'm not bitter, but I don't think
the book or movie explained what sailing's all about. Bluewater
sailors are sharp, self-reliant, and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Leonard no longer owns Satori, he is still drawn to
the sea. Earlier this year, fulfilling a lifelong dream, he went to
Alaska in search of the same work that took the lives of the crew
of the Andrea Gail. Once there, he signed on aboard a salmon
trawler. Of all things, the sailor became a fisherman.

AN OUTLET STORE WITH A DIFFERENCE: CAPPUCCINO 
</HEADLINE>
   By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sue Greenberg folded herself into a chair in the cafe
at ABC Carpet and Home Warehouse Outlet in the Bronx and ordered
chicken francais and a glass of white wine. The executive assistant
to the store's president, Greenberg talked about how the cafe,
which opened a year ago, enhanced the store, which stands out in
the gritty neighborhood like a woman at a Promise Keepers powwow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couples look around the store, then come in here, have a cup
of coffee and decide if they want to spend $5,000 on a rug,''
Greenberg said of the cafe, which is owned and operated by her
sister Janet.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that a man from Myrtle Beach, S.C., who was
visiting Manhattan arrived at the store by taxi and shopped for two
hours while the cabdriver waited with the meter running. Cost of
the taxi: $170. Cost of a rug from Iran that the man bought:
$3,499.
</P>
<P>
   This is all to say that ABC's outpost in the Bronx _ the
flagship store is on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan _ is no poor
relation.
</P>
<P>
   Customer after customer notes that it is nothing like a typical
factory outlet. The goods are artfully displayed. There is no dust,
and salespeople are willing to serve. Like the Manhattan store, it
brings to mind your grandmother's attic. (That is, if your
grandmother is Brooke Astor.) Prices are 20 percent to 50 percent
lower than they are in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The 320,000-square-foot emporium in the Bronx opened 17 years
ago as a warehouse. Two years later it started selling carpets and
rugs to the public. Now, in addition to floor coverings, there are
antiques and reproductions galore, linens and bed and bath items,
fabrics and remnants and cookware. Price tags hang even from the
mosaic tables, Brazilian china closets and chandeliers in the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is for sale,'' said Paul Chapman, the president of
the Bronx store, ``except for the pillars that hold up the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the comings and goings at ABC appear to be
unaffected by the rhythms of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, most of them well heeled and from the suburbs of Long
Island, Connecticut, New Jersey and Westchester, said they had no
qualms about driving to the area, possibly because the store has
its own parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The store stands on an industrial stretch of Bronx River Avenue.
The road is lined with squat, rambling buildings that house
auto-body and auto-parts stores, auto repair shops and used-car
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Hector B., a mechanic at the Chase Tire Shop who would not give
his last name, said that customers occasionally left their cars to
be repaired and walked over to ABC to shop. But Frank Ramirez of
Parkchester, who had taken his car to the Pompy Repair Shop a few
doors away, said he could not fathom doing such a thing. ``I
usually wait for my car,'' he said. ``I don't leave my car with
anyone. This is the Bronx!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The blocks that surround the store and its neighbors are dotted
with housing projects, well-maintained apartment buildings and some
two-family houses. One day recently, a 5-year-old on a bicycle was
trying to summon the nerve to ride through the running water of an
open fire hydrant. Adolescent boys, all legs and arms, laughed
outside a corner bodega.
</P>
<P>
   The police say the neighborhood has a high crime rate that is
rising in some categories. For example, from Jan. 1 to June 30 this
year there were 35 rapes, compared with 27 for the same period last
year, and 401 burglaries, compared with 317 last year. The most
significant drop in crime was for car theft: There were 330 auto
thefts this year, down from 465 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, is a big fan of
the store, and he takes issue with the characterization of the
neighborhood given by the police. ``It has a high crime rate
relative to what? Greenwich, Connecticut?'' he said. ``The fact is
people are coming down to the store, and they are fine. It's a
terrific place.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoppers agree.
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre Engels, her 1-year-old son, Jack, and her mother,
Kathleen DeBlasio, all from Rye, visited the store on a recent
Sunday afternoon. ``I'm not fearful of the area at all,'' said
Engels, who sipped a cappuccino and shared a pasta salad with her
mother and Jack. ``It's right off the Bruckner Expressway.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBlasio agreed. ``There's a parking lot with a security
guard,'' she said. ``You don't have to worry about finding a
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Engels, who said the cafe was a nice addition because there were
few restaurants in the area, shopped for two hours, riffling
through rugs. She finally settled on a 9-foot-by-12-foot dhurrie
rug, which cost $299.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Shufflebotham of Brooklyn Heights said she visited the
outlet twice a week, often stopping in the cafe. ``It's good to
rest for a few minutes,'' she said, sipping a cappuccino. ``This is
just as nice as the Manhattan store. Actually it's a little bit
smaller, so it's more relaxing. The cafe is nice for husbands who
maybe don't like to shop as much.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a plus for the store's 150 employees, too, Greenberg said.
``There's nothing around here to eat unless you want McDonald's or
Kentucky Fried Chicken.''

MIKI DENHOF, 88, AN INNOVATIVE ART DIRECTOR FOR MAGAZINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Miki Denhof, one of the first women to be the art director of a
magazine, and a noted mentor of fashion photographers, died on Aug.
2 at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, when Denhof joined Conde Nast, its fashion and
lifestyle magazines were widely influential for their use of
elegant typography and conceptual photography, approaches in which
she, too, excelled. The executive art director, Alexander Liberman,
installed Denhof as promotion art director of Vogue. There, ``she
was a creative force and arbiter of quality,'' said a friend and
colleague, Estelle Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   ``She also developed a keen ability to edit pictures into
narrative sequences and was deft with type,'' Ellis continued.
``She transcended the conventions of advertising design at that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Later named the editorial art director for House and Garden and
Glamour magazines, Denhof collaborated with Liberman, refining the
typographic and photographic styles that characterized those
publications.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not simply a stylist. ``Miki always had a sense of
the big picture,'' said Don Wise, who was art director of the
Glamour promotion art department in the 1950s. ``She designed in an
intellectual way, using words as integral parts of her pictures.
Now designers routinely integrate type and image, but she did it
before most others.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, at Glamour, she nurtured and mentored many U.S. and
European-emigre photographers, including David Bailey, Frank
Horvat, Jeanloup Sieff, Louis Faurer and Saul Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the only art director I wouldn't question,'' Bailey
said. ``She could put 22 pictures on a spread and I wouldn't worry.
She'd always do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Denhof was born in 1912 in Trieste, Italy, raised in Austria and
educated in Vienna and Berlin. She left Germany for New York with
her family in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   One of her earliest design jobs was as an assistant to the
Modernist designer Paul Rand at Esquire and Apparel Arts magazines.
She was also art director of Conde Nast Books, responsible for such
titles as ``Vanity Fair: Photographs of an Age 1914-1936'' with
Diane Edkins, and ``The Successful Face'' with Amy Green.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Conde Nast in 1977 she designed exhibitions,
catalogs and a documentary book for the Guild Hall in East Hampton,
which also mounted an exhibition of her editorial layouts.
</P>
<P>
   She spent the last few years archiving the photo albums and
diaries of her father, Bernhard Bardach, a doctor in the
Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. Recently she donated 900
of the photographs to the Leo Baeck Institute in New York. Some
were used in the 1999 exhibition ``Fighting for the Fatherland: The
Patriotism of Jews in World War I.''
</P>
<P>
   Denhof was divorced from Hans Denhof, who is deceased. She has
no immediate survivors.

GM PINS HOPES ON VEHICLE FOR ROAD WARRIORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Wash., Ind., Texas, Mo., N.J., Conn.)   (Eds: Adds number of Saturns sold a year in 2nd take, graf bgng,
John G.) 
By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Trying to capture the spirit of the times, General
Motors occasionally introduces a whole new brand, hoping it will
grow as popular as Cadillac, Buick or Oldsmobile. A decade ago it
brought out Saturns and Geos to tap a national desire for
affordable, sporty, fuel-efficient cars.
</P>
<P>
   Now GM is at it again. Its latest venture: the Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Jeep but far bigger, the Hummer started as a military
transport, the Humvee, which was used in the Persian Gulf war for
everything from launching missiles to ferrying the wounded.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War ended, the Humvee's manufacturer is looking to
civilian buyers. It has sold about 1,000 a year, for about $100,000
apiece, to affluent entrepreneurs, limousine companies and a
sprinkling of celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mike Tyson
and the rapper Coolio.
</P>
<P>
   GM recently acquired the Hummer brand, placing a big bet that
the decade-long trend toward ever larger and more
aggressive-looking sport utility vehicles would continue. Besides
selling the current version, GM will introduce at least two smaller
Hummer models over the next three years, at much lower prices than
the current model.
</P>
<P>
   With a national network of Hummer dealerships, and plans to
pursue the New York market in particular, the company expects to
make Hummers as common as BMWs, with sales approaching 150,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see a lot in New York City, places like Manhattan where
your affluent buyers are,'' said Michael DiGiovanni, GM's general
manager of Hummer operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the mass marketing of Hummers raises the same safety and
environmental issues that have dogged the largest sport utility
vehicles: extremely poor fuel efficiency, higher emissions of
smog-causing pollutants than cars, and a variety of risks and
annoyances to motorists in other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Even without its military look or a celebrity at the wheel, the
Hummer would be hard to miss: It is taller, much wider and a full
ton heavier than even GM's largest sport utility vehicle, the
Suburban. Indeed, while it seats only four, the current Hummer
weighs as much as two Jeep Grand Cherokees or three small cars.
</P>
<P>
   GM says its research shows that many prosperous baby boomers
cannot afford the current model but still love its military look.
GM's surveys have found that the Hummer is also the favorite brand
of teen-age boys and the third favorite of teen-age girls, after
only Volkswagen and Saturn. That is especially important to GM
because people tend to form lifelong preferences during their
teens.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer's teen-age admirers include Cooper Schwartz of
Bellevue, Wash. As a small boy, he used to collect model sports
cars _ Corvettes, Porsches and Ferraris. Now 17, he keeps a scale
model of a black Hummer on the shelf next to his bed, and dreams of
the day when he can afford a real Hummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the fact that the Hummer is a tank; it's like a tank
with fashion, it's like having your own war toy,'' said Schwartz,
co-captain of his high school football team. ``I like something
where I can look down into another car and give that knowing smile
that `I'm bigger than you.' It makes me feel powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Hummer can seem downright overpowering compared with
other passenger vehicles, raising the issue of safety.
</P>
<P>
   The current Hummer has 16 inches of ground clearance, half a
foot more than any other mass-market sport utility, and is designed
to climb over vertical walls up to 22 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations require car bumpers to be 16 to 20 inches
high. So the Hummer's height greatly increases the risk in crashes
that the vehicle will ride over cars' bumpers and door sills and
slam into the passenger compartment. And because the Hummer is so
heavy, it inflicts far more damage in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   While future Hummer models will have somewhat less ground
clearance and weigh somewhat less, they are being designed with a
central goal of ``unparalleled off-road performance.'' So they will
still be tall and heavy enough to pose problems for safety
engineers like Terry Connolly, GM's director of North American
vehicle safety, who said that his office had played little part in
the company's Hummer planning and design.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than other sport utilities, Hummers can block the view
of other motorists. While cars tend to be 5 or 6 feet wide, and
most sport utilities are a little over 6 feet wide, the current
Hummer is 7 feet 2 inches wide, and GM's prototype for a model the
length of the Chevrolet Tahoe full-sized sport utility is 6 feet 10
inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   GM says that the unusual width of Hummers is part of their brand
identity, so that even the smaller Hummers will be extra wide,
making them hard to park as well. The wide stance should reduce the
risk of their rolling over, however.
</P>
<P>
   Among the environmental problems, the Hummers will emit far more
air pollutants than cars. Current federal rules allow large sport
utilities to emit 5.5 times the smog-causing nitrogen oxides that
cars do. While Ford has improved its sport utilities and pickups so
they pollute no more than cars, GM does not plan to reduce air
pollution from its Hummers and other large sport utility vehicles
until required to do so by federal regulations in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is another issue. AM General, the military
contractor that developed the vehicle, says that the current Hummer
gets 13 miles to the gallon in the city and 15 on the highway. The
Hummer manages this mileage only because it has weak acceleration
and burns diesel fuel, which gives 35 percent better mileage than
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to make its next Hummer, like the current one, heavy
enough to be classified as a medium-duty truck and therefore exempt
from federal fuel-economy rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman, said GM would include
Hummers in its voluntary commitment, announced on Wednesday, to
have better gas mileage than Ford for sport utilities in 2005. GM
will have to make its other sport utilities much more efficient to
offset the Hummers.

</P>
<P>
   The Hummer as a passenger vehicle also troubles some U.S. war
veterans. Hummer buyers typically have not served in the military,
let alone fought in combat. ``It's like someone who always wanted
to be a cowboy and who goes out later in life and buys a hat and a
horse _ well, that doesn't make you a cowboy,'' said Bruce Harder,
a retired Marine colonel who is now director of national security
and foreign affairs at Veterans of Foreign Wars.
</P>
<P>
   During the Reagan administration's military buildup, a large
factory was built in South Bend, Ind., to manufacture 25,000 Humvee
military transports a year. Production soon plunged below 4,000
Humvees a year, so in late 1992 AM General began building nearly
identical Hummers for civilians on the same assembly line. GM and
AM General broke ground last Monday on a second Hummer assembly
plant in Mishawaka, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   GM will rely mostly on new models to increase Hummer sales,
while continuing to sell the current Hummer, which it is renaming
the Hummer H1. It plans to introduce in 2002 a $45,000 Hummer H2,
to be built in Mishawaka, with maximum sales of 40,000 a year. The
H2 will be the length of the Tahoe but considerably wider.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer H3, the size of midsize sport utilities like the
Chevrolet Blazer or Ford Explorer, is to go on sale the following
year for just under $25,000, as a higher-volume model aimed at a
market of young men. GM has also done a little work on a possible
Hummer H4, which would be slightly smaller and cheaper, but has
made no decisions on it.
</P>
<P>
   John G. Middlebrook, GM's vice president for North American
vehicle brand marketing, said GM would choose some of its most
successful dealers to sell Hummers. ``Like when we started up
Saturn, we have a clean sheet here,'' he said. &UR;  &LR; Saturn sells
230,000 cars a year.
</P>
<P>
   GM decided against a Hummer dealership in Manhattan because of
real estate costs. Instead, it plans dealerships across northern
New Jersey and Long Island, N.Y., and at least one for Westchester
County, N.Y., and Fairfield County, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ballew, GM's general director for market analysis, said
that the rising concentration of wealth and income in American
society over the last two decades had been the single most
important social trend for automakers. A very large class of
high-income, fairly youthful households has been created, he said,
and these people care little about gasoline prices and other
expenses of operating a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to aim the H1, H2 and H3 at different markets. The H1
will be marketed to ``rugged individualists.'' These are people who
are irreverent and daring and want to be seen that way by other
people, DiGiovanni said. ``The rugged individualists are people who
really seek out peer approval _ they're really going to go off
road, go out in the desert and come back and tell people about
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keri Quinn, a 44-year-old bachelor and co-founder of a software
company in Dallas who sold his Nissan 300ZX sports car and raided
his retirement account to buy his Hummer, said he went on frequent
off-road driving trips with his friends but also liked the
thumbs-up signals he received from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Hummer H2 is intended for ``successful achievers,''
especially people who perceive themselves as daring risk takers but
tend not to take risks involving their physical safety. ``They're
daring in the sense they may take a big stock-market position, like
buying 20,000 shares of an e-commerce stock,'' DiGiovanni said.
``They really have not much intention of going off road, but it's
really important for them that people tell them how successful they
are.''

   The Hummer H3 will be for young buyers, including those under
25, and is still in the early stages of design. The United States'
top-selling Hummer dealer, Jim Lynch in O'Fallon, Mo., a suburb of
St. Louis, said 10 of the 162 Hummers he sold last year were sold
to people who were buying them for their teen-age children.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Frankel, the Houston owner of a factory that makes what he
described as ``hillbilly'' novelty teeth, said he had bought two
Hummers and planned to buy another for his 9-year-old daughter when
she turns 16. ``I think it's a great first car for a kid,'' he
said. ``They can't destroy it, and they'll be the envy of all their
friends.''

CONVENTION OFFICIALS EMPHASIZED THE LOCAL ANGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Adds graf in 2nd take bgng, Locally, the ..., with convention
ratings down locally in Atlanta.)  
By PETER MARKS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For WLTV, the Univision station in Miami, covering the
Republicans in Philadelphia was like getting a seat at a national
banquet. Each day, the outlet was given the access it needed to
tailor its Spanish-language newscast via daily interviews with,
among others, Al Cardenas, the chairman of the Florida delegation,
and Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 11 p.m., there was a highlight and later we localized the
issues and went live with a local delegate,'' said Bernadette
Pardo, the station's senior political correspondent. ``The coverage
ended up much more productive because there was a larger local
emphasis.''
</P>
<P>
   On the airwaves in Atlanta, prominent Republicans like Colin
Powell, Dick Cheney, Elizabeth Dole and Newt Gingrich were not mere
fixtures on network news programs, but also appeared in profile
pieces and sat for interviews with local anchors and reporters. On
Chicago's top-rated WLS, Bush family members spoke with Linda Yu,
an anchor.
</P>
<P>
   And in Boston, the final night of WCVB's coverage from
Philadelphia featured one of its reporter-anchors, Natalie
Jacobson, proclaiming in a way that put a familiar local face on
convention-floor exuberance: ``What a night for George W. Bush!
What a convention!''
</P>
<P>
   The major networks may have complained loudly about a dearth of
breaking news and even cut back their coverage this year of the
four days and nights in the First Union Center. But no such griping
was heard from the local electronic news media, whose broadcasting
needs convention officials tried to satisfy to a degree unmatched
by previous party gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Using a battalion of bookers, the Republicans put 200 Bush
surrogates at the disposal of radio stations, Web sites and
especially local television outlets. They provided free satellite
time to stations that did not book their own, and concentrated
heavily on contacting outlets in markets in crucial states like
Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Michigan, with offers to
put Republican talking heads on their news programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ranged from congressmen to Condoleezza Rice,'' Nels Olson,
the convention's master scheduler, said, referring to Bush's top
foreign policy adviser. ``She was going on local shows, even the
Internet. The idea was to get as many people out there as we could
talking about George Bush. This is my third convention in this job
and in terms of sheer volume, this is two or three times the volume
we did last time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of real news, or even real debate, what dominated
American news pages and airwaves last week was the sound of one
party clapping. How that played depended greatly on how much each
of the 1,600 news organizations at the convention, and myriad
others that watched from afar, was willing to go beyond the happy
talk and examine the nature of Bush's appeal and the issues that
defined his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Republicans, the public-relations bonanza _ and the
bounce in Bush's own ratings _ was the payoff for what the
intensive message discipline imposed on the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said she was
impressed by the meticulousness with which the Republicans were
collectively putting on one face for the news media. On a stroll on
the convention floor before a session one evening, she came upon a
copy of the ``message points'' for talking to the media that
convention organizers had placed on every delegate's seat.
</P>
<P>
   The document was nine pages. ``I haven't seen anything this
detailed,'' she said. ``It's nicely structured to brief an activist
to make a case. Usually it's a two-page `message profile' with
sound bites in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson? ``The Republicans know what their message is,'' she
continued. ``They are able to outline it and outline the line of
defense, given the likely Democratic response.''
</P>
<P>
   An upbeat message seemed to be delivered pretty uniformly from
one end of the country to the other, from the pages of The Honolulu
Advertiser (``State GOP leaders say Bush will do well in Isles,''
said a Friday headline) to The Portland Press Herald (``Mainers
Uplifted by Bush Message''). Bush's acceptance speech on Thursday
night was not only the most prominently reported event of the week
but also the most favorably received. Commentators as diverse as
Jacob Weisberg of the Webzine Slate, Margaret Carlson of Time
magazine and the conservative columnist Robert Novak all gave it
admiring notices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The address, by Bush's chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson, was
loaded with quotable lines, and the media turned some into
overnight classics. Among the most often cited, a reference to
President Clinton: ``So much promise, to no great purpose,'' and a
dig at Vice President Al Gore: ``I am not running in borrowed
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the largest city in the governor's home state,
coverage of the convention was voluminous, particularly by the
strictures of local television news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been covering conventions a lot of years, and I never
remember one where so many local people were playing a role,''
observed Nancy Shafran, news director of KPRC, an NBC affiliate
that sent six staff members to Philadelphia. The convention led the
newscast every night, and on Thursday, the program was expanded.
``There was so much to cover it couldn't fit in the typical
35-minute show,'' Shafran said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's three network affiliates sent reporters to the
convention, but devoted a lot less time to what was going on.
Thursday night, in fact, none led the 6 o'clock programs with
political news; at 11 p.m., the speech moved up to the off-lead
position on WNBC. ``But first,'' Chuck Scarborough, the anchor,
announced as an introduction to a piece about a death from E. coli
bacteria, ``a family copes with tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   KNX, an all-news radio station in Los Angeles, site of the
Democratic convention next week, sent two reporters to the
gathering in Philadelphia and broadcast reports from there for 9 to
10 minutes every hour. And talk radio in Boston, a Democratic town,
was nonetheless consumed with the topic on the night of Bush's
speech. ``The crowd tonight would applaud and go crazy,'' said Jon
Keller, a WBZ radio commentator reporting from the convention
floor, ``if he held up a piece of French toast.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense that the response was preordained is probably what
turns off many potential viewers and listeners. Though the number
of people who tune in or log on to convention coverage locally is
hard to measure, nationally the viewership was down. On the three
major networks, for instance, an average of 16.6 million viewers
watched the 1996 Republican convention on a given night; this year,
the number dropped to 16.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the numbers were off, too. In Atlanta, for instance,
according to Ray Carter, news director for the market-leading
WSB-TV, an average of about 88,500 households watched this year's
convention, down from 118,600 in 1996. In fact, at 10 p.m.
Thursday, when Atlanta's big three affiliates carried Bush's speech
in its entirety, they were easily beaten by the Fox affiliate,
WAGA, which chose to run its regular newscast with only about eight
and a half minutes of convention coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the consummation of the `showbizification' of politics,''
Martin Kaplan, associate dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Southern California, said of the
convention. ``Whether it was better entertainment than `Survivor,'
that the audience has already voted on.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost invariably, the local stations had agendas in
Philadelphia customized to stories in their own backyards. Glen
Horn, executive producer of WFOR, a CBS affiliate in Miami, said
his reporter, Elliott Rodriguez, covered a meeting Bush held with
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of it had the bite of a juicy crime story. ``I
don't think that it had any great surprises,'' Horn said. ``Does it
even have the drama of conventions gone by? No. But it's part of
our history and for that reason alone we pay special attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, WLS, Chicago's ABC affiliate, found a home-grown angle
with a little mischief in it. The station covered a bomb scare in a
Philadelphia hotel triggered innocently by ticking alarm clocks in
a box. The clocks belonged to the Illinois attorney general, Jim
Ryan, who planned to give them away as mementos. Fans attending a
``Star Trek'' convention had to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a shot with a Vulcan in it,'' said Eric Lerner, the
station's news director. He liked the story so much he ran it
twice.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One woman was attacked last spring in Central Park by
two strangers who beat and sexually abused her until she broke free
and ran to safety on Manhattan's West Side. The attackers were
convicted of aggravated sexual abuse and are serving long prison
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman was attacked last summer by a man who dragged her
under the Coney Island Boardwalk, where, according to her grand
jury testimony, he punched her and raped her and told her that ``he
was going to put me 6 feet under.'' This assailant, a serial sex
offender, secured a lenient plea bargain for attempted assault. He
will be eligible for a parole hearing in January.
</P>
<P>
   The drastically different outcomes of these similar cases were
the result of what prosecutors, physicians and victims' advocates
describe as a game of chance inside emergency rooms at New York
City hospitals. The first woman received a thorough examination
that documented evidence of the attack. The second woman did not.
</P>
<P>
   Years after forensic exams became a standard part of treatment
for victims of sex crimes, the level of competence in administering
the exams varies widely. Some victims get meticulous treatment.
Many do not. This uneven quality of care, experts say, can mean an
uneven quality of evidence with which to prosecute some of
society's most malevolent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a crap shoot,'' said John Albert, a director at
Safe Horizon, an organization that assists crime victims in the
five boroughs. ``Depending on which hospital treats you, you can
either get care that is excellent, or you can get care that is
delinquent.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Gov. George Pataki plans to sign into law the Sexual
Assault Reform Act, which includes a provision directing the
Department of Health to develop more rape treatment programs like
the one at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which treated the
victim of the Central Park attack.
</P>
<P>
   This treatment model, known as a sexual assault examiner
program, provides every victim with immediate care, a private
examination area and a nurse or a doctor with special training in
forensic exams. It also encourages examiners to serve as witnesses
before grand juries and in trials, giving prosecutors leverage when
negotiating plea agreements with defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of these programs exist in the 73 hospitals with
emergency rooms in New York City, handling a small fraction of the
2,000 to 2,800 rapes reported in the city each year. Nationally,
about 300 of these centers are in service, treating as few as 2
percent of sex crime patients in the country each year, though
experts say the programs have been expanding each year since their
inception in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The precise plans for expanding the programs in New York, and
for paying for them, have not yet been made, state health officials
say. But Pataki and victims' advocates say the act gives New York a
chance to create a network of sophisticated treatment centers
throughout the city, bringing a measure of parity to the care and
attention that victims of sex crimes receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, emergency rooms too often lack the forensic
expertise to collect the evidence needed to convict sexual
predators,'' Pataki said. ``The advocates have been advocating, and
we think they are right, that we need to have three of these
special centers in each borough. Through the state Department of
Health, we are going to work with them to make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, state health law has required emergency rooms to
examine survivors of sex crimes with rape kits _ a box of equipment
and sampling envelopes that standardizes the collection of evidence
_ approved by the state. But these exams are sometimes undermined,
experts say, by tensions between the medical needs in emergency
departments and the legal needs of the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The potential problems are many. Prosecutors and victims'
advocates tell of patients who have been subjected to long waits in
public seating areas, of untrained examiners botching the exams and
of physicians who have turned over evidence to the police but have
refused to cooperate further. ``I've had nightmare examples,'' said
Linda Fairstein, chief of the Manhattan sex crimes bureau.
</P>
<P>
   To offset these problems, sexual assault examiner programs rely
on cadres of nurses, midwives and doctors who are trained in
finding, handling and documenting forensic evidence. The examiners
then volunteer to be on call, reporting to emergency rooms to
perform the exams whenever a victim arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our examiners are only allowed to treat rape patients on their
days off,'' said Karen Reichert, the program's coordinator. ``The
idea is that when you are examining a rape patient, you have no
other duties and no other priorities, so all of your attention goes
to the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   The programs also provide victims with trained advocates who
stay with patients throughout each hospital visit and provide
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals and their representatives say that many emergency
departments without specially trained, on-call examiners can still
provide effective treatment, and that the overwhelming number of
patients receive competent exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are incredibly compassionate and they really want to
treat people in the right and appropriate ways,'' said Mary
Johnson, spokeswoman for Greater New York Hospital Association,
which represents 100 area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Boardwalk case, which was cited when state regulators
fined Coney Island Hospital $46,000 last month, illustrates that
when a hospital is unprepared, or protocols are not followed, the
quality of care can sink by a baffling degree.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health's investigation found that the hospital
made the woman wait three hours for the exam and then lost her
underwear and vaginal swabs. It also found the hospital bungled two
tests for sexually transmitted diseases, did not ensure she
received a full birth-control prescription and failed to provide
complete care from social workers.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said that if the evidence had not been lost it
might have been used to secure a rape conviction against Anthony
Jones, a serial sex offender who attacked the woman the day after
his release from prison. Instead, prosecutors dropped a rape count
in exchange for Jones' guilty plea to the comparatively minor
offense. He was sentenced to two to four years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The handling of the Boardwalk case stands in sharp contrast to
the treatment of the woman attacked in Central Park, who released
her medical records to The New York Times on the condition that her
name and the names of her attackers not be published.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the victim arrived at the hospital at 8:05 a.m.
and was immediately led to a private examining room, where a
physician performed an initial assessment within 10 minutes. A
social worker arrived within 25 minutes. The examiner, Dr. Lorraine
Giordano, was at the victim's side by 9 a.m., having been paged to
work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the emergency departments in almost all hospitals, the
rape treatment center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt is equipped with a
video camera with a magnifying lens called a colposcope, as well as
a Wood's lamp, which illuminates a victim with a purplish-blue
glow, allowing examiners to find drops or smudges of an attacker's
body fluids that can be swabbed and analyzed for DNA. These two
pieces of specialized equipment let examiners search victims for
evidence that can prove an attack occurred and, in some cases, they
can link a suspect to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the Central Park case, the assault was cut short when the
victim's dog bit one of the attackers, allowing her to escape. The
attackers left behind no DNA. But with the colposcope, Giordano was
able to find and photograph genital abrasions that were consistent
with sexual abuse, supporting the prosecutor's charge.
</P>
<P>
   One law enforcement authority said that after one of the
defendants was confronted with the contents of the medical file _
which included images detailing the injuries _ he pleaded guilty to
the maximum charge and accepted a 15-year prison sentence. Until
that point, he had denied any sexual abuse had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   How often sex crime victims receive this level of treatment is
not clear; prosecutors and hospitals say statistics have not been
compiled in New York. Dr. Linda Ledray, of Minneapolis, who has
studied the programs for the federal Department of Justice, said a
study in the Midwest found that prosecutors introduced 48 percent
more evidence in cases in which victims were treated in examiner
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The study's contention supports local prosecutors' anecdotes
about high quality evidence gathered from the examiners' work.
``The injuries these examiners identify can turn cases from a
he-said-she-said case into cases of rape,'' said Marjory Fisher,
chief of the special victims bureau in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, prosecutors complain only that the programs do not
handle enough of the caseload. In Brooklyn, for example, the only
forensic examiner program is at Long Island College Hospital in
Cobble Hill. It treated 66 of 823 rape cases in the borough last
year. ``The program is great,'' said Julie Schwartz, deputy chief
of the Brooklyn sex crimes bureau. ``We just can't get as many
cases into it as we would like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sexual Assault Reform Act requires the state to start
additional programs during 2001 and to develop standards for
supervising them. John Signor, a spokesman for the Department of
Health, said the department was working with hospitals to determine
which emergency rooms would become part of the proposed network.
</P>
<P>
   Many issues remain unresolved, including finding a formula for
underwriting the training and logistics required to develop new
programs, and addressing the concerns of ambulance services about
tying up crews on longer drives if they are required to bring all
sex crime victims to the designated centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really trying to figure out how to do this,'' said
Harriet Lessel, executive director of the New York City Alliance
Against Sexual Assault, which lobbied for the passage of the act
and is now assisting the Department of Health. ``All hospitals
cannot start or maintain these programs. They are very complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, hospital representatives and state health officials
say that some hospitals have expressed a willingness to take part.
State health officials and the governor would not discuss estimates
of the cost, but Pataki said he expected that the administration
would provide some of the money to expand the centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex predators are very often serial predators, and if we can
catch them and stop them after the first attack, we can prevent
them from having more victims,'' the governor said. ``You can't put
a price on that.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sue Greenberg folded herself into a chair in the cafe
at ABC Carpet and Home Warehouse Outlet in the Bronx and ordered
chicken francais and a glass of white wine. The executive assistant
to the store's president, Greenberg talked about how the cafe,
which opened a year ago, enhanced the store, which stands out in
the gritty neighborhood like a woman at a Promise Keepers powwow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couples look around the store, then come in here, have a cup
of coffee and decide if they want to spend $5,000 on a rug,''
Greenberg said of the cafe, which is owned and operated by her
sister Janet.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that a man from Myrtle Beach, S.C., who was
visiting Manhattan arrived at the store by taxi and shopped for two
hours while the cabdriver waited with the meter running. Cost of
the taxi: $170. Cost of a rug from Iran that the man bought:
$3,499.
</P>
<P>
   This is all to say that ABC's outpost in the Bronx _ the
flagship store is on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan _ is no poor
relation.
</P>
<P>
   Customer after customer notes that it is nothing like a typical
factory outlet. The goods are artfully displayed. There is no dust,
and salespeople are willing to serve. Like the Manhattan store, it
brings to mind your grandmother's attic. (That is, if your
grandmother is Brooke Astor.) Prices are 20 percent to 50 percent
lower than they are in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The 320,000-square-foot emporium in the Bronx opened 17 years
ago as a warehouse. Two years later it started selling carpets and
rugs to the public. Now, in addition to floor coverings, there are
antiques and reproductions galore, linens and bed and bath items,
fabrics and remnants and cookware. Price tags hang even from the
mosaic tables, Brazilian china closets and chandeliers in the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is for sale,'' said Paul Chapman, the president of
the Bronx store, ``except for the pillars that hold up the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the comings and goings at ABC appear to be
unaffected by the rhythms of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, most of them well heeled and from the suburbs of Long
Island, Connecticut, New Jersey and Westchester, said they had no
qualms about driving to the area, possibly because the store has
its own parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The store stands on an industrial stretch of Bronx River Avenue.
The road is lined with squat, rambling buildings that house
auto-body and auto-parts stores, auto repair shops and used-car
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Hector B., a mechanic at the Chase Tire Shop who would not give
his last name, said that customers occasionally left their cars to
be repaired and walked over to ABC to shop. But Frank Ramirez of
Parkchester, who had taken his car to the Pompy Repair Shop a few
doors away, said he could not fathom doing such a thing. ``I
usually wait for my car,'' he said. ``I don't leave my car with
anyone. This is the Bronx!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The blocks that surround the store and its neighbors are dotted
with housing projects, well-maintained apartment buildings and some
two-family houses. One day recently, a 5-year-old on a bicycle was
trying to summon the nerve to ride through the running water of an
open fire hydrant. Adolescent boys, all legs and arms, laughed
outside a corner bodega.
</P>
<P>
   The police say the neighborhood has a high crime rate that is
rising in some categories. For example, from Jan. 1 to June 30 this
year there were 35 rapes, compared with 27 for the same period last
year, and 401 burglaries, compared with 317 last year. The most
significant drop in crime was for car theft: There were 330 auto
thefts this year, down from 465 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, is a big fan of
the store, and he takes issue with the characterization of the
neighborhood given by the police. ``It has a high crime rate
relative to what? Greenwich, Connecticut?'' he said. ``The fact is
people are coming down to the store, and they are fine. It's a
terrific place.''
</P>
<P>
   The shoppers agree.
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre Engels, her 1-year-old son, Jack, and her mother,
Kathleen DeBlasio, all from Rye, visited the store on a recent
Sunday afternoon. ``I'm not fearful of the area at all,'' said
Engels, who sipped a cappuccino and shared a pasta salad with her
mother and Jack. ``It's right off the Bruckner Expressway.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBlasio agreed. ``There's a parking lot with a security
guard,'' she said. ``You don't have to worry about finding a
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Engels, who said the cafe was a nice addition because there were
few restaurants in the area, shopped for two hours, riffling
through rugs. She finally settled on a 9-foot-by-12-foot dhurrie
rug, which cost $299.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Shufflebotham of Brooklyn Heights said she visited the
outlet twice a week, often stopping in the cafe. ``It's good to
rest for a few minutes,'' she said, sipping a cappuccino. ``This is
just as nice as the Manhattan store. Actually it's a little bit
smaller, so it's more relaxing. The cafe is nice for husbands who
maybe don't like to shop as much.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a plus for the store's 150 employees, too, Greenberg said.
``There's nothing around here to eat unless you want McDonald's or
Kentucky Fried Chicken.''

PRESIDENT VETOES MARRIAGE-TAX CUT HE CALLS RECKLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs to add background on prior vote in Congress, update Bush
quote from campaign trail, expand on what bill proposes.)

<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Two days after Republicans wound up their
political convention with promises of tax relief, President Clinton
set up an election-year battle Saturday by vetoing as too costly a
tax break for married couples that is the cornerstone of the
Republican effort.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the Republicans in his weekly radio address of
advancing a series of ``tax giveaways'' that abandon the fiscal
discipline that has helped produce the longest economic expansion
in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't retreat from this opportunity of a lifetime to keep
our economy strong and move our country forward,'' said Clinton,
who signed the veto Saturday morning during a visit to Martha's
Vineyard for a weekend vacation and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm vetoing legislation that represents the first
installation of a fiscally reckless tax strategy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The veto, which Clinton had long threatened, sets the stage for
a renewed partisan fight over tax policy when Congress returns to
Washington after Labor Day. It is a fight that Republicans
especially view as defining the parties in both the presidential
and legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, the spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
said Hastert planned to try to override the president's veto in the
first vote. He said the veto would put pressure on House Democrats,
who are competing for control of the chamber. Still, overriding it
would require a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate;
neither passed the bill by such a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in the Senate was 60-34, with seven Democrats joining
all but one Republican, George V. Voinovich of Ohio, in support of
the bill. In the House, the vote was 271-156.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in his radio ad- dress that the door was still open
for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got another chance,'' he said. White House aides said
they expected efforts to override the veto to fail and negotiations
with the Re- publican leadership on a deal that would meet the
president's priorities to continue through the fall.
</P>
<P>
   As his campaign train stopped at the station in Durand, Mich.,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas called the veto yet another
``squandered oppor- tunity'' of the Clinton administration, which
he pointedly called the Clinton- Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends the wrong signal in America, and yet my opponent
showed us where he stands,'' said Bush, who earlier in the day had
urged Vice President Al Gore to in- tervene against the veto.
``Instead of standing on the side of families,'' Bush said, ``he
stands on the side of big government. Had I been presi- dent of the
United States, I would have signed that bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, in their own weekly radio address, said Clinton was
turning his back on married couples and perpetuating the view that
the federal budget surplus belonged to the government instead of
the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that special and sacred moment when the bride and groom say
`I do,' they also unwittingly say `I do' to higher taxes,'' said
Rep. J.D. Hayworth of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Al Gore ``still peddle the shopworn slogan that
correcting this injustice is just a break for the rich,'' Hayworth
said. ``But Americans know better. We understand that two spouses
earning $25,000 each are not wealthy by any stretch of the
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have advanced plans to remedy the so-called
marriage penalty, a quirk in the tax code that forces many
two-income couples to pay more in taxes than they would as singles.
But the Republican plan is the broader one, giving an election-year
tax break to nearly all married couples, even those who do not pay
a marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a sticky one for Democrats, who are seeking to walk
the line between fiscal discipline and providing what is a
politically popular benefit. The bill would remedy features of the
tax code that force 25 million married couples to pay higher in-
come taxes than single people, main- ly by enlarging the bottom 15
percent tax bracket and increasing the stand- ard tax deduction for
couples filing jointly. But it would also cut taxes for millions of
other couples who now enjoy a marriage ``bonus'' because one spouse
earns the bulk of the family income.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is urging a more modest tax-relief package intended to
benefit people of low and middle incomes. He has given himself some
wiggle room, however. Last month, Clinton said he would agree to
the Republican tax reductions for married couples if Congress
backed his proposal for a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
Republicans, who have their own, less sweeping prescription drug
initiative, refused.
</P>
<P>
   The two approaches over how to spend the record federal budget
surplus mirror the turf staked out by the two presidential
candidates. Gore has advocated a more modest tax-relief package
than his Republican opponent. Gore has called Bush's plan risky.
Bush dismisses Gore's stance as government as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took great pains at their convention in Philadelphia
to portray themselves as an inclusive party that reaches out to
people of all ethnic groups and income levels. But as Clinton
stumps on behalf of Gore, he knocks the Republicans for favoring
the wealthy and turning their backs on minorities. At a Friday
night fund-raiser for Hillary Rodham Clinton's New York Senate
campaign, he told a group of wealthy donors that Gore would not
leave anybody behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guys are going to give you a bigger tax cut than we
are,'' Clinton told 200 guests at the seaside gathering on
Nantucket. But he said the country as a whole would be better off
under Gore's stewardship, helping rich and poor alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll give you lower interest rates and a better stock
market,'' the president said. ``You'll make more anyway. But I
think we ought to all go along for the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton compared Republican plans to spend much of the projected
surplus to a foolhardy person spending sweepstakes money before the
check arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever get one of those letters from Ed McMahon and
Publishers Clearing House?'' Clinton asked in what has become one
of his biggest applause lines of late. ``Think about it: `You may
have won $10 million.' Now, if you went out the next day and spent
the $10 million, you should support their program. But otherwise,
you ought to stick with us.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The standoff over tax cuts is a repeat of past end-of-the-year
budget confrontations, which Clinton has shown himself quite adept
at maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the Republicans profess to be relishing the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``House Democrats will have an opportunity to get rid of the
marriage penalty by overriding the veto,'' Feehery said. ``It's
going to be a tough fight. We're going to expose their real
proclivity for higher taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Hayworth called Clinton the ``de facto campaign
manager'' for Gore and said the president's veto would hurt his
favored candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the best efforts of the punditocracy to say that tax
breaks don't matter,'' Hayworth said, ``for Mr. Gore's electoral
health, Clinton the campaign manager ought to reconsider.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats praised the president's action as fiscally
prudent. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., called Clinton ``wise to
veto tax cuts that are not directed at the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer added, ``He is right to be concerned that the huge cost of
the Republican tax cuts will bring us back to the days of
intractable deficits.''

WHITE HOUSE ACCUSES BUSH OF STEALING CLINTON'S ORATORY
</HEADLINE>
  By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ White House aides grumbled Saturday that Gov.
George W. Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican National
Convention had been presidential _ too presidential, actually, as
they accused Bush of stealing not only President Clinton's ideas,
but his words as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a tone of pique colored with a tinge of glee, the aides said
they had come up with nine examples from Bush's convention speech
and other recent speeches that Clinton had uttered first. The list
may be significant chiefly because it shows the Clinton camp's
discomfort at Bush's infiltration of the president's rhetorical
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters should be wary of someone who tries to portray others'
ideas as their own,'' said the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart added: ``There's a fine line between flattery and
plagiarism. If he hasn't crossed it, he's deep in no man's land.''
</P>
<P>
   The list included these examples:
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare does more than meet the needs of the elderly; it
reflects the values of our society,'' Bush told cheering delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is more than just a program; it reflects our
values,'' Clinton had said in 1997, remarks recalled this week by
White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use these good times for great goals,'' Bush said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us take our long look ahead and set great goals for our
nation,'' Clinton said during his State of the Union address in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The similar language may be coincidental, but it fits into a
deliberate strategy on the part of the Bush campaign to blur some
of the traditional differences between the parties. The convention
itself reflected that approach as Republicans highlighted a
racially diverse cast and studiously steered clear of divisive
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Clinton himself has made the appropriation of others'
ideas a hallmark of his administration, regularly seizing
Republican initiatives that he deems worthy. But that was forgotten
Saturday as some aides to Clinton groused about Bush's
``Clintonian'' text.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart pointed out that Bush, during a June 30 campaign stop,
had said, ``How a country handles its moment of prosperity and
opportunity is just as stern a test of our vision, our judgment,
and our character as how we handle adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton utters quite similar words on a regular basis. ``How a
country deals with its prosperity is at least as big a test of its
judgment and its character as how a country deals with adversity,''
Clinton said on June 24 during a speech in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bush campaign, Ray Sullivan, criticized as
``silly and beneath the dignity of the White House'' the claim of
political plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that taxpayer-funded White House aides are spending
so much time on Governor Bush's speech shows how desperate and
political the Clinton-Gore team really is,'' he said. ``The truth
is that both Bill Clinton and Al Gore have made careers of
reinventing themselves and claiming credit for other people's
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, the communications director for the Bush campaign,
said, ``Let me assure the president, with all due respect, he is
not our model for speechmaking, fund raising, or conduct in
office.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although there were a few dead ringers, some supposed
similarities discovered by White House aides did not appear all
that similar.
</P>
<P>
   In his convention speech, Bush recalled an artist friend from El
Paso, Tom Lea, who lives on a mountainside. ``It's the sunrise
side, not the sunset side,'' Bush said. ``It is the side to see the
day that is coming, not to see the day that has gone. Americans
live on the sunrise side of the mountain. The night is passing, and
we're ready for the day to come.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton spoke of mountains, as well. ``We should be
filled with awe and joy at what lies over the horizon,'' he said,
declaring that the country stands ``on the mountaintop of a new
millennium.''

COLUMN: THIS TIME, A CANDIDATE PROJECTS HIS OWN IMAGE OF
MODERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The meeting of the National Black Republican
Leadership Caucus should have ranked high on the A-list of
happenings at the new Party of Inclusion's convention. The featured
politician was Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey, a moderate from
the political center, where Gov. George W. Bush of Texas supposedly
wants to herd the Grand Old Elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the joint would be jammed, upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   But fewer than 30 black Republicans _ and not many others _
gathered in the basement auditorium of the African-American Museum
here on Tuesday to listen to Whitman. The telegenic tax cutter and
supporter of abortion rights tried hard to rally the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry she's not our vice-presidential candidate,'' said
Doris Oliveira, a black delegate from Tuskegee, Ala. ``But we would
have lost the South. They were going to walk out of the convention
if Bush had chosen someone who supports a woman's right to choose.
Our party's gotten so conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush lavishly embraced the rhetoric and style of
moderate Northeastern Republicans, few of those moderates made it
to center stage. At the convention four years ago the region's
Republican governors were leading men and women, helping in the
fruitless task of softening the harsh image of the party's nominee,
Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the candidate softened himself. It has been widely
noted that Bush kept the party's conservative elements out of the
glare of the convention, but he kept moderates largely out of sight
as well. His own language and tone did the job the moderates did
for Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was a co-chairwoman for Dole's convention, along with
none other than Bush. Gov. George Pataki of New York gave a speech
nominating Jack Kemp as vice president, and Gov. John G. Rowland of
Connecticut also spoke. Susan Molinari of Staten Island, N.Y., then
a rising Republican in the House of Representatives, gave the
keynote address. This year, only Pataki had a prominent role, but
it was to read a scripted tribute to the three living Republican
former presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The showcasing of moderate governors that year was a bit of a
head fake. Dole had little intention of shaping the party in their
image. Bush managed to hit moderate chords, even as he reassured
many conservatives that he was their man, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said to me today, `Governor Bush sounded like a George
Pataki last night with the moderate message he was pushing out,'''
Daniel Stewart, the mayor of Plattsburgh, N.Y., and a convention
delegate, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With the theme of ``Leave No Child Behind,'' and people of all
races turning the convention stage into Bush's Neighborhood, and
lines like ``We Shall Overcome'' in his speech, Bush left moderates
feeling as if he had unleashed the party's inner Connecticut
Yankee. It was easier for them to swallow conservative platform
planks and his stands against gun control and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, New York state's first openly gay mayor, disagrees with
Bush on abortion and is upset with antigay language in the party's
platform. But in Bush he hears the tenor of the Republican Party he
knew growing up in New England and living in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He was buoyed by the appearance of the party's first openly gay
convention speaker, even if he spoke about international trade.
Sure, some Texas delegates held a silent prayer protest while he
spoke, but other Texans applauded. And a New York delegate waving a
gay pride flag on the convention floor drew a thumbs up sign from
another delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just see it as progress,'' Stewart said, ``slow progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The pro-choice moderates expressed delight with the convention,
even if most were sidelined. Unlike the 1996 convention, ``there
aren't the hard edges,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, among the losers in the vice-presidential sweepstakes to
the far more conservative Dick Cheney, said Bush replaced ``the
angry face of our party'' symbolized by strident congressional
Republicans, with the ``positive, problem-solving wing of the
party'' dominated by Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
   By prompting a blend of compassion and conservatism, said
William Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, ``Bush
has balanced his own ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless of course it's another head fake.

GORE PLANS TOUR OF KEY STATES BEFORE CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES DAO with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the days leading to the Democratic National
Convention, Vice President Al Gore plans to tour several important
battleground states, from Georgia to Pennsylvania to Michigan,
hammering at the emerging themes of his campaign, and emphasizing
that the presidential election will be about substance versus flash
and new ideas against old, his aides said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president will focus on a different issue each day,
including welfare, Social Security, health care and the economy,
seeking to draw sharp differences in style and policy with his
Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tour will offer a striking contrast to the Bush
campaign's approach of image rather than issues, photo-ops rather
than substance,'' Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said. ``It
will contrast Al Gore's agenda for working families with the Bush
agenda to benefit the privileged few and special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Going the Distance Tour,'' as the Gore campaign has dubbed
it, will begin on Tuesday in Nashville, Tenn., when the vice
president will appear for the first time with his running mate. It
will end on Tuesday, Aug. 15, in Michigan, when Gore stands
shoulder-to-shoulder with President Clinton for a symbolic passing
of the party's leadership torch.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will arrive at the convention in Los Angeles the next day,
and will accept the party's nomination on the night of Thursday,
Aug. 17. Clinton is scheduled to address the convention on Monday
night and then leave the next day, effectively clearing the stage
for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has previewed many of the themes he plans to
emphasize during his tour in speeches over the past two days. The
tour is also intended to highlight Gore's biography, and in remarks
on Saturday before the National Association of Police Organizations
in Washington, he talked extensively about his time as an Army
reporter in Vietnam and as a police reporter for The Nashville
Tennessean newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot and gained a tremendous respect for what law
enforcement officers do every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the group that he would push for ``common sense'' laws
to keep firearms out of the hands of children and criminals. He
noted that in Congress, he had supported bills banning so-called
cop-killer bullets and plastic guns. In doing that, he drew an
implicit contrast with Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, who voted
against both bills while a congressman from Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time somebody shows me a deer in a Kevlar vest, I'll
reconsider that opinion,'' Gore said of the cop-killer bullet bill.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president touted the administration's efforts to help
police departments hire 100,000 new officers, and said he would
push for money to hire 50,000 more. He also said he would fight to
allow officers to carry their weapons while off-duty and for a
constitutional amendment guaranteeing victims the right to be heard
at criminal proceedings involving their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The police group, which endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticket in
1996, has not decided whom to support this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney kept up their attacks on the Democrats on
Saturday as they continued a three-day trip, mostly by train,
through pivotal states in the Midwest. They started Saturday
morning in Pontiac, Mich., and made stops for rallies along the way
to Kalamazoo. Large, enthusiastic crowds greeted them, chanting
``No more Gore! No more Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney vowed to grant them that wish and made frequent
reference, in Bush's words, to the ``squandered opportunity'' of
the last eight years of prosperity. Bush pointedly laid the blame
not just on Clinton but on ``the Clinton-Gore administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also tied Gore to the president's veto of a bill to
eliminate the so-called marriage penalty tax, saying at a rally in
Durand, Mich., that Gore ``stands on the side of big government,''
not on the side of working families.  &QL; 
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &QL;
<P>
   After announcing his vice presidential pick in Nashville on
Tuesday, Gore will travel on Wednesday with his running mate to
Carthage, Tenn., Gore's home town. They will hold a town hall
meeting at the Carthage elementary school with about 150 Tennessee
residents, many of whom will reminisce about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   From there, they will travel to the home state of the vice
presidential candidate. Speculation is narrowing to three
Democratic senators _ John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Edwards of
North Carolina and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore and his running mate will go to Atlanta for a
meeting with Southern governors and a discussion on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it is on to the Philadelphia suburbs for an event
with working women. On Saturday, they will travel to western
Pennsylvania and the girlhood home of the late Rachel Carson, the
environmental advocate and author of ``Silent Spring,'' a book that
Gore says strongly influenced him.
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday, Gore plans to discuss children's health care at
University Hospital in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Aug. 14, the day the Democratic convention opens,
Gore will be in Independence, Mo., home of Harry S. Truman, where
he will discuss issues involving senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, will
speak at the convention. Gore will meet Clinton on Tuesday at an
as-yet-undesignated spot in Michigan, a crucial swing state, where
they will showcase the nation's economic expansion and try to
highlight Gore's role in the prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Gore will fly to Los Angeles, where his running
mate will be nominated. Thursday night, Gore gives his acceptance
speech and flies out that night to the Midwest, where he will begin
a four-day boat trip across the Great Lakes and down the
Mississippi River.

MAN CLEARED BY DNA TESTS LED POLICE TO MURDER SUSPECT
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An investigator credited DNA science Saturday with
helping the police solve the murders of six women in Brooklyn. Not
only did it ultimately link a homeless man to the crimes, he said,
but it also cleared another homeless man in the case _ a man who
then befriended a detective and helped find the murder suspect.
</P>
<P>
   More than a week ago, the homeless man who was cleared by DNA
tests led detectives from the Brooklyn North Homicide Task Force to
focus on a 5-foot-3-inch panhandler, Vincent Johnson, 31, the
investigator said. And after DNA from Johnson came back with a
match Thursday night, the other man also helped the police track
the suspect down, spotting him Friday on a Brooklyn street wearing
a bright orange shirt. The man called the police and followed
Johnson until they arrived and arrested him, the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, detectives were still questioning Johnson,
and police officials said he would be charged in the strangulation
killings in the Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant sections of
Brooklyn. The police said Johnson, a drug abuser who sometimes
spent time at the Glenwood hotel on Broadway in Williamsburg,
stalked and strangled the six women, leaving their bound bodies
where he killed them.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the victims were found on rooftops in Williamsburg and
one in a vacant lot there. Two others were found in apartments in
Bedford-Stuyvesant and one in a utility room under the Williamsburg
Bridge, where Johnson once lived on a cot. Most of the women had
been arrested in the past on prostitution or drug charges, police
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The police came across the homeless man who helped them during
the course of the investigation when detectives took DNA samples
from 25 to 30 suspects, officials said. The samples failed to match
the DNA that the killer had left behind, said one investigator
familiar with the tests. Among those cleared was a man who the
police had been told hung out with prostitutes in the area and had
argued with one of them, an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   But after the test showed he was not the killer, he ended up
befriending a detective working on the case, Steven Feely, and told
him about another homeless man with whom he often smoked crack, a
man who talked frequently about tying up women and having sex with
them, the investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless man who aided the police said in an interview
Saturday that he had known Johnson for about three months and
frequently smoked crack with him. ``He'd point out girls all the
time and say, `I want that girl,''' said the homeless man, who is
42 and asked that his name not be used. ``He'd gesture with his
hands, and say how we could take them up the hill, tie the girls'
arms behind their backs, duct tape their mouths so they wouldn't
scream'' and have sex with them. ``He told me, `You could leave if
you don't want to do that.' And I thought to myself, `You are a
sick, sick maniac.'''
</P>
<P>
   The man, who is from Brooklyn and recently served a prison term
for a drug offense, said that he once talked with Johnson about how
there were a lot of police officers in an area near Marcy Avenue,
where two of the bodies were found. He said Johnson told him he had
had sex with one of the dead women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great, I've done a good job,'' he said of his help to
the police. The police said that when they brought Johnson in for
questioning last week, he refused to provide a DNA sample and said
he did not know any of the slain women, the investigator said. But
one of the detectives who brought him in remembered that he had
spat on the street outside. The detective warned him, as they went
into the station house, that he should not spit inside, and Johnson
explained that he had tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   But detectives were able to take a saliva sample from where
Johnson spat, and by Thursday night, the results showed that his
DNA matched DNA found on four of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Johnson used to hang around a methadone clinic
on the Lower East Side of Manhattan where two of the dead women had
sought treatment and a single room occupancy hotel on West 92nd
Street in Manhattan. A security guard there who would not give her
name said Johnson's mother lived at the hotel until she died seven
years ago from cancer. The guard said Johnson visited infrequently,
usually to get money.

<P>
   The most recent victim was Patricia Sullivan, 48, who was found
strangled with her sneaker laces on June 22 in a vacant lot on
Marcy Avenue. Four months earlier, in February, firefighters
responding to a rubbish fire in a large utility storage room
underneath the Williamsburg Bridge approach ramp found the
decomposed body of a woman. Detectives believe it was Laura G.
Nusser, 43.
</P>
<P>
   They later learned that Johnson had once lived in the room on a
cot and that Nusser was last seen with him in the area. She had
been strangled with an electrical cord. The police are unsure when
she was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The first victim was Vivian Caraballo, 26, whose body was found
on Aug. 26, 1999, in the elevator room on the roof of 237 S. Second
St. in Williamsburg. She had been strangled with a piece of cloth.
Less than a month later, on Sept. 16, the body of Joanna Feliciano,
35, was found on the roof of 171 S. Fourth St.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Tucker, 21, was found dead inside her apartment on Park
Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Sept. 25, 1999. She had been
strangled with the drawstring from her pants. Katrina Niles, 34,
was found on Oct. 4, 1999, in her Marcy Avenue apartment. She had
been strangled with electrical cord and her throat was slashed.

ARREST IN BROOKLYN SLAYINGS CALMS NEIGHBORHOODS
</HEADLINE>
  (With DNA-SERIAL-KILLER)  
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many residents of a small section of northern
Brooklyn expressed relief Saturday after word spread that the
police had arrested a suspect in six strangulation and slashing
murders that occurred over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy they got him; I feel more safe now,'' said Stephanie
Robles, 16, who was walking with her mother, Maria Martinez, 54, on
South Eighth Street.
</P>
<P>
   When a possible connection between the first four murders _ all
brutal strangulations _ was reported last October, it stirred fears
around the blocks where the crimes occurred in Williamsburg and in
nearby Bedford-Stuyvesant.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said that many black and Hispanic women in the two
neighborhoods stopped walking alone at night.
</P>
<P>
   Marrin Rodriguez, a volunteer at El Puente, a civic group in
Williamsburg, said neighborhood leaders tried to calm fears after
the slayings. ``It was not like he was going to kill 20 people
without being caught,'' Rodriguez said. ``But they were scared.
After all, he was beating women, choking them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the idea that the earlier victims had been
involved in risky lifestyles _ drugs or prostitution _ did not help
allay concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the neighborhoods said they did not fear the
presence of a serial killer because they did not fit the profile of
those four victims, who were believed to have been prostitutes. ``I
never felt threatened,'' because the first victims were all
prostitutes, said Jeannie Bartel, who has lived in the area for
decades. ``It was like it was something that happened to another
neighborhood. It was almost like TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison Rink, 33, who is white, echoed Bartel's lack of fear,
but gave another reason. ``In some strange way there's a sense of
relief because I knew there was a certain demographic of the women
being targeted,'' who were all black or Hispanic, she said. ``And
with that sense of relief, there is guilt for those feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   But to many others, the suspected serial killer had grown to
mythical proportions as a predator of the night from whom no one
was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Cruz, 22, who lives on South Third Street, between the
sites of two of the slayings, said she feared that the killer would
``just keep killing all the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety that began to grow last October increased in
February, and again in June, when the bodies of two more women were
found.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, neighbors _ to varying degrees _ said they were
relieved that the police had arrested Vincent Johnson, the man they
called the serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   The police say that the suspect's killing field stretched from
South Second Street in Williamsburg to Bedford-Stuyvesant's Marcy
Houses.
</P>
<P>
   The two neighborhoods where the killings occurred, separated
from each other by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, have been the
sites of considerable improvements in recent years, residents said,
but while parks and streets are cleaner, they remain havens for
drug dealing and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements added to the shock that accompanied the news of
the killings, residents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel safer now. It was like he could kill anybody he wanted
to kill,'' said Paula Lopez, who lives in a building on
Williamsburg's South Third Street, near where two of the victims
were found strangled on rooftops. But, she added, echoing many
others, ``I still don't feel completely safe. There's too much
drugs, too many drug dealers.''

REAL ESTATE BROKERS DOT-COMMED INTO COOPERATING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly three decades ago, real estate agents across
the United States began to make life easier for home buyers by
sharing listings. Buyers visited just one broker, who could tell
them about everything on the market, even properties represented by
other brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The holdout was Manhattan, where real estate was handled the
old-fashioned way: Brokers jealously guarded their listings to
avoid having to split their commissions with rival brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Manhattan saw the light. The borough's three largest
brokerage firms _ Corcoran Group, Douglas Elliman and Halstead
Property Co. _ announced they were creating a database that would
place their combined listings on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers, brokerage-firm executives and academics say the
companies are acknowledging sweeping changes in technology,
consumer demands and financial realities.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan brokers had contended that the complex nature of the
co-op market _ having to deal with board approvals and
sensibilities toward privacy _ justified keeping listings private.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manhattan was always considered special and different, and
just because it worked somewhere else did not mean it would work
here,'' Sharon Baum, a top broker at Corcoran, said while taking a
break from shuttling clients around in her Rolls-Royce with ``SOLD
1'' license plates. ``To know how to deal with the boards, to know
people on the boards and how to get your clients in _ it was a real
art.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baum and other brokers admitted that agents citywide were
less concerned about giving sellers the greatest possible exposure
than they were about representing both sellers and buyers and not
having to split commissions with other agents.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Durkin, the new chief operating officer at Corcoran, said
that ``technology has clearly upstaged the helmet-haired,
blue-blooded, Kelly-bag-swinging real estate agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Patton, the executive director of the Real Estate
Institute at New York University, said that these days buyers
expected to be able to go to one place for all listings. And, he
said, several Internet companies _ like mlx.com and nyrealty.com _
entered the market to provide such a compilation.
</P>
<P>
   Patton, a former president of the Real Estate Board of New York,
said the brokerage firms responded by considering buying the online
companies. They also began placing listings on their own Web sites.
But their sites did not get as many hits as the more comprehensive
sites, which companies like Goldman Sachs began to explore
investing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest fear was that some third-party with deep pockets
was going to come in, collect all of our listings and take our
business away,'' Durkin said.
</P>
<P>
   And smaller brokerage firms had long pushed for sharing so they
could offer clients the thousands of listings from the big
brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The ice began to melt. About nine months ago, senior executives
at Douglas Elliman and Corcoran began discussing the creation of a
multiple listing service like those in other places across the
nation. Halstead joined the discussions in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The joint database is seen as a way to share the cost of
upgrading technology and to virtually eliminate the unit at each
company that compiles other firms' listings, a system called
co-broking, where brokerage companies can choose to disclose
information. The firms also hope that the database will eventually
be the best place to go for home listings, perhaps allowing them to
cut newspaper classified ads.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the announcement last week, the firms said that they were
inviting each brokerage firm in New York to participate. The
brokers in the system will have to post almost all their listings
to the shared database within 24 hours or face fines (amounts have
not been determined). The only exception will be homes of sellers
who request that the listing not be made available to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   One real estate industry official involved in the negotiations
said it ``took a lot of courage,'' because the firms were upsetting
some of their own brokers and because the firms knew that a joint
multiple listing Web site would ``cannibalize'' their own dot-com
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The firms are near a deal with California's homeseekers.com,
which put the first multiple listing service online, to create the
New York City system. They hope to have it running by Jan. 1. So
far, 30 brokerage firms, including William B. May Co. and Bellmark
Realty, have signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the online listing services in the city are girding
for competition. One, nyrealty.com, is about to change its name to
cityrealty.com and launch a site that will allow transactions
online. Daniel Levy, president of nyrealty.com, said, ``Everyone is
realizing that the Internet is affecting the real estate business,
just like it is impacting every other form of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice Mason, a prominent independent broker in Manhattan, said
the shared listings could have a pleasant side effect: collegial
brokers. She recalled when ``people would meet a client across the
street _ they would be afraid to meet them in the doorway _ because
other brokers would see them and think they had a new listing.''

 &HT;    GORE'S STRATEGY: FIGHT THE ``RUSTED WAYS'' OF OLD GUARD
 &HT;    Eds: Updates beginning in graf 6 with plans for Gore, Clinton
travel in Midwest; other editing throughout.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that the Republican National Convention is
history, Vice President Al Gore needs to counter its effects in two
main ways: Deliver an acceptance speech at the Democratic
convention that counters the style and substance of George W.
Bush's, and choose a running mate who compares well with Dick
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the campaign will try to reinforce Gore's
contention that Bush, the son of former President Bush, and Cheney,
who served as defense secretary in the elder Bush's cabinet,
represent ``the old guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his first campaign appearance after the GOP convention
ended, vowed to fight ``the rusted ways of the old guard.'' He told
3,400 union firefighters in Chicago on Friday that he would battle
``the big interests'' and ``powerful forces lined up against''
working families.
</P>
<P>
   And campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said Gore's choice as
running mate will be someone who ``represents the future and not
the old guard like Bush's choice'' of Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to reversing Bush's lead in the polls _ 19 percent
in the bipartisan Voter.com-Battleground survey taken immediately
after the convention _ Gore must step out of the shadow of Bill
Clinton, who is spoken of by the Bush-Cheney campaign as if he were
Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The most symbolic act of separation will take place Aug. 15 in
Michigan, where the two will hold a joint rally one day after
Clinton addresses the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the handing of the baton,'' Lehane said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign announced the event as part of a seven-day ``Going
the Distance'' tour that will take Gore from his family home in
Carthage, Tenn., to Los Angeles to accept his party's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   From Carthage, Gore will travel to Atlanta, a state that has
become more competitive for him now that there is a Senate race
featuring a popular former Democratic governor, Zell Miller, to
fill the term of Paul Coverdell, who died last month of a cerebral
hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also will visit the fiercely contested Midwestern states of
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri and Michigan, highlighting favorite
issues _ welfare reform, targeted tax cuts, the environment, health
care and retirement security _ before arriving in Los Angeles on
Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategists see the Aug. 17 acceptance speech as the time
that the vice president becomes his own person, politically.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Friday he would offer ``a new vision for the future''
in his acceptance speech, which he says he is writing himself.
``I'll be talking about the new heights America can reach if we
stay on the right track and make the right choices today,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been in public office for nearly a quarter of a
century, Gore wants to use his acceptance speech in much the way
that Bush did his _ to introduce himself to American voters who are
just beginning to pay attention to the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American people know him particularly
well,'' said Gore media adviser Bob Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the firefighters that he wants the American people
``to know me for who I am.'' And in an interview with CNN, he said,
``I'm running on who I am. I'm running as my own man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to disclose his choice of a running mate
Tuesday in Nashville. The two will then campaign together nonstop
en route to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Gore family and his most senior advisers know whom the
vice president regards as the best candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation on the six people Gore listed last week as top
candidates has centered mostly on Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts,
who appeals to younger generations and is popular with the liberal
wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has tried to add drama to the vice presidential
selection process by floating the idea of a ``wild card''
possibility, someone who has not been mentioned often in press
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's mention of a ``wild card'' caused considerable attention
to fall on former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's lone
challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee and a former mayor of Philadelphia, spent much of the
week of the GOP convention in his home town promoting Bradley. Gore
strategists in Nashville spoke glowingly of the amicable meeting
Gore and Bradley had in Wisconsin last month, when Bradley
announced his endorsement of his former rival. And Bradley is a
native of Missouri, one of the key states the ticket will be
visiting on its way to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The other names listed by Gore include Sens. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, Evan Bayh of Indiana and John Edwards of North
Carolina. But Bayh and Edwards, both first-term senators, may be
seen as lacking the experience needed to step into the presidency
if necessary. Choosing Lieberman, whose state has a Republican
governor, would cost the Democrats one seat in a closely fought
battle for control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen of New Hampshire round out the list, but both have insisted
they do not want the job.

MURDER CASE TESTS LIMITS OF PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seventeen years ago an angry young doctor who had
been fighting with his wife went to consult Michael H. Stone, a
psychiatrist known for treating the violent rages and fragile
self-esteem of borderline personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   In the elegant office overlooking Central Park, Stone said, the
young man spoke of homicidal impulses toward his wife and
acknowledged past violence. Once he had tried to drown her cat.
Recently he had choked his wife to unconsciousness, an act that led
his parents to arrange the consultation.
</P>
<P>
   The patient's rage was hardly new to Stone, who has written
extensively about men who control and dominate their partners. Nor
was Stone's obligation unfamiliar: a duty to protect the man's wife
from harm by warning her, which he did. He also contacted his
patient's parents, with the patient's permission.
</P>
<P>
   But little else has been familiar since that consultation in
1983: The wife, Gail Katz-Bierenbaum, vanished in 1985 and has
never been found. Last year her husband, Robert Bierenbaum, the
angry young man who had consulted Stone and became a successful
plastic surgeon, was charged with her murder. He will stand trial
this fall in Manhattan Criminal Court. He has said he is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   In pretrial hearings last week, prosecutors and defense lawyers
deadlocked over a single issue that has yet to be resolved by Judge
Leslie Crocker Snyder: whether Stone should be allowed to testify
at the trial, which Bierenbaum's lawyers vigorously oppose. They
say the psychiatrist-patient relationship is sacrosanct and
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The slim and elegant psychiatrist is more than a potential star
witness for the prosecution in a murder trial without a body. He is
at the center of a murky and fiercely argued conflict: Does the
psychiatrist's duty to warn the potential victim of a violent
patient nullify that patient's right to confidentiality in a court
of law?
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who wants to testify, considered this question recently
as he sat before a wall of books and diplomas, wearing an
impeccable blue suit and crisp white shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now a murder trial, which is a different
circumstance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the door is opened to what happened in Stone's office that
day and in subsequent meetings, what impact might it have on this
closely watched case? Lawyers involved in the case would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said he knew from the first consultation and Bierenbaum's
haunting admissions that he was a dangerous man. ``People who kill
large mammals _ '' He stopped himself and then continued, ``We know
it's a risk factor.''
</P>
<P>
   His concerns had been so great, he said, that he had given
Bierenbaum conditions for treatment: Each session was to be taped
on two recorders; Bierenbaum was to give continuing permission for
Stone to contact his parents and his wife, whenever the risk of
violence seemed greatest; and Bierenbaum's parents were to buy a $2
million life insurance policy from Lloyd's of London to provide for
Stone's children in the event that his patient harmed him.
</P>
<P>
   This last condition _ startling and unorthodox to some experts _
was necessary to reduce his own fear and ensure a safe atmosphere
for therapy, Stone said recently, explaining, ``The treatment would
be very confrontative, and who knows what feelings would be
mobilized.'' Bierenbaum rejected those conditions, Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   But armed with the duty to warn, and explicit permission from
Bierenbaum to speak with his parents, Stone said, he did both. In
meeting with Katz-Bierenbaum, he even gave her a letter to sign,
which stated that she had been warned by Stone to separate from her
husband or risk death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do not heed this advice, I must accept the consequences,
including the possibility of personal injury, or death, at the
hands of my husband,'' the letter stated, ``and absolve Stone of
responsibility.'' Katz-Bierenbaum took the letter but never signed
it, and two years later she was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics of medicine and the rule of law are worlds apart. The
psychiatrist's obligation, traditionally, has been to safeguard a
patient's disclosures, no matter how dark or alarming. The court's
obligation is to seek truth, even though facts may be deeply
hidden.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 a California court ruled in a landmark decision that a
psychiatrist was liable for damages when he failed to warn a
patient's intended victim, Tatiana Tarasoff, of an imminent threat
to her life. The privilege between therapist and patient ends where
the ``public peril begins,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists protested the Tarasoff decision, as it became
known, arguing that it would erode confidentiality and make
patients less trusting. But it was adopted as law by many states
and became a national standard taught to every psychiatrist in
training.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been little precedent in New York, as elsewhere,
for the decisions that now face Snyder: whether the warning by
Stone, once given, equals public disclosure and can be shared with
a jury, or, as prosecutors also contend, whether the patient's
voluntary waiver of confidentiality to his parents opened the door
to allow his doctor to testify about what he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a hearing last Tuesday, Stone saw his old patient for the
first time in years. Bierenbaum hunched over the defense table in a
dull gray suit, expressionless. And the psychiatrist took the
stand, glancing only occasionally at the man he had briefly
assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, with Stone out of earshot, an assistant district
attorney, Daniel L. Bibb, argued that when Bierenbaum authorized a
full disclosure to his parents, that destroyed the privilege for
good, ``not just to the parents but to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierenbaum's lawyer, David L. Lewis, argued that the privilege
still existed, that it extended far beyond the course of treatment,
and that authorizing Stone to speak with his parents was not a
blanket authorization to tell the whole world.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are divided. Some agreed with prosecutors that Stone's
warning to his patient's parents and wife effectively let the cat
out of the bag; once the patient permits a disclosure, the
privilege of confidentiality cannot be recouped.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that a limited release of information does not
waive confidentiality. As Dr. Paul S. Appelbaum, professor and
chairman of the department of psychiatry at the University of
Massachusetts medical school, pointed out, when patients release
confidential medical information to an insurance company,
confidentiality remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   Stone remains hopeful that he will be allowed to speak. ``I feel
that the information that I hold has great bearing on the case,''
he said. ``I have my beliefs; that's apparent already from the
letter I wrote to Gail.''

STATEN ISLAND BECOMES CENTER OF THE WEST NILE VIRUS BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
     c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Concern about the outbreak of West Nile virus has now
shifted to Staten Island, where the first human case of the disease
in the country this year has been reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Nile problem is primarily a Staten Island problem,''
the borough president, Guy Molinari, said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 31 infected birds found in New York City, 26 were on
Staten Island, said John Gadd, a New York City Health Department
spokesman. Of three pools found to have infected mosquitoes, one
was in Central Park, and two were in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of May, Staten Island University Hospital has
treated 13 patients with symptoms that could have come from the
virus, but only one case, an elderly man's, was confirmed, said
Brian Morris, a hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Staten Island man, 78, was the first person in the United
States to contract the virus this season. The man, whose name was
not released, has returned home from the hospital. At his sickest,
the man had a temperature of 104.7, a stiff neck and mental
confusion, Morris said. City and state officials began spraying
areas in and around the city with the pesticide malathion last
month when two dead crows on Staten Island were found to be
infected with the virus. ``Right now we are the epicenter of the
virus, and we expect it to accelerate in the next three to four
weeks. It is peak season now,'' Molinari said. ``In the second half
of the summer, we can expect incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem, he said, is that Staten Island has many wetlands,
creeks and tributaries, which are not easily reached by spraying
carried out from the road.
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus, which is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes,
can cause flu-like symptoms and, at its most dangerous stages,
encephalitis, a potentially fatal brain inflammation. It has spread
into New York state and Massachusetts in birds that have been
bitten by infected mosquitoes. Children, people with weakened
immune systems and the elderly are most susceptible to the disease,
though not everyone in those categories who is bitten by an
infected mosquito will develop symptoms, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.

 CHERITON, Va.: much money. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His journey to the United States was grueling. After Herman was
smuggled into Arizona, the smugglers stuffed him, his brother and
30 others into the back of a truck that carried them to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 48 hours, and we didn't have anything to eat,'' said
Herman, who owes the smugglers $1,850. ``It was very hot. There was
no water. Some people fainted. We were very weak when we got
here.''
</P>
<P>
   For a recent 60-hour week, he received a $240 check. That
translates to $4 an hour, but his managers said he received the
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security and other deductions were taken out, his boss
said, but many farm workers wonder if their bosses pocket the
deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, poverty drives the two largest groups of child farm
workers _ those like Herman who come from other countries and those
like Jose Arispe, born in Texas but compelled to work because his
father makes less than $10,000 a year doing farm work. On average,
the adult farm worker earns less than $7,500 a year, partly because
many find work for only eight months a year. Their incomes are cut
back further because federal laws do not require that farm workers
receive time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Farm workers' advocates say growers are happy to hire these
youngsters. But many farmers say they prefer not to hire young
workers but are forced to because of a labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmers' view is that workers under age 18 lack maturity
and are not particularly productive workers, and they do things
that are foolish and dangerous, so you prefer not to have them
around the farm,'' said Bryan Little of the American Farm Bureau
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in 1938, it set
more lenient standards for children doing farm work than
nonagricultural work, largely because farm work was seen as
wholesome and family-oriented. Agriculture has changed immensely
since then with the advent of huge corporate farms and of a network
of more than a million seasonal and migrant workers, many of them
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Children's advocacy groups say the laws need to be changed.
``Farm-working juveniles have second-class status _ they enjoy
fewer rights than their nonfarm-working peers, and they are
exploited while the government looks the other way,'' the Human
Rights Watch report said.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, of the Labor Department, said the government was
increasing its investigations into improper use of child farm
workers. Last year it cited 46 farms for violations involving 102
minors. There are 1.9 million farms in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The government is spending more for day care centers for young
migrant children, and for migrant teen-agers, it is financing
special programs, including summer schools, to keep them from
dropping out. But all this may not be enough to keep Jose Arispe in
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not doing well in school,'' said Jose's mother,
Elizabeth. ``He wants to quit school. But I don't think that's a
good idea. But he said he needs to work and contribute money to the
family.''

quality of evidence with which to prosecute some of society's most

   It could be every bit as dramatic as the revolution that hit the
world's telecommunications industry in the 1980s. And it is
occurring in an unexpected business; but one in which can be seen
the same forces of innovation, competition and choice that
transformed yesterday's sleepy telephone monopolies into today's
high-tech predators. That business is electricity generation.
Stifle your yawns _ power is every bit as big a business as
telecoms. Indeed, America's $220 billion electricity market is
larger than those for cellular and long-distance telephony
combined. &QL;

   Recent events have not been encouraging for Europe's crop of
once optimistic Internet start-ups. They include such spectacular
collapses as that of boo.com, a spendthrift electronic sports-goods
retailer that met impressive standards of corporate extravagance
while blithely losing a bundle. This week clickmango, an online
health-care business, became the latest of a string of such dot.com
casualties. Over the next few months hundreds of European
fledglings are likely to suffer the same fate as boo.com and
clickmango. Hundreds more will merge into larger entities with a
better chance of survival. The process of consolidation will have
profound effects, some beneficial but some harmful, on all European
companies, not just online ones. &QL;

ago. Twenty-five Ghanaian soldiers stake out a patch of soil
belonging to Lebanon, but repeatedly encroached upon by the Israeli
army. Having helped define the border, they must now prevent

   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Democratic Party's campaign planners rarely
lose sleep over Minnesota. The state's voters have chosen Democrats
in all but three presidential elections since 1948, and in all the
six most recent ones. But this land of fishermen and Scandinavian
crypto-socialists is no longer a bastion of the Democratic
Farmer-Labor Party (as the Minnesota branch still insists on
calling itself). Recent polls put Al Gore and George W. Bush
neck-and-neck there. If Gore loses Minnesota, he loses the
election. ``Minnesota is no longer simply a kind of knee-jerk
liberal state,'' argues Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of a
Washington newsletter. ``It's just a bizarre state.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ There was a spectre haunting the Republican National
Convention last week: that of the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon
Protestant) establishment. The entire point of the convention
seemed to be to prove that Republicans are just like the rest of
America: multicolored, serially disadvantaged and not a jot
WASPish. Was this all a charade? Had the real Republican convention
been held months ago in some exclusive club? Was compassionate
conservatism conceived in a fit of giggles over port and cigars? Or
is the WASP charge just another bogeyman dreamed up by the people
who brought you the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy? &QL;

   MOSCOW _ Remember Russia this time last year, and pinch
yourself. Vladimir Putin was an inconspicuous bureaucrat. The
Kremlin, under the ailing President Boris Yeltsin, seemed set for a
humiliating defeat in the forthcoming parliamentary and
presidential elections. The government was a corrupt shambles.
Since then, two big things have happened. The first is that the
Kremlin bounced back. It found a candidate for the presidency in
Putin. Second, power has shifted inside the Kremlin. &QL;

100th birthday. The occasion has already prompted a national
service at St. Paul's Cathedral and a huge pageant in the center of
London. But her birthday forms part of a much larger national and
international trend _ the remarkable rise in the number of
centenarians. &QL;

to Fran Bernstein, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. The past 18
months have been rather depressing for America's funeral industry.
The top three U.S.-quoted companies, which control roughly a fifth
of the country's $30 billion market, have seen their share prices
collapse since the start of 1999. And a fourth is now in the final
throes of bankruptcy. Too much debt and too few deaths are largely
to blame. &QL;

BUSH AND CHENEY TRAVEL BY TRAIN TO RALLY SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They sounded a cry for lower tax codes in Pontiac,
Mich., and rallied people in Durand with the promise that President
Clinton was on the way out. A crowd of several thousand people in
East Lansing got a pledge that the military would be strengthened.
A smattering of people in Holly and Fenton got only waves and
smiles as the train rattled by.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight day on the rails for Gov. George W.
Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney _ the second straight day of
trying to turn the momentum from a convention into a mandate from
Americans. And it took the Republican duo across much of the
breadth of southern Michigan, where they spent about seven
stop-and-go hours before abandoning the ground for the sky and
flying here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish you could travel with us and see the great spirit of
America,'' Bush told the people at the East Lansing rally. ``It
lies in the heartlands of our country. It lies along the tracks
that we've been on with people from all walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pledge is that if you give us the opportunity to lead this
nation, not only will we work on a positive agenda for what is
right for our country,'' Bush added. ``Our pledge is that if you
give us your trust, we will honor it.''
</P>
<P>
   As with much of the oratory that they used at the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia, Bush and Cheney were offering
indictments, both implicit and explicit, of President Clinton, and
they were attaching Vice President Gore to whatever disappointments
Americans had felt about Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The large, enthusiastic crowds mostly gobbled it up. They toted
signs with messages like ``I'd rather be Bushed than Gored.'' They
chanted: ``No more Gore! No more Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   At several stops, a few people protesting Bush's support for
capital punishment or opposition to abortion sought to thrust their
own voices and placards into the picture, but they were well
outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's train trip through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and
Illinois, which he was scheduled to visit on Sunday, represented a
bid to win swing states that had voted Democratic in the last two
presidential elections, and Bush made a point at several stops
Saturday to mention that his campaign was open to independents and
Democrats, and to beckon them aboard.
</P>
<P>
   He also articulated some bedrock conservative philosophies and
proposals, summoning particular passion for the subject of lowering
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, at the Durand stop, said the train trip showed that he
and Bush were going to ``carry this fight from border to border and
coast to coast, because it's extraordinarily important that we have
a change in Washington.''

   It could be every bit as dramatic as the revolution that hit the
world's telecommunications industry in the 1980s. And it is
occurring in an unexpected business; but one in which can be seen
the same forces of innovation, competition and choice that
transformed yesterday's sleepy telephone monopolies into today's
high-tech predators. That business is electricity generation.
Stifle your yawns _ power is every bit as big a business as
telecoms. Indeed, America's $220 billion electricity market is
larger than those for cellular and long-distance telephony
combined. &QL;

   Recent events have not been encouraging for Europe's crop of
once optimistic Internet start-ups. They include such spectacular
collapses as that of boo.com, a spendthrift electronic sports-goods
retailer that met impressive standards of corporate extravagance
while blithely losing a bundle. This week clickmango, an online
health-care business, became the latest of a string of such dot.com
casualties. Over the next few months hundreds of European
fledglings are likely to suffer the same fate as boo.com and
clickmango. Hundreds more will merge into larger entities with a
better chance of survival. The process of consolidation will have
profound effects, some beneficial but some harmful, on all European
companies, not just online ones. &QL;

belonging to Lebanon, but repeatedly encroached upon by the Israeli

   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Democratic Party's campaign planners rarely
lose sleep over Minnesota. The state's voters have chosen Democrats
in all but three presidential elections since 1948, and in all the
six most recent ones. But this land of fishermen and Scandinavian
crypto-socialists is no longer a bastion of the Democratic
Farmer-Labor Party (as the Minnesota branch still insists on
calling itself). Recent polls put Al Gore and George W. Bush
neck-and-neck there. If Gore loses Minnesota, he loses the
election. ``Minnesota is no longer simply a kind of knee-jerk
liberal state,'' argues Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of a
Washington newsletter. ``It's just a bizarre state.'' &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ There was a spectre haunting the Republican National
Convention last week: that of the WASP (White Anglo-Saxon
Protestant) establishment. The entire point of the convention
seemed to be to prove that Republicans are just like the rest of
America: multicolored, serially disadvantaged and not a jot
WASPish. Was this all a charade? Had the real Republican convention
been held months ago in some exclusive club? Was compassionate
conservatism conceived in a fit of giggles over port and cigars? Or
is the WASP charge just another bogeyman dreamed up by the people
who brought you the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy? &QL;

Kremlin, under the ailing President Boris Yeltsin, seemed set for a
humiliating defeat in the forthcoming parliamentary and

Since then, two big things have happened. The first is that the
Kremlin bounced back. It found a candidate for the presidency in
Putin. Second, power has shifted inside the Kremlin. &QL;

   GOP CONVENTION FOLLOW-UP
</P>
<P>
   CVN-REAL-GOP _ PHILADELPHIA _ George Bush's convention took
pains to portray the Republican Party as one in transition from the
party of narrow interests to the party of inclusion. But even as
the party's only openly gay congressional representative was
addressing Bush's convention, Bush's platform committee was voting
not to soften anti-gay language in the platform. Amid other such
discrepancies, the question remains: which is the real George W.
Bush, which is the real GOP. (Sherman, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GORE _ WASHINGTON _ Now that the Republican National
Convention is history, Vice President Al Gore needs to counter its
effects in two main ways: deliver an acceptance speech in Los
Angeles that counters the style and substance of George W. Bush's,
and choose a running mate who compares well with Dick Cheney.

_ DAYTON, Ohio _ Sen. John McCain may have caused Gov. George W.
Bush plenty of headaches in the bitterly contested Republican
presidential primary, but, if Ohio is any indication, he may have
done Bush and all Republican candidates a big favor. The sparks
flying off McCain's Straight Talk Express generated a wave of
interest among voters, particularly Republican voters, that hasn't
been seen in a primary in many years. According to newly released
statewide voter registration figures compiled by the Ohio secretary
of state's office, that wave almost doubled the ranks of the
state's registered Republicans. Democratic registration also grew,
but the registered Republican increase more than doubled the
Democratic gain. (McCall, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

from everyday life, relax and spend quality time with family and
friends. Dacha culture has existed since Czarist times, and it has
spawned a rich cultural tradition. In Soviet times, these plots
helped people survive amid shortages of food, and the land remained
the only private property allowed. My Russian friends Slava and
Lucy, like millions of Russians, treat their dacha as their castle.
They spent five years building their home and now slave every

   COXNET FOCUS 0805: COLOMBIA GRIPPED IN FEAR _ Bands of heavily
armed guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary groups roam the
countryside, warring against each other over ideology and control
of the illegal drug trade. Rural peasants, caught in the middle,
have fled by the thousands, their homes destroyed, businesses
ruined, their children lured or taken at gunpoint to join the
groups of fighters. Colombia is a nation living in fear and
uncertainty. Few are untouched by the country's troubles.

 &HT;    Over night success story was too good to be true
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Almost overnight, sports agent William
``Tank'' Black leaped from having one major client to more than 35.
Suddenly the once-broke former assistant football coach from South
Carolina was buying a brick mansion, leasing a private jet at
$3,000 per hour and giving expensive gifts to an exotic dancer who
was not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, NFL running back Fred Taylor of Belle Glade now
sadly concludes, ``Tank did his crooked thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What players such as Taylor saw too late was that Black was
taking his clients for a ride _ a ride into what federal
investigators say is the biggest agent fraud scandal they've seen
in the history of professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Black, 43, is expected to appear in Detroit this week to answer
federal charges he laundered $1.1 million for a drug ring. He is in
the custody of federal marshals at an undisclosed location, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit said. If
convicted, he could receive up to life in prison and a $4 million
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Black's is a sprawling case that fills stacks of files in
federal courthouses from Gainesville to Tampa to central Michigan.
He and more than half a dozen associates have been indicted on
federal criminal and civil charges they conspired to defraud former
clients _ including Taylor and the NBA's Vince Carter _ by
mishandling $15 million of their money since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One way Black lured clients was to give them money improperly
while they were still in college, many of them at the University of
Florida, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   There was a cautionary tale written on those dollars, if the
players had been able to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy cheats to get you, he will cheat you when he gets
you,'' said Trace Armstrong, the Miami Dolphins' defensive end and
former Gator who is president of the NFL Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   When players hired Black as an agent to negotiate their
professional contracts, he did more than take an agent's cut of 3
or 4 percent. He persuaded clients to let him pay their bills and
invest their millions for returns he claimed were higher than the
stock market, 20 percent or better. Never mind that the companies
included an unproven start-up, in which he was a director, that
sold black-history board games; a company that made car-title
loans; and a mysterious offshore firm in the Cayman Islands. Most
of the players had little experience handling money. Some, like
Tampa Bay receiver and UF receiver Jacquez Green, had never had a
checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Black's lawyers say he was a victim himself, of shady investment
advisers, and that he did not knowingly do business with drug
dealers. He even refunded the players' money in some cases _ at
least the principal investment, if not the profits he promised
them.
</P>
<P>
   But at least $10 million is still missing, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still adding up what Black's clients lost, but
Green is reportedly out of $500,000; Detroit Lions receiver Germane
Crowell lost a similar amount; Carter some $300,000. Taylor appears
to be the biggest vbelieve they would receive.
</P>
<P>
   HINDSIGHT IS 20/20
</P>
<P>
   Taylor wanted to believe Black. Until last fall, the
Jacksonville Jaguars running back from the University of Florida
stood by his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, he realized he could not get access to his own $3.6
million signing bonus and the head-spinning investment returns it
was supposed to be making. All he heard were excuses.
</P>
<P>
   With former teammate Ike Hilliard, now with the New York Giants,
Taylor has hired a Miami attorney to try to get his money back in a
civil lawsuit against Black. He has hired Drew Rosenhaus as his new
agent, and can only advise other young players to be more careful
than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful and do a couple of background checks,'' Taylor
said, standing outside the cafeteria of a hotel in Jacksonville,
where the Jaguars have begun training camp. ``Start out with a
group of three to five (prospective agents). Dissect them one by
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Black sold himself as a former college player and coach who knew
what black athletes have to go through. He had been a short and
stocky receiver at Carson-Newman and assistant coach at the
University of South Carolina. In 1990, he formed his own management
company, Professional Marketing Inc., in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   For years, his only prominent client was a South Carolina
receiver, Sterling Sharpe, who played for the Green Bay Packers.
But in 1996, Black began a push to become a super-agent.
</P>
<P>
   Within three years, his rise was eye-popping: He represented an
unprecedented five first-round picks in the 1999 NFL draft and more
than 35 clients overall. The names included New England Patriots
running back Terry Allen and Carolina Panthers receiver Rae
Carruth, who was later charged with arranging the murder of his
wife. He even branched into the NBA, luring emerging Toronto
superstar Carter, who grew up in Daytona Beach and whose mother
thought Black seemed sincerely interested in her son.
</P>
<P>
   PAYMENTS TO PLAYERS
</P>
<P>
   To build his business, Black handed out money to prospective
clients through a network of ``runners,'' or field assistants,
prosecutors say. He allegedly tried, unsuccessfully, to pay an
assistant coach at Louisiana State University to influence a
defensive tackle prospect there. But the most lucrative pickings
were at talent-laden UF in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   While still at the University of Florida, Taylor received an
unspecified amount of cash from, or allowed expenses to be paid by,
a runner named Alfred Twitty who was employed by Black, according
to an indictment filed by the U.S. Attorney's office in
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal began to come to light late in the 1998 season when
campus police received a tip that a Gator player, Tim Beauchamp,
was getting money from another agent. Beauchamp said he only wanted
what teammate Johnny Rutledge, was getting from Tank Black _ $500
to $600 per month. Another linebacker, Jevon Kearse, reportedly
drove a $133,000 Mercedes Black had bought him before the team's
1999 Orange Bowl game, though Kearse actually accepted title to the
car days after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Twitty, charged in Gainesville as part of the fraud conspiracy,
said he was paid $2,500 per month but now cannot afford his own
lawyer. According to an application he filed requesting a federal
public defender, he is now unemployed and, though single, has a
baby on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge and Kearse dropped Black as their agent when news of
the gifts became public. Florida coach Steve Spurrier said the
players were no longer welcome on campus, though neither the
athletes nor the school were otherwise punished. There was no
evidence the university had knowledge of the payments,
investigators concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Other former Florida players were not so lucky _ Taylor,
receiver Hilliard and receiver Reidel Anthony, found themselves and
their money caught up in the unfolding case. Hilliard also took
money in college before signing with Black, federal investigators
allege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, those players got tied up with that guy,''
Spurrier said. ``They didn't know what kind of person he was. I
didn't know anything about him. And a year or two later, all the
money is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the NFLPA president, said he has spoken to Florida
players this summer to remind them of the dangers that agents pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should affect the players just from reading about it,''
Spurrier said. ``They know the rules. You can't take money. Not
from agents, not from boosters. They know the rules, what it takes
to stay eligible.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said the Black case is
disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares you to death,'' said Bowden. ``You can talk to the
kids about this, but they're the ones who have to make the
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   POWER OF PERSUASION
</P>
<P>
   For Anthony, a 1998 first-round pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers
from UF and the son of South Bay Mayor Clarence Anthony, agent
worries only added to a miserable 1999 season in which he was hurt
for most of the year and dropped several passes. Trying to put it
behind him heading into the 2000 season has been a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard,'' Anthony said. ``You try to put it in the
back of your mind, but it still lingers.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of anxiety, Anthony and his father were able to
retrieve nearly $900,000 from Black in August 1999, but never saw
the profits the money was supposed to generate, according to
transcripts from a fraud caled in Tampa by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know who to trust and how things are going to
happen,'' Anthony said, between workouts recently at Bucs training
camp. ``You have a lot of money and people are after it. They'll
grab it. I got caught in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony was not mentioned among the payments to still-eligible
UF players that federal investigators uncovered, and his father
tried to keep an eye on his financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Black could be persuasive when he urged clients to let him
invest their money, Clarence Anthony told SEC investigators.
</P>
<P>
   A typical sales pitch from Black went like this, Clarence
Anthony said: ``I have this product, BAOA, which is an
African-American board game that is going to blow up and going to
be a big company, and you guys should look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Black sat on the board of BAOA Inc., a San Diego company that
sold a game called Black Americans of Achievement. The game was
endorsed by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said later he was unaware
of Black's financial dealings but liked what he knew about the
agent.
</P>
<P>
   The company agreed to give the players free BAOA stock in
exchange for promotional services, but Black sold them the shares
for 50 cents to $1 apiece _ when the stock was trading from 4 cents
to 28 cents per share _ and charged them commissions as well, the
SEC says.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Black's then-clients, including NFL running back Natrone
Means, became suspicious, and Black later refunded the principal
investment to more than a dozen players, though the SEC concluded
he cost the players $240,000 in foregone interest.
</P>
<P>
   Black steered clients into new investments, including a company
called Cash 4 Titles. The company made loans in exchange for car
titles and promised a stratospheric return of 36 percent annually.
Black told players they would receive a 20 percent return but
arranged to keep the other 16 percent for himself, the SEC alleges
_ plus a $30,000 annual commission.
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing amount of the clients' money was heading to
offshore companies in the Cayman Islands. In the end, SEC officials
said it amounted to a classic pyramid scheme, in which money from
new investors was used to pay old investors. Taylor and Hilliard's
lawsuit names Cash 4 Titles directors Michael Gause and Richard
Homa among other defendants, though they were not indicted in the
federal criminal or civil cases against Black. They could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   THE BOTTOM LINE
</P>
<P>
   Black claimed he was duped, too.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Anthony told SEC investigators he asked Black about it:
``He said, 'You know, I put money in this thing, too. I was tricked
like everybody else. You know, Clarence, I thought these guys were
legitimate I'm just as _ been bilked out of money just like you
guys.' And my response was, 'But these guys trusted you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He went on to say, 'Yes, I know. But, you know, the fact of
the matter is it was _ the money is gone.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Then came the stunning news of drug charges, which arose from a
completely separate investigation in Detroit. Federal investigators
there were looking into a drug ring that brought cocaine into the
United States _ and allegedly laundered $1.1 million of its cash
proceeds through a South Carolina corporation set up by Black and
attorney James A. Franklin. One of Black's employees, Linda Wilson,
allegedly knew members of the ring, though Black's attorney says he
was unaware what business they were really in.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment unsealed in July charged Black and Wilson helped
fugitive Dean Parker, a member of the ring, obtain false
identification to flee the country, on a plane from Columbia, S.C.,
to Jamaica. For a 25 percent fee, fictitious companies set up by
Black, Wilson and Franklin in 1998 provided the drug ring with
``the appearance of legitimate sources of income,'' said U.S.
Attorney Saul Green in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fake companies was called Taylor Development Ltd. in
the Cayman Islands _ from Fred Taylor's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of lessons to be learned,'' Armstrong said.
``One of them is that good agents don't need to cheat. A lot of
players are learning the hard way that it will catch up to them
sooner or later.''

<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ The average Florida legislator is now _ for the
first time _ a millionaire, and last year earned $118,000 in
outside income.
</P>
<P>
   The average senator was worth $1.9 million, and the average
House member $781,000 at the end of last year, according to an
analysis by The Palm Beach Post of annual financial disclosure
statements. The figures represent a 10 percent increase for the
average House member and a 12 percent gain for the typical senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty shocking,'' said Rep. Bob Henriquez, D-Tampa,
and who, with a $22,332 net worth, is one of the legislature's
poorest members. ``As poor as I am, a million dollars is a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the lawmakers are millionaires; only 43. But enough of
those have such great wealth as to pull up the average of all 160
members into the seven-figure range for the first time, with an
average net worth of $1,045,445. Last year's average net worth was
$952,502.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also made considerable outside incomes last year,
according to the disclosure statements: An average $105,501 in the
House and $152,965 in the Senate, on top of the $27,900 annual
legislative salary.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the per capita income in Florida last year was
about $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy lawmakers, however, said the mere fact of their fortunes
doesn't detract from their ability to empathize with considerably
poorer constituents. ``I've been a janitor, a waiter,'' said Rep.
Allan Bense, R-Lynn Haven, who has $7.3 million in assets and last
year earned $2.6 million through his golf course and construction
businesses. ``I've worked my way through high school, worked my way
through college, through graduate school . . . I've been on the
bottom. I understand what it's like on the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the legislature's overall wealth, however, are sharp
distinctions along gender and racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   The average male legislator is worth $1.14 million, the average
female, $766,000. The typical white lawmaker has a net worth of
$1.27 million; the average black, $230,000, and the average
Cuban-American lawmaker, $191,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-1 ratio between white and minority legislators' financial
conditions reflects but greatly exaggerates the differences in
society as a whole, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a tendency to elect people they're most
comfortable with,'' said Sen. Daryl Jones, D-Miami and chairman of
the black caucus. ``Republicans tend to be wealthier people, and
they tend to elect wealthier people. And Democrats tend to elect
people they're most comfortable with, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida lawmakers, like all other elected officials in the
state, are required to disclose their assets, liabilities and
incomes each July 1, although a number of legislators this year
missed that deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are required to disclose all sources of income above
$1,000 or, in the alternative, file a copy of their tax return,
including all forms that disclose income sources, such as the W2.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to do so, though, brings no penalty, said Ethics
Commission spokeswoman Helen Jones, unless someone files a sworn
ethics complaint and the commission subsequently finds the lawmaker
guilty of the infraction and levies a fine.

<P>
   It could be every bit as dramatic as the revolution that hit the
world's telecommunications industry in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And it is occurring in an unexpected business; but one in which
can be seen the same forces of innovation, competition and choice
that transformed yesterday's sleepy telephone monopolies into
today's high-tech predators.
</P>
<P>
   That business is electricity generation.
</P>
<P>
   Stifle your yawns. Power is every bit as big a business as
telecoms. America's $220 billion electricity market is larger than
those for cellular and long-distance telephony combined.
</P>
<P>
   And it is seeing a lot of consolidation: only this week two huge
utilities, FPL of Florida and Entergy of Louisiana, announced a $27
billion merger to form America's biggest electricity company.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy with telecoms goes further. All over the world,
generators have invested huge sums in power stations and
transmission grids, which many incumbents argue make them
``natural'' monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just as the phone companies that used to make the same
argument have found, their legacy may serve only to turn them into
easy targets. Although power grids, like all networks, may be
natural monopolies, the generation of what they carry is clearly
not.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of competition in telecoms led to furious investment
and innovation, helping to give rise to the digital economy.
Centralized control gave way to such anarchic technologies as the
mobile phone and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A similar shift is starting in electricity, thanks to market
liberalization, environmentalism and technological advance. The
entrenched monopolies that run large, dirty power plants are facing
new competition from rivals with smaller and cleaner technologies
at their command.
</P>
<P>
   The result will be lower prices for consumers, and more capacity
to satisfy the world's ever-growing demand for electricity _ some
of it, ironically, caused by the spread of the Internet. And it
could soon mean power produced, quite literally, in your own
backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to this revolution lies in ``micropower,'' the
generation of electricity by small-scale fuel cells and gas
turbines.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is not exactly new: most of it is, indeed, over a
century old. But, thanks in good part to a huge inflow of venture
capital into the business, it has in the past few years moved far
closer to commercial reality.
</P>
<P>
   One telling sign: such huge multinationals as America's GE and
Europe's ABB are fizzing with excitement about micropower.
Micropower offers substantial advantages over old-fashioned power
stations, in terms of efficiency, reliability, environmental
friendliness and, increasingly, price.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the transmission losses suffered while distributing
centrally-generated electricity over long distances were more than
outweighed by the economies of scale of large power stations. But
the efficiency of the new technologies has undermined this
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Local power generation makes it easier to use the surplus heat
that even the most efficient generators release. Micropower allows
users to declare independence from electricity grids that _ as even
users in California have found this summer _ are becoming less
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   And the fuels involved (hydrogen or natural gas) come low on
environmentalists' hate-lists, certainly when compared with the
coal or nuclear energy of a typical power station.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of micropower may be even greater in poor
countries. Many of these have grids that make California's seem a
paragon of reliability, which is why so many of their customers
already run their own, mostly diesel-powered, generators.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel cells and microturbines may now allow some countries to
skip the giant-power-station stage of energy generation altogether
_ rather as many countries are sensibly jumping over wired
telephony and straight to wireless.
</P>
<P>
   If the world is ever to realize the full potential of
micropower, however, three big obstacles must be overcome: in
taxation, in standards and in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (325-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Micropower can be seriously slowed down by the distorted
taxation and subsidy of energy. Many big coal-fired power stations
are escaping ``carbon'' taxes on their emissions; even worse, a lot
receive fat subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Europe, these come directly from taxpayers; in
America, they come through waivers that exempt many established
power stations from environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Tax codes may also discriminate directly against micropower.
Fuel cells, for example, attract unfavorable depreciation rates.
All such perverse incentives need to be removed if micropower is to
be given a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The second snag is a lack of uniform technical standards. One
attraction of micropower is that it can allow generator-owners to
become producers as well as consumers _ selling surplus electricity
back to the grid when they do not need it.
</P>
<P>
   That requires clever electronic control systems, which now
exist. But it also requires agreed standards. Yet few countries
have national codes governing interconnections to their power
grids.
</P>
<P>
   So manufacturers and owners of micropower units have to deal
with myriad, sometimes contradictory, rules whenever they want to
negotiate the right to buy and sell power. And that makes it all
too easy for established incumbents to thwart newcomers by citing
bogus safety concerns, imposing lengthy approval processes or
demanding outrageous fees.
</P>
<P>
   Governments should push efforts to harmonize standards and also
act more vigorously against such anti-competitive practices.
</P>
<P>
   The third obstacle is a regulatory mess that may hold up proper
competition in electricity. America has done most to liberalize:
about half its states have thrown open their power markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the lack of coordination over interstate trading of
electricity, the absence of a single regulatory authority and the
requirement to have reserve capacity for peak demand have all led
to uncertainties that have deterred new entrants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Promising technologies will be delayed unless such muddles are
dealt with _ and the results enforced. Enforcement is an even
bigger problem in Europe, where, thanks mainly to lobbying by
Electricite de France, the French have failed to implement EU
directives on energy liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these obstructions were cleared away, traditional power
stations would not disappear. Their capital costs are sunk and
their marginal running costs are not high. But once the idea of
micropower really catches on, few new big power stations are likely
to be built.
</P>
<P>
   In a few decades' time, the notion of a micropower unit in every
home and office may even have come to fruition. The whole conceit
that electricity is generated far away from where it is consumed
may then come to seem as quaint as the idea that every phone has to
have a wire attached.
</P>
<P>
   Let the electricity revolution roll. &QL;

   Even if these obstructions were cleared away, traditional power
stations would not disappear. Their capital costs are sunk and
their marginal running costs are not high. But once the idea of
micropower really catches on, few new big power stations are likely
to be built.
</P>
<P>
   In a few decades' time, the notion of a micropower unit in every
home and office may even have come to fruition. The whole conceit
that electricity is generated far away from where it is consumed
may then come to seem as quaint as the idea that every phone has to
have a wire attached.
</P>
<P>
   Let the electricity revolution roll. &QL;

<P>
   Recent events have not been encouraging for Europe's crop of
once optimistic Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   They include such spectacular collapses as that of boo.com, a
spendthrift electronic sports-goods retailer that met impressive
standards of corporate extravagance while blithely losing a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   This week clickmango, an online health-care business, became the
latest of a string of such dot.com casualties. Clickmango's weekly
sales had reached the glorious heights of Pounds2,000 ($3,000), a
small fraction of the Pounds25,000 ($37,500) it was spending every
week to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing unusual in this, surely? After all, businesses, even
Internet businesses, fail all the time. America has, as ever,
blazed the trail; as its list of dead dot.coms lengthens, so do the
shadows over the best-known of them all, Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months hundreds of European fledglings are
likely to suffer the same fate as boo.com and clickmango. Hundreds
more will merge into larger entities with a better chance of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The process of consolidation will have profound effects, some
beneficial but some harmful, on all European companies, not just
online ones.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the benefits first. Because of the swing of the funding
cycle, many European Internet start-ups are running out of cash at
the same moment.
</P>
<P>
   Until April this year, almost anybody in Europe could raise
funds for an Internet venture. But, after wobbles on America's
high-tech stock markets that month, investors, mostly professional
venture capitalists, took fright and funding abruptly dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Only the best business ideas now get any start-up money. Only
the best executed win the second and later rounds of funding that
are needed before any company can think of floating itself on a
stock market that is suddenly much less accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   During the coming shakeout, lots of poorly conceived companies
that should, by rights, not have been funded at all will disappear.
Others that have more to offer will be snapped up by rivals in a
flurry of paper mergers (cash, not shares, being today's precious
resource).
</P>
<P>
   One result is that genuinely pan-European Internet companies are
likely to emerge sooner than even the most ambitious start-ups had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, especially in the market for business services
(or B2B), big gains for Europe's economies should thereby be
unlocked. And pan-European Internet companies will be better placed
to fight off the challenge from American firms seeking to exploit
their strength and first-mover advantage at home by spreading
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional firms may also get in on the act. Europe's big
companies have been typically slow to take to the ``new economy,''
and even slower to invest in Internet efforts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the speed with which Europe's Internet companies have
reached their consolidation phase, these slowpokes now have an
unexpected second chance to establish an online presence, at
much-reduced prices. There can be a benefit from watching others
make mistakes: call it second-mover advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet two dangers in particular lie ahead. The first is that
Europe's imported American-style venture capitalism, which
encouraged so many Internet start-ups to launch, might be thrown
over almost as soon as it has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to forget that America's investing infrastructure
took nearly three decades to develop from its Silicon Valley roots.
Over the past two years, Europe has seen a remarkable burst of
activity, but venture-capital firms have not had sufficient time to
foster the dense networks of contacts and knowledge that they need.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that a flurry of failures could send European
venture investors back to their old ways, favoring management
buyouts over start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   A second risk relates to Europe's entrepreneurial culture. From
Stockholm to Lisbon, a whole generation of motivated, excited
managers have poured their energies into starting Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   That has shaken up the executive floors more widely, as
traditional firms have struggled to hold on to the best talent and,
in many cases, have watched their market worth exceeded by cheeky
new entrants.
</P>
<P>
   With many of those new entrants now facing failure or
consolidation, there is a danger that the continent's businesses
may assume that, after all, nothing needs to change. That would be
a shame: an overly protected, over-regulated Europe has long needed
more, not fewer, risk-takers.
</P>
<P>
   How many failed entrepreneurs get a second chance will be an
important test of whether European business has really ``got'' the
new economy. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ There was a spectre haunting the Republican National
Convention this week: that of the WASP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton did his best to label George W. Bush as a
WASP whose only qualification for high office is that ``my daddy
was president'' _ a jibe which so infuriated George senior that he
threatened to tell the country what he really thinks of his
successor as ``a human being and a person.''
</P>
<P>
   And the entire point of the convention seemed to be to prove
that Republicans are just like the rest of America: multicolored,
serially disadvantaged and not a jot WASPish.
</P>
<P>
   Was this all a charade? Had the real Republican convention been
held months ago in some exclusive club? Was compassionate
conservatism conceived in a fit of giggles over port and cigars? Or
is the WASP charge just another bogeyman dreamed up by the people
who brought you the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy?
</P>
<P>
   By happy coincidence, the Republicans gathered in the very city
that gave birth to the idea of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. E.
Digby Baltzell, a local sociologist, invented the term back in
1964, and he argued that the finest examples of the species could
be found in Philadelphia and its Main Line suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   They turned up for work puffed out and a little late after
spending their morning hallooing after foxes at the Whitemarsh
Valley Hunt Club. They cut business deals at the Philadelphia Club,
played cricket and bowls at the Merion Cricket Club and, after a
few drinks, reminisced about their time at Groton and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Many American cities were like Baltzell's Philadelphia in the
first half of the century. Even brand-new Los Angeles was run by a
handful of families who met regularly in the cavernous California
Club.
</P>
<P>
   In huge areas of business it was impossible to find a Catholic
or a Jew. Ivy League universities used quotas to keep out ethnic
minorities. The Republican Party was an almost exclusively WASP
affair.
</P>
<P>
   How much has Baltzell's world changed? The Main Line still
boasts magnificent mansions. Blue-blooded Philadelphians still play
cricket (a local team, the Gentlemen of Philadelphia, is touring
England at the moment).
</P>
<P>
   But rapacious outsiders have gobbled up local institutions, such
as the Girard Trust and the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, that
once gave the WASPs a comfortable nest. Hunting foxes is no longer
an acceptable excuse for being late for work in any important
American city.
</P>
<P>
   The WASPs have had to face a two-pronged attack on their
political influence. The Democrats created huge political machines,
powered by immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Italy, which pushed
them out of power in previously WASPish cities like Boston and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Then, even more painfully, they were pushed to the margins of
the Republican Party by a combination of demographics and Richard
Nixon's Southern Strategy. The Northeastern wing of the Republican
Party is now little more than a rump.
</P>
<P>
   The modern party gets much of its intellectual energy from
Jewish neo-conservatives, much of its organizational dynamism from
Southern Baptists, and much of its social tone from the likes of
Dennis Hastert, a former high-school wrestling coach.
</P>
<P>
   The WASP elite has lost a lot of its cultural allure, too. There
was a time when immigrants wanted nothing more than to be taken for
English gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Gatsby's family hailed from Germany. Jewish
intellectuals like Lionel Trilling adopted the mannerisms of Oxford
dons. Ralph Lauren (born Lifschitz) built a business empire by
selling preppie elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Now university humanities departments are dominated by
multiculturalists who treasure every culture except the Anglo.
Ralph Lauren, shaken by falling earnings, is diversifying into
extreme sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   WASPs are the only ethnic group that it is safe to laugh at. And
yet it is hard to escape the suspicion that the last laugh may be
had by the WASPs rather than their tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of the multicultural jamboree in Philadelphia
was to put a crown on the head of the archetypal WASP: the
Ivy-League-educated son of a president and grandson of a senator.
And the state delegations were sprinkled with Bush cousins and old
fraternity brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The children of alumni (``legatees'') are still given
preferential treatment for admission to America's best
universities, a practice far more shameful than affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   WASPs are still overrepresented in the upper echelons of
companies. And it should not be forgotten that the sale of all
those WASP institutions, such as Philadelphia's banks, made their
shareholders a lot richer.
</P>
<P>
   The WASPs have not so much disappeared as evolved. They have
finally learned de Tocqueville's lesson: that the best way for
aristocrats to survive in a democracy is to disguise themselves as
hoi polloi.
</P>
<P>
   They have dropped some of their nastier habits, such as
anti-Semitism. They have also dropped some of their nicer ones,
such as putting obligation to their local communities above
maximizing their profits.
</P>
<P>
   No family illustrates this flexibility more perfectly than the
one at the center of this week's convention. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prescott Bush, W.'s granddaddy, made a fortune in the
oak-panelled world of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York before
becoming a senator from Connecticut. George Bush senior proved his
manhood by making a fortune in the hard-scrabble world of west
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush has broken every rule in the old WASP playbook by
marrying a Mexican and converting to Catholicism. But Jeb's eldest
son, who looks either like Pete Sampras (in your pundit's view) or
John Kennedy junior (every teenage girl's) and glories in the
middle name Prescott, is already proving to be one of the family's
best campaigners.
</P>
<P>
   The WASPs have also learned to diversify their risks by
supporting both sides of the political aisle. A long line of blue
bloods have jettisoned the increasingly vulgar Republican Party for
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bluest blood in the Senate runs through the veins of
Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat. The Ivy League universities and great
foundations, all founded and fertilized with WASP money, are
solidly in the Democratic camp.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton made his disparaging remarks about Governor Bush's
pedigree at one of his innumerable fund-raisers. Perhaps his
biggest worry is not that George senior will tell him what he
thinks of him ``as a human being and a person,'' but that some of
the blue bloods in his audience might have taken offense. &QL;

oak-panelled world of Brown Brothers Harriman in New York before
becoming a senator from Connecticut. George Bush senior proved his
manhood by making a fortune in the hard-scrabble world of west
Texas.

<P>
   Jeb Bush has broken every rule in the old WASP playbook by
marrying a Mexican and converting to Catholicism. But Jeb's eldest
son, who looks either like Pete Sampras (in your pundit's view) or

middle name Prescott, is already proving to be one of the family's
best campaigners.

Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat. The Ivy League universities and great
foundations, all founded and fertilized with WASP money, are
solidly in the Democratic camp.

<P>
   Bill Clinton made his disparaging remarks about Governor Bush's
pedigree at one of his innumerable fund-raisers. Perhaps his
biggest worry is not that George senior will tell him what he
thinks of him ``as a human being and a person,'' but that some of
the blue bloods in his audience might have taken offense. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ There was a spectre haunting the Republican National
Convention this week: that of the WASP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton did his best to label George W. Bush as a
WASP whose only qualification for high office is that ``my daddy
was president'' _ a jibe which so infuriated George senior that he
threatened to tell the country what he really thinks of his
successor as ``a human being and a person.''
</P>
<P>
   And the entire point of the convention seemed to be to prove
that Republicans are just like the rest of America: multicolored,
serially disadvantaged and not a jot WASPish.
</P>
<P>
   Was this all a charade? Had the real Republican convention been
held months ago in some exclusive club? Was compassionate
conservatism conceived in a fit of giggles over port and cigars? Or
is the WASP charge just another bogeyman dreamed up by the people
who brought you the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy?
</P>
<P>
   By happy coincidence, the Republicans gathered in the very city
that gave birth to the idea of the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant. E.
Digby Baltzell, a local sociologist, invented the term back in
1964, and he argued that the finest examples of the species could
be found in Philadelphia and its Main Line suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   They turned up for work puffed out and a little late after
spending their morning hallooing after foxes at the Whitemarsh
Valley Hunt Club. They cut business deals at the Philadelphia Club,
played cricket and bowls at the Merion Cricket Club and, after a
few drinks, reminisced about their time at Groton and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Many American cities were like Baltzell's Philadelphia in the
first half of the century. Even brand-new Los Angeles was run by a
handful of families who met regularly in the cavernous California
Club.
</P>
<P>
   In huge areas of business it was impossible to find a Catholic
or a Jew. Ivy League universities used quotas to keep out ethnic
minorities. The Republican Party was an almost exclusively WASP
affair.
</P>
<P>
   How much has Baltzell's world changed? The Main Line still
boasts magnificent mansions. Blue-blooded Philadelphians still play
cricket (a local team, the Gentlemen of Philadelphia, is touring
England at the moment).
</P>
<P>
   But rapacious outsiders have gobbled up local institutions, such
as the Girard Trust and the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, that
once gave the WASPs a comfortable nest. Hunting foxes is no longer
an acceptable excuse for being late for work in any important
American city.
</P>
<P>
   The WASPs have had to face a two-pronged attack on their
political influence. The Democrats created huge political machines,
powered by immigrants from Ireland, Germany and Italy, which pushed
them out of power in previously WASPish cities like Boston and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Then, even more painfully, they were pushed to the margins of
the Republican Party by a combination of demographics and Richard
Nixon's Southern Strategy. The Northeastern wing of the Republican
Party is now little more than a rump.
</P>
<P>
   The modern party gets much of its intellectual energy from
Jewish neo-conservatives, much of its organizational dynamism from
Southern Baptists, and much of its social tone from the likes of
Dennis Hastert, a former high-school wrestling coach.
</P>
<P>
   The WASP elite has lost a lot of its cultural allure, too. There
was a time when immigrants wanted nothing more than to be taken for
English gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Gatsby's family hailed from Germany. Jewish
intellectuals like Lionel Trilling adopted the mannerisms of Oxford
dons. Ralph Lauren (born Lifschitz) built a business empire by
selling preppie elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Now university humanities departments are dominated by
multiculturalists who treasure every culture except the Anglo.
Ralph Lauren, shaken by falling earnings, is diversifying into
extreme sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   WASPs are the only ethnic group that it is safe to laugh at. And
yet it is hard to escape the suspicion that the last laugh may be
had by the WASPs rather than their tormentors.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of the multicultural jamboree in Philadelphia
was to put a crown on the head of the archetypal WASP: the
Ivy-League-educated son of a president and grandson of a senator.
And the state delegations were sprinkled with Bush cousins and old
fraternity brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The children of alumni (``legatees'') are still given
preferential treatment for admission to America's best
universities, a practice far more shameful than affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   WASPs are still overrepresented in the upper echelons of
companies. And it should not be forgotten that the sale of all
those WASP institutions, such as Philadelphia's banks, made their
shareholders a lot richer.
</P>
<P>
   The WASPs have not so much disappeared as evolved. They have
finally learned de Tocqueville's lesson: that the best way for
aristocrats to survive in a democracy is to disguise themselves as
hoi polloi.
</P>
<P>
   They have dropped some of their nastier habits, such as
anti-Semitism. They have also dropped some of their nicer ones,
such as putting obligation to their local communities above
maximizing their profits.
</P>
<P>
   No family illustrates this flexibility more perfectly than the
one at the center of this week's convention. &QL;

 &HT;    `I ain't going to quit now,' vows weary worker
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON CITY, Ga. _ Johnny B. Rushing has been a full-time
farmworker for almost half a century. Each of those years, it
seems, can be read in his hands. They have been lined, gnarled and
strengthened by his labor in the fields of Worth County.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only livelihood Rushing has ever known, and 43 years
of it has been spent as a hired hand for one family. He works for
Jerald Carter, whose father first hired Rushing in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised up on a farm,'' says Rushing, 62. ``My daddy used
to farm. My granddaddy used to farm. I've just enjoyed being around
farming from when it was a mule to a tractor the way it is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't going to quit now,'' Rushing adds with a smile. ``Not
unless something bad happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But something bad is happening to farmers like Jerald Carter and
the people who work for them. Georgia's worst drought on record is
threatening their jobs and way of life. Since the start of the
spring planting season, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution
photographer and a staff writer have followed the Carter family
farm's fight for survival in this South Georgia community _ a fight
that comes closer to being a lost cause with each dry day.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many farm jobs hang in the balance because of
the drought. The closest thing to a count of farmworkers from the
state Department of Labor is a 1998 figure of 41,531 in
agriculture, forestry and fishing who were enrolled in the state's
unemployment insurance program. But that, no doubt, is well short
of the number of people who make their living raising crops and
livestock on more than 30,000 farms in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on a single farm like Jerald Carter's, however, and it's
not the numbers that matter; it's what's at stake for people. Three
men _ Rushing, Jack McCullough and Jeff Mathews _ work for Carter.
They all have a lot to lose if the drought drives Carter out of
business. But Rushing has the most to lose because he's been
working at Carter Farms since he was a young man.
</P>
<P>
   A HARD LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Johnny B. Rushing (''I don't know what the `B' stands for;
that's just my name'') knows how hard the farming life can be. He
spoke about it on a late July evening, relaxing in a rocking chair
on the front porch of the Carter Farms office after another 12-hour
workday.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up on Ten-Horse Farm, in a house that held an extended
family of 19, including cousins and his seven brothers and sisters.
By the time he was 13, Rushing says, he was ``plowing a mule like a
man, because there was so many of us, and I had to do what I could
to help support them.'' He was 14 when he quit school and went to
work full time on the farm beside his father.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 19, Rushing went to work for Jerald Carter's father.
He has worked on the family's farms since then.
</P>
<P>
   Such longtime ties between farmworkers and their employers may
occur less frequently than they once did, but they endure because
of the nature of farming, says Doug Bachtel, a rural sociologist at
the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture continues to be a family business in Georgia, and
(the relationship between farmworkers and employers) stays over
generations,'' Bachtel says. ``If you have a good worker, then you
stick with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Rushing was the only one from the large brood at
Ten-Horse Farm who stuck with farming as an adult. ``They just
didn't like it,'' he says of the others. ``They didn't like it when
they was kids. Hated to go out there and pick cotton. Hated to go
out there and feed the mules and water them.''
</P>
<P>
   His three brothers all finished high school and wound up in New
York. One recently retired from the New York police force, where he
worked undercover.
</P>
<P>
   None of Rushing's four sons had an interest in farming, and he
didn't push them toward it. He wanted them to get the education he
missed out on, then make their own decision about what to do with
their lives. One chose a career in the Army, one manages grocery
stores in Tallahassee; another, also in Tallahassee, manages a
fast-food restaurant; the fourth runs a car wash in Sylvester, the
Worth County seat where Rushing raised his family.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing says he doesn't regret his own decision to stay with
farm work. He says he ``can't complain'' about a salary of $300 a
week, plus a year-end bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get by,'' he says. ``You don't save much. You don't have
too much left over to spend. But I raised all my children, and I've
been getting by.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rushing, a big man with an easy smile, talks about the
future of farming in positives, despite the drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to get a little rain, some of it,'' he says.
``It's looking pretty good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   `JUST TIRED OF IT'
</P>
<P>
   But Jerald Carter sounds less optimistic about his chances than
at any time since he began putting seeds in the ground early in the
year. After a day spent working balky irrigation equipment, he sits
in one of the rockers on his office porch and executes what some
call ``the South Georgia salute'' _ a wave of his hand to shoo
gnats from his face. He could as easily be swatting the litany of
drought-related problems he's reciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to be pessimistic, but I'm about to get enough of
it,'' he says. ``This is the third year in a row (of drought), and
I am just tired of it. You'd think directly this thing would break
and go away and we'd be back to near to a normal situation, but,
man, we've been near about the whole summer without any rain.''
</P>
<P>
   As July drew to a close amid the forecast of more hot, dry
weather, Carter was running out of water for irrigation. A well
driller was due to come by soon to look for a new source of water.
</P>
<P>
   One field of cotton _ the first he planted this year _ is pretty
much ruined, Carter says. He's just hoping he can collect on the
crop insurance. He continues to invest in the rest of his cotton
and peanuts _ spraying for pests, irrigating, plowing _ to keep the
crops going. And he prays that the weather forecasters will be
proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the cotton, it's fixing to be over with. It's fixing to
bloom out at the top, and it'll be over with,'' Carter says sadly.
``The peanuts have probably got a few more days. But we've got to
have a significant amount of rainfall for the peanuts to turn
around. . . . We need three or four days of rain. We need probably
two or three inches over a week's period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if Carter is able to bring his crops in, his worries
won't end. The prices they bring will determine if he makes a
profit. Right now, the market isn't good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commodity prices are just horrible,'' he says. ``I've got
some corn that's about ready to gather. I called the grain elevator
_ the man that buys corn here in the county _ yesterday morning,
and he told me that it looked like the market would go to where he
was going to pay $1.70 to $1.75 a bushel for it. My gosh! You can't
even think about breaking even at that price. You need $2.75 to
$2.80 just to break even. You really need $3 for it. We've watered
it. We've put a lot into it.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's going to happen if the rain doesn't fall and commodity
prices don't go up?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen?'' he repeats. ``Are we all going to
dry up and go away? What's going to happen to us? I really don't
know. I'm so discouraged with it that I don't know what to do. I've
got so much invested in it that I can't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachtel of UGA says the drought is forcing farmers to decide
whether they can stick with it. When the decision is to give up
farming, he says, it sends ripples through the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's devastating,'' Bachtel says. ``It's devastating not only
for the farmer and his workers. It really affects the community. If
that guy goes out of business, there really isn't anything else for
the people who work for him.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Jerald Carter contemplates a worst-case
scenario, Johnny B. Rushing is asked the same question: What will
happen if things don't turn around?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll collect my Social Security,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then he adds: ``But I expect I'll keep working for Mr. Carter. I
expect he'll find something for me to do. He always has.''

   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Democratic Party's campaign planners rarely
lose sleep over Minnesota. The state's voters have chosen Democrats
in all but three presidential elections since 1948, and in all the
six most recent ones.
</P>
<P>
   But this land of fishermen and Scandinavian crypto-socialists is
no longer a bastion of the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party (as the
Minnesota branch still insists on calling itself).
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls put Al Gore and George W. Bush neck-and-neck there.
If Gore loses Minnesota, he loses the election. That is not because
of electoral-college votes: the state has only ten. But weakness
there would point to general weaknesses elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Political power in Minnesota, as in America as a whole, has
shifted to the suburbs, where Minnesotans are increasingly building
new homes. And, like suburbanites elsewhere, these people are
disdainful of party politics, and less loyal to any one party
label.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that nearly a decade of unparalleled prosperity and
a lack of any one defining issue have unmasked Minnesotans for what
they have always been: cautious, pragmatic and (gasp) centrist.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's voters strongly backed Michael Dukakis in 1988. In
1992 they plumped for Bill Clinton, though Ross Perot, for the
Reform Party, got 24 percent of the vote. In 1996 they backed
Clinton again.
</P>
<P>
   But recently Minnesotans have become more mercurial. In 1998,
young people and political fence-sitters raced to the polls to
elect as governor Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's election, many think, was an ``up yours'' vote: a
rebellion for its own sake. But it also exposed fissures in the
state's once formidable Democratic apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Party operators had endorsed Mike Freeman, another Farmer-Labor
stalwart, as their candidate for governor. At one time, that would
have been enough; but the primary was won by Hubert Humphrey III,
scion of a favorite Minnesotan son.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you knock out the two votes for Clinton and the
election of ultra-liberal Paul Wellstone to the Senate in 1990, the
Democrats have ``had as bad a decade as one can remember,'' says
Chris Gilbert, a political scientist at Gustavus Adolphus College,
in Saint Peter.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying reason is the ever-growing number of independent
voters. Worse for Gore, the poll that put him in a dead heat with
Bush also found independents more likely to vote Republican than
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota is no longer simply a kind of knee-jerk liberal
state,'' argues Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of a Washington
newsletter. ``It's just a bizarre state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is scrambling to cope with this. Gore has
visited Minnesota three times in the past five months to curry
favor with Ventura. He has made no secret of the fact that he needs
the support of the young, disaffected voters who supported the
governor, and who could hold the key to several Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   But in his quest for independents Gore may be snubbing those who
could labor for him in the autumn. When he last visited the state,
in late June, he courted the Democratic faithful only as an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' he told a group of diners in a local cafe,
``Minnesota is crucial to this election, and Minnesota will be won
or lost in your hearts.'' Democrats felt disinclined to believe
him, seeing that, the next moment, he was being chummy with
Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Once the campaign proper begins, after the conventions,
Minnesotans may start inspecting the two candidates' specific
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released on July 3 showed that 59 percent of them support
Gore's plans to use the federal surplus to shore up Social
Security, and only 31 percent support Bush's plans to let people
invest part of their Social Security taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   And those Minnesotans who say that Social Security is the most
important issue (the old, who vote) favor Gore over Bush by 49
percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore presses that issue, and finds others that appeal, he may
persuade Minnesotans to remember their native liberals: Hubert
Humphrey, Walter Mondale and Eugene McCarthy, who helped to foster
among many Minnesotans their once-deep belief that government was
more benevolent than meddlesome.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the privacy of the polling booth, Minnesotans may
decide to vote as they have nearly always done. &QL;

   Political power in Minnesota, as in America as a whole, has
shifted to the suburbs, where Minnesotans are increasingly building
new homes. And, like suburbanites elsewhere, these people are
disdainful of party politics, and less loyal to any one party
label.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that nearly a decade of unparalleled prosperity and
a lack of any one defining issue have unmasked Minnesotans for what
they have always been: cautious, pragmatic and (gasp) centrist.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's voters strongly backed Michael Dukakis in 1988. In
1992 they plumped for Bill Clinton, though Ross Perot, for the
Reform Party, got 24 percent of the vote. In 1996 they backed
Clinton again.
</P>
<P>
   But recently Minnesotans have become more mercurial. In 1998,
young people and political fence-sitters raced to the polls to
elect as governor Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's election, many think, was an ``up yours'' vote: a
rebellion for its own sake. But it also exposed fissures in the
state's once formidable Democratic apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   Party operators had endorsed Mike Freeman, another Farmer-Labor
stalwart, as their candidate for governor. At one time, that would
have been enough; but the primary was won by Hubert Humphrey III,
scion of a favorite Minnesotan son.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you knock out the two votes for Clinton and the
election of ultra-liberal Paul Wellstone to the Senate in 1990, the
Democrats have ``had as bad a decade as one can remember,'' says
Chris Gilbert, a political scientist at Gustavus Adolphus College,
in Saint Peter.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying reason is the ever-growing number of independent
voters. Worse for Gore, the poll that put him in a dead heat with
Bush also found independents more likely to vote Republican than
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota is no longer simply a kind of knee-jerk liberal
state,'' argues Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of a Washington
newsletter. ``It's just a bizarre state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is scrambling to cope with this. Gore has
visited Minnesota three times in the past five months to curry
favor with Ventura. He has made no secret of the fact that he needs
the support of the young, disaffected voters who supported the
governor, and who could hold the key to several Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   But in his quest for independents Gore may be snubbing those who
could labor for him in the autumn. When he last visited the state,
in late June, he courted the Democratic faithful only as an
afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' he told a group of diners in a local cafe,
``Minnesota is crucial to this election, and Minnesota will be won
or lost in your hearts.'' Democrats felt disinclined to believe
him, seeing that, the next moment, he was being chummy with
Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Once the campaign proper begins, after the conventions,
Minnesotans may start inspecting the two candidates' specific
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released on July 3 showed that 59 percent of them support
Gore's plans to use the federal surplus to shore up Social
Security, and only 31 percent support Bush's plans to let people
invest part of their Social Security taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   And those Minnesotans who say that Social Security is the most
important issue (the old, who vote) favor Gore over Bush by 49
percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore presses that issue, and finds others that appeal, he may
persuade Minnesotans to remember their native liberals: Hubert
Humphrey, Walter Mondale and Eugene McCarthy, who helped to foster
among many Minnesotans their once-deep belief that government was
more benevolent than meddlesome.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the privacy of the polling booth, Minnesotans may
decide to vote as they have nearly always done. &QL;

   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Democratic Party's campaign planners rarely
lose sleep over Minnesota. The state's voters have chosen Democrats
in all but three presidential elections since 1948, and in all the
six most recent ones.
</P>
<P>
   But this land of fishermen and Scandinavian crypto-socialists is
no longer a bastion of the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party (as the
Minnesota branch still insists on calling itself).
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls put Al Gore and George W. Bush neck-and-neck there.
If Gore loses Minnesota, he loses the election. That is not because
of electoral-college votes: the state has only ten. But weakness
there would point to general weaknesses elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Political power in Minnesota, as in America as a whole, has
shifted to the suburbs, where Minnesotans are increasingly building
new homes. And, like suburbanites elsewhere, these people are

 &HT;    Senate duel like a blast from the past
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From Washington, a U.S. Senate seat beckoned Zell
Miller as the fulfillment of a long-time dream. Republicans,
casting about for a candidate, settled on one of their leaders,
Mack Mattingly.
</P>
<P>
   That was 20 years ago, the first time Miller and Mattingly
coveted the same seat in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   They never faced each other then. A primary loss by Miller kept
them apart, and Mattingly went on to defeat Democratic legend
Herman Talmadge for the seat.
</P>
<P>
   But the matchup that never happened two decades ago is finally
unfolding as Georgians prepare to select a successor for the late
U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell in a Nov. 7 special election.
</P>
<P>
   Eight other candidates have signed up for the accelerated
three-month campaign. But most aren't expected to be more than
window dressing for the race.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Miller, 68, appointed by Gov. Roy Barnes as an
interim replacement, is the favorite, after 16 years as lieutenant
governor and eight years as governor. Mattingly, 69, who hasn't
been on the ballot in 14 years and hasn't won a race since his
upset Senate victory in 1980, will have to reaquaint himself with
voters in a state enlarged by 1.7 million new residents since he
left office.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Miller has set the tone.
</P>
<P>
   The popular former governor immediately embraced the legacy of
Coverdell, with whom he served in the Georgia Senate, and promised
to eschew partisanship in Washington in order to represent all
``7.5 million Georgians.'' He even broke ranks with Democrats and
President Clinton, a close personal friend, by saying he'll support
Republican efforts to repeal the marriage tax penalty and the
estate tax, even over a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's position on the tax issues has taken ``two of the most
salient issues in the state'' out of play for Republicans, said
Emory University political scientist Merle Black.
</P>
<P>
   And Miller's commanding popularity _ he left office with an 85
percent approval rating and a recent poll for the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee says he leads Mattingly 61 percent to
21 percent _ means ``it'd take a political earthquake here'' to
beat him, Black said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Miller fails to make it through the crowded field of
challengers without a runoff, a situation political experts believe
is unlikely, he becomes more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are hoping for a runoff, but they aren't about to
make the race a referendum on Miller. Party leaders, won't even
talk about the newly appointed senator's possible liabilities _ the
corporate boards he has served on since leaving office, his
consulting for the Philip Morris company or his divisive attempts
to remove the Confederate battle emblem from the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   What Republicans will try to exploit is Miller's ties to
President Clinton to lump him with liberal national Democrats. As
governor, Miller moved up Georgia's primary to give Clinton the
needed boost to win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either you're a part of the Al Gore, Tom Daschle, Teddy
Kennedy team or the George Bush, John McCain, Paul Coverdell
team,'' said GOP Chairman Chuck Clay. ``You can't be a Paul
Coverdell Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   With his decision to skip the Democratic convention in Los
Angeles this month, Miller is trying to innoculate himself in
advance for those charges. ``These folks who think I'm going to go
up there and vote the party line or be Bill Clinton's lap dog don't
know Zell Miller,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But even more often than Republicans invoke Clinton's image,
they'll use Coverdell's name in reverence. They have to establish
Mattingly as the rightful heir to the Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Already they have begun the gambit. The head of Coverdell's
campaign committee delivered Mattingly's qualifying papers and
declared he's the one that Coverdell would want in his chair. The
Coverdell campaign could give the funds remaining in the late
senator's account _ more than $537,000, according to the 1999
year-end report _ to the state GOP to spend on the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   But getting the message out is going to require much more money.
Political analysts say it will take massive TV advertising to pump
up Mattingly's name ID across the state. And national Republicans
have said that there will be little outside money directed to
Georgia if the race isn't competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly told some reporters that he, like wealthy airline
executive Lewis Jordan, who flirted with a run for the office,
could have pumped much of his own resources into the race. ``But I
think it's better to have the money coming from the people of the
state,'' Mattingly said.
</P>
<P>
   The former IBM salesman is known for his ability to drum up
campaign cash. But Miller has used his business ties, accumulating
$5 million in campaign pledges in the week he has been in office.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres, Mattingly's pollster, acknowledges the challenge. ``It's
obviously going to be an uphill climb. Governor Miller was a fine
governor, but this is a different race.''

 &HT;    Betemit tearing through New York-Penn League
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wilson Betemit is trying to make up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican shortstop is hitting over .300 for Jamestown in
the New York-Penn League after missing spring training and all of
April and May in a dispute with the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Betemit, signed by Atlanta when he was too young, filed suit in
an attempt to be declared a free agent. But he and the Braves
reached a settlement in June.
</P>
<P>
   Now 18, Betemit reported to Jamestown in time for opening day in
the short-season Class A league. He was so happy about playing
again that he did flips _ a la Ozzie Smith _ as he took the field
before games.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing injury, the organization put an end to that
crowd-pleasing routine. But Betemit's play still is exciting fans.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting .320 last season while making the all-star team in
the rookie Appalachian League, Betemit raised his average to .338
with Jamestown.
</P>
<P>
   With Betemit and second baseman Greg Donato, the Jammers have
two of the top hitters in the New York-Penn League. Donato, 19, was
hitting .351 and led the league with seven homers and 31 RBIs.
Originally a third baseman, Donato was a 12th-round draft pick in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   RICHMOND
</P>
<P>
   The R-Braves have the worst record in the International League,
but manager Randy Ingle still is nearing the 500 milestone in
career victories. Ingle, 42, went into the year with a
regular-season record of 455-442. This is his ninth season, the
second in AAA. . . . Chipper Jones and Dale Murphy headline
Richmond's all-time team. Jones was a shortstop for the R-Braves
and Murphy a catcher. Other familiar names include Dusty Baker,
Glenn Hubbard, Brett Butler, Darrell Evans and Ralph Garr. Tommie
Aaron, Hank's late brother, made the team as a player and a
manager. The team also included Paul Runge, now manager at
Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   GREENVILLE
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Mike Moore hit three homers in a 10-2 victory over
Carolina. Moore, who went into the game with just six homers, drove
in four runs. A former first-round draft choice of Los Angeles,
Moore was signed by the G-Braves after being released by Southern
League rival Huntsville. . . . Second baseman Marcus Giles stole 20
bases for the first time in his career. The Class AA all-star had a
.284 average, with 13 homers and 45 RBIs. . . . Right-hander Zach
Franchiseur, a former University of Georgia pitcher from Conyers,
moved into the starting rotation. Jason Flach switched to the
bullpen.MYRTLE BEACH
</P>
<P>
   The Pelicans edged Potomac 3-2 in 17 innings _ the longest game
in the Class A Carolina League this season. From the eighth into
the 17th inning, Pelican pitchers Tim Spooneybarger, Chris Chavez
and Michael Gray retired 27 consecutive batters. Catcher Steve
Torrealba singled home the winning run. Left-hander Jung Bong, just
called up from Macon, pitched the first six innings. He struck out
seven and walked none.MACON
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Matt Butler improved to 11-4 as he and two
relievers combined to two-hit Cape Fear 8-0 in the Class A South
Atlantic League. Butler allowed one hit and five walks in seven
innings. He struck out seven as he lowered his ERA to 3.00.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For much of the past decade, the left-of-center
Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) could claim to be the main
opposition to Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   So the triumph of Vicente Fox, the candidate of the
center-right, in last month's presidential election has thrown not
just the PRI into disarray, but the left too.
</P>
<P>
   The election was a crushing defeat for the PRD. Not only did
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, its candidate, gain fewer voters than in his
two previous presidential campaigns, but the party lost more than
half its congressional seats.
</P>
<P>
   When the new Congress assembles, it will have only 52 seats in
the 500-member lower house. And though the PRD's Andres Manuel
Lopez Obrador was elected as mayor of Mexico City, he won by a
narrower than expected margin.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Mexico City, the PRD governs just four other smallish
states, in alliance with other parties.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat has sparked recriminations. At a tumultuous meeting of
the PRD's national council last month, some members blamed the
mirthless Cardenas for his leaden campaigning; he was no match for
the charismatic Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas in turn pointed the finger at the party's various
internal squabbles. He has a point. The PRD was born out of the
first, and almost successful, presidential campaign by Cardenas,
then a dissident PRI leader, in 1988. That campaign drew support
from a host of small left-wing parties and social organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardenas's great strength was the diversity of his movement,
but on turning it into a party, that diversity became a defect,''
says Marco Rascon, a former PRD congressman.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD's diverse constituent groups became factions within the
party, vying for posts. Amalia Garcia, the party's chairwoman, and
herself the leader of one faction, complained during the national
council meeting that she had to spend 85 percent of her time
dealing with internal disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The council meeting ended with a vague agreement to work with
the new government, which is due to take office on Dec. 1. But that
masks a deep division on ideology: some believe the PRD should move
further left; others, towards the center.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the left should do well in a country where poverty is
widespread, and the gap between rich and poor is wide. But the
PRD's mixture of PRI-style nationalism and Marxism is useless now
that the Mexican economy is so closely integrated with that of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, argues Ricardo Pascoe, formerly a close aide
to Cardenas, so too is a wishy-washy ``third wayism'' borrowed from
more developed, and less unequal, countries. That policy debate may
be resolved, or excerbated, by a leadership struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas will gradually fade away _ though his sons, one of whom
is a state senator, may in time replace him.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the most influential voices are likely to be those of
two of the PRD's state governors: Lopez Obrador is, or was, a fiery
leftist; Ricardo Monreal, governor of Zacatecas, is a pragmatist
who in the past urged the party to support Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD's best hope may lie, first, in offering effective local
government, especially in Mexico City. But it could also start to
gain support in the trade unions and farmers' organizations now
that the PRI has lost its huge power of central-government
patronage.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD will not, at least at first, face much competition from
the more extreme left: strikers who kept the National University in
Mexico City closed for ten months recently have run out of steam,
and the Zapatist guerrillas in the south are waiting to see how
Fox's government deals with them.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying challenge for the PRD is to place itself once
again at the center of a broad movement, of the kind Rascon speaks
of.
</P>
<P>
   In the PRD's heyday, Rascon himself was better known as
Superbarrio: dressed in the mask and cape of a Mexican wrestler, he
campaigned for better housing for the poor in Mexico City, as a
leader of an Assembly of Neighborhood Associations which backed
Cardenas's 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rascon looks respectable, with a mobile phone and a pager
hitched to his ample waist, minding the fish restaurant he opened a
month ago in one of the capital's gentrifying neighborhoods. Maybe
one of the PRD's problems is that Mexico is changing in ways that
the left has not foreseen. &QL;

 From The Economist magazine

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ For all the growth of e-commerce, it has lagged
behind in one significant respect: payments. Almost all goods and
services bought on the Internet are paid for by old-fashioned
credit- or charge-cards. Yet for many sorts of transactions,
plastic is inappropriate or unusable.
</P>
<P>
   Most attempts to launch rival online payment-systems have been
false starts. But over the past few months, three big American
banks have been having another try.
</P>
<P>
   They are promoting new services aimed at filling one of the most
glaring gaps left by credit cards: settling person-to-person (P2P)
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, such payments are made in cash, or, failing
that, by checks and wire transfers. But these cannot meet the
demand on the Internet for immediate settlement of transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers and buyers in many online auctions, for instance, are
often individuals, rather than businesses. X.com, by some measures
the most successful online personal payment system, says 2.7
million people have signed up for its PayPal system, which lets
users transfer money by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Many are undoubtedly drawn by the $5 the company offers just for
trying the service, but PayPal is also the cheapest payment method
available. Its popularity has spawned a number of imitators.
</P>
<P>
   It has also forced banks to pay more attention to personal
payments, says James Van Dyke, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, one of the biggest Internet banks, is tackling the
threat head on. In March, it took an equity stake in Billpoint, a
payments service offered by eBay, an online auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Other banks have started to offer online remittances. In March,
Chicago's Bank One launched eMoneyMail, which _ as its name
suggests _ allows customers to e-mail money to each other from
their credit cards or bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup will soon launch a similar service in cooperation with
America Online, the biggest Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   So far, personal payments have been a niche market, but banks
have an incentive to make their initiatives work: they can easily
accommodate person-to-business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would this make e-commerce easier for the 12 million
American households without credit cards; it would also be
attractive to many credit-card holders, 41 percent of whom are
hesitant to divulge their card details online, according to a
Jupiter survey.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, such systems do not always offer shoppers the
protection that credit cards routinely provide against fraud
(though this week PayPal said it would start reimbursing victims of
some frauds).
</P>
<P>
   With credit cards, merchants bear most of the risk. Avivah
Litan, an analyst with GartnerGroup, a consultancy, says online
businesses encounter credit-card fraud 12 times more often than
offline merchants. As a result, credit-card firms charge about
two-thirds more in transaction fees than they do for sales where
the card is physically present.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards also usually set a minimum transaction size. This
has impeded the development of ``micropayments,'' where consumers
might, for example, pay a fraction of a cent to download a file.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, the volumes handled by personal services barely
register, when compared with older systems. Bank One, for example,
has managed to process just 15,000 eMoneyMail transactions in five
months of operation.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Dieringer, eMoneyMail's general manager, believes
volumes will grow as Bank One promotes the system and ties it more
closely to customers' accounts. He is probably right that other
banks will follow suit, and that P2P will grow into more than just
a cute way to buy Beanie babies. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ For all the growth of e-commerce, it has lagged
behind in one significant respect: payments. Almost all goods and
services bought on the Internet are paid for by old-fashioned
credit- or charge-cards. Yet for many sorts of transactions,
plastic is inappropriate or unusable.
</P>
<P>
   Most attempts to launch rival online payment-systems have been
false starts. But over the past few months, three big American
banks have been having another try.
</P>
<P>
   They are promoting new services aimed at filling one of the most
glaring gaps left by credit cards: settling person-to-person (P2P)
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, such payments are made in cash, or, failing
that, by checks and wire transfers. But these cannot meet the
demand on the Internet for immediate settlement of transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers and buyers in many online auctions, for instance, are
often individuals, rather than businesses. X.com, by some measures
the most successful online personal payment system, says 2.7
million people have signed up for its PayPal system, which lets
users transfer money by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Many are undoubtedly drawn by the $5 the company offers just for
trying the service, but PayPal is also the cheapest payment method
available. Its popularity has spawned a number of imitators.
</P>
<P>
   It has also forced banks to pay more attention to personal
payments, says James Van Dyke, an analyst with Jupiter
Communications, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, one of the biggest Internet banks, is tackling the
threat head on. In March, it took an equity stake in Billpoint, a
payments service offered by eBay, an online auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Other banks have started to offer online remittances. In March,
Chicago's Bank One launched eMoneyMail, which _ as its name
suggests _ allows customers to e-mail money to each other from
their credit cards or bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup will soon launch a similar service in cooperation with
America Online, the biggest Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   So far, personal payments have been a niche market, but banks
have an incentive to make their initiatives work: they can easily
accommodate person-to-business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would this make e-commerce easier for the 12 million
American households without credit cards; it would also be
attractive to many credit-card holders, 41 percent of whom are
hesitant to divulge their card details online, according to a
Jupiter survey.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, such systems do not always offer shoppers the
protection that credit cards routinely provide against fraud
(though this week PayPal said it would start reimbursing victims of
some frauds).
</P>
<P>
   With credit cards, merchants bear most of the risk. Avivah
Litan, an analyst with GartnerGroup, a consultancy, says online
businesses encounter credit-card fraud 12 times more often than
offline merchants. As a result, credit-card firms charge about
two-thirds more in transaction fees than they do for sales where
the card is physically present.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards also usually set a minimum transaction size. This
has impeded the development of ``micropayments,'' where consumers
might, for example, pay a fraction of a cent to download a file.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, the volumes handled by personal services barely
register, when compared with older systems. Bank One, for example,
has managed to process just 15,000 eMoneyMail transactions in five
months of operation.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Dieringer, eMoneyMail's general manager, believes
volumes will grow as Bank One promotes the system and ties it more
closely to customers' accounts. He is probably right that other
banks will follow suit, and that P2P will grow into more than just
a cute way to buy Beanie babies. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Barring a sudden outbreak of immortality, one would
expect undertaking to be a nice, steady business. Not so, according
to Fran Bernstein, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The past 18 months have been rather gruelling for America's
funeral industry. The top three U.S.-quoted companies, which
control roughly a fifth of the country's $30 billion market, have
seen their share prices collapse since the start of 1999. And a
fourth, Loewen, is now in the final throes of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Too much debt and too few deaths are largely to blame.
Historically, funeral firms' profits growth has been fuelled by
consolidation, with large firms buying up small, mom-and-pop
funeral parlors across America and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The top companies, such as Service Corporation International
(SCI) and Stewart Enterprises, spent almost $9.3 billion on
acquisitions in the 1990s, according to Joseph Chiarelli, a
``post-life'' industry analyst at J.P. Morgan. But competition led
to consolidators paying hefty premiums for their purchases,
plunging many into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse for a high-fixed-cost business, the number of deaths
in America has flattened out since 1998 to roughly 2.3 million a
year, after a steady rise of 1 percent a year for most of the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   With investors deserting the business, acquisitions are no
longer an option. Companies are instead selling peripheral assets.
</P>
<P>
   In July, SCI announced the sale of its French and American
insurance businesses, netting the firm $275 million in badly needed
cash. It has also sold its operations in Northern Ireland,
consisting largely of Protestant funeral homes in what have become
predominantly Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
   The firms also have to grapple with a funeral market that is
changing fast. As Bill Rowe, head of Stewart Enterprises, points
out, today's customers expect something more personal than black
crepe and tasteful wreaths for the $5,000 they are paying out.
</P>
<P>
   So as well as catering to a growing demand for cremation,
Stewart offers a catalogue of less conventional arrangements, such
as New Orleans jazz funerals and ``permanent'' memorial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   SCI too has expanded its products to include post-funeral
services such as legal assistance, bereavement counselling and
family archiving.
</P>
<P>
   SCI is also trying to trim its costs by cutting down on
expensive salesmen, and pitching its prepaid funeral plans directly
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The company has long had ``affinity'' relationships with
organizations representing its target market, such as a British
charity for the old, Age Concern. Now it is extending these to
America's big companies, which are starting to offer SCI's
discounted funeral packages to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   And SCI's new Web site, dignitymemorial.com, allows visitors to
find their nearest funeral home. Eventually, the company hopes that
globe-trotting consumers will be able to buy a standard plan over
the Web that can be delivered at any of its 3,800 funeral homes
worldwide _ which are in the process of being branded as part of
SCI's network.
</P>
<P>
   Chiarelli reckons that the companies' focus on improving
internal operations and greater customer convenience, along with
their steady market share, may lure back investors.
</P>
<P>
   Although SCI's second-quarter profit figures, being released on
Aug. 8, will be lower than expected, it has already reduced its
debt to a year-end target of $3.6 billion-3.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite a resurrection, perhaps, but still less a cause for
mourning. &QL;

   EAST JERUSALEM _ Praising Ehud Barak for his courage at Camp
David _ and implicitly criticizing Yasser Arafat for showing less _
U.S. President Bill Clinton has raised the controversial matter of
moving America's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   He has always wanted to do this, he said, but has held back
because of the damage it might do the peace process. Now, ``in the
light of what has happened,'' he would be reviewing the situation,
and would come to a decision before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Congress passed a law to move the embassy to Jerusalem,
which was supposed to come into effect in May 1999, the original
deadline for a Palestinian-Israeli final agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Because the deadline was lost, and negotiations continued,
Clinton has had to invoke America's ``critical national security
interests'' three times in the past 18 months to delay the move.
</P>
<P>
   If he now decides to let Congress have its way, America would
join Costa Rica and El Salvador in recognizing Jerusalem as
Israel's capital, a step no other country has yet taken.
</P>
<P>
   International law defines Israel as an ``occupying power'' in
East Jerusalem and as the de facto power in West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Quite apart from what it would do to America's efforts to serve
as honest broker in the search for peace in the Middle East, moving
the American embassy to Jerusalem would spill out a cascade of
subsidiary issues.
</P>
<P>
   One of these is the fact that the 3.2 hectares (8 acres) of land
in West Jerusalem designated for the embassy may not be Israel's to
lease. Before 1948, the area was home to some of the city's richest
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   After Congress's 1995 ruling, a Palestinian historian, Walid
Khalidi, did a little spadework. He found that most of the land
designated for the embassy site had belonged to 19 Palestinian
families. The descendants and heirs of these families now ``number
hundreds,'' says Khalidi, including at least 90 who are American
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing these Americans have already said they will
take their government to court if it builds an embassy on ``stolen
land.''
</P>
<P>
   That awkwardness would lead to others, one of them being the
question of restitution for Palestinian-owned properties throughout
the pre-1948 Mandate for Palestine, including West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   According to Palestinian studies, Palestinian families hold the
deeds to some 40 percent of all properties in West Jerusalem;
another 36 percent belong to the Islamic Religious Trust, the
Christian churches and the British government.
</P>
<P>
   The private properties are the patrimony of the 90,000
Palestinians who fled from, or were driven out of, the Jerusalem
area during the 1948 war. Today these refugees and their
descendants number nearly 200,000 people. Many of them live in East
Jerusalem and the West Bank, some almost within sight of their
former homes.
</P>
<P>
   Individual claims for some form of restitution are going to be
put on the table, says Salim Tamari, a Palestinian sociologist who
has recently written a book about Palestinian property in West
Jerusalem (``Jerusalem 1948: The Arab Neighborhoods and Their Fate
in the War,'' published by the Institute of Jerusalem Studies).
</P>
<P>
   This is not because the Palestinians like to dwell on past
grievances, says Tamari, but because ``their homes have been taken
over by people who at the same time are claiming Jewish properties
in East Jerusalem. It won't wash.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   After Congress's 1995 ruling, a Palestinian historian, Walid
Khalidi, did a little spadework. He found that most of the land
designated for the embassy site had belonged to 19 Palestinian
families. The descendants and heirs of these families now ``number
hundreds,'' says Khalidi, including at least 90 who are American
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing these Americans have already said they will
take their government to court if it builds an embassy on ``stolen
land.''
</P>
<P>
   That awkwardness would lead to others, one of them being the
question of restitution for Palestinian-owned properties throughout
the pre-1948 Mandate for Palestine, including West Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   According to Palestinian studies, Palestinian families hold the
deeds to some 40 percent of all properties in West Jerusalem;
another 36 percent belong to the Islamic Religious Trust, the
Christian churches and the British government.
</P>
<P>
   The private properties are the patrimony of the 90,000
Palestinians who fled from, or were driven out of, the Jerusalem
area during the 1948 war. Today these refugees and their
descendants number nearly 200,000 people. Many of them live in East
Jerusalem and the West Bank, some almost within sight of their
former homes.
</P>
<P>
   Individual claims for some form of restitution are going to be
put on the table, says Salim Tamari, a Palestinian sociologist who
has recently written a book about Palestinian property in West
Jerusalem (``Jerusalem 1948: The Arab Neighborhoods and Their Fate
in the War,'' published by the Institute of Jerusalem Studies).
</P>
<P>
   This is not because the Palestinians like to dwell on past
grievances, says Tamari, but because ``their homes have been taken
over by people who at the same time are claiming Jewish properties
in East Jerusalem. It won't wash.'' &QL;

   MOSCOW _ Remember Russia this time last year, and pinch
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin was an inconspicuous bureaucrat. The Kremlin,
under the ailing President Boris Yeltsin, seemed set for a
humiliating defeat in the forthcoming parliamentary and
presidential elections. The government was a corrupt shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Regional barons both ruled their own fiefs and held great sway
at court. And the oligarchs _ Russia's self-important tycoons _
seemed cozily entrenched in the overlap between business and
government.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, two big things have happened. The first is that the
Kremlin bounced back. It found a candidate for the presidency in
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   It found a popular cause, in the Chechen war, that eclipsed the
public's anger and disappointment with ten years of half-cocked
reform. It built up a political machine in the provinces. It used
state-controlled media to brand its main opponents as corrupt,
opportunistic and unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   After the parliamentary election, it quickly stitched up a deal
inside the lower house of parliament, the Duma, that gave it a
majority big enough to override any objections from the less
malleable upper house. A high oil price and a post-devaluation boom
gave a fair wind for all this.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, one way or another, for the first time since the
Soviet Union started falling apart under Mikhail Gorbachev, the
Kremlin now looks as if it can run the country.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has pushed through a tax reform which, although still not
nearly enough, is a lot better than anything Russia has had before.
</P>
<P>
   He has made regional governors sackable, and removed their
automatic membership of the upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He has publicly humiliated the most conspicuous oligarchs, thus
upsetting their private arrangements with government ministers.
</P>
<P>
   And this week he dismissed some generals loyal to the
independent-minded defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, who has been
noisily resisting plans to spend more money on conventional weapons
at the expense of Russia's nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   Second, power has shifted inside the Kremlin. The choice of
Putin seems to have been a compromise between, on the one hand, the
insider business interests close to the Yeltsin family and, on the
other, the security services and their allies, who are the
champions of old-fashioned Soviet thinking on strong Russian state
power at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   That deal between crooks and spooks always looked temporary. Now
it seems to have been resolved in favor of the spooks _ and of the
increasingly powerful ex-spook, Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest casualty has been Boris Berezovsky, a friend of
Yeltsin's daughter and the mastermind of both the Kremlin's recent
election victories.
</P>
<P>
   The consummate insider is now an outsider, scrambling to put
together an opposition to Putin. He is under heavy pressure from
Swiss fraud investigators, who have now handed over half a ton of
documents to Russian prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alexander Mamut, a banker closely tied to the Yeltsin
Kremlin, has so far escaped scrutiny, another previously
untouchable insider, Roman Abramovich, moved closer to the flames
last week, when Putin raised the question of the low taxes paid by
his oil company, Sibneft.
</P>
<P>
   The president's star has soared in the past month. At first, his
government looked divided and weak, and then he seemed to be
picking fights with too many powerful enemies at once. But so far
his plan has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Many expect a further burst of activity in the autumn; perhaps
the promotion of reform-minded ministers, and the sacking of those,
such as the railways minister, Nikolai Aksenenko, too closely tied
to the old guard.
</P>
<P>
   His seven newly appointed regional representatives are also
starting to take swipes at some of the more glaring illegalities
perpetrated on their patches by local governors: for instance, the
city of Moscow's unconstitutional, and very corrupt, system of
residency permits.
</P>
<P>
   To what end? But as Russia's top people head off to the south of
France for their vacations (some things do not change), two big
questions remain unanswered. Will this really work? And where is it
leading?
</P>
<P>
   The task of reforming Russia is so huge that almost any effort
risks seeming inadequate. But the biggest shortcoming in Putin's
approach so far is that it looks so selective and arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, for example, Vladimir Gusinsky, a tycoon who
owns the main independent television channel, was so dangerous a
criminal that he had to be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Now all charges have been dropped. Neither he nor the
authorities will say why. But it looks as if he has agreed to give
up his media empire. If so, the case was about the state using the
criminal-justice system to cow a political opponent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 775) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This may not be directly Putin's fault: he spends a remarkable
amount of time on foreign trips, which seem oddly to coincide with
sticky moments at home. But it does reflect a fundamental problem:
although the government talks about the rule of law, it does not
seem to understand that it applies to the state as well.
</P>
<P>
   The most ghastly atrocities in Chechnya continue unchecked.
Officials, either at their own whim or at someone else's, do with
journalists, environmentalists, trade unionists and other nuisances
more or less as they please.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's levers of patronage and intimidation make for
effective politics, but they are a rum way to build a law-abiding
state.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, most of the changes so far are superficial. Lower tax
rates are good, but Russians will start trusting the system only
when tax inspectors stop behaving like bandits.
</P>
<P>
   Business in Russia is still stifled by the combination of silly
rules and extortionate officials. To reform such things would mean
turning the bureaucracy upside down.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Putin's successes are mostly in cutting back on obvious abuses,
rather than really changing the way Russia works. That may yet
alter. Putin has at least created some of the preconditions for
proper reform; an important step, if an incomplete one.
</P>
<P>
   But there are worrying signs, too. Russia did not become a
proper democracy under Boris Yeltsin, but it was at least
pluralistic. There is no sign so far that the new Kremlin has any
time, let alone sees any need, for opposition, be it in politics,
the media or society.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian newspapers compare Putin's offensive against the
oligarchs to Stalin's early years, when the profiteers who
flourished under Lenin's ``new economic program'' _ a retreat from
total state control _ were first shaken down, and then shot.
</P>
<P>
   Putin surely has no such drastic next steps in mind. But the
fears are there. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ On Aug. 4, the Queen Mother celebrated her 100th
birthday. The occasion has already prompted a national service at
St. Paul's Cathedral and a huge pageant in the center of London.
</P>
<P>
   But her birthday forms part of a much bigger national and
international trend _ the remarkable rise in the number of
centenarians.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, when Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was born, the daughter of a
Scottish aristocrat, there were only about a hundred centenarians
in Britain. By the time she was 50, there were around 300.
</P>
<P>
   Now she joins a still select but much larger group of over
8,000, the great majority of whom are women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of centenarians has been growing at 7 percent a year.
This is a population explosion _ and one that is set to continue.
By the late 2030s, there are expected to be over 50,000 people in
the United Kingdom who have notched up the ultimate century.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is not alone in experiencing a population surge among
the very old. Worldwide, the number of centenarians is projected by
the United Nations to rise from about 150,000 today to over 2
million by 2050. What was once an extraordinary event will have
become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Why are so many more people living to such advanced ages?
Compare the present day with 1950, and it is clear that in Britain
one reason is simply that the number of births was higher at the
end of the 19th century than it was in 1850.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, the growth in the number of centenarians will be
curbed in the second half of the next decade because of the sharp
fall in birth rates during the First World War. More important than
past changes in fertility is the sharp improvement in life
expectancy between birth and the age of 80.
</P>
<P>
   But the single most important factor _ accounting for over half
the growth in the number of centenarians in the past 50 years _ has
been the rise in survival rates from the age of 80 to 100, an age
group sometimes called the ``old old.''
</P>
<P>
   In the developed world since the 1950s some of the most
pronounced declines in death rates among adults have been at older
ages. For British men, the largest percentage drop in mortality
rates since the early 1960s has been in the 55-64 age group. For
Swedish women, the biggest percentage fall between the late 1950s
and late 1980s was among 70-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, there is no sign that mortality declines at older ages
are slowing down, as health-care improves and the benefits of
better diet come to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Just how long can the Queen Mother and others in her peer group
hope to live? At present, the record is held by Jeanne Calment, a
French woman who died in 1997 aged 122.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to believe that this represents a fixed upper
limit to life, but the current maximum age-range for centenarians
is around 110 to 115.
</P>
<P>
   However, Roger Thatcher, a former director of the census, thinks
that some of the baby-boom generation born in the late 1950s and
1960s may live to between 116 and 123.
</P>
<P>
   By the 2080s, he says, at least one person in Britain will reach
the age of 116 every year _ a remarkable thought for those
30-somethings who may live that long. And sobering for the
relations who may have to look after them.
</P>
<P>
   The rising number of centenarians highlights the gloomy concept
of ``longevity risk.'' This is the risk that you will live longer
than average.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retires at 60 and lives to 110 is an actuary's
nightmare. No wonder annuity rates have tumbled as the pensions
industry struggles to catch up with the ``Queen Mother'' effect of
rising longevity. &QL;

   Looking ahead, the growth in the number of centenarians will be
curbed in the second half of the next decade because of the sharp
fall in birth rates during the First World War. More important than
past changes in fertility is the sharp improvement in life
expectancy between birth and the age of 80.
</P>
<P>
   But the single most important factor _ accounting for over half
the growth in the number of centenarians in the past 50 years _ has
been the rise in survival rates from the age of 80 to 100, an age
group sometimes called the ``old old.''
</P>
<P>
   In the developed world since the 1950s some of the most
pronounced declines in death rates among adults have been at older
ages. For British men, the largest percentage drop in mortality
rates since the early 1960s has been in the 55-64 age group. For
Swedish women, the biggest percentage fall between the late 1950s
and late 1980s was among 70-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, there is no sign that mortality declines at older ages
are slowing down, as health-care improves and the benefits of
better diet come to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Just how long can the Queen Mother and others in her peer group
hope to live? At present, the record is held by Jeanne Calment, a
French woman who died in 1997 aged 122.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to believe that this represents a fixed upper
limit to life, but the current maximum age-range for centenarians
is around 110 to 115.
</P>
<P>
   However, Roger Thatcher, a former director of the census, thinks
that some of the baby-boom generation born in the late 1950s and
1960s may live to between 116 and 123.
</P>
<P>
   By the 2080s, he says, at least one person in Britain will reach
the age of 116 every year _ a remarkable thought for those
30-somethings who may live that long. And sobering for the
relations who may have to look after them.
</P>
<P>
   The rising number of centenarians highlights the gloomy concept
of ``longevity risk.'' This is the risk that you will live longer
than average.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retires at 60 and lives to 110 is an actuary's
nightmare. No wonder annuity rates have tumbled as the pensions
industry struggles to catch up with the ``Queen Mother'' effect of
rising longevity. &QL;

   MARKABA, LEBANON _ On the pine-scented slopes along the
Lebanese-Israeli border, a platoon of United Nations peacekeepers
at last arrives to start the job they were first given 22 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five Ghanaian soldiers stake out a patch of soil
belonging to Lebanon, but repeatedly encroached upon by the Israeli
army. Having helped define the border, they must now prevent
incidents along it.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a twitchy Israeli foot-patrol that watches the
sightseers, and forbids cross-border sales of ice cream, while the
Ghanaians look on unconcerned. At the first sign of trouble, an
Israeli soldier says, the peacekeepers will turn tail and run.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, UNIFIL, as the U.N.'s acronym division has dubbed the
force, is famous for holding its ground. It came to southern
Lebanon in 1978 to ``confirm'' Israel's withdrawal and to help the
Lebanese government restore its authority.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israelis stayed put and battled Lebanese guerrillas.
UNIFIL, with no mandate to evict them, could only sit by and wait
for them to leave _ for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the force provided what humanitarian assistance
it could to local villagers and meticulously recorded each blow to
the peace it had hoped to keep.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 82 UNIFIL soldiers have been killed in the cross-fire.
For the most part, however, the job is mundane: inspecting car
trunks and patrolling empty hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   UNIFIL's Indian contingent, for example, keeps 30 men on
permanent alert at each of its three checkpoints, all for the sake
of the two or three occasions a month when someone tries to take a
gun through or drive past without stopping.
</P>
<P>
   They call one of the valleys in their zone ``Hezbollah highway''
after the guerrillas who are said to sneak through it, but none of
them has seen one.
</P>
<P>
   Their engineering division spends its time building football
playing fields, mending roads and righting cars that have turned
turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Locals love them for their free clinics, their expert vet, and
for the vague sense they convey that the world has not abandoned
south Lebanon. But there is little UNIFIL can do without the
cooperation of the Lebanese and Israeli governments.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, the Israelis mounted a full-scale invasion of Lebanon
under UNIFIL's nose. In 1996, Israeli shelling killed over 100
Lebanese civilians sheltering at a UNIFIL base in the village of
Qana.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the Lebanese government has been impeding UNIFIL's work,
refusing to allow its troops to patrol the border with Israel until
niggling territorial disputes have been settled.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the Ghanaian platoon arrived at Markaba, Lebanon
called off the redeployment, only to relent again a day later. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Not the beginning of the end, more the end of the
beginning _ or perhaps only the beginning of the end of the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of dot.com burnouts and layoffs, the numbers
from America suggest that worse is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem with Internet companies (aside from huge losses
and dwindling supplies of cash at many of them) is not that there
have been too many failures but that there have been too few.
</P>
<P>
   Even in good times, some 40 percent of all new businesses fail
within their first five years of operation, according to Census
Bureau figures. In America as a whole, more than 70,000 companies
went bust during 1998, almost half as many as were started that
year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the drumbeat of Internet failures is still
incredibly faint.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 3,000 dot.com start-ups backed by American
venture-capital firms, according to VentureOne, a consultancy. Some
50,000 firms in America get some or all of their revenues from the
Internet, according to the University of Texas at Austin's Center
for Research on Electronic Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows quite how many of these have gone bankrupt, but the
available lists are shockingly short. The Industry Standard's
``dot.com flop tracker'' lists only 21 as of July 18.
Dotcomfailures.com lists a mere 20.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs tell the same thin story. The University of Texas
research team calculates that 2.5 million Americans are employed in
the dot.com economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet total American dot.com layoffs from December to July
amounted to only 6,800 in 118 companies, according to a study by
Challenger, Gray and Christmas, a recruitment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with a single announcement this week by Bank of
America, which plans to shed 10,000 workers over the next year
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Every year more than 1 million Americans lose their jobs, or
about 1 percent of the total employed. If dot.coms were simply to
meet this unexceptional norm, much less exceed it, as the headlines
would suggest they are, they would have to be making 25,000 layoffs
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Even accounting for considerable under-reporting, the Internet
industry broadly defined (including both risky start-ups and
larger, more established firms) is still running well below the
usual rate.
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests two things. First, that the number of
layoffs and failures will rise dramatically, if for no other reason
than to reach the norms in other businesses. And, second, that this
is no bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   After all the dot.com mania of the past couple of years,
business as usual _ with all the failures that implies _ ought to
be welcomed, not feared. &QL;

ATTACKING BUSH ON BASEBALL, THAT COULD BE THE TICKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
Attacking Bush on baseball, that could be the ticket 
The phone was ringing early Friday morning. The name that popped up
on the handy caller ID read: A. Gore.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But it couldn't be ``that'' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me introduce myself,'' said the familiar voice. ``I'm your
vice president. And I'm running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I heard about all that. How can I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for my call is I have an important speech coming up
this month out in LA. This requires doing extensive research on my
opponent. I needed to check some facts with an independent
journalist, so ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``An independent journalist. That's you, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I know of. I'm a sportswriter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, but as a sportswriter you spent, like, five years
reporting on a baseball team that was owned by my opponent,
correct?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, owned in part by ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``But he had the title of managing general partner, so he called
all the ownership shots. He's the guy who traded Sammy Sosa,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No ... that was Tom Grieve, the general manager at the time.
And the manager, Bobby Valentine, also had a large hand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But who was in charge? Who had the final sign-off on that
trade of Sammy Sosa?''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, I guess you're right. But what the heck does any of
this have to do with being a candidate for president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You call yourself a sportswriter? And you still don't
understand? Can we go off the record?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure. What's your point here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is top secret. But our party platform, and our campaign
slogan coming out of the national convention this month will be:
`Does This Country Need Another Harold Baines?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, this is pure genius. That's how we win in
November. We beat him on his baseball record. All that nasty stuff
I'm been saying about Texas since he became governor _ it's nothing
but a smoke screen. But baseball is something all of America
understands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now hold it. He was actually a good owner, I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you, some kind of Republican? This was the worst
trade in the history of baseball. He gave up Sammy Sosa and Wilson
Alvarez for a lifeless bum in Harold Baines. Any man who has that
on his record is not qualified to be president of the United
States. And the American people will agree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Big Al. C'mon. It was 11 years ago. 1989. That was the
first season of ownership for those guys. He was trying to be the
right kind of professional sports owner. He had people in place who
knew baseball. He was delegating authority. He was doing it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure ... just try to sell that to Sam Donaldson. I
watched their convention last night. I heard my opponent up there,
taking his shots at me. He crowed about the buck stopping here.
Well, I've got news for the man. In a couple of weeks, his buck is
gonna stop on Sammy Sosa. `Now is the time' _ that's what he kept
saying in his speech. But the time is coming, and real soon, when
he'll have to explain Harold Baines, and a lot of other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't run a baseball team, you can't run this country.
That's my platform. And the American people will agree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, Big Al, he had five pretty good baseball years here,
everything considered. He took over a franchise that had totally
bottomed out, and ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must have been covering too much Cowboys in those days.
The early '90s, Jimmy started winning Super Bowls, and you let my
opponent slide over there in Arlington. That's it, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what was the Rangers' record from '89 to '93, meaning on
his watch?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Offhand, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do. Try 414 wins, 396 losses. In five years, the team was 18
games over .500. Pitiful. If he's elected, his economic program
will have about the same kind of growth. How close did the Rangers
ever come to first place in that time? Got the answer right here.
Eight games. Not even close to being a contender. His baseball team
was a boring loser. Come November, the American people won't accept
that from a president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the team became economically feasible in the early '90s,
and that helped in some later success on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop protecting this guy. When the money started coming in,
what did he do to improve the club? Did he sign free agents?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, but let me give you those names. How about the immortal
Manny Lee. Did Gary Pettis thrill you? Or Dickie Thon? What about
bringing back Tom Henke when Henke was already washed up? Like I've
been saying all along, your guy doesn't know what to do with a
surplus budget. And this proves it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't agree with you. I don't think politics and baseball
are an accurate mix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are so wrong. Just wait 'til my speech in LA when I remind
the American people that my opponent allowed Rafael Palmeiro to
walk in free agency, then he was thrilled about signing Will Clark
to replace him. When I hit him over the head with that one, I may
even carry Texas. Or at least Tarrant County.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to admit it, but that Raffy stuff is, well, damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My man, you ain't heard nothing yet. I gotta go now. Bill is
holding on the hotline. But remember what I told you _ baseball is
bigger than politics, and this country can't afford another Harold
Baines.''

ATTACKING BUSH ON BASEBALL, THAT COULD BE THE TICKET
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The phone was ringing early Friday morning. The name that popped
up on the handy caller ID read: A. Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But it couldn't be ``that'' ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me introduce myself,'' said the familiar voice. ``I'm your
vice president. And I'm running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I heard about all that. How can I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for my call is I have an important speech coming up
this month out in LA. This requires doing extensive research on my
opponent. I needed to check some facts with an independent
journalist, so ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``An independent journalist. That's you, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I know of. I'm a sportswriter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, but as a sportswriter you spent, like, five years
reporting on a baseball team that was owned by my opponent,
correct?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, owned in part by ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``But he had the title of managing general partner, so he called
all the ownership shots. He's the guy who traded Sammy Sosa,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No ... that was Tom Grieve, the general manager at the time.
And the manager, Bobby Valentine, also had a large hand in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But who was in charge? Who had the final sign-off on that
trade of Sammy Sosa?''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, I guess you're right. But what the heck does any of
this have to do with being a candidate for president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You call yourself a sportswriter? And you still don't
understand? Can we go off the record?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure. What's your point here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is top secret. But our party platform, and our campaign
slogan coming out of the national convention this month will be:
`Does This Country Need Another Harold Baines?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you, this is pure genius. That's how we win in
November. We beat him on his baseball record. All that nasty stuff
I'm been saying about Texas since he became governor _ it's nothing
but a smoke screen. But baseball is something all of America
understands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now hold it. He was actually a good owner, I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you, some kind of Republican? This was the worst
trade in the history of baseball. He gave up Sammy Sosa and Wilson
Alvarez for a lifeless bum in Harold Baines. Any man who has that
on his record is not qualified to be president of the United
States. And the American people will agree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Big Al. C'mon. It was 11 years ago. 1989. That was the
first season of ownership for those guys. He was trying to be the
right kind of professional sports owner. He had people in place who
knew baseball. He was delegating authority. He was doing it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, sure ... just try to sell that to Sam Donaldson. I
watched their convention last night. I heard my opponent up there,
taking his shots at me. He crowed about the buck stopping here.
Well, I've got news for the man. In a couple of weeks, his buck is
gonna stop on Sammy Sosa. `Now is the time' _ that's what he kept
saying in his speech. But the time is coming, and real soon, when
he'll have to explain Harold Baines, and a lot of other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't run a baseball team, you can't run this country.
That's my platform. And the American people will agree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, Big Al, he had five pretty good baseball years here,
everything considered. He took over a franchise that had totally
bottomed out, and ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must have been covering too much Cowboys in those days.
The early '90s, Jimmy started winning Super Bowls, and you let my
opponent slide over there in Arlington. That's it, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what was the Rangers' record from '89 to '93, meaning on
his watch?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Offhand, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do. Try 414 wins, 396 losses. In five years, the team was 18
games over .500. Pitiful. If he's elected, his economic program
will have about the same kind of growth. How close did the Rangers
ever come to first place in that time? Got the answer right here.
Eight games. Not even close to being a contender. His baseball team
was a boring loser. Come November, the American people won't accept
that from a president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the team became economically feasible in the early '90s,
and that helped in some later success on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop protecting this guy. When the money started coming in,
what did he do to improve the club? Did he sign free agents?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, but let me give you those names. How about the immortal
Manny Lee. Did Gary Pettis thrill you? Or Dickie Thon? What about
bringing back Tom Henke when Henke was already washed up? Like I've
been saying all along, your guy doesn't know what to do with a
surplus budget. And this proves it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't agree with you. I don't think politics and baseball
are an accurate mix.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are so wrong. Just wait 'til my speech in LA when I remind
the American people that my opponent allowed Rafael Palmeiro to
walk in free agency, then he was thrilled about signing Will Clark
to replace him. When I hit him over the head with that one, I may
even carry Texas. Or at least Tarrant County.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to admit it, but that Raffy stuff is, well, damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My man, you ain't heard nothing yet. I gotta go now. Bill is
holding on the hotline. But remember what I told you _ baseball is
bigger than politics, and this country can't afford another Harold
Baines.''

FORD HAS SURGERY TO RELIEVE ABSCESS CAUSED BY RARE INFECTION
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former President Gerald Ford underwent successful
surgery in a Philadelphia hospital Saturday to relieve swelling in
his tongue from a rare bacterial infection, his doctors reported.
</P>
<P>
   The infection was unrelated to the stroke that caused Ford to be
admitted last Wednesday to Hahnemann University Hospital in
Philadelphia during the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the 87-year-old former president was on a path to
full recovery from both the stroke and the abscess in his tongue
and was resting comfortably at the hospital. A biopsy showed no
sign of a tumor causing the pain and swelling in his tongue, the
hospital reported. Doctors diagnosed the condition as a case of a
bacterial infection known as actinomycosis, a common oral bacillus
that rarely attacks the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   The abscess was drained, easing the swelling considerably,
doctors reported. Ford received a general anesthetic for the
25-minute surgical procedure and, after 30 minutes of recovery,
returned to his room where he was reported awake and alert as he
was greeted by his wife, Betty, and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now, I think, completely recovered from his small
stroke,'' said Dr. Robert J. Schwartzman, the hospital's chief
neurologist, who said Ford's blood-thinning drugs were receiving a
final adjustment. ``As soon as that is accomplished he should be
ready to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   The pocket of infection deep within the tongue was described as
an exceedingly rare condition with so little casebook precedents
that the doctors declined to speculate on how the tongue became
infected. The doctors and Ford's spokesman, Calvin McDowell,
unofficially referred to it as ``the president's syndrome'' in
discussing it at a news conference at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``There simply aren't enough cases for us to draw conclusions in
the medical literature,'' said Dr. Richard Hayden, chairman of the
hospital's department of otolaryngology, who performed the surgical
procedure on the former president.
</P>
<P>
   ``His comfort level is markedly improved and his speech has come
back,'' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   After being saluted at the convention Tuesday night, Ford later
went to the hospital and told doctors he was suffering acute facial
pain. He was told he probably had a bad sinus infection and was
given some antibiotics and released.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sleepless night, Ford returned to the hospital about
9 a.m. Wednesday, once more walking in on his own. The symptoms
were worse, he told doctors, and besides pain included dizziness,
numbness and an inability to speak without slurring words.
</P>
<P>
   Tests indicated that he had suffered at least one mild stroke in
the rear portion of the brain that controls basic functions like
balance, speech and swallowing, doctors reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was admitted to the neurological intensive care unit and,
within a day's treatment that included blood-thinning drugs,
doctors reported he was doing much better and could expect a full
recovery from the stroke. He was making such good progress that
hospital officials permitted Gov. George W. Bush to visit him for
20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With Ford neurologically stable, the doctors decided to treat
the tongue abscess Saturday morning. As part of the treatment
following the surgery, Ford, who is allergic to penicillin, began
taking the antibiotics Clindamycin and Levofloxacin. Hayden
predicted a full recovery in the next several weeks with Ford to be
treated on an outpatient basis after he returns home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in great spirits,'' McDowell said. ``Everyone is very
excited. Ford is calling it a `beautiful day and beautiful news.'''

BUSH, CHENEY ROLL THROUGH THE RUST BELT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHOOLCRAFT, Mich. _ The road from here for the Bush-Cheney
campaign is one well-trodden with Democratic footprints.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from the Republican National Convention, the GOP ticket of
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney rolled through this Rust Belt state
Saturday as part of a multipronged strategy to defeat Al Gore in
states _ and with tactics and themes _ that have been winners for
Democrats in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   In each state, the bounty is so-called swing voters,
independents and moderates who are expected to vote Nov. 7 on the
basis of a candidate more than his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just a Republican message. Ours is a message that
speaks to working people from all walks of life,'' Bush told a
crowd of more than 1,000 gathered in Durand as part of a pitch to
union members, a traditionally Democratic bloc.
</P>
<P>
   GOP and Bush campaign strategists say their plan for gathering
the 270 electoral votes needed to elect a president includes having
the candidates themselves concentrate on a band of six swing states
running from New Jersey through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,
Illinois, and Missouri. By air and rail, the ticket will visit all
those states but New Jersey and Missouri by the end of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rode into last week's convention in Philadelphia after
visits to Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, and
Pennsylvania, all of which have voted Democratic in recent
presidential elections. He and Cheney plan more visits there and in
Louisiana and Florida, which have also gone Democratic. Florida,
where Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor, has 25 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush will take Arizona Senator John S. McCain with
him this week to California, which has the mother lode of 54
electoral votes. Building off the cross-party appeal of McCain's
reformist message, Bush and Cheney plan to campaign up and down the
West Coast, and raise money not only for themselves but for
Republican House and Senate candidates as well.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the campaign will build off the $67.7 million it received
from the federal government for the general election campaign with
financial support from the Republican National Committee. It is
trying to stock its ``Victory 2000'' fund with more than $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the money will be spent on party TV ads benefiting the
ticket. The rest will be dedicated to grass-roots organizing and
turn-out-the-vote efforts that it hopes will rival those put on by
organized labor and the law enforcement community, which have been
rallying to Democratic causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the foot soldiers may be marching in a different
direction this time around, and they may be marching for Republican
candidates,'' said RNC spokesman Mark Pfeifle. He noted the
presence in Philadelphia last week of James P. Hoffa, head of the
Teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more than anything, the Republicans hope to regain the White
House with a thematic appeal aimed at scratching an itch that
voters feel in both good times and bad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Gore and Bill Clinton satisfied the urge by portraying
President Bush as part of a tired, 12-year-old Republican
administration that hadn't changed since Ronald Reagan took office
in 1981. The ouster of Bush's father was stunning considering his
90-plus percent approval rating following the Persian Gulf War only
21 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It helped the Democrats that the country was in the midst of an
economic slowdown in the summer of 1992. But now, even amid
unprecedented prosperity and widespread contentment, usually
factors for maintaining the status quo, Bush will make the same
argument that elected Clinton eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the clearest of terms and on the most prominent of political
stages, Bush made his pitch Thursday night in his speech accepting
the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not led. We will,'' he thundered in the signature
phrase of his 52-minute address.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Cheney appropriated Gore's famous chant from
his 1992 speech accepting the Democratic vice presidential
nomination. ``It's time for them to go,'' Cheney said in accepting
the GOP nomination. The delegates roared in delight.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans believe the argument will have even more resonance
should Gore choose Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry as his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who will accept the Democratic presidential nomination on
Aug. 17, is set to announce his selection Tuesday. Saturday, Kerry
flew to Washington from his vacation home in Idaho; today he plans
to return to Boston. Kerry and his staff had no comment on the vice
presidential choice, but there was continuing buzz he remained
among four to six, and possibly seven, choices.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore picks Kerry, the Republicans are expected to immediately
label him ``another Massachusetts liberal'' and ``Mike Dukakis's
lieutenant governor,'' the strategist said. Kerry was lieutenant
governor under former governor Michael S. Dukakis, whom Bush's
father defeated in the 1988 election.
</P>
<P>
   According to Karl Rove, the Bush campaign's senior strategist,
the state Republican parties have a more prominent role in the
election strategy than in past years.
</P>
<P>
   Through mailings, phone call, e-mail distribution and rallies,
state parties are being charged with building grass-roots support
for the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   While it will be run at the local level, the effort will be
closely watched by Bush campaign officials back in Austin, Texas.
The campaign has exerted great pressure on state parties to turn
out on behalf of Bush, and analyzes their progress every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally, we are saying to state Republican parties, if you
want George W. Bush or Dick Cheney or a Bush surrogate to appear at
your fund-raiser, we better have come to a mutual agreement as to
what our goals are and how we're going to execute them,'' Rove said
in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said Bush officials have met with leaders of the more than
20 so-called ``battleground'' states over the last three months to
put those guidelines to paper and decide how they will be financed.
</P>
<P>
   The strategist also said he expected four key states,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Missouri, to remain battlegrounds
until Election Day. At the very least, he said, it would be another
four to five weeks until the campaign could determine which way
they were leaning.
</P>
<P>
   He described California and Florida as ``late-deciding'' states,
whose voting preference would not become clear until mid- to
late-October, after the first presidential debate.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the campaign has mapped out its advertising strategy
through November. But Rove declined to describe it, and said the
plans were subject to change.
</P>
<P>
   One area of the country appeared to be something of a lower
priority for Bush: New England. Rove said three states, Maine, New
Hampshire and Vermont, appeared to be leaning toward Bush, and the
campaign is planning to return there in the coming months.
Connecticut is also in play, Rove said. Massachusetts appears to be
hardly on the campaign's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the campaign is casting a wide net, relying on the
harmonious image coming out of the Republican convention to attract
support anywhere possible. One tangible sign of the outreach?
</P>
<P>
   Next Saturday, Bush will pay a visit to the Arizona ranch of
McCain, once his most bitter primary rival.
</P>
<P>
   Kornblut reported from Michigan; Johnson reported from
Washington.

 &HT;    QB Weinke 'Noles' statesman
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chris Weinke knows he is not the average college
quarterback. The reminders are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was filling out a form for a physical the other day, and
another player was standing next to me,'' said the
</P>
<P>
   Florida State senior. ``I was born in 1972. He was born in
1982.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, who spent six years in pro baseball's minor leagues
before returning to college football in 1997, turned 28 on July 31.
A week ago, he skipped the 10-year reunion of his high school
senior class in Minneapolis. Probably just as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Chris, what are you doing these days?'' Weinke asked,
mocking a potential question. ``Uh, I'm still in college.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of self-deprecating humor has served Weinke well
during his successful reign as college football's elder statesman.
He is 21-1 as a starting quarterback. But when the subject turns to
Florida State's effort to defend its 1999 national championship,
the joking stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who think we aren't hungry, that
we're going to be complacent,'' said Weinke, who led the Seminoles
to a 12-0 season in 1999, capped by a 46-29 win over Virginia Tech
in the Sugar Bowl. ``That is the biggest mistake they could make.
We are working harder now than we did a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke is seeing to that, and the work began with himself. After
making the decision to return for his senior season, the 6-foot-5
Weinke threw himself into a stringent workout program to add muscle
and quickness. Last season, when he was returning from a November
1998 neck injury that nearly ended his career, Weinke bulked up to
245 pounds in an effort to protect himself.
</P>
<P>
   The pro scouts, who projected Weinke no higher than a
third-round pick in the 2000 NFL draft, told him he needed to get
quicker. He has, by slimming down to 229 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really had to tell me that I needed to get quicker; it
was obvious,'' said Weinke, who threw for 3,103 yards and 25
touchdowns last season. ``But last year, I was just worried about
taking a hit and surviving. Now, I'm doing everything I can to be
the best I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's in the best shape of his life, Weinke is demanding
the same of his teammates. He is in the weight room three days a
week because he thinks it is important for the younger players to
see him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be a leader, you can talk all you want,'' he
said. ``Until you lead by example, nobody is going to respect you.
I learned that in baseball, where there were guys who could talk
and guys who could play.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, he led nightly throwing sessions in Tallahassee
that drew as many as 60 Florida State players. Coaches are not
allowed at such informal workouts, but Weinke stepped in to run the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance isn't mandatory, but . . . ``If a guy shows up and
he's been gone for a couple of weeks, he knows he's going to get
his butt chewed out,'' Weinke said. ``I don't have any problem
calling a guy out in front of everybody if he's not coming to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden, set to begin his 25th season as the Seminoles'
coach, loves to hear it. Florida State has handled success well, in
posting 13 consecutive seasons of 10 wins or more. A player like
Weinke just makes his job easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not trade that guy for any other quarterback in
America,'' said Bowden, who has 304 career victories. There may be
some who are more talented, but there is not a better leader
anywhere. He is the perfect quarterback for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss of All-America receiver Peter Warrick, Weinke
said, this Florida State offense actually has a chance to be better
than the explosive unit of a year ago that averaged 37.5 points per
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete was a special player but this offense can be better
because now we can spread the ball around to eight or nine
different receivers,'' he said. ``I was guilty of looking to Pete a
lot, because if I could get it to him, he could always make a big
play. But we've got a lot of guys on this team that nobody's really
heard about. And they are pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles have just one way to improve on the first 12-0
season in Florida State history, he said. With an early game
against BYU, on Aug. 26 in Jacksonville, the 2000 team potentially
could go 13-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I came back,'' Weinke said. ``I've got one national
championship, but I guess I'm greedy. I want another one.''

 &HT;    Gimmicks key to moving the turnstiles

<P>
   JUPITER _ It's a sweltering afternoon at the home of the Jupiter
Hammerheads, and Pat Hathaway and his 8-year-old son Andrew sit in
the stands and cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Hathaway brings his son to the ballpark about once a month. He's
lured by the Hammerheads' affordable tickets _ $4 to $5 each _ and
by minor league baseball's laid-back atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the team's alumni include Major League stars such as
Vladimir Guerrero, Hathaway isn't here for the quality of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the minors there are a lot more errors than in the majors,
so that makes it exciting,'' Hathaway says.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Florida State League. It's Class A baseball, near
the entry level to the professional game. The typical player has a
couple of years of minor league experience and makes about $1,200 a
month, plus meal money.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball might be a little rough, but many fans pay scant
attention to the games. They're more interested in giveaways such
as Pokemon trinkets and promotions such as sky-diving Elvis
impersonators.
</P>
<P>
   Fans such as Hathaway _ unlike big league fans _ typically don't
care whether a minor league club is in first place or last.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sellout crowds are as rare as profitable teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida State League's average attendance is 1,000, giving
the 14-team league one of the lowest attendance totals in minor
league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If crowds are sparse, profitable seasons are scarcer. The median
loss for the 14 teams in the Florida State League in 1999 was
$216,077.
</P>
<P>
   The teams blame a variety of factors, including hot and rainy
weather, Florida's notoriously fickle sports fans and a plethora of
competing entertainment choices that vie for fans' time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough draw,'' acknowledges Mike Veeck, a co-owner
of the Florida State League's Fort Myers Miracle and three other
minor league clubs throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Miracle are one of only two independently owned teams in the
14-team league. The Hammerheads, St. Lucie Mets and Vero Beach
Dodgers are owned by their big league parents, and all three lose
money.
</P>
<P>
   Veeck says his team is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12 years the Montreal Expos have owned the Hammerheads,
the former West Palm Beach Expos have turned a profit for only one
season, and then just $10,000. In the team's other 11 seasons, the
Hammerheads have lost as much as $190,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, Dodgers and Miracle wouldn't reveal their loss or
profit.
</P>
<P>
   The Hammerheads' losses are narrowing, says Rob Rabenecker,
general manager of Jupiter's Roger Dean Stadium, thanks largely to
the team's $30 million home that opened in 1998. The 7,000-seat
park was designed by HOK, the architectural firm responsible for
well-received stadiums such as Camden Yards in Baltimore and Jacobs
Field in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   At the team's former home, West Palm Beach Municipal Stadium, an
outfield that wouldn't drain canceled games even on days when it
didn't rain.
</P>
<P>
   The Hammerheads' attendance shot to 90,000 in 1998, the team's
first season in Jupiter, up from 65,000 in 1997, the last season in
West Palm Beach. The team's net loss narrowed to $161,222 in 1998
from $186,263 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Hammerheads lost $54,177; Rabenecker expects the
club to turn a profit this year.
</P>
<P>
   If the Hammerheads become profitable, the black ink won't flow
from a winning record. Rather, Rabenecker says, profit will come
because the team pays attention to the cleanliness of its park, the
quality of its concessions and the attractiveness of its
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Minor league teams don't control the players they receive from
major league parents. Therefore, gimmicks are key to moving the
turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Hammerheads gave out Pokemon coins during a game last month,
and the team has handed out backpacks. An Independence Day
fireworks show was a big draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just open the gates, we're going to get 250 or 300
people,'' Rabenecker says.
</P>
<P>
   While minor league baseball is known for bizarre promotions, the
Hammerheads' gimmicks are of the vanilla variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play it pretty straight-up,'' Rabenecker says. ``We're
trying to position ourselves as family entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because racier promotions proved distasteful, Rabenecker
says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, for instance, the West Palm Beach Expos brought in
Morganna, the busty groupie who gained fame by doddering onto
fields to kiss star players during games.
</P>
<P>
   Rabenecker was disturbed by the ruckus Morganna caused during
her one-game visit. He saw one father and son at the game; the
father held a copy of Playboy magazine for Morganna to sign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Expos hired Captain Dynamite, whose act consisted
of taking his Coffin of Doom to the pitcher's mound, dousing it
with kerosene and setting off a deafening explosion. As a side
effect, the pitcher's mound caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd went nuts,'' Rabenecker recalls. ``But I'm standing
there with the groundskeeper, and his eyes were bugging out.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the type of promotions Mike Veeck loves. He's the son
of the late Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck, a promotions wizard
who as owner of the St. Louis Browns had the 3-foot-7 Eddie Gaedel
pinch hit to draw a walk. (He did.)
</P>
<P>
   Baseball promoters consider the younger Veeck a pioneer of minor
league baseball marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Among Veeck's brainstorms: ``Field of Screams,'' a promotion in
Fort Myers that involved showing all-night horror movies on the
field after the game. He's also had mimes re-create close plays and
gave away inflatable bats sponsored by Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like double-entendres,'' Veeck says.
</P>
<P>
   The Vero Beach Dodgers haven't dared to be quite so risque, but
the team did hire guys to dress up in sequined Elvis outfits, jump
out of a plane and land on the field at Holman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the team sponsored a ``Dog Days of Summer''
promotion. Canines who paid for their owners received free tickets,
and the concession stands doled out doggie biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Vero's Dodgers might play on the same grass where Jackie
Robinson and Sandy Koufax once took the field during spring
training, but what really keeps the fans coming back isn't
tradition, says Dodgers General Manager Grant Griesser. It's
fireworks, sky-diving Elvises and seat cushion giveaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough sell,'' Griesser says. ``You can't just open the
gates and say, `Hey, we've got a baseball game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Lucie Mets have a similar strategy, says Mets General
Manager Paul Taglieri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we're 20 games out of first place, we still have to
try to put on a show,'' Taglieri says. ``Our competition is the
movie theater, the roller skating rink across the street, going out
to dinner, the mall.''

TALKS AIM TO AVERT WALKOUT AT VERIZON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiations continued into the night Saturday as Verizon
Communications sought to head off a strike by thousands of service
representatives and technicians who threatened to walk off their
jobs at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the company's refusal to yield to labor officials'
demands to unionize employees in its wireless division, some 85,000
workers planned to strike shortly after the 11:55 p.m. Saturday
expiration of a two-year contract with Verizon Communications,
formerly Bell Atlantic. Of those workers, about 15,000 live in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be terribly optimistic at the same time,'' said
Eric Rabe, a Verizon spokesman, during a late afternoon conference
call, ``but we're committed to doing everything we can to reach a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The walkout would affect 25 million customers from Maine to
Virginia who are seeking installation or repairs of telephone lines
or who wish to add services. However, Verizon spokesman Steve
Marcus said the network would continue to function and customers
can still make and receive telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made some contingency plans, and we will have managers
fill in, about 30,000 managers, for some of these jobs,'' said
Marcus. ``We will, obviously, do everything we can to service
customers, but there will likely be some delays. The emphasis will
be on making repairs and keeping people connected to the network
rather than installing new services.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the company and the Communications Workers of
America, which represents 72,000 Verizon workers on the East Coast,
and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which
represents 13,000 employees, began June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations stalled over the unions' demands for contract
language that would guarantee job security in a changing
telecommunications market. At the top of this job security list: a
request for an agreement to guarantee voluntary card check
arrangements as well as expedited elections at Verizon Wireless,
the company's fast-growing wireless unit.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 42 of the wireless unit's 3,500 workers are
unionized. CWA organizers contend technical and service workers at
Verizon Wireless receive lower benefits, work longer hours, and, in
some cases, earn less pay than their union counterparts in other
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout, the second by the CWA in two years, marks the
continuation of a life-and-death battle for both sides. Experts say
Verizon may be reluctant to yield on the issue of unionization,
particularly since many of its competitors are not unionized. At
the same time, the two unions must break into the growing wireless
telecommunications sector or face certain membership decline in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, to be unionized was not a competitive
disadvantage (for telephone companies),'' said Jeffrey Kagan, a
telecommunications analyst in Atlanta. ``But it is now. They face
competitors who are not unionized. Instead, every employee of every
successful telecom and tech company in this new economy is treated
like an owner, and they act like owners. They don't work to rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Bernard, director of the Harvard Trade Union Program,
likened the dispute to past labor disputes that have arisen over
double-breasting in the construction industry, which occurs when a
contractor creates a nonunion ``sister'' entity that hires only
nonunion workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the telecommunications industry's future,'' Bernard
said. ``But the fact that these firms are set up as a nonunion
sector is particularly galling to the unions, since they had
reached an agreement with Bell Atlantic that had called for
neutrality (in union organizing).''
</P>
<P>
   CWA said prior to its merger with Bell Atlantic Corp., Nynex
Mobile had agreed to a card check agreement and had recognized both
unions as bargaining representatives for sales and technicians in
Boston and New York. That was in 1992 and 1993, respectively. The
unions maintain that in 1995, after Bell Atlantic took over Nynex
Mobile, it declined to negotiate with either union.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, Marcus said the company was willing to
discuss the matter but felt ``that it is really an issue for
Verizon Wireless, our subsidiary. Verizon Wireless is a separate
company and it is responsible for its own labor relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The unions have made some headway in a handful of wireless
units. At AT&AMP;T Wireless, they have won the right to institute a
voluntary card check procedure. Additionally, CWA has organized
some 5,000 wireless workers at SBC Communications, which owns
CellularOne. SBC's wireless units have a total payroll of 14,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Under such an agreement, the union can either declare itself the
sole bargaining agent for a group of workers after securing a
majority of union card signatures, or it gains the right to hold an
election within 10 days, with certification by the American
Arbitration Association. The organizing technique has, at many
unions, replaced the use of standard elections, which are often
challenged by employers.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, fearful that union work rules and contracts will stymie
growth and prevent it from lowering prices when necessary, has
refused to budge on the issue.

 &HT;    While party shows unusual diversity, platform unaltered
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The more inclusive Republican Party that George W.
Bush led out of Philadelphia on Friday stands for a no-exceptions
ban on abortion and limiting sex education to teaching about
abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   While an openly gay GOP congressman addressed the convention for
the first time, speaking about trade, not gay rights, delegates
defeated efforts to rid the party platform of its calls for bans on
gay marriage and gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans congratulated themselves last week for their new
interest in diversity and a willingness to listen to dissenting
points of view. ``We commit to resolve our differences with
civility, trust and mutual respect,'' reads the introduction to the
platform section on ``Renewing Family and Community.''
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP remains committed to conservative social policies
that do not always square with the friendlier image that emanated
from Philadelphia. And the tension inherent in Bush's compassionate
conservatism might lead some voters to wonder which is the real
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the policy was geared to the conservative element in our
party,'' said Susan Cullman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition.
``All the public face was geared to the moderates in the rest of
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, a consultant to the Bush campaign and former
Christian Coalition executive, had a different take. ``We remain a
conservative party,'' Reed said, ``but this is a party that is
lowering the barrier to entry and opening the door wide to
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions within the Republican and Democratic parties are, of
course, nothing new. The two modern parties succeed by knitting
together disparate groups.
</P>
<P>
   The platform is just one element in this delicate balancing act:
How does a party broaden its appeal without turning off its core
support?
</P>
<P>
   Yet this year, mindful of defeats in two presidential elections,
the Bush campaign has made a special point of playing up a
compassionate side of its conservative message.
</P>
<P>
   The early reviews are promising for Republicans. Polls of likely
voters taken throughout the week showed Bush increasing his lead
over Vice President Al Gore, even among women and independent
voters. These socially moderate voters, who backed Bill Clinton in
1992 and 1996, are widely thought to be keys to the outcome of the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats already have begun to try to exploit what they see
as discrepancies between GOP rhetoric and sub- stance.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Republicans tried to round off the edges of their
position by encouraging adoption (though only for heterosexual
couples) and giving assurances they oppose ``punitive action
against women who have an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the platform unambiguously calls for outlawing all
abortions and appointing federal judges who oppose abortion rights.
Bush favors keeping abortion legal in limited cases and opposes any
litmus tests for judicial appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Republican abortion rights supporters hoped in vain that they
would win changes in the platform language. ``I have since 1976
been hoping we'd come to a point where this wouldn't be an issue,
but I've decided we're never going to reach that point,'' said Jo
Ann Davidson, the speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives and
a member of the platform committee.
</P>
<P>
   Cullman, the leader of the GOP's abortion rights advocates, said
she continues to believe that most Republicans do not feel as
strongly about abortion as the delegates to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complete ban on abortion and the litmus test on judges are
outrageous,'' Cullman said. ``And I didn't hear Governor Bush
remind us that he doesn't have a litmus test.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor, she said, is that a group of undecided voters
who watched Bush's speech under the gaze of Republican pollster
Frank Luntz generally liked what they heard, except for the
speech's segment on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the same proclamation of support for the ``life of the
unborn'' and an end to so-called partial birth abortions drew the
heartiest applause of the night inside the convention hall in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, former presidential candidate Gary Bauer, who
repeatedly attacked Bush for his silence on abortion during the GOP
primary campaign, lavished praise on his former opponent. ``In his
speech, the governor addressed the pro-life message compellingly
and definitively,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Concerning sex education, Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), a surgeon
and co-chairman of the platform committee, failed to make the
platform more moderate.
</P>
<P>
   As approved by the convention, the platform reads, ``We renew
our call for replacing `family planning' programs for teens with
increased funding for abstinence education, which teaches
abstinence until marriage as the responsible and expected standard
of behavior. . . . We oppose school-based clinics that provide
referrals, counseling and related services for contraception and
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Frist sought to omit the references to family planning and
contraception. His committee would not go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wrong,'' said Carolyn Meadows, a delegate from Georgia.
``We have things in our platform that define us from the
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullman, addressing the same topic, said, ``The idea of throwing
out funding for family planning and replacing it with abstinence
only is like having your head in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights was one area in which the Bush campaign would have
preferred less explicit anti-gay language. Again, the social
conservatives on the platform committee carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), who is gay, addressed the
convention, some Texas delegates bowed their heads in prayer, a
silent protest against his presence at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe seized on the awkward moment to explain that his speech
and the protest were evidence of a new inclusiveness in the GOP.

GORE LISTS REASONS FOR PICKING ANY OF THOSE ON SHORT LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Gender, religion, and length of time in office will
not determine his choice of a running mate, Vice President Al Gore
said this weekend, as political analysts, reporters, and even
members of Gore's campaign scrutinized both his short list and his
every utterance for clues.
</P>
<P>
   With just two days remaining until Gore announces his vice
presidential nominee here, a sense of frenzied tension has set in.
Television networks, for example, have dispatched producers to
trail four of the likely candidates, Senators John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, John Edwards of North Carolina, Evan Bayh of
Indiana, and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Telephones at Gore campaign headquarters have been ringing
nonstop with last-minute lobbying by supporters, and queries from
those left off the short list, campaign insiders said. Even a print
shop is on standby, waiting to find out whose name to place on
posters and placards.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the process said that each of the
potential running mates has provided Gore with telephone numbers
where he can be reached. And each has been told to expect a
resolution by Sunday night or early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials insisted Saturday that Gore still had not
made up his mind and that they were not privy to his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, deputy campaign manager for communications, said
Gore has given no indication of his choice, despite a flurry of
speculation in the past couple of days that the vice president is
focusing on Edwards of North Carolina, who has held elective office
for only a year and a half. Saturday, Gore telephoned Edwards,
sources said, though the content of the conversation is not known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's just people doing guesswork that has nothing
to do with what the vice president is doing,'' Fabiani said of all
the whispers.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore himself is partly responsible for fueling the
speculation about Edwards, 47. In an interview with ABC News,
posted on its Web site, the vice president was asked whether length
of time in office would be a factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Washington experience is the only experience
that's relevant to leadership and to this country,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He was also asked if the nation is ready for a woman vice
president. ``Oh, of course,'' Gore said. Although New Hampshire
Governor Jeanne Shaheen has been mentioned as a running mate,
campaign officials have acknowledged she is not likely to be
picked, and Shaheen herself has said she would not accept.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also asked if a Jewish candidate, such as Lieberman,
would face prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those old distinctions and categories matter
these days, the way they did in the past,'' Gore said. ``I think
we've grown as a nation. I think we've grown beyond that kind of
attitude. I think that the day is coming when that'll be completely
irrelevant in all of our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the media frenzy was directed at Edwards Saturday,
Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz, returned to Washington from
Ketchum, Idaho, only to be met by a network television crew and
reporters. Kerry had spent the last week at their vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   As he loaded up their Lexus SUV with luggage, Kerry was asked if
he had been told when to expect a phone call from Gore. ``No,
absolutely, I don't know more than you do,'' he said, before
heading to Georgetown for the night, and then leaving for Boston on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore spent the day in Washington Saturday,
speaking to a convention of the National Association of Police
Organizations before flying off to the Hamptons for a Democratic
party fund-raiser featuring actor Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after celebrating the birthday of his daughter
Karenna, Gore will travel to Nashville, where he is expected to
meet with his senior campaign officials. On Tuesday, Gore plans to
introduce his running mate at the downtown War Memorial Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Gore currently is trailing Texas Governor George W. Bush in the
polls by double digits. Many Americans tend to focus on the
election during the political conventions, the debates, and when a
running mate is selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first significant decision that people are going to
see them make as a presidential candidate,'' said Joel K.
Goldstein, author of ``The Modern American Vice Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a bad job of deciding, if you put somebody out there
who is shown to have all sorts of weaknesses,'' Goldstein said,
``or you pick somebody for all sorts of political reasons, it
creates a negative image of the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the candidate chosen to run for vice president will
be so extraordinary that it will help Gore whittle down Bush's lead
is unlikely, said Bill McInturff, a pollster who worked on Senator
John McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most normal people have not heard of any of these people the
Democrats are considering,'' McInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bush campaign, officials were nonchalant: ``Whoever it
is, we're running against Al Gore,'' said Ari Fleischer, Bush's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckman reported from Nashville and Milligan from Washington,
D.C. Glen Johnson, Anne E. Kornblut, and Walter V. Robinson, all of
the Globe staff, contributed to this report.

GORE LISTS REASONS FOR PICKING ANY OF THOSE ON SHORT LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Gender, religion, and length of time in office will
not determine his choice of a running mate, Vice President Al Gore
said this weekend, as political analysts, reporters, and even
members of Gore's campaign scrutinized both his short list and his
every utterance for clues.
</P>
<P>
   With just two days remaining until Gore announces his vice
presidential nominee here, a sense of frenzied tension has set in.
Television networks, for example, have dispatched producers to
trail four of the likely candidates, Senators John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, John Edwards of North Carolina, Evan Bayh of
Indiana, and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Telephones at Gore campaign headquarters have been ringing
nonstop with last-minute lobbying by supporters, and queries from
those left off the short list, campaign insiders said. Even a print
shop is on standby, waiting to find out whose name to place on
posters and placards.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the process said that each of the
potential running mates has provided Gore with telephone numbers
where he can be reached. And each has been told to expect a
resolution by Sunday night or early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials insisted Saturday that Gore still had not
made up his mind and that they were not privy to his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, deputy campaign manager for communications, said
Gore has given no indication of his choice, despite a flurry of
speculation in the past couple of days that the vice president is
focusing on Edwards of North Carolina, who has held elective office
for only a year and a half. Saturday, Gore telephoned Edwards,
sources said, though the content of the conversation is not known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's just people doing guesswork that has nothing
to do with what the vice president is doing,'' Fabiani said of all
the whispers.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore himself is partly responsible for fueling the
speculation about Edwards, 47. In an interview with ABC News,
posted on its Web site, the vice president was asked whether length
of time in office would be a factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Washington experience is the only experience
that's relevant to leadership and to this country,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He was also asked if the nation is ready for a woman vice
president. ``Oh, of course,'' Gore said. Although New Hampshire
Governor Jeanne Shaheen has been mentioned as a running mate,
campaign officials have acknowledged she is not likely to be
picked, and Shaheen herself has said she would not accept.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also asked if a Jewish candidate, such as Lieberman,
would face prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those old distinctions and categories matter
these days, the way they did in the past,'' Gore said. ``I think
we've grown as a nation. I think we've grown beyond that kind of
attitude. I think that the day is coming when that'll be completely
irrelevant in all of our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the media frenzy was directed at Edwards Saturday,
Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz, returned to Washington from
Ketchum, Idaho, only to be met by a network television crew and
reporters. Kerry had spent the last week at their vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   As he loaded up their Lexus SUV with luggage, Kerry was asked if
he had been told when to expect a phone call from Gore. ``No,
absolutely, I don't know more than you do,'' he said, before
heading to Georgetown for the night, and then leaving for Boston on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore spent the day in Washington Saturday,
speaking to a convention of the National Association of Police
Organizations before flying off to the Hamptons for a Democratic
party fund-raiser featuring actor Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after celebrating the birthday of his daughter
Karenna, Gore will travel to Nashville, where he is expected to
meet with his senior campaign officials. On Tuesday, Gore plans to
introduce his running mate at the downtown War Memorial Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Gore currently is trailing Texas Governor George W. Bush in the
polls by double digits. Many Americans tend to focus on the
election during the political conventions, the debates, and when a
running mate is selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first significant decision that people are going to
see them make as a presidential candidate,'' said Joel K.
Goldstein, author of ``The Modern American Vice Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a bad job of deciding, if you put somebody out there
who is shown to have all sorts of weaknesses,'' Goldstein said,
``or you pick somebody for all sorts of political reasons, it
creates a negative image of the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the candidate chosen to run for vice president will
be so extraordinary that it will help Gore whittle down Bush's lead
is unlikely, said Bill McInturff, a pollster who worked on Senator
John McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most normal people have not heard of any of these people the
Democrats are considering,'' McInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bush campaign, officials were nonchalant: ``Whoever it
is, we're running against Al Gore,'' said Ari Fleischer, Bush's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckman reported from Nashville and Milligan from Washington,
D.C. Glen Johnson, Anne E. Kornblut, and Walter V. Robinson, all of
the Globe staff, contributed to this report.

UNITED CANCELS 156 FLIGHTS AS PILOT SHORTAGE DISRUPTS THE AIRLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A shortage of pilots forced United Airlines to cancel 16 percent
of its flights at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago Saturday,
creating a wave of delays across the country that inconvenienced
thousands of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellations, involving 156 flights, created one of the
more serious disruptions in service since April, when United's
contract with its 10,000 pilots expired and many refused to fly
overtime in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's difficulties were particularly surprising because
United had already reduced its schedule of flights by more than 2
percent to ensure that it would have enough pilots.
</P>
<P>
   A United spokesman, Chris Brathwaite, blamed much of the problem
on the weather. Heavy rains and thunderstorms over the last week
had caused delays across the country, Brathwaite said, forcing many
pilots to use up the hours they are legally allowed to be on the
job and leading to Saturday's crew shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a domino effect,'' he said. ``We are doing as
much as we have control over to make sure that people get the kind
of service that they expect.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Associations could not be
reached Saturday, but in the past, the union has said that it is
not involved in any concerted job action, which would be illegal
under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Individual pilots have said in interviews that there is an
unspoken agreement among many of their peers not to volunteer for
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare is United's biggest hub, so the disruption there rippled
through the system.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Carter, a psychologist and textbook editor in Pagosa
Springs, Colo., was trying to fly to Washington, D.C., to escape
the wildfires in her state.
</P>
<P>
   Carter got as far as Chicago only to find that her flight to
Washington had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm plenty frustrated,'' she said, standing at the end of a
long customer service line. ``I may just go get a hotel because I'm
tired and hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Although United pared its schedule by 4,800 flights between May
and August, and it has taken nearly 2,000 more flights out of the
September schedule, there may be additional reductions, Brathwaite
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that there would probably be more delays Sunday. He
recommended that passengers call ahead, check United's Web site,
and ``exercise patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Full planes and severe thunderstorms have strained the country's
air traffic control system, leading to record numbers of delays
this summer. But United, the world's largest carrier, has been hurt
far worse than others. Its flights arrived on time only 57 percent
of the time in May, the last month for which statistics are
available, and it has had a record number of cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its pilots, United is negotiating a new contract
with its mechanics, baggage handlers and gate agents, who are
represented by the International Association of Machinists. The
machinists and the pilots took deep wage cuts in 1994 in exchange
for a majority of the stock in UAL Corp., United's parent.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the airline was struggling, but it has since
recorded several years of record profits. Both unions said their
members were promised generous contracts when the old ones expired.
They accused UAL management of going back on its word.
</P>
<P>
   United executives have said they are committed to reaching an
``industry-leading'' contract with the pilots and the machinists.

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The corporate suits love Lenny Krayzelburg's
story.
</P>
<P>
   It's a magical tale, though with no muggles, mind you, or
whomping willows. As a kid, he escaped the Dark Side _ in this
case, th Union before the Cold War was in full thaw _ with his
parents and younger sister and settled in the Los Angeles area _
West Hollywood and then Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming was his means of assimilation. Like Harry Potter, he
exhibited special powers, in the backstroke, and was carried by an
incantational current from Fairfax High to Santa Monica College to
USC.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he swam as if under the spell of some magical
powder, setting world records in the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes
at pool in Sydney where the 2000 Olympics will be next month.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Krayzelburg and the Sorcerer's Sponsors? The corporate
suits in the boardrooms up and down Madison Avenue were smitten.
</P>
<P>
   Seven companies have signed Krayzelburg to guaranteed contracts,
including Kellogg's, which will unveil boxes of Crispix cereal with
the 6-foot-2 swimmer gracing the front this month.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer Krayzelburg has collected what amounts to a
hefty advance for the next chapter of his story.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz is that it's going to move people to tears and cheers.
The wave of expectation appears nowhere close to cresting.
Krayzelburg hasn't qualified for the U.S. team yet and already some
people have pegged him the Mary Lou Retton of the millennium Games.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, who will compete this week at the U.S. Olympic Swim
Trials in Indianapolis, is under the starter's gun, begging the
question: Can he deliver as advertised, or will he succumb to
wizard's block?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good question,'' Krayzelburg said the other day,
leaning back on the bleachers at the USC Olympic Swim Stadium after
a two-hour practice. ``It's really scary to think if I don't do
well, what do you say to all the people you'll feel like you've let
down?''
</P>
<P>
   !dtpost!qqq!dtpost!
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg, 24, never envisioned his story taking this latest
twist.
</P>
<P>
   Really, it would have required an imagination more more vivid
than J.K. Rowling's to picture a child born into Communism growing
up to become a polished jewel of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly didn't seem possible that swimming would set his
family free financially in his high school days, when Krayzelburg
uncomplainingly cut back on his training so he could work longer
hours as a lifeguard at the Westside Jewish Community Center to
help his parents, Oleg and Yelena, make ends meet. They had
emigrated to the U.S. from Odessa, Ukraine, in 1989, when
Krayzelburg was 13.
</P>
<P>
   The humble beginnings of his new life in the United States
steeled Krayzelburg. His adolescence in southern California
innoculated him against the adult disease of material greed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, when the offers and opportunities began pouring in,
Mark Schubert, Krayzelburg's coach at Trojan Swim Club and the U.S.
men's Olympic coach, sat the swimmer down.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I told him,'' Schubert said, ``is not to let
the external pressures take over his life this year. And his
primary focus really has been no different than it ever was. He's
maybe done the best job of anybody I've coached of following
advice. A lot of times I've asked him to say 'no' to things and he
has.''
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg is in demand for the same reason actor Heath Ledger
is; he walks into a room and without meaning to he commands perfect
strangers to pay attention to him. The humble swimmer crammed as
many speaking engagements and commercial spots into his schedule as
Schubert would allow. But you should know this: He also squeezed in
aerobic spinning classes.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make your head spin, just knowing that the man
whose legs propelled him to a place no swimmer had ever gone in the
backstroke believed his lower body could stand to be stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Success and minor celebrity, it would seem, have yet to spoil
Krayzelburg. Former USC swimming great John Naber will second that
notion. A few months ago, Naber called Krayzelburg and invited him
to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, 23 years before Krayzelburg became the first
backstroker to swim faster than 1 minute, 56 seconds in the 200
meters with his world-record clocking of 1:55.87, Naber was the
first swimmer to break the magical two-minute barrier in the event.
Naber won four gold medals and one silver at the 1976 Olympics in
Montreal, then became the darling of corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it worked back then; the Olympic gold medals were
in the bank before you cashed in on them.
</P>
<P>
   Naber remembered the pressures to perform that weighed so
heavily on him in Montreal and the commercial pressures that tugged
at him afterward. He couldn't imagine handling both those stresses
at once without feeling like a swimsuit wrung out and then hung out
to dry.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to make sure Krayzelburg's form was holding up OK,
that he wasn't coming apart at the seams. When they sat down to
lunch, Naber knew before he had decided what to eat that he didn't
have to worry about Krayzelburg. The kid was all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine the multiplication factor of the pressure he's
dealing with, taking money in advance of doing well at the
Olympics,'' Naber said from his office in Pasadena. ``In some cases
it can be too much pressure to put on an athlete. But of all the
people to handle that pressure, Lenny's personality is ideally
suited for it. His sense of self-worth has never been determined by
the time on a stopwatch. He appreciates the beauty of the sport.
Because of his groundedness, he's safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call him the smiling cobra,'' Naber added, ``because he
makes you feel so happy and joyous inside and then he uncoils and,
bam, does something remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   !dtpost!qqq!dtpost!
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Krayzelburg didn't lose a backstroke race. Not in
workout, where his training partners include 1996 Olympic 200
backstroke champion Brad Bridgewater, or at any meet. Then at the
Janet Evans Invitational last month on his home turf, Krayzelburg
was beaten in the 200 backstroke by Aaron Peirsol, a rising senior
at Newport Harbor High who trains with Irvine Novaquatics.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg was naturally disappointed that he finished second,
but he didn't get down. He knew how hard he had trained in the days
leading up to the meet. He didn't lose sight of the fact his whole
season has been geared toward a peak performance in September.
Krayzelburg's father Oleg, however, was a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Yelena Krayzelburg later told her son that at the end of the
race, Oleg, who was sitting alongside his wife in the USC Swim
Stadium bleachers, ``was as white as a piece of paper. He was in
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, the corporate suits probably were a little pale
themselves. They haven't invested beaucoup bucks in Krayzelburg,
after all, to see him lose to a 17-year-old so close to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter to them that Peirsol reminds a lot of swimming
insiders of Krayzelburg four years ago; Peirsol is not the person
an NBC producer deposited in a prime Staples Center seat during the
Lakers' postseason march to the NBA title (the television cameras
then conveniently ``found'' Krayzelburg _ an avid Lakers fan, as it
so happens _ during commercial breaks as a way of promoting the
network's upcoming Olympics coverage).
</P>
<P>
   Peirsol is not the marketing world's winning lottery ticket;
Krayzelburg is.
</P>
<P>
   In Harry Potter's world, Krayzelburg could use his charm to
shield himself from the external forces that could sink him. In
lieu of that, Krayzelburg is using common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like two different worlds,'' he said. ``There's
the swimming world where I feel in complete control. And there's
the marketing world where they're trying to create an image that I
have no power over. All I can do is try to focus on the things that
have gotten me to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   !dtpost!qqq!dtpost!
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg nearly arrived on the Olympic scene early enough to
crash a couple parties. At the 1996 Olympic Trials in Indianapolis,
he shaved two seconds off his best time in the 200 backstroke
during the preliminaries and was the second-fastest qualifier for
the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody expected him to secure one of the two Olympic berths,
least of all himself. Krayzelburg had raced as fast as he could
from the start in his morning swim and was in terrible pain
afterward. So he decided to swim the first part of his race that
night a little slower. He eased his way right out of contention,
finishing fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg was too wet behind the ears to know he should have
been seriously bummed to have been left home from Atlanta after
coming so close to making the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand the magnitude of what I had done,''
Krayzelburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he gets it. He knows how much is on the line.
He understands his life might be on the verge of another sea
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to get crazier depending on how well I do at
Trials,'' Krayzelburg said. ``I can promise you one thing. No
matter what happens, it's not going to change me. I've always been
able to keep things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving your homeland for an unfamiliar place has a way of
grounding a person. Krayzelburg appreciates that his life already
has undergone a dramatic transformation. The way he sees it,
whatever happens from here is sunshine on his shoulders.

REDS HAVE THEMSELVES IN BETTER FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; While it could take years to figure out which trade turns out
to be the best one made before the trading deadline, it's fairly
simple to decide Cincinnati's decision to trade lefty Denny Neagle
to the Yankees at the All-Star break was the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, like the Reds about now couldn't use a veteran left-handed
starter with playoff experience and nasty stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Reds general manager Jim Bowden was criticized for giving up on
the season too early because Cincinnati had fallen 10 games behind
front-running St. Louis in the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   But there was half a season left and Mark McGwire's knee was
acting up. Now, the Reds have closed the gap to five games, McGwire
might not play for another month, if at all this season, and the
Cardinals are sputtering terribly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if today was Sept. 1, we'd still feel good about our
position,'' said Reds right-hander Pete Harnisch. ``So I think
we're in a decent spot now. Everybody feels pretty good for the
first time all year. I think things are a little upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' recent hot streak has also quelled rumors about
manager Jack McKeon's job being on the line.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears even shortstop Barry Larkin, who nixed a deal
with the Mets and then signed a three-year extension with the Reds
during a wacky weekend two weeks ago, is managing to coexist with
McKeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think earlier in the season, when we dropped 10 games
behind, one of the reasons for that was we weren't focusing on what
we had to do,'' Larkin said. ``We were more concerned about where
we were in the standings behind the Cardinals. We let a lot of
games get away from us because we may have been scoreboard-watching
a little too much. A lot of the talk in the clubhouse was about the
Cardinals as opposed to the teams we were playing in that
particular series. We talked about that. We're refocused.''

   &UR; __  &LR; Schilling's impact: Not only does the acquisition of
right-hander Curt Schilling give Arizona the best one-two punch in
baseball in the starting rotation, but it also puts the
Diamondbacks in a wonderful position should they meet Atlanta in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling shut out the Braves 2-0 Wednesday in his home debut,
marking the fourth straight time he's beaten Greg Maddux. He's also
6-2 with a 2.54 ERA in his last eight starts against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Home and away: Colorado manager Buddy Bell got the chance
to chat with former Rockies manager Don Baylor, now managing the
Chicago Cubs, at Wrigley Field during the week. Among the topics of
conversation was how well the Rockies hit at home. &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . And how
horrid they are away.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Jeff Cirillo is a perfect example. He came into
the season batting .309 at home and .306 on the road in his career,
and he's hitting .421 at home and .202 on the road this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most frustrating thing about managing there,''
Baylor said. ``You're on the mountain top when you're at home.
Everybody's hitting, but it's so draining when you leave that
place. Then when you go on the road, it's like, 'Where's my hits?
Where's my runs?' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies are hitting .233 and averaging 3.47 runs on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy's not the only guy who was frustrated by it,'' Baylor
said. ``I was in Atlanta last year. Their pitching staff didn't
want any part of Coors Field. They were all nervous. (Pitching
coach) Leo (Mazzone) was double-rocking over there in the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Courting Kendall: Pittsburgh continues to try to sign
catcher Jason Kendall to a long-term deal as the club gets ready to
enter a new stadium next season, but discussions aren't going well.

<P>
   The Pirates signed John Vander Wal and Mike Benjamin to two-year
contracts this week, but general manager Cam Bonifay remains
frustrated about Kendall's situation. Kendall is under contract
next season, but he recently rejected a six-year, $60 million offer
because $23 million of it was deferred.

 &HT;    Labonte's move wins Brickyard
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Brickyard 400 is considered one of the most
prestigious Winston Cup races of the season. Darrell Waltrip
referred to Indianapolis Motor Speedway as the ``holy land'' this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, stock-car racing on the world's most famous track
is sometimes dull. Kyle Petty said there has never been a ``good
race'' in the seven-year existence of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte won the Brickyard 400 on Saturday. The one
tantalizing moment of driving in the entire 160-lap race, which
turned out to be a one-on-one duel between Labonte and Rusty
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a thrill,'' Labonte said. ``We've been close a
couple of times (in the past). The car was flawless. We only
adjusted air pressure all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had the strongest car in the field _ leading 110 total
laps _ until the No. 2 Ford became difficult to steer late in the
race. With 15 laps remaining, Wallace's car went up five inches
higher than normal in the fourth turn, allowing Labonte to make a
bid to pass inside.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a drag race down the front stretch, with
Labonte's right front bumper making contact with the left rear end
of Wallace's car. By the first turn of lap 147, Labonte had cleared
Wallace, essentially clinching his first Brickyard victory.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last of nine lead changes at IMS, which has narrow
lanes and is known for being extremely tough for stock cars to pass
each other. There was relatively little side-by-side racing, with
the field scattered over the 2.5-mile track for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard to pass here,'' Labonte said. ``I wasn't sure
(passing Wallace) was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, the biggest story of the weekend by qualifying for the
No. 2 start position, dropped to seventh by the completion of the
first lap. Ricky Rudd, the pole sitter, finished 21st.
</P>
<P>
   The most exciting moments happened after the race. Labonte
pumped his fist excitedly for the fans during the cool-down lap.
When he steered the No. 18 Pontiac down pit road, he braked in
front of his bother's pit box.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte sat out the race with dizziness and missed his
first Winston Cup start since 1979. The elder Labonte watched from
the pit box during the race, and saw replacement driver Todd Bodine
steer the No. 5 Chevrolet to a respectable 15th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points leader Bobby Labonte increased his advantage
from 53 points to 87 in the standings.

REDS HAVE THEMSELVES IN BETTER FOCUS

<P>
   &LR; While it could take years to figure out which trade turns out
to be the best one made before the trading deadline, it's fairly
simple to decide Cincinnati's decision to trade lefty Denny Neagle
to the Yankees at the All-Star break was the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, like the Reds about now couldn't use a veteran left-handed
starter with playoff experience and nasty stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Reds general manager Jim Bowden was criticized for giving up on
the season too early because Cincinnati had fallen 10 games behind
front-running St. Louis in the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   But there was half a season left and Mark McGwire's knee was
acting up. Now, the Reds have closed the gap to five games, McGwire
might not play for another month, if at all this season, and the
Cardinals are sputtering terribly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if today was Sept. 1, we'd still feel good about our
position,'' said Reds right-hander Pete Harnisch. ``So I think
we're in a decent spot now. Everybody feels pretty good for the
first time all year. I think things are a little upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' recent hot streak has also quelled rumors about
manager Jack McKeon's job being on the line.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears even shortstop Barry Larkin, who nixed a deal
with the Mets and then signed a three-year extension with the Reds
during a wacky weekend two weeks ago, is managing to coexist with
McKeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think earlier in the season, when we dropped 10 games
behind, one of the reasons for that was we weren't focusing on what
we had to do,'' Larkin said. ``We were more concerned about where
we were in the standings behind the Cardinals. We let a lot of

TO LOS ANGELES VIA NASHVILLE, TO PICK UP VOTES AND A RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change dateline, add fund-raisers in Hamptons) 
By JAMES DAO with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTHAMPTON, N.Y. _ In the days leading to the Democratic
convention, Vice President Al Gore plans to tour several important
battleground states, from Georgia to Pennsylvania to Michigan,
hammering at the emerging themes of his campaign: that the
presidential election will be about substance versus flash and new
ideas against old, his aides said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In separate appearances with Southern Democratic governors,
President Clinton and his soon-to-be-announced running mate, Gore
will focus on a different issue each day, including welfare, Social
Security, health care and the economy, seeking to draw sharp
differences in style and policy with his Republican rival, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tour will offer a striking contrast to the Bush
campaign's approach of image rather than issues, photo-ops rather
than substance,'' Gore's press secretary, Chris Lehane, said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Going the Distance Tour,'' as the Gore campaign has dubbed
it, will begin on Tuesday in Nashville, when the vice president
will appear for the first time with his running mate. It will end
on Tuesday, Aug. 15, in Michigan when Gore stands
shoulder-to-shoulder with Clinton for a symbolic passing of the
party's leadership torch.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will arrive at the convention in Los Angeles the next day,
and will accept the party's nomination the night of Thursday, Aug.
17. Clinton is scheduled to address the convention on Monday night
and then leave the next day, effectively clearing the stage for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has previewed many of the themes he plans to
emphasize during his tour in speeches over the past two days. The
tour is also intended to highlight Gore's biography, and Saturday
in remarks before the National Association of Police Organizations
in Washington, he talked extensively about his time as an Army
reporter in Vietnam and as a police reporter for The Nashville
Tennessean newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the group that he would push for ``common sense'' laws
to keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals. He noted
that in Congress, he had supported bills banning so-called
cop-killer bullets and plastic guns. In doing that, he drew an
implicit contrast with Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, who voted
against both bills while a congressman from Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president heralded the administration's efforts to help
police departments hire 100,000 new officers, and said he would
push for money to hire 50,000 more. He also said he would fight to
allow officers to carry their weapons while off-duty and for a
constitutional amendment guaranteeing victims the right to be heard
at criminal proceedings involving their attackers.
</P>
<P>
   The police group, which endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticket in
1996, has not decided whom to support this year. But in introducing
Gore Saturday, the group's president, Thomas J. Scotto, warmly
praised Gore, saying the group has had a relationship with the
White House that ``is probably the envy of all other law
enforcement groups and politicians throughout this country.''
</P>
<P>
   From Washington, Gore flew here to spend the weekend on Long
Island attending three fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued to hold any vice-presidential decision close to
the vest. When he landed Saturday afternoon at Suffolk County
Airport, reporters asked him if he was close to making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about two and a half days away from it now,'' he said,
stating the obvious, since he has imposed a deadline on himself for
an announcement at noon on Tuesday. ``That's pretty close.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was attending two fund-raisers Saturday night for the
Democratic National Committee. He raised $250,000 at a fund-raiser
sponsored by Scott Bessent, a hedge-fund manager, and Will Trinkle,
a real estate developer, from about 100 people, many of them
homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   At a later dinner, he raised $1 million from about 100 people at
the home of Craig Hatkoff, a real estate developer, and Jane
Rosenthal, a film producer who, with the actor Robert De Niro,
founded the Tribeca Film Center. Entertainment was provided by the
Bangles.
</P>
<P>
   Other guests at the events included Christie Brinkley, the
model; Andrew Tobias, the author; Charles Nolan, the designer; and
John Sykes, president of VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a fund-raiser here, Ed Rendell, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, chatted with reporters about Gore's
vice-presidential selection. He said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut would be ``a bold and courageous choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell also said William S. Cohen, the Republican who is
secretary of defense, would have been the candidate if he had not
announced that was voting for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   From Long Island, Gore heads to Nashville on Sunday afternoon to
prepare for the announcement of his vice presidential pick on
Tuesday. He will travel on Wednesday with his running mate to
Carthage, Tenn., Gore's hometown. They will hold a town hall
meeting at the Carthage elementary school with about 150 Tennessee
residents, many of whom will reminisce about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   From there, they will travel to the home state of the vice
presidential candidate. Speculation is narrowing to three
Democratic senators _ John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Edwards of
North Carolina, and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore and his running mate will go to Atlanta for a
meeting with Southern governors and a discussion on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it is on to the Philadelphia suburbs for an event
with working women. On Saturday, they will travel to western
Pennsylvania and the girlhood home of the late Rachel Carson, the
environmental advocate and author of ``Silent Spring,'' a book that
Gore says strongly influenced him.
</P>
<P>
   Next Sunday, Gore plans to discuss children's health care at
University Hospital in Cleveland. On Monday, Aug. 14, the day the
Democratic convention opens, Gore will be in Independence, Mo.,
home of Harry S. Truman, where he will discuss issues involving
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, will
speak at the convention. Gore will meet Clinton on Tuesday at an
as-yet-undesignated spot in Michigan, a crucial state, where they
will showcase the nation's economic expansion and try to highlight
Gore's role in the prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Gore will fly to Los Angeles, where his running
mate will be nominated. Thursday night, Gore gives his acceptance
speech and flies out that night to the Midwest, where he will begin
a four-day boat trip across the Great Lakes and down the
Mississippi River.

FORGOTTEN, OLD TREES GET ATTENTION FROM MODERN-DAY NATURE-LOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO, Kan. _ You say ``old-growth forest,'' and you think of
towering sequoias in the mists of West Coast mountains, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, how about old-growth forests in Kansas?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Southeastern Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas all have a
belt of virgin timber, some of it older than our nation.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? The trees _ cedars going back 500 years, post oak
and blackjack 300 years plus _ were deemed so marginal for use that
settlers initially largely ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   And they have been ignored until recently, because as far as
trees go, well, they're not pretty _ gnarled, twisted and short.
The weather and the rocky sandstone soil they grow in aren't
exactly hospitable.
</P>
<P>
   But the trees now have caught the eyes of nature lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Two fingers of the old trees extend into Kansas on the
Chautauqua Hills. By next spring a 1.5-mile walking trail will
snake along the north shore of Toronto Lake here so visitors can
see them and the land they inhabit, as pristine as before white men
came.
</P>
<P>
   The trail will be called the Ancient Trees of the Chautauqua
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to see the trees,'' said Doyle Niemeyer, a Kansas
Department of Wildlife and Parks manager. ``That's what the trail
will do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chautauqua Hills contain a small part of what once was a
35,000-square-mile belt of matted, tangled undergrowth and old
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The post oak and blackjack dominated, but there were cedars,
white and red oak, hickory and pecan, walnut and elm, shinnery
(dwarf oak) and hackberry. And, of course, the all-encompassing
briars. The trees and brush went from roughly where Dallas is now,
through Oklahoma and into Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The area was called the Cross Timbers, a physical barrier
between the woodland and plains Indian tribes that marked the
separation of the bluestem grasses to the east and the buffalo
prairie to the west, and caused Joblike tribulations for the first
whites trekking west.
</P>
<P>
   Once part of what now is Oklahoma was opened to white
settlement, settlers began to clear the Cross Timbers. By the start
of the 20th century, close to 80 percent of it had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of tie-cutters for the railroads in this part
of the country,'' said Niemeyer. ``But they left some, mainly on
the steep slopes above the rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   With civilization, the Cross Timbers area was largely forgotten.
The remaining trees didn't look old. They were rarely more than 30
feet tall. They didn't stand in groves. Their often-distorted
shapes could be passed off to lightning, ice storms or fires.
</P>
<P>
   How the Cross Timbers area came to modern-day attention starts
with, of all people, Sir Walter Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh _ courtier, adventurer, soldier and writer _ in the
1580s was also a sponsor of a colony in what would become North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   A relief expedition sent to resupply the colony discovered that
the settlers had vanished. Since then the Lost Colony of Roanoke
has been a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? In the early 1990s, David W. Stahle, a geoscience
professor at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, postulated
that the settlers might have died of drought-caused starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Stahle is a dendrochronologist, meaning he studies tree rings,
which are an accurate gauge of climatic conditions in a given year
because the thickness of the rings varies with soil moisture.
</P>
<P>
   By examining rings from old trees near Roanoke, Stahle found
that the worst drought in North America in the last 800 years
occurred around the time the colony was started. No rain meant no
crops, said Stahle, likely a fatal combination for the colonists.
</P>
<P>
   Being a scientist, Stahle had another question. Had the drought
occurred all over the country? To determine that he had to find old
trees, a difficult chore, because in the last 200 years settlers
had cut most of them down.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came on the wall of his office, on a map by A.W.
Kuchler, a professor of geography at the University of Kansas who
died in 1999 at age 91.
</P>
<P>
   From 1950 to 1977, Kuchler worked on various versions of the map
showing the vegetation of North America before Europeans came. The
largest hardwood forest, he found, extended southward from the
Missouri Bootheel to the Gulf of Mexico before being cut down.
</P>
<P>
   On the map, a small part was labeled ``Cross Timbers.'' A few
old trees might be on some of the slopes there, Stahle bet.
</P>
<P>
   Stahle and Matthew D. Therrell, a fellow dendrochronologist,
started taking test borings. They confirmed that the Roanoke
drought was confined to the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   They also were amazed at the number of old trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found 20-acre tracts, 40-acre tracts, even bigger,'' said
Stahle. ``Stuff that had never been touched and that had been
growing since well before the Revolutionary War and even farther
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, the word got out. In the middle of the country
were old-growth forests. And conservationists were determined to
keep them intact.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Chris Wilson, is conservation director for a Nature
Conservancy project called the Keystone Ancient Cross Timbers
Preserve, just west of Sand Springs, Okla. The preserve, which
should have its trails open by 2001, contains almost 1,400 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pristine,'' he said, the largest known intact remnant of
the Cross Timbers. ``It's never been touched except for some oil
exploration on top the bluffs. It's a whole forest ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   Saving the tract is akin to preserving the last vestiges of
unbroken prairie near Pawhuska, Okla., and near Cottonwood Falls,
said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Stahle is upbeat about the Keystone preserve but worried about
the other old trees that have survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got chip mills on the Oklahoma-Arkansas border now,'' he
said. ``Those trees could be attractive to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just see it _ chip mills turning those old post oaks
into paper and then some environmental magazine printed on that
paper wailing about chip mills and the loss of old-growth forest.''

<P>
   The 10-year-old can fall silent when asked about her goal as a
musician, but then suddenly exclaim: ``To become a spectacular
violinist.''
</P>
<P>
   But the complexity of Miran's personality is not obvious until
she picks up her three-quarter-sized Palliot fiddle from Paris. The
pensive girl with hair pulled back is instantly transformed into a
poised, determined young woman. With concentration focused
razor-sharp, she rips through concertos by Bruch and Mendelssohn.
</P>
<P>
   What strikes the ear is the expressive quality of her playing.
Although many would-be wunderkinder race through concertos as loud
and as fast as possible, Miran's music-making is earnest, restless,
striving.
</P>
<P>
   Lately her practice sessions have a new sense of purpose. Miran
is preparing to take a giant step: to New York, and the Pre-College
Division of the Juilliard School of Music there.
</P>
<P>
   Miran's selection to attend the world-renown school has thrilled
the family, but it has created apprehensions about how the
instruction will affect their future.
</P>
<P>
   Miran, who lives in Overland Park, Kan., with her parents and
3-year-old sister, Minna, says she is rarely ruffled by an
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Performing is just playing in front of people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in May, when she auditioned for admittance to Juilliard, she
was terrified as she stood before a jury of some of the most astute
violin teachers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   These titans must have been impressed. Miran, who will be a
sixth-grader this fall at Barstow School, was one of 18 students
accepted into Juilliard's youth violin program from a field of
nearly 150.
</P>
<P>
   She has been placed in the class of Dorothy DeLay and her
associate, Hyo Kang. DeLay has taught many leading violinists,
including Itzhak Perlman, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Midori, Gil
Shaham and Sarah Chang.
</P>
<P>
   Rarefied air for a girl barely 4 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be wonderful exposure for her,'' said Paul
Kantor, Miran's summer teacher at the Aspen Music Festival and
School in Colorado. ``When you go to a place like Juilliard, you
really get a sense for what the world standard is.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this Juilliard euphoria stand two parents facing big
decisions. Should mother and daughter fly to New York every weekend
of the school year? Should the entire family move to New York?
Should the parents borrow money to pay for a future that is
anything but ensured?
</P>
<P>
   Despite financial help from relatives, last year the Kims sold
their Overland Park home and moved into a duplex nearby, which they
are renting until they determine how to orchestrate Miran's
education. Already the costs associated with the girl's violins,
her lessons (at $75 an hour) and the mother-daughter trips to Aspen
each summer (five weeks in June and July) are creating financial
stress.
</P>
<P>
   Juilliard's pre-college program takes place on 30 Saturdays from
late August through May. The annual tuition is $5,000, and airfare
for two and a weekend in a New York hotel could easily cost the
family $1,000 a week. And that's if they don't eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got the good news, I got a big headache,'' said
Miran's father, Sung-Chul Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is considering moving the family, or at least part of it, to
New York, which raises the biggest question of all: How much should
a parent sacrifice for the sake of a gifted child _ or, indeed, for
any child?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no limit,'' said Kim, 43, who owns a small discount
clothing store in Kansas City, Kan. ``If there's a limit, then
that's not a father's love.''
Film music
</P>
<P>
   Miran's musical ``career'' began simply enough: One evening the
Kims brought their 3-year-old daughter home from a movie and were
surprised when she went to the piano and pecked out the theme music
from the film.
</P>
<P>
   Dong-Yeong Kim, an artist herself (she recently completed a
degree at the Kansas City Art Institute), immediately recognized a
spark of talent. She enrolled Miran in the Suzuki Strings at Ottawa
(Kan.) University, where the girl quickly took to the
one-tenth-sized violin she received.
</P>
<P>
   By age 4, Miran was playing in concerts at the Suzuki school.
Seeing rapid progress, the family sought out former Kansas City
Symphony concertmaster Tiberius Klausner as her teacher and later
Elizabeth Suh, a former member of the London Symphony Orchestra who
now teaches in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very, very gifted,'' Klausner said of Miran, adding that
it had been awhile since he had heard her play.
</P>
<P>
   That can be remedied next Sunday when Miran performs her first
full-length recital. It will be at 3 p.m. in White Hall at the
University of Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you get to Carnegie Hall? Well, yes, you practice, as
the old saw suggests. Miran practices one to three hours every day
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Attending Juilliard helps you get to Carnegie Hall, too. One of
the best preparations for a music career is the school's
Pre-College Division.
</P>
<P>
   Miran is both excited and intimidated by the thought of being
thrown together with such talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of competitive spirit there,'' Miran said. ``But
it will just make me want to work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miran is like a jewel, which must be shaped,'' said Klausner,
``and this is the time the jeweler can shape it into a diamond.''
`Into the music'
</P>
<P>
   Miran's technique is strong _ rapid passagework flows easily
through her short fingers _ though her teachers are working on
technical problems ranging from an awkward bow grip to a drooping
posture.
</P>
<P>
   Among the violinists she admires are Maxim Vengerov and Joshua
Bell, ``because they sound like they're really into the music and
not just into the notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Miran says she will not be content merely to become a member of
a major orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be a soloist,'' she said. ``You get more
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that classical music is her only focus. Her love of field
hockey, in-line roller-skating, bicycling and swimming is almost
matched by her devotion to Britney Spears and 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of kids who play music and don't have any
life,'' her mother said. ``We want to avoid that.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves literature; she loves art; she loves school. I want
her to have a normal education.''
</P>
<P>
   At Juilliard, this might not be entirely possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a regular school, with an important difference,''
said Andrew Thomas, director of the Pre-College Division since
1994. ``That the bell curve is askew. It's way up at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had kids come into the office in tears because they got
an A in a class instead of an A-plus. They are driven by this
perfection. Of course, we try to give them some idea of what it's
like to be a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees with the Kim family's decision to send Miran
to Juilliard at this point. Benny Kim, who as Miran's teacher has
worked hard to remedy problems in her technique, fears it might be
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very gifted girl,'' he said, ``who has some areas to
work on. It's very important that a 10-year-old child have a normal
upbringing, and that she not be completely consumed with music at
too early an age. Burnout can happen very easily....Maybe I'm a
little overly protective. She should try it for a year and see if
she likes it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kantor said Miran would do fine at Juilliard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miran is a very natural player, a very healthy player _ (that
is,) there's nothing compulsively driven about her playing, which
is not always the case with young talent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Miran goes to Juilliard this month, the rest of her family
will be with her, in spirit at least _ each contributing, with toil
and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Dong-Yeong Kim, with her own career as a painter on hold,
wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I barely have any time for me,'' she said, with no noticeable
regret. ``I took all my art supplies to Aspen this summer, and I
didn't even open the box. Maybe's that's the sacrifice. Miran is
young, and she has more potential. Maybe she can have a better
future than I've had.''

GORE HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM, OBSERVERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY and STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ When he played basketball as a congressman, Al
Gore didn't rebound much. He liked to launch three-point shots,
recalls Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   That might be the Democratic presidential candidate's game after
a Republican convention that put a lot of points on the board for
nominee George W. Bush, said Roberts, a Republican who played ball
with Gore when they were in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be bombs away,'' Roberts predicted. ``There's no
question some attack dogs will be let off the chains.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans came out of last week's convention beaming over
their unity and their pronounced resolve to beat Gore. Now, many
wonder how Democrats will respond at their convention, which begins
Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes his announcement Tuesday of a running mate will shift
the spotlight back to the Democrats. Last Thursday he released a
list of six contenders. He said he also was considering ``one wild
card.''
</P>
<P>
   The right pick could certainly put Gore on the road to recovery,
but the selection may not be enough to overcome Bush's double-digit
lead in the polls. That is why Roberts and others expect Gore to go
on the offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Others urge Gore to use caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing Al Gore needs to do more than anything is reach down
into himself, find out what he believes in strongly and go out and
fight for that,'' said Paul Simon, a retired senator from Illinois
and former Democratic presidential candidate. ``Don't pay attention
to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of
Texas, agreed that Gore should concentrate on himself, particularly
on closing a ``leadership gap'' he suffers in the minds of the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly a question of style and image,'' Buchanan said.
``He can't fix it at one convention. An artfully constructed video
will help.'' So might an acceptance speech in which Gore comes off
as presidential, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that so far Gore had not been effective in
attacking Bush. He might be better off letting someone else carry
the hatchet, much as GOP vice-presidential candidate Dick Cheney
did for Bush in his convention speech, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has a way of attacking that just seems petty,'' Buchanan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Cheney's speech and some lines in Bush's speech
Thursday, the Republican convention stuck mainly to image building.
</P>
<P>
   Given that approach, some Republicans think Democrats risk
public scorn if they decide to go into an attack mode at their
convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats do not agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that the Gore folks would miss an opportunity
to really draw some sharp contrasts,'' said Mike McCurry, a
political communications consultant and President Clinton's former
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Republican volleys at Gore were actually aimed at
Clinton. Cheney made repeated indirect references to Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky, which led to his impeachment in the
House and allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has denounced Clinton's behavior but has staunchly defended
his record as president. At the convention and in the campaign,
Gore will have to juggle two different Clinton legacies, observers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to decide if Bill Clinton was the greatest president in
American history or someone we have to get over collectively,''
said John Hancock, executive director of the Missouri Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   While the loudest cheers from the Republican convention floor
came when someone took a swipe at Clinton, he remained popular in
the polls, and the Lewinsky scandal did not affect Democrats in the
1998 congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats will play on the fact we've had eight years of a
great economy and that most people have seen some benefit from this
administration,'' said Henry Gueary, president of the Olathe branch
of the NAACP. ``As long as they seize on those things, they can
counter the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the public knows that Gore is not Clinton from a
moral standpoint, said Jim Slattery, a former Democratic
congressman from Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have to be very careful they don't overplay the
attack on Clinton, because at some point in the election process
people will realize that Bill Clinton is history,'' Slattery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore needs to say flat out that `I'm not Bill Clinton,'' '
Slattery said. He said Gore also should say: ``I've worked with
this president for things we agree on, and we've achieved a lot
together. Bill Clinton has made some personal mistakes, but they
are not my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has not been free of missteps of his own that
Republicans may choose to exploit, such as questionable fund
raising in 1996 at the White House and at a Buddhist temple in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the eight years with Bill and Hillary Clinton is bound to
link Gore with their era and so-called Clinton fatigue, especially
since both Clintons are expected to speak at the convention, said
Republican pollster Neil Newhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Another chore is to respond to the Republican effort to strike a
moderate tone at the convention by including speakers and
entertainers from minority groups traditionally in the Democratic
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can ill-afford to lose votes from his own party, observers
noted. Polls show that Bush has the backing of about 90 percent of
Republicans but that Gore has 80 percent or fewer Democrats behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's best chance of winning over the electorate may come not
at the convention but in debates, said former Kansas City Mayor
Emanuel Cleaver, who is widely thought of as an effective public
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election will be won in the debates,'' said Cleaver.
``Nobody believes that George W. Bush can in any way handle Vice
President Al Gore in a debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, too, realize that elections are not won at
conventions, no matter how successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope we are not overconfident,'' said U.S. Sen. Kit
Bond, a Republican who is chairman of the Bush campaign in
Missouri. ``We have a lot of work to do.''

STOWERS INSTITUTE FORMS ITS OWN VISION FROM DISTINGUISHED DALLAS
MODEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Long before this city's main medical center produced
Nobel Prize winners, and before it became a model for Kansas City,
there was a time when world renown was just a glimmering
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1972. The first research-only building was opening.
And top-notch scientists were being recruited to fill it. Folks
such as Bill Neaves. People who could sense that the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center would become something big.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades later Southwestern is as revered in medical
circles as Harvard or Johns Hopkins universities. It has nurtured
more Nobel winners, four, than any other medical institution. It
has built a six-block-long campus with 30-some buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Those who witnessed Southwestern's rise look back on 1972 as a
turning point. And today Kansas City's Stowers Institute for
Medical Research is at a similar point in its endeavor to establish
itself relatively quickly.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Neaves was at Southwestern then. And he is at Stowers
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the experience of Southwestern in the early 1970s in
bringing in all kinds of talented newcomers causes me to have
confidence that it can be reproduced here,'' said Neaves, who left
Southwestern this year to become Stowers' first president.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers' buildings will open this fall after a $200 million-plus
expansion and refurbishing of the old Menorah Medical Center near
the Country Club Plaza. It will attempt to answer some of the
fundamental questions of life sciences, such as how genes work
together to create and cleanse cancer and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   As such, Stowers represents something scarce in Kansas City, a
facility aiming for world renown. The city's civic community
promises to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to support the
institute and bankroll spinoff ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stowers' model, the rise of Southwestern, is an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern's glory took only a couple of decades to attain,
not the generations it took Harvard or Johns Hopkins or even
Washington University in St. Louis. Southwestern did it in middle
America, not on the East or West coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only place that's been successful in what we're
trying to do,'' said Jim Stowers Jr., the American Century mutual
fund magnate who is founding Kansas City's institute.
</P>
<P>
   A focused vision
</P>
<P>
   Edward Wakeland is, in his words, ``a Southern boy.'' But after
growing up in Texas and attending college there, he had ``had
enough of Texas.'' He went to medical school in Hawaii and took a
research position in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan.,
tried recruiting him a decade ago. He visited there but instead
decided to go home, to Southwestern, as the director of an
immunology center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They set the bar high and come up with the resources for the
very best people to achieve their goals,'' Wakeland said.
</P>
<P>
   The man who set that bar was one of Southwestern's pioneers,
Donald Seldin. When Seldin arrived in January 1951 from Yale
University, the center still occupied leftover Army barracks, the
same ones it had started with in World War II. The dean and various
top professors and department heads were fed up. They were leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Seldin found himself as the sole member of the medicine
department. He became chairman by default. He had no faculty. ``You
can look at that as a great liability. You can also look at it as a
great asset,'' he said. He chose the latter.
</P>
<P>
   For almost two decades his best resource was his own medical
students. He identified the top ones, recruited them for research
projects and then used his contacts to get them more prestigious
training, with the promise that they return to Southwestern. And
students like Joseph Goldstein did come back.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the mid-1960s, Texas' state government put a higher
priority on higher education. In the 1970s the federal government
did the same. Southwestern's state funding jumped from $2.5 million
in 1965 to $62.5 million two decades later. Meanwhile, Southwestern
received enough from the feds to go on a building boom, which would
eventually boost research space tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   As the first new building opened, Neaves arrived as a professor.
He became dean of the graduate school and then dean of the medical
school. His major responsibility was recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood for high-level quality,'' Seldin said. ``He tried to
ensure the appointments were of the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the payoffs rolled in: Goldstein and colleague
Michael Brown won Southwestern's first Nobel in 1985 for
cholesterol research. Then research grants shot up from less than
$40 million to more than $180 million today. Southwestern
researchers found what's called the ``fountain of youth,'' an
enzyme that causes human cells to avoid the normal process of
aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``UT Southwestern has moved into the front rank of medical
schools ... and it's the only school to have done so in the last
decade,'' said H. Maxwell Cowan, who has been a distinguished
professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Southwestern officials about this success, and they
invariably stress two key themes.
</P>
<P>
   One is a narrowly focused vision, putting resources toward the
right areas of study. In the early 1980s, Southwestern's leaders
put their focus on molecular biology, believing genetics was where
scientific breakthroughs would come. They guessed right.
</P>
<P>
   The second theme is carefully choosing who gets the resources.
It's what Seldin calls ``taste,'' finding up-and-coming talent and
not blowing a hiring opportunity on mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to what Chris Newgard, a biochemistry professor,
calls a ``relentless, insatiable desire to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   A new start
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kansas City, Jim Stowers Jr. had his dream to cure
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Stanford University scientists came to visit him.
They wanted his money in California. He wanted to keep it in Kansas
City. Unable to change his mind, the scientists told him about
Southwestern. Intrigued, Stowers visited Neaves three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us what he had done, and that's what we wanted to
do,'' Stowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers was so impressed that he made Neaves an adviser to his
fledgling organization. He didn't think about hiring him. Neaves
was too entrenched at Southwestern. He had become the executive
over all academics. But after one of their regular meetings last
February, Neaves called Stowers. He wanted to get back to building
gene-based science ``from the ground up,'' as he put it.
</P>
<P>
   He asked about becoming Stowers' chief executive. ``We about
fell over,'' Stowers said. ``We really believe in what Bill Neaves
believes in, and he's the one who built Southwestern. He's the one
who found the way to make it work in an unlikely place.''
</P>
<P>
   Neaves, at 56, started in Kansas City in June.
</P>
<P>
   Along a wall of books in his new office there is one white
binder _ Southwestern's operating handbook. Neaves intends to
follow Southwestern's formula, its two key themes.
</P>
<P>
   One already is in place: the narrowly focused vision. At Stowers
that's the genetic susceptibility to diseases. For the second,
choosing only the best up-and-coming talent, Neaves is setting his
bar high.
</P>
<P>
   He has stipulated that Stowers will select only those scientists
with enough credentials to be selected by the Hughes Medical
Institute, which funds the most promising research at medical
centers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The imperative is to make no mistakes in the quality of the
individuals we recruit,'' Neaves said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither facilities nor money will likely limit Stowers'
potential. Jim and Virginia Stowers already have given one-third of
their $1.8 billion commitment to an endowment for operations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone will come. Even Southwestern doesn't get
everyone it wants. ``Where we're hurt here, as in Kansas City, is
there are no mountains, there is no ocean, there's nothing,'' said
Southwestern's Wakeland.
</P>
<P>
   It will take time for Stowers to develop a reputation. It will
take 10 years, in Neaves' estimation, just to hire all 50 or 60
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City should not expect to have a Nobel Prize in three
years,'' said Kern Wildenthal, Southwestern's president.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Alpern, dean of Southwestern's medical school, added: ``Bill
will have it easier because he has the resources. But you need
patience to get the best people. You can't let impatience cause you
to accept lower quality. If you get mediocre researchers, it's all
over. You set a standard for the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who witnessed Southwestern's rise are encouraged about
Kansas City's chances _ because of Neaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't emphasize enough what a star you're getting,'' said
Newgard, the biochemistry professor. ``I know it's a big challenge,
but if anyone can do it, he can.''

STARR SAYS HE DIDN'T HAVE VENDETTA AGAINST CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Before sitting down to talk, former
Whitewater special counsel Kenneth Starr stood to open the drapes
of a hotel conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a sunlight guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who poured more sunlight on President Clinton than
anyone thought possible doesn't apologize for the work that led to
the impeachment, though not conviction, of a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task had to be done,'' Starr said in a Kansas City
interview Saturday. ``It was never a vendetta. It was never
anything but a professional investigation of facts. But its sheer
longevity and its expansion led to its vilification. That was
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr was in Kansas City to address the National Lawyers
Association, a conservative lawyers group based here. In a
half-hour interview, he discussed the legacy of his work, which
ultimately led to the revelation of marital infidelity in the White
House, and how he coped, for a time, with being one of the most
reviled men in America.
</P>
<P>
   Television was a great escape when the acid opinions of former
presidential adviser James Carville became too vexing, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched Monty Python reruns, that and John Cleese in `Fawlty
Towers,' '' Starr said. ``Manic British humor was helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said that in addition to the criminal convictions he
obtained against lesser Whitewater figures _ such as James and
Susan McDougal and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker _ the
important legacy of his investigation is on a personal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``By virtue of this horror we've gone through, we've seen some
shared values emerge,'' Starr told the lawyers in his address.
``Parents have been reminded to teach their children there is right
and there is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr declined to discuss his views on Hillary Rodham Clinton's
bid for a U.S. Senate seat from New York or say whether the media
should spend more time picking through Vice President Al Gore's
campaign finance issues. He suggested, however, that Attorney
General Janet Reno pay more attention to those asking her for a
more intense probe of campaign finance questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the highest regard for the integrity of (FBI Director)
Louis Freeh,'' Starr said. ``Judge Freeh called for an independent
counsel and urged the attorney general to do that. (Former Justice
Department campaign finance task force chief) Charles Labella
called for an independent counsel. Now we know his successor,
Robert Conrad, has called for an independent counsel. That suggests
to me that most attorneys general would have appointed an
independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's assessment of Clinton echoed that of Texas Gov. George
W. Bush in his acceptance speech at the Republican National
Convention last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Clinton is) a man of immense talent, first in his class,''
Starr said. ``But he was an individual who was willing to mock the
truth, even under oath. We want a remarkable president. We want our
president to be great. Very sadly, he squandered much of his moral
authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said those considering public office today should
scrutinize their motives and moral compass before deciding to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a hunger for plain speaking,'' Starr said. ``There are
too many poll-driven decisions now. A lot of people love power, the
trappings of power and the attention. I tend to be fearful of
those, in both parties. I tend to be skeptical of career
politicians.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush anticipates debating Gore
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the GOP convention over, Republican presidential candidate
Gov. George W. Bush said Saturday that he's eager for one-on-one
debates with his opponent Al Gore. Bush, who has been criticized as
a poor orator, told The Associated Press that he could hold his
own, although he views Gore as ``a very good debater.'' ``The first
thing about a debate is to know what you believe. And I know what I
believe,'' he said. The bipartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates has tentatively set three presidential debates: Oct. 3 in
Boston, Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis.
The vice presidential debate is set for Oct. 5 in Danville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH STILL HAS TWO DIGIT LEAD IN POLLS
</P>
<P>
   Bush leads Vice President Al Gore by more than 10 percentage
points, according to two new national polls taken after the
Republican National Convention. A Newsweek poll released Saturday
showed Republican Bush was ahead of Democrat Gore 49 percent to 38
percent while Green Party candidate Ralph Nader had 5 percent and
Pat Buchanan, a Reform Party hopeful, had 1 percent. The Newsweek
poll found Bush was viewed more favorably over Gore on the
following issues: upholding moral values (53-30), reducing crime
and violence (49-33), handling taxes (50-36), national defense (55
- 30), and foreign policy (48-37). Gore led on helping seniors pay
for prescription drugs (45-40), and protecting gay rights (47-30).
</P>
<P>
   A Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll of likely voters also
gave Bush an 8-point advantage at the start of the GOP convention
that grew by 10 points by the end of the week. In the tracking
poll, Bush led in every region of the country and among most
demographic groups. Overall, the convention gave 49 percent of
those surveyed a more favorable opinion of the Republican Party
while 22 percent said less favorable. Still, 41 percent said there
was not enough discussion of what actual policies the GOP would
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG LAWMAKER TO SPEAK IN L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr. will be a keynote speaker
at the Democratic National Convention to be held next week in Los
Angeles, Gore's campaign announced Friday. Ford, 30, the youngest
member of Congress, said Friday that an ``electric feeling'' went
through his body when Gore phoned to ask him to give a 15-minute
speech. ``He knows Al Gore. He's from Tennessee. He's an excellent
speaker,'' Gore campaign spokesman Jano Cabrera said.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS CHARGE HOUSTON IS `FILTHY'
</P>
<P>
   Democrats appear to have been caught criticizing one of their
own when party officials last week launched charges that Houston _
which is run by a Democratic mayor _ is filthy with pollution. In
Friday's Washington Times, Democrat spokeswoman Jennifer
Laszlo-Mizrahi said: ``We need to start letting people know, for
example, that Houston is a filthy, smoggy, disgusting city.''
Houston's mayor Lee Brown, however, is a Democrat. Democrats have
repeatedly criticized Bush's environmental record as governor of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jim Nicholson, Chairman of the Republican National
Committee: ``This is more `slaughterhouse' rhetoric from the Gore
campaign. It's hard to believe they are so desperate that they'd
level an attack that hurts one of their own party leaders.'' Brown
had no comment.

GRAEME HALL'S VICTORY IS WORTH A SIGH OF RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ With a heartbreaking 24 hours behind
him and another harrowing 24 ahead, Todd Pletcher summoned a
comfortable truism he learned as a boy from his father, J.J., as
they knocked along the back stretches of the southwestern racing
circuit. One of three talented 3-year-olds in his barn, Graeme
Hall, had just galloped home a surprise winner in the Jim Dandy,
earning a relieved shake of the head from Pletcher, his 33-year-old
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You eat chicken one day, feathers the next,'' he said. ``It's
just the way this game is. You have to enjoy the chicken when you
have it.''
</P>
<P>
   The trophy from the Grade II race represented the chicken he
could enjoy, the $240,000 first-place check could provide some
healthy feed for Graeme Hall's owners, Eugene and Laura Melnyk, and
the victory in this important prep for the Travers Stakes
catapulted Pletcher to the top of the trainers' standing here at
Saratoga Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, however, Pletcher's prospects were not nearly as
promising. His blazing sprinter, Trippi, was anything but in
finishing third as the odds-on favorite in the Amsterdam. A bruise
discovered on his left hoof explained part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   As Graeme Hall was preparing to run the best race of his young
career, Pletcher received more bad news. The jockey John Velazquez,
who was supposed to fly to the Jersey Shore and ride More Than
Ready, the morning-line favorite, for Pletcher in Sunday's $1
million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park, was involved in a
nasty spill in Saturday's fifth race and might have broken his left
collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   That tension was suspended for a startling 1:48.95 _ the time it
took Graeme Hall to dash 1[ miles and ruin the coronation of the
front-running Albert the Great _ as the slightly built son of
Dehere showed his victory in the Arkansas Derby was not a fluke
before an enthusiastic crowd of 64,979. Under Jerry Bailey, Graeme
Hall sat on the wing of the Nick Zito-trained Albert the Great as
the two clicked off a swift half-mile fraction of 46.11 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going too fast,'' Pletcher suspected from his perch in
the owner's box.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey was unruffled and believed he was just following the
trainer's instructions. ``He told me to let him find his rhythm,''
Bailey said. ``My horse was real aggressive around the turn. I
could have put Albert the Great away any time.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Bailey and Graeme Hall hit the top of the stretch,
they had, stopping Albert the Great's four-race winning streak and
leaving Zito sputtering for a reason. ``I'm at a loss for words,''
Zito said. ``I have no excuse. I thought we were just going to
gallop out to the lead and make the move, but we didn't. He cleared
to the lead, and the next thing I knew, he stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as he did in the Arkansas Derby, Graeme Hall continued to
dig down the middle of the lane determined to hold off the closing
charges of the late runners, Curule and Unshaded. That pair loped
along in sixth and seventh place until getting interested at the
bottom of the final turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stuck going into the final turn,'' said the rider of
second-place Curule, Mike Smith, a last-minute replacement for
Velazquez. ``He's not like a horse you ride every day. He's got a
quick trigger. Now I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Nafzger, the trainer for the 2-1 favorite, Unshaded, took
responsibility for his gelding's uneven race, but with a qualifier.
The trainer had said all along that his goal was to win the Aug. 26
Travers Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should have had him a little sharper,'' he said.
``This wasn't our main goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Nafzger's, Pletcher's sights are on winning the Travers and
making a case for one of his talented colts to be named 3-year-old
of the year. Besides More Than Ready, who will be ridden by Richard
Migliore on Sunday at Monmouth, the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness' third-place finisher, Impeachment, will represent his
barn in the big race in Oceanport, N.J. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the racing future of the Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi
Pegasus clouded by an impending sale as a stallion and the
Preakness winner Red Bullet still recovering from a viral infection
and ulcers, the 3-year-old division is wide open. There was no
mistaking that one of Pletcher's horses had earned his way into the
Travers. Asked if he would run, the trainer responded: ``That's why
we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   If More Than Ready and Impeachment run well on Sunday, Graeme
Hall will have plenty of company.

MARINERS BEAT YANKEES, 6-5 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone tilted back his head, peered through
squinted eyes into a sunny, summer sky and seemed to say something
about the beautiful day to Mel Stottlemyre. The pitching coach
agreed with him, the only words spoken on their 150-yard walk from
the bullpen to the dugout before Cone's start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The sun hung low by the time the organist Eddie Layton and the
highest rim of Yankee Stadium formed the shadow that covered the
third-base side stands and reached for the mound. Cone finished his
part of the game in the evening's darkness, departing after six
innings and 137 pitches _ the most he has thrown since generating
147 against Seattle in Game 5 of the 1995 division series.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 15th consecutive start made by Cone in which he was
not the winning pitcher, and although he was not charged with the
loss Saturday, the Seattle Mariners beat the Yankees, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners took a 6-3 lead with three runs in the top of the
ninth inning against Dwight Gooden and Mariano Rivera, and in the
bottom of the ninth the Yankees' Jorge Posada hammered a two-run
homer, his second home run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden relieved Cone to start the seventh inning and shut out
the Mariners for two innings. But the Mariners put together a
couple of singles to begin the ninth, and with one out, Rivera
relieved Gooden, and Al Martin beat out a hit to the right side of
the Yankees' drawn-in infield to score Stan Javier with the
go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have not won any of Cone's last 13 starts, which is
why his plight to achieve his second victory of the season and
182nd of his career has become something of a mission.
</P>
<P>
   When Cone retired the Mariners in the top of the first inning,
some of the fans at Yankee Stadium stood and cheered, and there is
no telling how Cone would perceive a gesture like this. He has said
he appreciates the ample support offered to him; on the other hand,
he is a former Cy Young Award, a ruthless competitor and a
self-deprecating realist, and a small part of him might have found
it somewhat galling to be given such cheers for one scoreless
inning.
</P>
<P>
   But fans and Yankees Manager Joe Torre and Cone's teammates all
wanted the win for him, for his misery to end. The Yankees scored
twice in the bottom of the first, on a two-out, two-run single by
David Justice, and for only the fourth time since his last win
April 28, Cone was able to pitch with a two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   During his week in Tampa, Fla., Cone made a handful of minor
adjustments, while under the counsel of former pitching coach Billy
Connors. Cone compacted his delivery, keeping his hands close to
his body, taking a short step back with his left foot at the outset
of his motion, drawing his right hand back and firing. Everything
he did was quicker: His hands, his feet, his pace. Cone allowed
back-to-back singles to start the second inning, before a ground
ball double-play killed the Seattle rally, but he threw 22 pitches
in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The shadows reached about 15 feet in front of home plate when
the top of the third inning began. Cone began the inning by walking
Mark McLemore, Seattle's No. 9 hitter; Cone was in the midst of a
stretch when he would reach three-ball counts to nine of 13
batters.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore stole second base, and with one out, Al Martin pulled a
slow roller through the hole between the second baseman Jose
Vizcaino and the first baseman Tino Martinez, scoring McLemore.
Alex Rodriguez, the Seattle shortstop, fell behind no balls and two
strikes, fouling off a couple of pitches, and Cone threw a fastball
and two breaking balls wide of the strike zone. The catcher Jorge
Posada signaled for a fastball, set his target just off the outside
corner, and when Cone's fastball drifted over the plate, Rodriguez
leaned forward and drove it into the right field stands. The
Mariners led, 3-2, and Cone's mouth turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The shade touched the base of the mound by the time Cone left
it, after 37 pitches. He had thrown 72 pitches in three innings,
and when he went out for the fourth inning, Gooden began to stretch
in the Yankees' bullpen, just in case he would be needed in short
order. Cone's shadow covered the back of the mound as the fourth
inning began; by the end of the fourth, sunshine touched only the
bill of his cap. Stottlemyre's fingers jabbed at the silver pitch
counter he held in his hand, and by the end of fourth, it read 92.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre was willing to wait, to give Cone every chance. The
right-hander allowed a hit and a walk with two outs in the fifth
and there was movement in the Yankees' bullpen. Cone pitched to
Mike Cameron, closed out the inning with a strikeout -- the 2,500th
strikeout of his career -- and again Cone walked off to a standing
ovation. When the milestone was announced to the fans, their cheers
grew, a call for Cone to come out of the dugout for a wave.
</P>
<P>
   He would not come out. He had thrown 113 pitches. Cone walked
out for the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Guillen walked leading off the sixth; now the Yankees'
bullpen was fully active, a left-hander and a right-hander. Cone
struck out Dan Wilson with his 126th pitch. Guillen was thrown out
at second on what appeared to be a botched hit and run, but
McLemore singled. One hundred thirty-two pitches. Cone appeared
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   He summoned enough stuff to reach a 2-2 count on Rickey
Henderson, before throwing a fastball past the veteran. More
cheering. Cone's outing was over. He walked off in twilight and he
did not appear to be pleased.

GORE LISTS REASONS FOR PICKING ANY OF THOSE ON SHORT LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Deletes reference to Gore phone call to Edwards)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Gender, religion, and length of time in office will
not determine his choice of a running mate, Vice President Al Gore
said this weekend, as political analysts, reporters, and even
members of Gore's campaign scrutinized both his short list and his
every utterance for clues.
</P>
<P>
   With just two days remaining until Gore announces his vice
presidential nominee here, a sense of frenzied tension has set in.
Television networks, for example, have dispatched producers to
trail four of the likely candidates, Senators John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, John Edwards of North Carolina, Evan Bayh of
Indiana, and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Telephones at Gore campaign headquarters have been ringing
nonstop with last-minute lobbying by supporters, and queries from
those left off the short list, campaign insiders said. Even a print
shop is on standby, waiting to find out whose name to place on
posters and placards.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the process said that each of the
potential running mates has provided Gore with telephone numbers
where he can be reached. And each has been told to expect a
resolution by Sunday night or early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials insisted Saturday that Gore still had not
made up his mind and that they were not privy to his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, deputy campaign manager for communications, said
Gore has given no indication of his choice, despite a flurry of
speculation in the past couple of days that the vice president is
focusing on Edwards of North Carolina, who has held elective office
for only a year and a half. Saturday, Gore telephoned Edwards,
sources said, though the content of the conversation is not known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's just people doing guesswork that has nothing
to do with what the vice president is doing,'' Fabiani said of all
the whispers.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore himself is partly responsible for fueling the
speculation about Edwards, 47. In an interview with ABC News,
posted on its Web site, the vice president was asked whether length
of time in office would be a factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Washington experience is the only experience
that's relevant to leadership and to this country,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He was also asked if the nation is ready for a woman vice
president. ``Oh, of course,'' Gore said. Although New Hampshire
Governor Jeanne Shaheen has been mentioned as a running mate,
campaign officials have acknowledged she is not likely to be
picked, and Shaheen herself has said she would not accept.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also asked if a Jewish candidate, such as Lieberman,
would face prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those old distinctions and categories matter
these days, the way they did in the past,'' Gore said. ``I think
we've grown as a nation. I think we've grown beyond that kind of
attitude. I think that the day is coming when that'll be completely
irrelevant in all of our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the media frenzy was directed at Edwards Saturday,
Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz, returned to Washington from
Ketchum, Idaho, only to be met by a network television crew and
reporters. Kerry had spent the last week at their vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   As he loaded up their Lexus SUV with luggage, Kerry was asked if
he had been told when to expect a phone call from Gore. ``No,
absolutely, I don't know more than you do,'' he said, before
heading to Georgetown for the night, and then leaving for Boston on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore spent the day in Washington Saturday,
speaking to a convention of the National Association of Police
Organizations before flying off to the Hamptons for a Democratic
party fund-raiser featuring actor Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after celebrating the birthday of his daughter
Karenna, Gore will travel to Nashville, where he is expected to
meet with his senior campaign officials. On Tuesday, Gore plans to
introduce his running mate at the downtown War Memorial Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Gore currently is trailing Texas Governor George W. Bush in the
polls by double digits. Many Americans tend to focus on the
election during the political conventions, the debates, and when a
running mate is selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first significant decision that people are going to
see them make as a presidential candidate,'' said Joel K.
Goldstein, author of ``The Modern American Vice Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a bad job of deciding, if you put somebody out there
who is shown to have all sorts of weaknesses,'' Goldstein said,
``or you pick somebody for all sorts of political reasons, it
creates a negative image of the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the candidate chosen to run for vice president will
be so extraordinary that it will help Gore whittle down Bush's lead
is unlikely, said Bill McInturff, a pollster who worked on Senator
John McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most normal people have not heard of any of these people the
Democrats are considering,'' McInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bush campaign, officials were nonchalant: ``Whoever it
is, we're running against Al Gore,'' said Ari Fleischer, Bush's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckman reported from Nashville and Milligan from Washington,
D.C. Glen Johnson, Anne E. Kornblut, and Walter V. Robinson, all of
the Globe staff, contributed to this report.

   NASHVILLE _ Gender, religion, and length of time in office will
not determine his choice of a running mate, Vice President Al Gore
said this weekend, as political analysts, reporters, and even
members of Gore's campaign scrutinized both his short list and his
every utterance for clues.
</P>
<P>
   With just two days remaining until Gore announces his vice
presidential nominee here, a sense of frenzied tension has set in.
Television networks, for example, have dispatched producers to
trail four of the likely candidates, Senators John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, John Edwards of North Carolina, Evan Bayh of
Indiana, and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Telephones at Gore campaign headquarters have been ringing
nonstop with last-minute lobbying by supporters, and queries from
those left off the short list, campaign insiders said. Even a print
shop is on standby, waiting to find out whose name to place on
posters and placards.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the process said that each of the
potential running mates has provided Gore with telephone numbers
where he can be reached. And each has been told to expect a
resolution by Sunday night or early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials insisted Saturday that Gore still had not
made up his mind and that they were not privy to his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, deputy campaign manager for communications, said
Gore has given no indication of his choice, despite a flurry of
speculation in the past couple of days that the vice president is
focusing on Edwards of North Carolina, who has held elective office
for only a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's just people doing guesswork that has nothing
to do with what the vice president is doing,'' Fabiani said of all
the whispers.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore himself is partly responsible for fueling the
speculation about Edwards, 47. In an interview with ABC News,
posted on its Web site, the vice president was asked whether length
of time in office would be a factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Washington experience is the only experience
that's relevant to leadership and to this country,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He was also asked if the nation is ready for a woman vice
president. ``Oh, of course,'' Gore said. Although New Hampshire
Governor Jeanne Shaheen has been mentioned as a running mate,
campaign officials have acknowledged she is not likely to be
picked, and Shaheen herself has said she would not accept.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also asked if a Jewish candidate, such as Lieberman,
would face prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those old distinctions and categories matter
these days, the way they did in the past,'' Gore said. ``I think
we've grown as a nation. I think we've grown beyond that kind of
attitude. I think that the day is coming when that'll be completely
irrelevant in all of our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the media frenzy was directed at Edwards Saturday,
Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz, returned to Washington from
Ketchum, Idaho, only to be met by a network television crew and
reporters. Kerry had spent the last week at their vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   As he loaded up their Lexus SUV with luggage, Kerry was asked if
he had been told when to expect a phone call from Gore. ``No,
absolutely, I don't know more than you do,'' he said, before
heading to Georgetown for the night, and then leaving for Boston on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore spent the day in Washington Saturday,
speaking to a convention of the National Association of Police
Organizations before flying off to the Hamptons for a Democratic
party fund-raiser featuring actor Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after celebrating the birthday of his daughter
Karenna, Gore will travel to Nashville, where he is expected to
meet with his senior campaign officials. On Tuesday, Gore plans to
introduce his running mate at the downtown War Memorial Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Gore currently is trailing Texas Governor George W. Bush in the
polls by double digits. Many Americans tend to focus on the
election during the political conventions, the debates, and when a
running mate is selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first significant decision that people are going to
see them make as a presidential candidate,'' said Joel K.
Goldstein, author of ``The Modern American Vice Presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do a bad job of deciding, if you put somebody out there
who is shown to have all sorts of weaknesses,'' Goldstein said,
``or you pick somebody for all sorts of political reasons, it
creates a negative image of the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether the candidate chosen to run for vice president will
be so extraordinary that it will help Gore whittle down Bush's lead
is unlikely, said Bill McInturff, a pollster who worked on Senator
John McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most normal people have not heard of any of these people the
Democrats are considering,'' McInturff said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bush campaign, officials were nonchalant: ``Whoever it
is, we're running against Al Gore,'' said Ari Fleischer, Bush's
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckman reported from Nashville and Milligan from Washington,
D.C. Glen Johnson, Anne E. Kornblut, and Walter V. Robinson, all of
the Globe staff, contributed to this report.

EX-TROJAN JENKINS IMPROVES SKILLS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Geoff Jenkins realizes hitting is what draws the
publicity, the big contracts and is the easiest way to secure a
spot in the lineup. He's always considered it the most enjoyable
part of baseball and the part of the game at which he's excelled.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins entered this weekend's Milwaukee Brewers series against
the Dodgers with 19 home runs and the second-highest average on the
team at .300, but he takes just as much pride in his 11 outfield
assists, which rank second in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much is put on the offensive side that a lot of people
forget about defense,'' said Jenkins. ``I've always known that if I
just practice my hitting, it'll be there. But, defensively, that's
something they haven't always really thought I was good at.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've really worked hard at and I think I've
really become a good outfielder now just from listening to guys
like Marquis Grissom, Darrin Jackson and other veteran guys I've
played with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just listening to their advice and just studying the hitters,
where they hit the ball, it really helps you become a better
outfielder.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' desire to become a more complete player started when
his older brother Brett played for USC and former Trojan Fred Lynn
was repeatedly mentioned as an example of an ideal outfielder. The
tales of Lynn continued when Geoff enrolled at USC, but the
numerous accolades Jenkins received during his three seasons there
were based on his hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, 26, left USC in 1995 as the Trojans' leader in career
RBI (175) and ranks among the school's top five in several other
career and season offensive categories.
</P>
<P>
   He capped his All-American career by leading USC to the 1995
College World Series final and playing well enough to earn a spot
on the College World Series All-Decade team even though the Trojans
lost the championship to Cal State Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a hitter,'' Jenkins said. ``I wasn't really
known for my fielding coming out of college, but I finally decided
I wanted to be more than just a hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   As a minor-leaguer in 1996, Jenkins did not make an error. His
14 outfield assists in 1999 _ his first full season in the major
leagues _ were fifth in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works on his defense a lot and he's definitely gotten
better,'' Brewers manager Davey Lopes said.
</P>
<P>
   Being more than a one-dimensional player is part of what Jenkins
hopes will make him a good example for teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm not one of the guys that has a ton of service
time like some of the other guys on our team, but I still feel like
when I go out there, how you perform out there and how you go about
your business on and off the field, can make you a leader,''
Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys around you see what you do. This year and years to
come, I definitely look forward to being one of the guys on the
team that everyone will want to turn to. It's just one more thing I
can contribute to the team.'' &QL;

BOBBY LABONTE WINS THE BRICKYARD 400 AS OLDER BROTHER'S LONGEVITY
STREAK ENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Fate linked Texas' Labonte brothers yesterday at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where Bobby Labonte's landmark
Brickyard 400 victory was framed against the abrupt end of Terry
Labonte's historic ``Iron Man'' streak.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, the NASCAR Winston Cup points leader, chased
down, rubbed fenders against and passed Rusty Wallace within a few
harrowing seconds on Lap 146 of 160 around the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, it's hard to pass here, and that was a ``pass'',''
said Labonte, who nosed his car under Wallace's in the short chute
between turns 3 and 4 of the 2.5-mile rectangular oval. They exited
Turn 4 side by side and momentarily traded paint _ Labonte's right
front fender banging Wallace's left rear quarter. Labonte squeezed
ahead before the start/finish line, but his lead over Wallace was
timed at 0.004 seconds as they barreled toward Turn 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was puckered up on that one,'' Labonte said, ``because when
I got to Turn 1, I wasn't sure what was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Running in clean air, Labonte cleared Wallace and methodically
stretched his lead to nearly five seconds en route to his second
victory of 2000 and the 14th of his Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   Among those greeting him on pit road was big brother Terry, who
spent a subdued day in the pits with his Hendrick Motorsports team.
Suffering dizziness from a concussion suffered in a wreck at the
Daytona International Speedway last month, Terry Labonte decided
Friday he was unfit to compete at IMS. His voluntary decision not
to race ended a streak of 655 consecutive series starts dating to
February 1979 and covering the length of his Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, driver of the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac
Grand Prix, said he managed only a quick moment with his brother on
the way to Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little hard to talk to him,'' said Bobby, his voice
beginning to crack with emotion. ``I grabbed him and about drug him
down to Victory Lane. Streaks are numbers, and the number came to
an end. It's definitely sad in a lot of ways ... it's all good,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte concurred, aware that Bobby had boosted not only
his stature but also his championship points lead to 87 over
reigning Cup champion Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him \RBobby\S the whole race, and I was real nervous
the last few laps,'' said Terry, the older of the brothers from
Corpus Christi. ``I kept my fingers crossed. Rusty and him were
much better than anybody else, but anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly why Terry Labonte opted to sit out the race,
even when he could have kept the streak alive by starting and
completing one lap in the No. 5 Kellogg's Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my mind up that I was stepping out, and nothing changed
my mind,'' Terry Labonte said. ``Todd Bodine did a great job for us
\Rfinishing 15th\S. We worked real hard. Well, I didn't. I just sat
back and watched. I guess with Bobby winning the race, it was a
good way for it to end. But I hate that I didn't get to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the one-on-one duel between Bobby Labonte and Wallace
provided the only real drama on a track where single-file racing
remains the norm. Wallace did his part to stink it up, leading four
times for a race-high 110 laps. Labonte was runner-up in that
category, with 21 laps led.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second stinks, it really does,'' said Wallace, driver of the
No. 2 Miller Lite Ford Taurus. ``I lost the race in '95 to \R
Dale\S Earnhardt when I led all day long and they had a wreck on
pit road and I got hung up behind him, so I lost that one kind of
by a weird deal. But today, I just got outrun the last 25 laps.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said his car began to tighten up _ making it difficult
to turn through corners _ once cloud cover cooled the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing I could do about it,'' Wallace said. ``I
knew Turn 3 was my weakest all day long. He kept getting me in Turn
3, and I'd get him in Turn 1. I'd get him off of Turn 4, and I'd
get him down the straightaways. I just had super-big horsepower
today, but I was just too slow entering Turn 3 and he got up
underneath me there. Once we got side by side down the front
straightaway and we were still past the start/finish line side by
side, there's just no way to go two-wide into Turn 1. So I had to
get out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The official margin of victory was 4.229 seconds, with Wallace
trailed home by Bill Elliott, Jerry Nadeau and Indiana native Tony
Stewart. Labonte's winning speed of 155.918 mph was an event
record. Earnhardt held the previous record of 155.218 set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A past winner of NASCAR's longest race, the Coca-Cola 600 at
Lowe's Motor Speedway, Bobby Labonte said victory in the series'
richest race was special.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're sitting in the cabin one day when we're done and
retired, we'll say, `Hey, remember that day when we won the
Brickyard 400?' '' Labonte said. ``Nobody will remember it by then,
but hopefully somebody will and we'll be able to talk about it.
That's one that you talk about.'' nn

JAMES-FALDO UPROAR A COMEDY OF ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truthfully, how can you not laugh at this entire Mark James
controversy? Good gracious, we are talking about an assistant
captain in the Ryder Cup. It's probably an important duty, like a
bullpen coach in baseball, but it cannot possibly be worth all
this.
</P>
<P>
   It's a serious matter in Europe, but from thousands of miles
away it is pure comedy. With such a madcap affair, it is difficult
to determine where to start, but let's begin with James's
appointment an assistant captain. Why? To reward him for some moves
that cost his team a victory last September at The Country Club in
Brookline? In case you forgot, let's recap his gaffes:
</P>
<P>
   --Choosing Andrew Coltart over Bernhard Langer or Nick Faldo
with the second of his picks. (Jesper Parnevik was the other.)
James had such faith in Coltart he didn't play him until the final
day. In 22 events since late last summer, Coltart has finished in
the top 10 just four times and broken 70 in only 18 of 74 rounds,
numbers that prove James was wise to keep him in the locker room
until Ryder Cup bylaws forced him to use all 12 guys. Anyone who
knows a 2-iron from a putter understands that Langer or Faldo could
have contributed more than Coltart.
</P>
<P>
   --Burning out his marquee guys, which was part of the fallout of
having Coltart on the team, in addition to Jean Van de Velde and
Jarmo Sandelin, players James didn't trust. In a coaching strategy
that only K.C. Jones could have liked, James rode his best players
hard, far too hard by the looks of things on Singles Sunday. And
before you defend James for giving his team its only chance,
remember this: If Jose Maria Olazabal had not asked out of the
foursomes, when he mysteriously forgot how to swing a driver, James
most likely would have stuck with him, and Padraig Harrington
wouldn't have played until Sunday. How shameful that would have
been, considering Harrington went 1-1-1 and has blossomed into a
wonderful player.
</P>
<P>
   --Tossing Sandelin, Van de Velde, and Coltart out 3-4-5. It was
a gamble _ and James lost big. Trailing, 10-6, the Americans were
going to load the front end of their singles lineup and everyone
knew it. James made it easier by tossing them three sacrificial
lambs as Phil Mickelson (4 and 3), Davis Love (6 and 5), and Tiger
Woods (3 and 2) cruised to help the US win the first six matches,
setting up the greatest comeback in Ryder Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   --Not playing Colin Montgomerie first or second. He was the best
player walking the hallowed grounds of TCC last September (Woods
included), his team needed an early point, and James rendered him
meaningless by batting him 10th.
</P>
<P>
   --Writing the book, ``Into the Bear Pit.'' We already knew he
didn't like Faldo and held Tom Lehman, Hal Sutton, and Ben Crenshaw
in contempt, but he had to tell us again. Ironically, for all the
harm the book has caused, every time Faldo opens his mouth or the
story is retold another sorry day, James rakes in the pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are sidekicks in any comedy. Faldo, arguably
the most self-centered player of his era, is acting as a team
spokesman in search of harmony, but he helped create this mess by
his ill-timed blast of Montgomerie just a few weeks before last
year's matches.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo said he apologized to Montgomerie and sent a letter of
encouragement to the European team. James tossed it in the circular
file without showing the team, according to Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo called James names. James called Faldo names.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo lined up veteran players on his side. James lined up
veteran players on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo lined up British writers on his side. James lined up
British writers on his side.
</P>
<P>
   (We interrupt to remind you that these are grown men and
reportedly distinguished athletes.)
</P>
<P>
   Faldo got voted down at a tournament players' meeting. James got
voted out at a European Ryder Cup officials' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, European events are being overshadowed by this petty
feud, and the best interest of the Ryder Cup has taken a back seat.
Of course, if you listen to James or Faldo, it's the other's fault.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Hill was never funnier.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A British undressing
</P>
<P>
   There are few sports moments as rewarding as the winner's walk
up the 72d fairway, and when those victorious steps are as historic
as Woods's were at St. Andrews, the theater is special. So what
happened? Just as Woods takes off his hat to salute the fans, a
woman takes off every stitch of clothing and streaks onto the 18th
green. The same thing happened to Woods in Saturday's third round
and, in fact, it seemed to be a daily exercise. (A title for
James's next book: ``Into the Bare Pit.'') Harmless? Well, yes. But
the British press, which rightfully blasted fan behavior at The
Country Club, seems to accept naked fans prancing across golf
courses. (We won't even get into their soccer hooligans.) Too bad,
because the British Open at St. Andrews is the ultimate golf
experience, from the greatest fans (at least those who remain
clothed), to the most distinctive course, to the unmatched aura of
links golf . . . As for Woods, he'll tee it up at the Buick Open
this week, going against his stated strategy of playing the week
before a major. (The PGA Championship begins Aug. 17.) Obviously,
his endorsement deal with Buick has something to do with it, but
the commute (Grand Blanc, Mich., to Louisville, Ky.) isn't rough,
so he should be ready to make a bid at a third major championship
this year. Ben Hogan (1953) is the only man to win three majors in
a season in the modern era . . . Surely, Karrie Webb is used to it
by now, but the misfortune of being in Woods's shadow is a
disheartening reality. In 1999, she won six times, including her
first major; nice, but virtually unnoticed in light of Woods's
eight victories and second major. Now, as Webb chases her third
major of the season (the du Maurier, which begins Thursday), much
of the focus will move to the Buick Open _ an event that rarely
makes a blip on the radar screen _ simply because Woods is playing
. . . Woods has finished over par in just one event in 2000 _ his
own Williams World Challenge (an unofficial tournament), when he
was 10th at plus-2. In 12 PGA Tour medal events, Woods has done no
worse than 4 under (at the Masters) and he is an unthinkable 138
under par in 48 stroke-play rounds. That translates into an
adjusted scoring average of 67.77 and Woods is on his way to
breaking the mark of 68.43, which he set a year ago. When you
consider that Ernie Els is second in the Vardon Trophy race
(69.29), it's easy to see why Stuart Appleby said Woods enters each
round with a two-shot edge . . . Shame on me for a triple bogey
several weeks ago. The course used as a qualifier for the British
Open was Lundin Links, not London Links, and, of course, it is
within a short distance of St. Andrews, not outside of London.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Word from the wise
</P>
<P>
   On those days when Kevin Johnson wasn't hitting balls or playing
golf at North Hill in Duxbury, he was hitting balls or playing golf
at Halifax CC, where he got to know Ray Bump. ``He was always
telling me I needed to play the Publinx,'' said Johnson from Omaha,
where he was taking part in the BUY.com Tour event this weekend.
Johnson took Bump's advice and ended up winning the 1987 US Amateur
Public Links Championship at Glenview GC in Cincinnati. Johnson
remembers Bump flying out just to watch that championship match, a
10-and-9 rout. ``He was the guy behind the tournament. I remember
when (the Public Links Championship) came to Stow Acres, Ray was
talking about that for years, like it was his own little
tournament.'' Johnson, like many in the state's golfing circles,
was saddened by the death of Bump, 79, July 16. ``He was always
very good to me,'' said Johnson. ``He really helped me.'' . . .
Johnson returned to tournament action after three weeks off with
his wife, Christa, as they celebrated the birth of their daughter,
Jordan Paige, July 17 . . . Chip Drury, the 38-year-old former pro
from Atlanta who earned a US Amateur spot during a qualifier at
Salem CC in Peabody Tuesday, had a helping hand in one of golf's
most historic victories _ Jack Nicklaus's 1986 Masters triumph at
the age of 46. OK, maybe not a helping hand, but certainly some
inspirational assistance. As a US Amateur semifinalist the previous
summer, Drury had a spot in the Masters field in 1986, and got set
up with a Tuesday practice round with Nicklaus. That day, an
Atlanta columnist suggested Nicklaus should gracefully walk away
from the game and not return to Augusta as a ceremonial
participant. At one point, ``I turned to Nicklaus and said, `Mr.
Nicklaus, you have just struck it perfectly and putted beautifully.
You could win this tournament.' '' Drury said Nicklaus gave him a
sly grin, a memory he'll have forever. Drury shot 76-77 and missed
the cut; Nicklaus, of course, earned his 18th professional major.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clark's number is up
</P>
<P>
   Michael Clark played college golf with David Duval at Georgia
Tech. Michael who? Michael Clark, last week's John Deere Classic
winner. If you ever wonder why some guys keep plugging along on the
BUY.com Tour, the answer is Michael Clark. Before the John Deere
Classic, he played in 17 events this year, his rookie year on the
PGA Tour. He missed 11 cuts, finished in the top 20 just twice, and
broke 70 in just 12 of 47 rounds. If you found his name on the
money list it was only by accident. Now, thanks to the incredible
riches that throw things out of whack, Clark is 49th on the money
list, having earned $468,000 of his $588,994 at the John Deere. Not
bad for a guy who ranks 151st in scoring average, 134th in putts
per round, and 130th in greens in regulation . . . What's Clark
going to do with the bulk of his first-place check? Buy a
four-wheel drive tractor, of course, to help clear the 100 acres of
land he owns in Georgia . . . The John Deere also proved to be a
huge hit for Charles Howell III, who finished third and earned
$176,800 in just his third PGA Tour event since turning pro. With
$195,362, Howell would rank 132d on the money list, but he is not a
member of the PGA Tour yet. However, if at the end of the season he
has reached a figure equal to or greater than the 125th player
(last year that figure was $326,893), he would earn his card and
get to skip the hellish Q School . . . In case you are keeping
track, Fuzzy Zoeller made his first cut of the year at the Greater
Milwaukee Open, earning $4,550. That's all he has to show for 12
starts in 2000 . . . Don't look now, but Jumbo Ozaki has slipped to
54th in the world rankings. It has been a mere 28 years since his
victory in the New Zealand PGA Championship, his only win outside
of Japan. He should get points for having the guts to wear an
all-purple outfit . . . Defending champ Aree Wongluekiet was
stunned in the third round of the US Girls' Junior Championship at
Pumpkin Ridge in North Plains, Ore. Her twin sister, Naree, was a
second-round upset victim. Tears flowed and the shock factor
apparently was immense. Fortunately, at just 14 years old, they
have time to get over it. Suggested remedy: Head to the beach, the
game rooms, or water parks for a few weeks and be kids. Most likely
course of action: more practice for a dozen or so national
tournaments.

NEW RULES MAY NOT BE ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As one Winston Cup driver put it, it was ``just smart thinking''
when NASCAR announced rule changes last week, requiring engines to
be outfitted with a throttle stop assembly and an auxiliary
shut-off switch on the steering wheel within reach of the driver's
thumb.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the changes, effective for Saturday's
Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, would have prevented
the deaths of Busch Series driver Adam Petty May 12 and Winston Cup
driver Kenny Irwin Jr. July 7 at New Hampshire International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Both drivers were killed under similar circumstances when their
cars hit the wall in Turn 3 at NHIS. In both instances it was
speculated a stuck throttle was the cause, but NASCAR officials
have yet to find conclusive evidence to support that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're running these things at around 200 miles per hour,
there's no way you're going to make them totally safe,'' said
driver Jeremy Mayfield, 31, of Owensboro, Ky., who discovered that
firsthand Friday morning when he crashed and sustained a concussion
during practice for the Brickyard. Mayfield, who was fourth fastest
during pole qualifications Thursday afternoon, suffered the injury
when his No. 12 Mobil Oil Ford Taurus spun as it entered Turn 3 at
Indy and slammed into the concrete wall on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   It took rescue workers 10 minutes to extricate Mayfield. He was
taken to Methodist Hospital, where he was examined and reported to
be alert.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty, Adam's father, who failed to qualify his own car,
drove Mayfield's backup Ford for the Penske-Kranefuss Racing team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that makes the cars safer,'' Mayfield said before his
accident, ``especially something that doesn't affect the racing,
and something that doesn't open up a can of worms for other stuff,
it's just smart thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But how smart was it to wait so long before making those rule
changes?
</P>
<P>
   Were the safety measures overdue? Why did it take two tragedies
before NASCAR finally acted? And what of the timing of the
announcement? Winston Cup teams would have been better served if
NASCAR allowed for more time _ say, last weekend's open date _ for
the changes to be implemented. Instead, NASCAR announced the
changes two days before Winston Cup teams were scheduled to arrive
in Indy for the Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ideas are still coming,'' said Gary Nelson,
NASCAR's Winston Cup Series director. ``As long as we never rest
and continue to look for ways to make the sport safer, ideas will
develop from that. If you look at a NASCAR stock car from 1949 and
you look at one from 2000, you will see there has been a lot done.
The fact that we did things this week tells me there will probably
be a lot more done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of evolution. It's a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Petty and Irwin tragedies gave rise to talk about the
implementation of a foam barrier along the retaining walls, it has
resulted in nothing more than that, talk.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers have taken steps to prevent serious head injuries
and the whiplash effect of violent wall crashes by using a head and
neck safety (HANS) device. The HANS device is nothing more than a
pair of straps at the back of a helmet anchored to the shoulder
harness. Its function is to stabilize the head and neck in the
event of a crash, but NASCAR has not yet made the device mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if NASCAR might be inclined to solicit help from crash
experts and engineers in developing other safety measures, Nelson
said: ``The specialized engineers are the guys in this garage who
build these cars every day and understand them. I don't think
there's anybody better who understands what's going on.''

   Darrell Waltrip and Brett Bodine were treated to a pair of
uplifting experiences (courtesy of their brothers, Michael Waltrip
and Geoffrey Bodine) during the first and second rounds of
qualifying for the Brickyard 400, which was won Saturday by Bobby
Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the 53-year-old Waltrip, who is retiring at the end
of the season, surprised everyone when he set a track record with
his lap of 180.923 miles per hour, good enough for a spot on the
provisional pole.
</P>
<P>
   When ol' D.W. pulled down pit road, where Michael was awaiting
him, he was greeted by a rousing ovation. When he climbed out of
his car, Darrell jumped into Michael's arms and was carried around
the pits to the delight of the cheering crowd. Ricky Rudd knocked
Waltrip off the pole with a record-shattering lap of 181.068
m.p.h., but it didn't seem to diminish D.W.'s day. ``That doesn't
bother me,'' said Darrell Waltrip. ``I told y'all, and I mean it, I
don't have to win and I don't have to be on the pole. As long as
you can leave here this weekend and say, `Ol' D.W. was up there,'
that's all that matters to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, a similar scene played out between the Bodines, when
Brett erased Rudd's track record with a lap of 181.072 during the
second day of qualifications. Brett, who had failed to qualify for
last year's Brickyard race, wrested the honor of fastest second-day
qualifier away from Geoffrey, who had gone 179.037. The Bodines
started Saturday's race side by side in Row 13. As he was being
interviewed on pit road by an ESPN reporter, Brett was joined by
Geoffrey, who threw a bear hug on his younger brother and
triumphantly lifted him off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional scene that vastly differed from their first
trip to Indy for the inaugural Brickyard 400 in 1994, when Brett
bumped Geoffrey from behind on Lap 101, causing him to fall out of
the lead when he spun and hit the wall in Turn 4. Geoffrey caused a
family feud when he left the track that day claiming Brett had
``taken him out.'' If anything, Friday proved the Brothers Bodine
had mended their fences, finally.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   End of the road
</P>
<P>
   The streak is over.
</P>
<P>
   Despite overcoming injuries the past few weeks to continue
racing, Terry Labonte, Bobby's older brother, was not in the
Brickyard 400 lineup, thus ending his incredible string of 655
consecutive Winston Cup starts.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Labonte hobbled into the Jack Ratta Media Center at
NHIS, still smarting from the non-displaced fracture he suffered in
his right tibia after a wall crash at Daytona the week before.
Asked if he felt his Ripkenesque streak, which at the time numbered
653 races, was in any peril, Labonte replied, ``It's got to come to
an end some day, but you'd hate to see it come to an end like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old ironman expressed every hope of being healthy
enough to start not only the New England 300 (which he did) but
also the Brickyard 400. But his chances to race in Indianapolis
were further imperiled by his crash at NHIS, where he aggravated
his injuries when he had to climb out of his flaming wreck without
assistance and hop on one leg to the nearby retaining wall on the
frontstretch. When he arrived at Indy, Labonte could not get back
into the car and was forced to return to North Carolina for a
doctor's visit.
</P>
<P>
   He came back to Indianapolis intending to race Saturday. But,
after practicing in his No. 5 Chevy on Friday, Labonte made his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt much better today, but I just didn't feel 100
percent,'' he said. ``We talked with Dr. (Jerry) Petty (in
Charlotte) and he said I could run one lap in the race, if I wanted
to, and then come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident it's not a lingering problem, but I decided
I'm going to sit out (the Brickyard) and then Watkins Glen (next
Sunday), then pick up where we left off. We'll try to start another
streak.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It runs in the family
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bodine, Geoffrey and Brett's baby brother, climbed into the
No. 5 Kellogg's Corn Flakes Chevrolet and barely cracked the top 25
with a lap of 178.770 m.p.h. in the first round of pole
qualifications Thursday. He started 25th ahead of his brothers, who
started alongside each other on Row 13 in the 26th and 27th
positions . . . Brazilian-born drivers Cristiano da Matta and
Rubens Barrichello recorded their first victories last Sunday. Da
Matta, a seven-time winner on the Indy Lights circuit, won on the
CART FedEx Championship circuit at Chicago, surging to the lead
late in the race when Juan Montoya's gallop came to an halt because
of an electrical problem. Barrichello piloted his Ferrari to a
triumph in a Formula One race in Germany, where he sobbed as he
stood atop the podium. ``It was incredible,'' da Matta said. ``I've
won some races in other series, but this was just a different
emotion. And I'm so happy for Rubens. Both of us knew our day would
come.''

AYALA'S GAMBLE WAS RISKY BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you wonder why nobody fights anybody anymore, if
it can be avoided, think of Tony Ayala with tears in his eyes,
slumped in his corner, apologizing to his father for breaking his
hand and having to quit against Yory Boy Campas last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's comeback, after a 16-year layoff in a New Jersey prison
after a rape conviction, was going well until that fight in San
Antonio. He had won five straight over powder puff opponents, was
pulling in about $200,000 a fight, and was selling tickets in his
hometown and haven, and slowly building new interest in an old
story.
</P>
<P>
   It was just a matter of time, if he kept winning, before the
37-year-old Ayala got the title shot he missed out on in 1982 or,
failing that, a least a chance for a big-money fight; his story and
his criminal record were too hard for the public and pay television
to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   But finally El Torito wanted to test himself. He wanted to get
in with some iron, although the belief was that Campas's iron had
been well pounded in his recent fights, several of which ended with
his early resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, veteran trainer and broadcaster Teddy Atlas was surprised
when Ayala agreed to the fight because ``Campas is not as shot as
people think. It's a dangerous fight for Ayala at a time when he
doesn't have to take the risk. He could just keep fighting anyone
down in San Antonio for $200,000 a fight until he gets into
position for what they want _ a big-money fight. It's an unusual
decision for a guy to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's handlers probably were buoyed by the sight of Campas
being stopped by Oba Carr in March, but they also knew Campas could
punch with power. What they didn't know was that his head would be
hard enough to break Ayala's hand in the second round and his
punches would land often enough to nearly close Ayala's eyes by the
end of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Six rounds Ayala fought with a broken left hand, alternately
trying to widen a cut over Campas's eye and then trying to protect
his own swollen eyes and hand. In the end, Ayala's hand gave out
before Campas's heart and Ayala's father stopped the fight as Ayala
sat on his stool crying softly.
</P>
<P>
   From the fourth round, Ayala's father urged him to quit but he
refused. Ayala never quit. Not in that fight and not on himself.
</P>
<P>
   He is now an old fighter who must start over because he picked
the wrong guy on the wrong night. He must start over because he
took a chance, a chance that will keep him out of the ring until
December.
</P>
<P>
   He says he'll begin again because this setback was ``petty''
compared with what he faced in prison. That's true.
</P>
<P>
   Just like it's true most fighters won't gamble on themselves the
way Tony Ayala did.

   Floyd Mayweather Sr. is having better luck than his son. He was
just hired as lead trainer of talented Erik Morales, the undefeated
World Boxing Council super bantamweight champion. Morales, coming
off a stirring battle with Marco Antonio Barrera, will challenge
Guty Espadas Sept. 2 for the WBC featherweight title. Mayweather
replaces Morales's father, Jose, because Mayweather is considered a
defensive genius. One thing he taught his son, Floyd Jr., before
their split was how not to get hit. If there is one skill Morales
does not possess, that's it, but Mayweather believes he has the
athletic ability to learn defense. If Morales can master defense to
complement his firepower, he'll win a lot of title belts before
he's through . . . Young Floyd is having problems of his own
making. The most talented 130-pound fighter in the world is
learning a harsh lesson. He's learning boxing doesn't need him.
Mayweather created a storm by calling a $12 million long-term offer
from HBO ``a slave contract,'' dumped his father-manager-trainer in
favor of ex-rap impressario James Prince, and irritated his
promoter to the point Top Rank refused to allow him to fight on the
Roy Jones Jr.-Eric Harding card Sept. 9 in New Orleans.
Mayweather's only appearance since last September was March 18,
when he defeated Goyo Vargas. Nobody noticed his presence then or
his absence now. He could not understand why his promoters did so
much more for Oscar De La Hoya, forgetting that De La Hoya earned
more income in one pay-per-view fight than Mayweather's produced in
his entire career. Mayweather learned what all this means when he
attended a press conference a week ago in New York announcing his
participation on the Jones card. A day later, Bob Arum, who still
holds Mayweather's promotional rights, could not reach a settlement
with Jones's promoter, Murad Muhammad. So Floyd Mayweather Jr. sits
some more. Muhammad acknowledged he never spoke to Arum about
getting a release to use Mayweather, dealing directly with Prince
and the fighter, apparently under the mistaken impression he could
work it out with Arum later. But things get worked out in boxing
only when all sides want them worked out, and at the moment few
people care about the problems Mayweather has created for himself.
Proof of that is everywhere, including on the Jones card, where
another Arum fighter, World Boxing Association featherweight
champion Freddie Norwood, will fight for Muhammad against Smoke
Gainer, a close friend of Jones. Arum had no trouble making a deal
there. Although Muhammad claimed he felt bad for Mayweather and
felt Arum was not acting in his fighter's best interest, he also
made clear he wasn't ready to go to war over Mayweather's services.
``We don't want trouble,'' Muhammad said. So a talented young man
sits for nearly a year and no one notices but his creditors. He has
no trainer since firing his father, no big-time TV contract and no
one rushing to give him one since he turned down that $12 million
deal. Don't feel sorry for Floyd Mayweather Jr. When all this
began, he listened to no one but the sound of his own voice . . .
Once again, boxing's TV players seem hellbent on hurting the sport.
Jones finishes up his contract with HBO Sept. 9 on a pay-per-view
card against Harding that seems likely to end up with Jones
fighting for nothing. TVKO, HBO's pay-per-view arm, wouldn't give
Jones a guarantee because he wouldn't extend his contract and since
he's the promoter, he must foot about a $900,000 bill. To make
money, the fight has to sell to around 60,000 homes. It would be
lucky if 60,000 homes that have HBO tuned in for this fight, as
great as Jones is. But give Jones some credit, too. Part of the
reason he could lose his shirt is that he told a fighter he
manages, David Izon, to sign to fight Mike Tyson Sept. 8 on HBO
rival Showtime. Izon stands to make $650,000 if it comes off. Tyson
has yet to agree and he always pulls out of every fight at least
once, so maybe there won't be a conflict, but Jones is ready to
take the fall if there is. That says he's a loyal friend, good
manager, and lousy businessman . . . Izon, by the way, seems to be
the perfect foil for Tyson. He's been knocked out by David Tua and
Michael Grant and was getting blasted by Derrick Jefferson before
suddenly knocking Jefferson stiff . . . Speaking of Tyson, there is
already talk of a showdown with Andrew Golota Nov. 4 in Hong Kong,
which would be Tyson's first pay-per-view appearance since
returning to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits
</P>
<P>
   The planned Nov. 11 fight between Lennox Lewis and Tua in
Toronto is headed to purse bids because the sides cannot agree. Tua
has been offered $3.25 million but has demanded $4 million. A
Thursday deadline passed without Tua accepting the terms. If it
goes to purse bid, Tua will get 25 percent of the total with Lewis
receiving the rest . . . Fernando Vargas is set to fight Ross
Thompson Aug. 26 but says it is difficult to focus on defense of
his International Boxing Federation junior middleweight title
knowing he has a Dec. 2 date with Felix Trinidad for big money.
``It's hard to get up for a fight like this but I have to because I
know after this I get Trinidad.'' Only, of course, if he gets by
Thompson (24-3-1), who doesn't seem to pose much of a problem.
Although a deal has not been finalized, both fighters have
basically agreed to the significant terms, so all Vargas (19-0, 17
KO's) has to do is win . . . Evander Holyfield was asked last week
if he thought he won a rematch with Lewis. ``It's not what I
thought because I did win,'' Holyfield said. ``If you look at the
fight and judge it, you'll see that I controlled the fight.'' He
did? Holyfield fights John Ruiz Saturday for the vacant WBA title.
The winner may get a shot with Tyson . . . Anybody still think
Julio Cesar Chavez belonged in the same ring with Kostya Tszyu?
Shame on the WBC and its president, Jose Sulaiman. If Chavez needed
money that bad, why didn't Sulaiman give him some phony job with
the organization rather than a No. 1 ranking?

BOURQUE GIVES TRADE THUMBS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has been gone for five months but it still seems strange to
think of Ray Bourque with the Colorado Avalanche. However, as much
of an icon as Bourque is in Boston, the move to the Rocky Mountains
very much agrees with the veteran defenseman. He has found renewed
life in his new home. Had he remained with the Bruins, it's
extremely likely he'd be retired now rather than gearing up for his
22d professional season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about what could've been, but the facts are, if I
would've finished here last year, I don't know if I would've played
another year,'' said Bourque. ``It just couldn't end like that for
me. It would've just ended with that sour feeling, just nothing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of waiting for that inevitable bitter end, Bourque asked
to be traded to a Stanley Cup contender and the Bruins complied in
March. He wanted a chance to win what has eluded him as well as the
opportunity to find out how much he had left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a major decision, going out, trying to compete to win
something and (revitalize) my career,'' said Bourque. ``And those
things happened. That's what I was looking for. That's how I want
to end my career, not with my head down and not feeling good about
the way I was playing or how the team was doing. I had to get into
a situation which was a positive one for me. Last year (in Boston)
just wasn't positive here with the club and the injuries and all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as he looked forward to a new challenge, he did head
west with a heavy heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to leave, I didn't want to go anywhere,'' he
said. ``But for my best interests and my game and just the feeling
I've always played with and how I love playing the game, it wasn't
going to happen here. I went (to the Avalanche) and everything I
was looking for happened. I'm excited about the game and next year,
and that's how it should be. I still feel bad about leaving. I've
had so many great memories here and a great relationship with the
fans and it was a fun organization to play for, for the most part,
because we've been competitive and we've had some fun and some good
years, but I can't say that was the case last year. For me, I
needed a change and it was a tough one to make, but looking back,
it was a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque had the opportunity to become an unrestricted free agent
July 1 but rather than test the market, he came to terms on a deal
with the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked my situation there and I knew going back there, there
was some kind of unfinished business,'' said Bourque, referring to
Colorado's loss to Dallas in the Western Conference finals. ``I
thought we could've gotten to the (Stanley Cup) finals and came
close. Next year, I think we'll be there again. I was really liking
the situation I was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   As happy as he was at the end, Bourque acknowledged that after
more than 20 years with one team, it took some time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the ice, it happened pretty quick, but off the ice, it was
very tough,'' he said. ``It took me probably three or four weeks to
feel comfortable with myself, the change and the move and that
whole thing. You go through a lot of emotions and a lot of
different thoughts come through your mind. Not having my family and
all that was hard. It took about three or four weeks and then
everything fell into place.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins signed free agent defenseman Paul Coffey,
president/general manager Harry Sinden said he had been interested
in making an offer to Bourque. He said he didn't have the chance,
however, because Bourque never became a free agent. Bourque said he
didn't have any knowledge of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think there was any openings there,'' he said.
``I never really heard anything, not the slightest comment or
whatever in terms of them possibly offering me a contract, not that
they were allowed to talk to me until July 1. But I would've been
surprised. I kind of had my mind set with Colorado, that if it
could work out there then I probably wouldn't get to free agency. I
really didn't think all that much about it. Their GM (Pierre
Lacroix) said he'd get back to me within a week and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Coffey signing, Bourque said he was surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit, like a lot of people,'' he said. ``The
power play, they don't really have anybody back there and I think
he'll help out in that situation. I hope it works out for him and
for them. He's been a great player, so we'll have to wait and see.
People can look at it in two ways, but if Paul Coffey plays the way
he's capable of, he's going to help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bourque certainly will help the Avalanche. The way
everything has worked out, he has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look back,'' he said. ``I'm just looking forward. It
would've been perfect and nice to finish here, but it wasn't meant
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeward bound?
</P>
<P>
   Word around the league is that injured center Eric Lindros will
land in his native Toronto. Lindros effectively cut his ties to the
Flyers by rejecting an $8.5 million qualifying offer that included
an $85,000 minor league clause, and he remains a restricted free
agent. Lindros, who suffered four concussions in a five-month span
last season and six in the last 28 months, is probably out of any
lineup until December or January, and most likely will change teams
via a trade rather than an offer sheet that would cost a team five
first-round draft picks. Others reportedly bidding for Lindros's
services are the Rangers, Kings, and Lightning. Maple Leafs
assistant to the president Bill Watters indicated much would have
to happen for Lindros to end up there. ``You're talking about what
would be a very complex deal, which would include the risk
factor,'' said Watters. ``We're one of the teams Philly targeted
and we're flattered. But first you have to satisfy the Flyers with
a package of draft picks and/or players. Then you have to work with
the Lindros people on a contract.'' . . . The Canucks hired former
Blackhawks GM Bob Murray as a pro scout. Murray, 45, had spent more
than 25 years with the Blackhawks _ as a player, scout, director of
player personnel, assistant GM, and, finally, as GM after Bob
Pulford resigned in 1997.

</P>
<P>
   No big deal

<P>
   As talented as he is, right wing Alexsey Morozov had to settle
for a minimum raise from Pittsburgh after three so-so seasons.
Morozov was the Penguins' No. 1 pick in 1995. ``We were told by the
Penguins that they want him to be stronger,'' said Morozov's agent,
Jay Grossman. ``They want him to be able to win the battles you
need to win on the ice and fight through checks.'' Certainly sounds
reasonable . . . The Kings re-upped free agent center Ian
Laperriere, avoiding an arbitration hearing . . . No word yet on
what center Alexei Yashin is going to do. He sat out last season
rather than honor the final year of his contract with the Senators
that would have paid him $3.6 million. An arbitrator ruled that
Yashin still owes that final year until he can become a free agent.
But the bratty Yashin doesn't seem to care what the team thinks or
what the arbitrator rules. Unfortunately, Yashin's talent is such
an asset that it would make sense for the Senators to trade him in
order to get something back, but it would be great if he were
forced to sit out for the rest of his life. That might wake him up.

<P>
   Rekindling an old Flame
</P>
<P>
   The Calgary Flames finally settled on a coach last week, hiring
46-year-old Don Hay, a former Flames assistant. Hay, who coached
the Coyotes during the 1996-97 season, replaces former Bruins coach
Brian Sutter and promises a more uptempo approach. ``Every team in
the NHL plays such a strong defensive game now,'' said Hay, who
spent the last two years in junior hockey as GM/head coach of the
Western League's Tri-City Americans. ``In the last 10 years, the
emphasis has been placed on defense, so every coach and every
player has really done a good job with the defensive part of the
game. Now we have to do a good job with the offensive part of the
game. We have to make the offense more of a factor in our game.''
New Flames GM Craig Button said he wanted to take his time
choosing, and considered retaining Sutter. He also talked to
Avalanche assistant coach Bryan Trottier. Nashville assistant Brent
Peterson also was in the mix until he pulled himself out . . . Nice
to see Roger Neilson back in the NHL. The 66-year-old Neilson, who
was let go by the Flyers, has accepted an assistant coaching
position with Ottawa under Jacques Martin. Neilson underwent
treatment for cancer last year and said the illness is in
remission. ``We had great doctors in Philadelphia and they tell me
I'm in good shape,'' he said. ``I'm off all medications and I'm
working out regularly. I'm probably in better shape than I was
before this whole thing started.'' . . . 32 days to training camp.
Think Anson Carter, Joe Thornton, or Sergei Samsonov will be there
at the start? Me neither.

TREND IS TO PASS THE TORCH

<P>
   Yes, the Olympics are right after the US Open. And yes, they're
halfway around the world. And, yes, it's a long year. Still, the
refusal of several of the world's top tennis players (e.g. Pete
Sampras, Martina Hingis, Anna Kournikova) to play for their
countries points to a growing trend among professional athletes to
turn up their noses at the Games. It isn't just the tennis players.
Kobe Bryant said he wasn't interested in what would have been a
virtually certain gold medal with the US men's basketball team and
Shaquille O'Neal turned down a return trip. And Vlade Divac and
Aleksandar Djordjevic don't want to play for Yugoslavia, which is
expected to meet the US in the final. Too much of a time
commitment, they said.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is mind-boggling to rowers, archers,
weightlifters, and the thousands of other amateur athletes who
scrimp and sweat for a quadrennium to make a team. The pros not
only make millions a year, they also get free passes to Olympus. No
trials. Just say yes. Those pros who do, like Andre Agassi, realize
that the Games offer an incalculable payoff. ``To me, the Olympics
represent the core of what sports are all about _ human challenge
and triumph,'' said Agassi, who is returning to defend the title he
won in Atlanta. ``The reward is pride, not anything material.''

<P>
   Test hasn't passed yet
</P>
<P>
   That breakthrough test for banned EPO (erythropoietin) announced
last week by the International Olympic Committee isn't a done deal
for Sydney. The unprecedented urine-blood test still has to be
approved by the IOC's lawyers and by its executive board at the end
of the month. And questions abound: Is the test 100 percent
accurate? Will athletes in all sports be tested, or just from those
sports under suspicion (e.g. endurance sports such as cycling and
swimming)? Is the blood test too ``invasive,'' as many athletes
(especially Muslims) claim? ``The final victory against doping
needs to go in steps,'' conceded IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch. ``Many steps build stairs, and at the top of the stairs
is heaven.'' . . . There are nearly enough women requesting injury
waivers to next week's Olympic Gymnastics Trials at the FleetCenter
to fill the team _ Magnificent 7 veterans Shannon Miller and Jaycie
Phelps plus Jeannette Antolin, Amanda Stroud, and Stephanie Carter.
All of them will have to pass fitness tests at Bela Karolyi's
Houston ranch before getting an OK. Already approved for the men's
trials are Chris Young and Yewki Tomita.

   Hoping to make splash
</P>
<P>
   It's redemption time for Jenny Thompson at this week's Olympic
Swimming Trials in Indianapolis. After failing to qualify in an
individual event in 1996, Thompson has a shot at four (50-100-200
freestyle and 100 butterfly) plus three relays. The most intriguing
story, though, is sprinter Dara Torres trying for her fourth team
at 33 after being out of the pool for seven (yes, seven) years.
Torres could well earn a spot in the 50 and should at least make a
relay. Back for another go are Atlanta gold medalists Amy Van
Dyken, Tom Dolan, Brooke Bennett, Brad Bridgewater, and Beth
Botsford . . . Back on track, if gingerly, are Maurice Greene and
Michael Johnson after pulling up lame in the 200 at the Olympic
trials two weekends ago. Greene, who says his hamstring injury was
a cramp and not a pull, plans to run the 100 next weekend in
Zurich. Johnson is back training, but is iffy for Zurich . . . Why
did the Chinese turn thumbs-down on race walker Chen Yueling
competing for the US in Sydney after they'd granted waivers to
American badminton and table tennis players? Because Chen, who won
a gold medal for China in 1992, is still a contender. Though the
IOC requires waivers for any athlete wanting to compete for a new
country less than three years after they receive citizenship,
they're usually (but not automatically) granted. Cuba this year
nixed kayaker Angel Perez, who also had made the US team. Replacing
Chen will be Joanne Dow of Bedford, N.H., who was fourth at the
trials.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wakeup call?
</P>
<P>
   Warning bells are going off for the US Olympic women's soccer
team, which has lost three times this year to the Norwegians, who
will be its opening opponent Down Under. ``We lost to China at home
right before the World Cup and it was a great thing for us,'' mused
midfielder Julie Foudy after the Americans lost, 2-1, in Oslo last
weekend. Meanwhile, the banged-up US males salvaged a 1-0 victory
over the Bolton Wanderers last weekend with only nine players on
the field for the final half-hour. For 10 minutes, while injured
midfielder Joey DiGiamarino was being tended to, the Americans were
down to eight . . . Getting named to the US Olympic men's road
cycling team by the coaches last week made up for the travel
nightmare that kept Fred Rodriguez out of the May trials. After bad
weather stranded him in San Francisco for an entire day, Rodriguez
missed his connecting flight in Dallas by 15 minutes and couldn't
get off the standby list for the last flight to Jackson, Miss.,
that would have gotten him to the starting line. ``I begged the
airline and told them that I had to make the Olympics and this was
one of my only chances,'' Rodriguez said. ``But nothing worked.''
Happy ending, too, for Johnny Bairos, who was added to the track
cycling team after recuperating from a horrific crash in June in
which he broke his jaw in two places, fractured a kneecap, and
damaged both sinus cavities . . . Except for Monica Tranel-Michini
(who is rowing the single), odds are that the US Olympic women's
eight will feature the same faces who won the silver medal at last
year's World Rowing Championships _ Linda Miller, Amy Martin, Betsy
McCagg, Katie Maloney, Sarah Jones, Torrey Folk, Amy Fuller, and
coxswain Raj Shah. Lianne Nelson, who missed qualifying in the
pair, probably will replace Michini and may stroke. With the roster
deadline barely a week off, the men's lightweight four is still a
scramble. The incumbents (Tom Auth, Paul Teti, Marc Schneider, and
Bill Carlucci) are in the mix, as is Harvard grad Greg Ruckman . .
. The man who vowed four years ago that we could shoot him if we
ever saw him around a racing shell again is going back to Olympus
for a shot at a fifth gold. Great Britain's Steve Redgrave, who
will row in the ``Fab Four'' in Sydney at 38, would be only the
second athlete to do it in five straight Games. Hungarian fencer
Aladar Gerevich managed six in a row between 1932 and 1960 despite
an eight-year hiatus for World War II.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly awesome
</P>
<P>
   Goose eggs are looming ad infinitum for US Olympic softball
pitcher Lisa Fernandez, who has hurled four consecutive perfect
games. Her teammates, meanwhile, are 90-0 since 1998 and have
outscored rivals, 300-2, on their current exhibition tour . . .
After pulling out of last year's world championships because they
claimed the judges were hosing them, the Cuban boxing team is
talking trash again. ``We are going to clean up,'' bragged eternal
coach Alcides Sagarra. ``What we want is the national hymn played
12 times and our flag raised 12 times.'' Slim chance of that. The
Cubans, whose program has sagged in recent years, won only four
golds and two silvers in Atlanta. Two of their champions are back _
flyweight Maikro Romero (now a light fly) and heavyweight Felix
Savon, who is going for his third gold . . . Though the US Olympic
women's volleyball team is ranked only 10th in the world and has
just two Atlanta veterans (Tara Cross-Battle and Danielle Scott) on
the roster, it has a decent shot at surviving the prelims in
Sydney. All it needs to do is beat weak sisters Australia and Kenya
to make the quarterfinals . . . Nearly half of the US women's
Alpine ski team has gone AWOL from the mandatory summer camp in
Utah, saying that a month of team-building and workouts is too
much. So Megan Gerety, Katie Monahan, Sarah Schleper, and Kirsten
Clark went home . . . While skeptics were fretting about whether
Sydney's train system could withstand the Olympic onslaught, they
should have been worrying about the planes. Even though the
government spent two years and $351 million improving the airport,
the facility has been shut down twice in a month with power outages
in the control tower.

OLERUD: NOMAR HAS WHAT IT TAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is one of the fringe benefits that comes with having been
the last player to be hitting .400 this deep into the season: You
get to be asked about the chances of the next guy.
</P>
<P>
   So John Olerud was hardly surprised when a visitor from Boston
strolled into the Mariners clubhouse last week to solicit his
opinion on Nomar Garciaparra and his run at .400.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Olerud said, he believes Garciaparra has a legitimate shot
at becoming the first player since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941 to
crack the .400 barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been hitting for four months now and he's right there,''
Olerud said. ``He has to stay hot for another two months. That's a
long time to stay hot, but he's already done it for four months, so
it's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud was hitting .400 as late as Aug. 2, 1993, before tailing
off to .363. The only player to have gone deeper into the season at
.400 was George Brett of the Royals, who was at .400 on Sept. 20,
1980, before finishing at .390.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, of course, doesn't want to discuss the subject, but
it's impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to have people asking questions about
it,'' said Olerud. ``It's in the forefront of your mind, but you
just try to downplay it as much as you can. But if you're still
there the middle of September, then you talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, a low-key, affable sort who left the Mets as a free
agent in order to return to his native Washington, wasn't the type
who was going to allow his hair to fall out because of his batting
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt any pressure to do it because I never felt like I
was the guy who was going to do it,'' he said. ``I was just having
a real good year. I just wanted the chance to swing the bat the way
I had been for as long as I could and so that's the way I went at
it. I was going to keep going and if it was meant to happen it will
happen, and if not, then it's not. Just try to take good swings and
see how it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the approach you have to take. I'm sure that
Nomar doesn't feel like he has to be the guy to do it. He's just
going to try and have as good a year as he can. That's what I would
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud smiled when told that Williams, at his Hitters' Hall of
Fame last year, said he thought Garciaparra could become the best
player of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real big compliment,'' Olerud said. ``He's having a
great year, and hopefully he's able to enjoy it for what it is, a
great year. Yeah, I enjoyed (1993). There was a lot of talking to
the media, which was a downside, but the upside was that I was
having a great year. It was just fun coming to the ballpark knowing
you're going to take good swings and you're going to hit the ball
hard. That makes it a lot easier to go to the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud doesn't know Garciaparra, other than to say hello to him
when he's playing first base and Garciaparra reaches safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's a very aggressive hitter,'' Olerud said. ``If
he gets a pitch in his zone, he's going to hit it. And he's got a
real big zone. He covers the plate real well, he handles off-speed
pitches well, and he recognizes the pitches well. He's not the type
of guy who is easy to pitch around, and if it's a decent pitch to
hit or he can get a bat on the ball, he's going to take a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a little different in that I'm looking for a
good pitch to hit, and if the pitchers make good quality pitches
I'm going to fall behind in the count and I'll be fighting pitches
off. Nomar, he's ready from the moment he gets up there for a pitch
in his zone. I like that approach. I like being aggressive and
being ready for your pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will it happen again?
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, who bumped an umpire during a July 15 tirade and
was suspended, got into a shouting match with his manager Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question today is: Will he go off again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the traits that make him a great player have led to
trouble for him from time to time,'' said Houston Astros general
manager Gerry Hunsicker, who as an executive with the New York Mets
was instrumental in the 1994 trade that brought Everett to the Mets
from the Florida Marlins. Hunsicker then acquired him for the
Astros in 1997 and last December traded Everett to the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mainly his competitiveness and his lack of fear of anyone
or anything. At times, he can lose control. As he has matured and
grown up, those times have become fewer and fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's just somebody who has the ability to lose control of
his emotions. His background shows that there are times when he
loses control and it's gotten him in trouble. It's just one aspect
of his personality. Some aspects of his personality get him in
trouble. They can also make him a great competitor. I still
maintain Carl is a good person. He needs a support system and an
environment that allows him to perform without a lot of stress and
distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   After all the controversy Everett endured in New York in '97,
few teams were willing to take a chance on him. An exception was
Houston. ``I felt with myself and (hitting coach) Tommy McCraw, we
had a support system in place,'' Hunsicker said. ``And this is a
much less scrutinized environment we have here in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of the fact this organization really helped
Carl get over the hump and helped to lay the foundation for the
player Carl became.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Astros players, including star first baseman Jeff
Bagwell, said Everett was their most valuable player last season,
although in Houston players took notice of Everett's penchant for
tardiness, which surfaced again this year in Boston. But Astros
manager Larry Dierker chose not to make an issue of it, just as
Jimy Williams has said it is not an issue with the Red Sox, even
though Everett did something here he never did in Houston, arriving
so late he was not on the field when his group took batting
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Until Everett dropped the appeal of his 10-game suspension for
his July tirade, the players' union was prepared to seek a
reduction in the penalty by arguing that in a previous incident,
Vince Coleman was suspended seven games after drawing blood from an
umpire's face when his batting helmet struck the umpire during an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   But Everett decided to drop the appeal for reasons he has not
made public. ``We want to let this thing die out,'' said Larry
Reynolds, his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Everett hurt his right hand when he punched the bat rack in the
Red Sox dugout during his explosion and did not play in two games
before beginning to serve his suspension. But both he and Red Sox
officials, including manager Williams, have insisted the wrist was
not a factor in his decision to drop his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Carl's position and the team's position that it made
sense to serve it at this point in the schedule, instead of later
when the team is deeper in the playoff race,'' said one baseball
official with knowledge of the case. ``And from Carl's personal
perspective, he wants this thing to go away. He didn't want to
prolong it, which would only exacerbate the rehabilitation of his
reputation, and a lot of that already has been undone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker was asked if it was possible that Everett may have
other incidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent incident reinforces that there's part of his
personality that from time to time will surface,'' Hunsicker said.
``He needs somebody to be there in his corner, to give him a
support system. If there's not a support system in place, the
potential is there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Case closed: He's a keeper
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette's greatest find this season, hands down, has been
Hipolito Pichardo, who has come back from elbow surgery that caused
him to miss all of the '99 season to become an indispensable member
of the Sox bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me he was a two-pitch pitcher,'' said pitching coach
Joe Kerrigan. ``Fastball and a splitter. But he throws a slider
that is just as good as his splitter.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question, Kerrigan said, that Pichardo has closer's
stuff. ``And the control, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have been cautious about pitching Pichardo on
back-to-back days, but his workload of late, which includes
pitching in three of Boston's last four games entering Saturday,
suggests that concern is waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws a 92-94-mile-an-hour with nasty sink, straight-down
sink that you don't see too often,'' Kerrigan said. ``And he throws
a heavy ball, the kind of ball that pitchers use to break bats when
guys swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox may be perfectly content to leave Pichardo in a setup
role, but if his arm is sound and he continues to pitch as well as
he has, the Sox might have reason to think about converting Derek
Lowe back to a starter next season. Lowe was an All-Star this
season as a closer, but he recently admitted he hasn't abandoned
the idea of starting again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd still like to get a shot someday,'' Lowe said. ``It would
be hard to leave a position in the bullpen where I've had success
the last two years to go back to doing something where I didn't
have success (0-7 as a starter for the Sox), but I'd like to think
I'd do better this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe things will change in a year or two if (Rod) Beck and
Flash (Gordon) come back. It may be easier to find a guy who
pitches an inning than another starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to go by whatever they say _ setup, close, start. My
goal is just to spend a long time here while they use me however
they want. That's one of the advantages of having a long-term deal,
you don't care how you're used as long as we do whatever needs to
be done to get us to the playoffs. I've really enjoyed being the
closer the last two years, but I'm never going to say never (about
starting).''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Lowe would like to do, he said, is be an All-Star
again. ``I wish all players could go through it and see what it's
like, what a great feeling it is to be there,'' he said. ``It
really is one of my goals to get back because it was such a special
feeling. I've got to thank Joe Torre for picking me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt to ask
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Giants general manager Brian Sabean said, he did ask
Phillies GM Ed Wade whether Curt Schilling would add the Giants to
his list of teams to which he'd accept a trade. ``That was our aim
before the break, during the break, and after the break, but it
wasn't going to happen. We weren't the only team to ask. There's
nothing we could have done because we tried.'' On how Schilling
winding up in Arizona will impact the race in the NL West, Sabean
said: ``We can't worry about that. We're thankful we've got the
roster we've got. They're going to have to make do with what
they've got. It's all going to be settled on the field. Obviously,
they've got two starters who can cause some problems. But we've got
eight games left against them at the end of the season, and three
with LA. I'm sure LA will duke it out to the end and make it a
three-team race. Sabean on Giants closer Robb Nen, who set a record
for saves in a month with 14 in July: ``He's throwing better than
he ever has, including his time here.'' . . . How durable is Craig
Biggio, the Astros' gritty second baseman who went on the disabled
list for the first time in 13 seasons after tearing the medial
collateral and anterior cruciate ligaments in his left knee last
week? He had played with a muscle tear in his shoulder and a torn
ligament in his right ankle . . . David Segui, who has been playing
in the outfield since his trade from Texas to Cleveland, admits he
tried to come back too quickly after he had a metal plate
surgically implanted in his left foot last winter. The plate has
since snapped, Segui said, and he can hear it clicking when he runs
. . . Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Plaschke laments the passing
of another tradition at Dodger Stadium, where the ushers have given
up their boaters and uniforms for designer golf shirts and sweater
vests. The clothing company's name is visible, Plaschke said,
making it just another form of in-stadium advertising . . . Expos
catcher Chris Widger criticized the team for trading standout
outfielder Rondell White, who was sent to the Cubs, opening up a
spot for Milton Bradley. ``Vladimir Guerrero is our superstar, Jose
Vidro is our All-Star, but the person who makes this team go is
Rondell,'' Widger said. ``Everybody in this locker room knows it.
It's gone now. Our biggest building block is gone.'' . . . Mike
Lansing, the Sox' new second baseman, on the sudden collapse of his
former team, the Rockies, who went from first to fourth in a span
of about three weeks last month: ``I still don't have any
explanation for it,'' he said. ``We went into San Francisco and
lost a doubleheader and it seems like panic set in. I don't know
who panicked, if it was the players or the coaches. I don't think
it was the manager. Obviously, when you lose 12 in a row you're
going to try different things. But we got to the point where guys
were saying, `How can we not lose?' And they started playing not to
lose. I'm not going to say anything bad about the Rockies or Buddy
(Bell, the manager). He helped me have a great deal after I had
back surgery and missed last year.'' . . . Hunsicker on Adam
Everett, the shortstop who went to Houston in the Carl Everett
deal: ``We expected to get a polished defensive player and we did.
He has great instincts, and we believe in time he may become a
solid all-around shortstop.'' But Hunsicker concedes it may take
more time than originally anticipated. He believes the Red Sox may
have rushed Adam Everett offensively when they had him play at
Double A last season, and then the Astros had him start the year in
Triple A, where he was overmatched offensively. ``He's probably at
least a year away from having a chance to compete on the major
league level.'' And Moises Alou, Hunsicker said, was never
available, not at the price teams were willing to pay. ``So much
was written at the outset, but we were never trying aggressively to
move Alou as was reported,'' he said. ``A number of teams thought
we were going to dump him. But we made it very clear that he was an
All-Star-caliber player and we needed something pretty good back.''
. . . A law enforcement official said Friday that there are no new
developments involving Manny Alexander in connection with the
illegal steroids found in the glove compartment of his Mercedes
after he loaned it to a bat boy.

MCCARTY HAS ROOM TO GROW WITH MUSIC CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ A single, low-watt bulb keeps most of the voice room
and its padded walls in shadow. The lone shaft of light shines on a
towering microphone just tall enough to fit 6-foot-10-inch Walter
McCarty. Lyrics scribbled over Celtics stationery rest on a nearby
music stand. In a basement recording studio at his home, McCarty
works on finishing his debut CD titled ``Situations.'' Rhythm and
blues music fills the control room. Dance beats and rap give the
tracks a hip-hop feel and, hopefully, popular appeal.
</P>
<P>
   With their chorus of doubts about an NBA player producing a
successful album, the skeptics can drown out the smooth tenor of
the Celtic forward. But not for long. Given a few minutes to
showcase his vocal talents, McCarty dispels any notion that he
might be a music dilettante. Wearing headphones and standing at the
microphone, McCarty sings with his eyes closed. He nods approvingly
with each down beat. He takes his music seriously, sometimes
spending 13 hours at a time in the studio refining a cut.
</P>
<P>
   During the last year and a half, McCarty pieced together
``Situations,'' drawing on his experiences in the NBA for some
subject matter and working around the Celtics' schedule. The lyrics
contain references to the league's fast-paced lifestyle, wealthy
players, and the price of sports celebrity. But McCarty believes
his audience will relate to the overriding music discussions of
relationships, dating, and partying.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty claims his NBA career and budding music career
complement each other. Without his lucrative contract and a day job
that leaves lots of down time, McCarty could not fund his music
company, IceStorm Productions, or afford a private studio. The
music gives McCarty a way to relax and gain perspective on
basketball. The CD gives McCarty a creative outlet outside
basketball and provides a rare insight into the life of an NBA
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``My music side brings out more of me than basketball does,''
said McCarty. ``People don't really get to know Walter McCarty the
Celtic. You can only get so close to NBA basketball players,
whether it's on the court or off the court. Shaking hands and
signing autographs, that's pretty much all the interaction you'll
get.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm doing this music thing, for me, it's more personal.
People get to know me better. I get to express myself. After a
game, you only talk about basketball. A lot of people know I like
to sing, but they don't know what's behind the big curtain. This
album opens up the curtain and says, `This is Walter.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heroic efforts
</P>
<P>
   With two different sides of his personality playing on different
stages, McCarty envisions himself ``being Superman and Clark
Kent.'' Not that the 3.8 points per game and 1.8 rebounds he
averaged last season in just over 14 minutes a contest were
Superman-like numbers. Not that he bumbles and stutters his way
through life off the court with an endearing nerdiness.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison to the comic book superhero works on a very basic
level. In a Celtics uniform, the aggressive, physical side takes
over. In the studio, the sensitive, emotional side of McCarty shows
up, hesitating to ask a girl to dance in one song and worrying
about the poor judgment of a female friend in another. Still,
parallels between the player and musician remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the studio, time goes by so fast, especially
when you're doing something that you love,'' said McCarty. ``It's
like if you're out there having a good game and you know your shots
are going in, you don't want the game to end. It's the same way
with time in the studio. I'll just come in after games and put in
five or six hours in the studio. Basketball is my priority, but
sometimes I (sacrifice my basketball for my music). I could easily
be in the gym every day, instead of being in the studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowded with high-tech equipment and tangles of power cords, the
10-by-12-foot studio control room is much more than Superman's
telephone booth. And the transformation from McCarty the basketball
player to McCarty the musician is much less dramatic. Wearing a
Celtics T-shirt, sweatpants, and black cap turned backward, he
ducks his head under a door frame and moves quickly down a flight
of stairs to the home of IceStorm Productions.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty sits at a keyboard and fools around with a few chords,
playing by ear without any formal training. (He also has taught
himself guitar and bass.) An enviable collection of recording and
mixing equipment extends to his right. Five sound modules that help
layer the tracks for each song. Two drum machines. Two CD players.
Two tape decks. A microphone voice compressor. Two external effects
machines for reverbs and choruses. Three digital recorders. Five
large speakers. One digital mixing board. One closed-circuit
television monitor to watch the recording artist, since a bathroom
separates the control room from the voice room.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple but impressive setup for an independent production
company that employs four people and competes in a billion-dollar
industry against other independent labels with million-dollar
budgets. ``It's a business, not a hobby for anybody in the house,''
said Frank Williams, a college friend of McCarty who serves as vice
president of operations of IceStorm and co-owner of the company.
When production intensifies, Williams lives in the McCarty
townhouse along with other contributing employees (occasionally six
or seven at one time). It's a music fraternity, with McCarty the
majority owner of IceStorm.
</P>
<P>
   The production company, whose name comes partly from McCarty's
college nickname, ``Ice,'' emphasizes collaborative efforts. The
creative minds in the house feed off each other. ``Situations'' is
the first major undertaking for IceStorm and, in an unusual step,
McCarty and crew will not only produce the CD, but also handle
promotion and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure I come in and let everybody know this is
something I'm serious about and put a lot of effort into,'' said
McCarty. ``I went about it the same way as somebody else trying to
make it in the music business would go about it. I tried to get the
best producers, struggled trying to come up with songs or stuff
that people will listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Melodies, messages
</P>
<P>
   The debut CD begins with a two-minute interlude, a melodic
message to the listeners that sets the tone for the songs that
follow. The situation is McCarty ``talking to a girl, all girls''
about the pressures of being 26 with money and fame. He doesn't
want the people he meets to go out of their way to impress him or
act differently in his presence.
</P>
<P>
   How many times do I have to break it down to you?
</P>
<P>
   Living two lives in this world is some crazy stuff to do . . .
</P>
<P>
   Who are you trying to test?
</P>
<P>
   Please don't make me flex
</P>
<P>
   I sure don't need your stress
</P>
<P>
   In my situation
</P>
<P>
   As with the opening lines, most of the NBA-related content
remains veiled. From heartbreak and one-night stands to pulsing
club scenes, McCarty and his collaborators at IceStorm strived to
write about experiences common to everyone. Each song is a
self-contained story, some derived from real life experiences
traveling in the NBA and some fed by imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In every song and interlude, McCarty adopts the voice of the
narrator. At times, he sounds apologetic and kindhearted. At times,
he can come across as flaunting an extravagant lifestyle. (``If
it's on tonight, jump in the Benz,'' he sings at one particularly
raucous party moment. ``Let's ride, if the feeling's right. If the
Benz is too small or too tight, I've got a Navigator. The Navi's
just right.'')
</P>
<P>
   Before its yet unnamed early fall release date, ``Situations''
should grow to a compilation of 10 or 11 full songs with three or
four short interludes that announce thematic changes. McCarty
currently is finishing the last few tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The CD) is kind of what his lifestyle is,'' said Marc
Silverburg, co-executive producer of ``Situations'' and co-owner of
IceStorm. ``Naturally, he is an NBA guy. He's a bachelor, so it's
got a bachelor's feel. It's also got a searching feel. He's a
bachelor and he's searching, but during his search, he's having a
lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial interlude also addresses the skeptics and music
purists who might be offended by yet another athlete financing his
way into a music career. The recorded reply by McCarty to critics:
Listen first, then judge. In recent years there have been some
notable, rather than ignominious, contributions from NBA players.
``Shaq Diesel,'' the debut CD of Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal,
went platinum in 1993. Former player and talented jazz bassist
Waymon Tisdale signed a seven-year contract with MoJazz records in
1995. McCarty dreams of going gold or platinum, but would be
content selling 100,000 copies of his CD.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Serious business
</P>
<P>
   The thoughtful r &AMP; b style of McCarty's debut album and
influences of Boyz II Men and Brian McKnight should help
distinguish it from the less-serious efforts of other athletes, the
hastily compiled rap collections and ill-advised stage romps.
Unwilling to parlay friendships made through the NBA (especially
during his rookie year in New York) with such music business
magnates as Sean ``Puffy'' Combs into musical contributions,
McCarty drew from lesser-known talents (Ed O.G. and Iayadonna) and
artists signed on with IceStorm (Black Coffey and Kymyra Moore).
Still, producer Dave ``Jam'' Hall, who has worked with Mariah
Carey, Mary J. Blige, and Madonna, saw enough promise in McCarty to
help produce ``Situations.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best evidence of McCarty's commitment to the project is
his life-long interest in music. Following his great-great-aunt, he
started singing in church choirs as a child and in a family group
with his cousin, brother, and sister. When he reached high school,
he performed in concert choir, receiving his share of solos and
attending Indiana state music competitions. Although he missed high
school concerts because of All-Star games and tournaments, his
interest in music continued at Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to listen to him for six years,'' said Celtics coach
Rick Pitino, who also coached McCarty in college. ``(He sings) at
parties, when we go on the road. Any time there was a piano in
college, he would play and sing. He always had talent. I remember
him singing the national anthem in high school and he did it in
college. We've been in some restaurants where he's taken over the
piano (in college). I knew he was a talented young man to the point
of an amateur, then the players told me his (debut) CD was
outstanding. Paul Pierce was telling me and Antoine Walker. And
they would go the opposite way, razz him a little bit and say it
wasn't good.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, he turned his college dorm room into a small studio
with a keyboard given to him by his mother and equipment rented
from the Doo Wop Shop in Lexington. At Kentucky, he learned the
basics of music production by experimentation, recording teammates
rapping and allowing recruits to sit down and sing. As word of the
dorm room studio spread, the roots of IceStorm Productions formed.
Years of friendship and partnership are behind ``Situations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I like to take my time and put out the nicest project,
the hottest project,'' said McCarty. ``That's what I've been trying
to do. When you start making records and if you've never done
records before, it is foreign. You have to go the extra mile to
make sure it's done the proper way, especially when you're doing it
independently. By doing our own research, we're doing it the way we
think it should be done. Right now, we think we're doing a heck of
a job.''
</P>
<P>
   With the NBA season fast approaching, McCarty and the creative
minds at IceStorm are putting in long studio hours to finish most
of the project before training camp. McCarty figures he has six
weeks to work through the kinks, polish the existing tracks, and
select the last few songs for the debut. A yet-to-be-chosen single
will be released in early September. A video shoot and promotional
tour will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-September, the focus for McCarty will shift to the Celtics.
More shooting and weightlifting. Less writing and recording. But
considering McCarty's serious interest in basketball and music,
there still will be a lot of mixing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we're professional basketball players, it doesn't
mean it's all we want to do with our lives,'' said McCarty. ``We do
have other lives, other loves. Some people get caught up in doing
just one thing. But I don't think you should look at yourself, your
life, as meant to do just one thing.''

LOUD RETURN INCLUDES SHOUTING MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day was practically gift-wrapped for him. The only thing
missing was a skywriter's calligraphy _ ``Welcome Back, Carl!''
hovering above Fenway Park. If Carl Everett simply had accepted
this gift of an afternoon, a lot of the overhyped madness
surrounding him would have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't accept, and so the madness continues. When will it
end? Well, no matter what spin you hear from the Red Sox, the truth
is that only one man (Everett) holds the answer to the question.
Jimy Williams doesn't know. Dan Duquette doesn't know. Everett's
teammates don't know. And the man who does know chose to leave the
park Saturday afternoon without saying much.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad he didn't show such verbal restraint earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Everett came off a 10-game suspension and immediately walked
into the middle of a ruckus. At about 10:30 a.m., 15 minutes before
the Red Sox held batting practice, Everett got into a loud, profane
argument with Williams. Both men are known for their unique
phraseology, but they weren't quite as original during their
confrontation in the manager's office. They were cussing each other
out with language that we've all heard before.
</P>
<P>
   After the brief eruption, Everett left the office cursing and
headed to the trainer's room. He returned and began watching
television. It would have been fitting if a WWF performance had
been on the screen, because that's exactly what this organization
is beginning to resemble. At least the wrestlers' act is scripted;
what excuse do Everett and his enablers (Williams and Duquette)
have?
</P>
<P>
   Following BP, Williams said that he would keep all information
``in house.'' He said that families sometimes have disagreements in
which the participants raise their voices. He gave a lot of vague
answers and nonanswers, but the most revealing one came when
someone asked if his beef with Everett was resolved. He did an
old-school lindyhop around a straight answer. Here's why: He
probably knows there will be no resolution this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Duquette regime has displayed a consistent distaste for
players who can't be controlled. Even if the players aren't out of
control, they are frowned upon if they can't be controlled. Nomar
Garciaparra may slam the team occasionally, but he shows up for
work on time and frustrates pitchers, making his attack on
management's decisions (Lou Merloni, Mike Stanley, the value of Dr.
Arthur Pappas) more palatable. Everett is the anti-Duquette player:
forever opinionated and fearless of any man . . . even the man who
gave him his sizable contract.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way Duquette and Williams can discipline him this
year and they know it. If they suspend him, they will hurt
themselves. If they don't suspend him, they will take such
nonaction before a group of judging clubhouse eyes, eyes that will
see that a double standard exists.
</P>
<P>
   None of that would have mattered if Everett had simply gone to
the office, taken the field, and played his brilliant game.
Everett, justifiably, complained that he was being skewered by the
media in the aftermath of his July 15 showdown with umpire Ronald
Kulpa. He said people were trying to portray him as a monster.
Obviously he is not a monster. Saturday, he was also not very
smart.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he began the dispute with Williams is irrelevant.
What he should be asking is why he allowed himself to be put in
this position. More than 31,000 people were at the park Saturday,
ready to file away the events of July 15. Some of those folks have
deep philosophical problems with Everett's actions that day, but
they also have a deep attachment to the Sox. They were prepared to
ignore personal philosophy and instead pursue pennant philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Everett wouldn't let them do it. Instead, he gave critics _ some
of whom surely lurk in his own clubhouse _ more ammunition to use
against him. Boston wanted to throw Everett a party Saturday.
Rather than enjoy it, he walked into the party and began cursing at
one of his biggest supporters. Williams is similar to some of those
fans in that he sees some things with which he doesn't agree, but
lets some of them slide because he wants to win.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is that Williams mentioned Everett's frequent
tardiness (that was a problem in Houston, too) and that angered the
outfielder. Even if Williams had said, ``Carl, you look like a sumo
wrestler when you wear those pants,'' Saturday was the day not to
respond publicly. Not only is it unprofessional, but this ragged
team already has enough to worry about without another Everett
incident.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that has Pedro Martinez, Tim Wakefield, and a
bunch of pitchers who are going through an I'm-a-reliever identity
crisis. When starters such as Ramon Martinez and Jeff Fassero can't
go more than six innings (combined) in the same week, it's a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that doesn't need the center fielder yelling at
the manager, even though those arguments happen often in baseball.
Everett may not need anger management classes, but he does need to
learn the arts of Timing and Knowing When To Fight With The Boss.
There are thousands of employees in North America who rip their
managers. Most often, they do it away from the office and away from
nosy media members. After reflecting on their rage, they usually
decide that it wasn't as serious as they originally thought.
</P>
<P>
   Everett should consider this.
</P>
<P>
   He talked with Tommy Harper, Wendell Kim, and Jose Offerman
after his blowup. There were whispers and closed-door meetings in
the clubhouse, up until game time. Harper, an extremely wise man,
was asked if he has become a liaison between Everett and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, and began to explain that he was talking to
Everett about hitting. After a while, he seemed to grow annoyed and
said, ``I don't want to talk about Carl anymore. If he doesn't want
to talk to (the media), then that's your problem. I'm not going to
speak for him.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the game began, Everett went 3 for 5 and smacked a
ninth-inning homer. The only redeeming element of the day was that
it reminded us of our contradictions. If the self-righteous Sox fan
finds Everett's summer behavior loathsome, will that same fan
continue to applaud his brilliant play?
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good day,'' Williams said. ``He hit the ball good.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no Jimy. Everett didn't have a good day. He had a day of
wasted energy. He also hit the ball very well. Maybe it was a good
day for Everett because he now knows that he has the organization
by its, ahem, tail. That must trouble the souls of Duquette and
Williams because there is nothing they can do about it.

REDSOX FALL IN FIELD OF SCREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confining his anger to the clubhouse, Carl Everett Saturday
thundered back to Fenway Park and proved how much the Red Sox
missed his bat, if not his temper.
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who began the day with a high-decibel shouting match
behind closed doors with manager Jimy Williams, capped his return
from a 10-game suspension with a ninth-inning home run that nearly
propelled the Sox to their second straight come-from-behind victory
against the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   But the rally died with the potential winning run at the plate,
as the Royals spoiled Everett's release from baseball's penalty
box, 7-5, before 31,441 in the Fens. He was suspended July 20 for a
July 15 tirade at Fenway involving plate umpire Ron Kulpa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big boost to the offense to have him back,'' said Rico
Brogna, the team's new first baseman. ``He can strike at any
time.''
</P>
<P>
   As Everett showed with his double off the Green Monster that
fell 2 feet short of the screen in the seventh inning, his 409-foot
homer in the ninth, and his verbal scrimmage with his boss. He made
his return in a nationally televised game three weeks after he
erupted on national TV in Kulpa's face.
</P>
<P>
   Everett refused to speak with reporters Saturday about his
doings on or off the field. And Williams would not discuss details
of their disagreement, which he described as ``a family feud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a family that ran smoothly every day,''
Williams said. ``Sometimes you have a little argument. Voices get
raised. You move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox tried to move on Saturday. But no one needed the
National Security Agency to crack the secret of their defeat.
Mediocre pitching, errant fielding, and missed scoring
opportunities can flummox even the happiest baseball family.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Rolando Arrojo, making his Fenway debut for the Sox,
provided a textbook lesson in pitching's pitfalls. In remaining
winless in his last seven starts for the Sox and the Colorado
Rockies, Arrojo allowed the leadoff batter to reach base in four of
the five innings he started, and all four scored.
</P>
<P>
   He threw more balls (44) than strikes (39), and before Bryce
Florie took over with two out and two on in the fifth, Arrojo
yielded four runs (one unearned) on seven hits, two walks, and a
wild pitch. The unearned run was the product of an uncharacteristic
fielding error by Brogna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched bad,'' Arrojo said through a translator, reliever
Rich Garces. ``I didn't have any command of my pitches. I just
pitched bad today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Sox bullpen, which has excelled most of the season,
muster a masterful outing.
</P>
<P>
   Florie was on the mound when the Sox, trailing, 4-3, snuffed
Kansas City's fifth-inning rally. But the credit went to left
fielder Troy O'Leary, who gunned out Jermaine Dye as he tried to
score from second on a single by Mark Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   And with the score tied, 4-4, in the eighth, the game was in
Rheal Cormier's left hand when he allowed back-to-back singles that
set up Kansas City's game-winning rally.
</P>
<P>
   Cormier knew the fans had better expectations of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're not going to do it every day,'' he said. ``There
are times when you're going to have a bump in the road. You just
try to limit the damage as much as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck couldn't, though. Summoned to rescue Cormier, Beck
yielded a double to Quinn that scored one run, a single to Gregg
Zaun that scored a second run, and a groundout to Dave McCarty that
scored a third, making it 7-4, more than Everett &AMP; Co. could
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your job is to come into the ballgame and make something
happen, good or bad,'' Beck said. ``Unfortunately, it wasn't too
good today.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Red Sox took only what was handed to
them. And Royals starter Chad Durbin was their biggest benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   Before he departed for a late brunch with one out in the second,
the rookie allowed three runs on three walks and single by Mike
Lansing. He only made it once through the order and averaged four
pitches to every batter.
</P>
<P>
   Everett did almost all the rest for the Sox. After he doubled in
the seventh, he scored on Nomar Garciaparra's two-out single on a
1-2 count to tie the score at 4. It was a huge hit in the clutch
for Garciaparra, who is batting a remarkable .350 with two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra went hitless in his first three at-bats and finished
the game at .392.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's 27th home run, off Royals closer Ricky Bottalico,
accounted for Boston's only other run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have a guy like that in the middle of your lineup
who can add some offensive punch,'' Lansing said. ``It's a nice
bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicer if the others chip in, too. But the Sox stranded 10
runners, including four in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   The last opportunity dissolved in the bottom of the ninth, when
Garciaparra and O'Leary each drew walks after Everett's homer. But
Jason Varitek, who had been left stranded after reaching on doubles
in the sixth and eighth, struck out to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bottalico survived the ninth for his 10th save, the
Royals owed their victory in large measure to Brian Meadows, a new
arrival from the San Diego Padres who pitched 6 2/3 innings of
one-run relief after Durbin's debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a super job of holding us down,'' said Brogna, who was
0 for 2 with two walks. ``We weren't able to get anyting going
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Everett.

TIME HAS COME TO THINK MODERN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only Mr. Mayor himself knows why he didn't make nice a long time
ago with Jimmy Kelly and the Debating Society, known as the Boston
City Council, on the subject of a new ballpark, but he didn't. Now
all of us will temporarily be held hostage by a group of people
who, being unaccustomed to spotlights of any kind, will play this
thing out until every last newspaper reporter, newspaper
photographer, radio reporter, television reporter, and television
cameraperson pleads for mercy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the deal will be struck.
</P>
<P>
   That said, we can only hope that someone in the John Harrington
entourage has brought something extremely important to his
attention _ a prescient article in the July 30 Globe by Robert
Campbell, our esteemed architecture critic, who called attention to
a sadly under-discussed aspect of this entire affair. ``I'm
wondering why everyone is talking about politics and money,'' he
wrote, ``and nobody is talking about the fact that this is a
terrible design for a ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how completely correct he is.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that Harrington and Co. do come up with the requisite
financing, what they are prepared to do is kowtow to the dewy-eyed
preservationists while attempting to address their business needs.
Operating on the apparent theory that no one really wants to leave
Fenway, and the Fenway Experience, behind, they are circulating a
ballpark design that would perpetuate the nonsense of the
left-field wall, a freak of real estate that has skewed performance
evaluation for 66 years and, whether the Sentimental Set wishes to
admit it, has had as much to do with the team's inability to
construct a championship team as any other single factor.
</P>
<P>
   No, no, a trillion times, no!
</P>
<P>
   The new ballpark, (and, by the way, let's agree that we shall
never, ever refer to it as the ``New Fenway,'' because that's not
gonna happen), has simply got to be a truly new ballpark, not a
mindless derivative of the old. Warns Campbell, ``Once you
replicate the Monster on a different site, you've transformed it
from reality to stage set. Instead of being a real place with a
real game, the park will feel like a planned amusement park ride.''
</P>
<P>
   It's very possible you can do something about it. I know for a
fact that the design we have seen is a first draft. Harrington and
friends authorized it on the assumption that to submit a design
that failed to look like Son of Fenway would be politically
disastrous. But I am counting on the good sense of intelligent
baseball fans to let him know that they most definitely do not want
to make any attempt to transport the history and memories they
cherish to a phony-baloney, Las Vegas-style Fenway re-creation,
that to do so would not merely be flat-out stupid, but borderline
sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   I say this because people are already weighing in, and here are
a few e-mail samples I have received:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why anyone in their right mind would want to build a ballpark
that retains the stupid left-field wall, the ladder, the
center-field triangle, etc. is beyond understanding.'' _ Bob Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd only ditch the idea of re-creating the wall in the
new park! _ Charles G. Ruberto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preserving the current Fenway is akin to the Amish not wanting
to progress with the rest of society.'' _ Jim O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   So I know you're out there, and I suspect you're out there in
far greater numbers than the Harringtonians realize.
</P>
<P>
   It is imperative to do the right thing with this new ballpark.
Lord knows there are enough models out there. Camden Yards in
Baltimore basically works, although the left-field fence should
definitely be higher. Cleveland's Jacobs Field comes very close to
being the answer, except for the hideous sight of three-tiered
luxury boxes that extend the length of the left-field line and
which, when lit, look like the Titanic an hour or so prior to its
encounter with the iceberg. Comiskey Park (Chicago) is an outdoor
FleetCenter. The Ballpark (Arlington, Texas) is contrived. Coors
Field (Denver) and Enron Field (Houston) are too skewed toward
offense. I have not been to either Comerica Park (Detroit) or
Safeco Field (Seattle), but the word is that the former has
regrettable sight lines, while the latter isn't bad at all. Nor
have I been to Pacific Bell Park (San Francisco), but it has
received staggeringly positive reviews on every level. Of course,
we've already blown our chance for a waterfront setting, but that's
the price we pay for allowing demagogues like Kelly to have too
much say in civic affairs. The other park worth studying is Turner
Field (Atlanta), which, while lacking landmarks, is very
comfortable and brings everyone reasonably close to the action.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here are skeptical that a new ballpark will turn out
all right because of the aforementioned disaster known as the
FleetCenter, otherwise known as the Wal-Mart of indoor arenas. But
the FleetCenter's sterility and lack of imagination at least serves
as a definitive ``How Not To.'' And an arena is not a ballpark. In
all the world, there is only one truly breathtaking, goose-bumpy
and charming, large-sized venue for professional basketball, and
that is Conseco Fieldhouse in downtown Indianapolis. That is a
unique situation. But there are many examples of new baseball parks
that enhance the experience.
</P>
<P>
   With a price tag approaching $700 million, there is going to be
only one chance in our lifetime for the Red Sox to construct a 21st
century ballpark with heart. Fenway Park remains a joy. I look
forward to each game there. But it is, as Campbell points out, a
joy because it is real. It was not designed to be a baseball
heirloom; it just turned out that way. And let me remind you that
as recently as 1966, when the Red Sox drew 811,172, no one was
rhapsodizing about Fenway, least of all Thomas A. Yawkey (trust me;
I've looked it up).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how silly this can get: The Red Sox have seriously
discussed painting one of the bleacher seats in the new park red,
to commemorate the 1946 Ted Williams home run that hit a man on the
head and broke his new straw hat. How sick is that? What's next?
Will they paint a big white X on the spot that approximates where
Rico Petrocelli caught Rich Rollins's pop fly that ended the 1967
season? It's all so absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway is Fenway, and when it goes we won't forget about it. The
Red Sox are moving out for many reasons. They should be interested
in creating new experiences, new memories, new history. So write,
phone, e-mail, and otherwise contact John Harrington to let him
know you want an all-new ballpark, with good sight lines for all.
Tell him to let Fenway rest in appropriate peace. Remind him that
one Williamsburg is enough.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late.

A LOT OF TALK, LITTLE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've been through a month of rumors and romancing. Free agents
were wined and dined in Orlando, Chicago, and, yes, even in Boston.
(Ever try to get on Charles River Country Club?)
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day, sports Web sites breathlessly tracked the
comings and goings of free agents. NBA executives called the
process way too protracted and far too exhausting. They also could
have added futile.
</P>
<P>
   After all the offers, counteroffers, proposals, threats,
promises, and winks, one may wonder if there has been any notable
change in the NBA balance of power. True, there's still time left,
but most of the major free agents have committed and all we really
have is a reconfigured and possibly better team in Orlando and
something in Detroit that looks a lot like Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winner in free agency, by far, is San Antonio
because it kept Tim Duncan. Anything else is gravy. The second
biggest winner, Indiana, also managed to keep its key people.
(We're assuming Reggie Miller stays.) The Magic made some big
changes; the Bulls tried to make some big changes; Miami and
Charlotte made a big trade. Everyone else talked, talked, talked,
and did nothing, unless you count Randy Brown, Tony Delk, and John
Starks as major additions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember the phrase `short-sheet' from your camp days?
That's what the NBA has done to its teams,'' says player agent
Keith Glass. ``You kicked and you kicked and you couldn't break
through that sheet. That's what is happening now to teams. They
can't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is the way the NBA wants it. (One rumor was
that the league denied the Nets both injury exceptions for that
very reason.) The less movement for players, the better. But the
less movement for players means the less movement for teams. It's
positively Newtonian.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA encourages and invites teams to re-sign their players,
which takes them over the salary cap. Thus, the teams are unable to
compete for somebody else's players. The players, therefore, have
few options, even though the money is slightly above the league's
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the summer started, only five teams were going to be
possible players in free agency. Two, Orlando and Chicago, had
planned it that way. A third, the Clippers, were among them because
they're the Clippers. Indiana and Houston had trade exceptions in
excess of $4 million. (Detroit and Toronto subsequently got into
it, but only after losing free agents they wanted to re-sign.)
</P>
<P>
   That left 24 teams to work out sign-and-trades if they wanted a
free agent. If that could not be done, and only Miami has been able
to seriously pull it off (forget the Orlando deals, those were not
the same thing). Teams had no room and free agents were left to
hope, like Danny Fortson, that something could be done to make them
not settle for the mid-level exception.
</P>
<P>
   Executives spent all of July on the phone. Atlanta GM Pete
Babcock spent last week in Rhode Island, where it rained every day,
and said he noticed only that it was cooler than it would have been
had he stayed in hot 'Lanta. He had two phones going at his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I wouldn't have been doing the same thing in
Atlanta,'' he said. ``I'm just doing it in a different place.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can only talk so much. The marketplace is what it is,
the rules are what they are, and, well, you have a lot of square
pegs trying to fit into round holes. Everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stagnant now,'' contends Glass. ``The league is stifling
its teams. The teams just can't get any better. I'm hearing more
complaints from teams, from general managers, than I am from the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   And it could be even worse the next two summers.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with this class. What would it have been without
Duncan, Tracy McGrady, Austin Croshere, Tim Thomas, and Ron Mercer?
Can you spell Y-A-W-N? Had they fallen into the new rookie scale,
they'd all still be with their current teams. Grant Hill might well
have stayed put without the prospect of joining Duncan, and Orlando
might not have done anything without the possibility of signing
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Houston, Dallas, Miami, and perhaps Atlanta and San
Antonio will have cap room. Who will be out there? None of the
third-year rookies who, under the last agreement, would be looking
ahead to big paydays, even if, as was the case with Croshere,
Thomas, and McGrady, they played perhaps one decent season among
them.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Carter, Mike Bibby, Paul Pierce, and Larry Hughes not only
won't be free next summer, they won't be free in the summer of
2002, either. All their respective teams have to do is push a
button by Halloween and those players are under lock and key for
two more years. Teams also have a right of first refusal for year
five, so, in essence, if those players seriously want to test the
market, they will have to wait until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how many guys are going to want to do that (wait
five years),'' says Celtics GM Chris Wallace. ``I just think it's
so overwhelming in favor of the home team.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber will be the Big Kahuna next summer. He will have
been in the league eight years at that point. (Geez, wasn't it just
yesterday that he and Nellie were dueling at 20 paces?) After that,
you have players such as Jamal Mashburn, Anthony Mason, Jim
Jackson, and Christian Laettner. Cedric Ceballos will be there.
Excited yet? How about the Hall of Fame center list: Patrick Ewing,
Dikembe Mutombo, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and Arvydas
Sabonis? No? How about if we added Shawn Bradley? Still no?
</P>
<P>
   What's missing are young players about to hit their prime who
can spell H-O-P-E. Of all the players we just listed, Mashburn is
the youngest. He's 27. And this season will be his seventh. Of the
early list of next summer's free agents, around 80 or so including
Adrian Griffin, almost half of them will have had at least eight
years in the league. By then, most players are already established.
You won't hear the words ``upside'' or ``potential'' or ``growth''
mentioned with any of them in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   So prepare yourself. You're going to have to wait until 2003 at
the earliest for the next possible Free Agent Frenzy, and that's
only if Carter et al don't re-sign before then.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, enjoy it while it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   In the free agency update, the undisputed winner is San Antonio.
As noted, Spurs kept Duncan. End of story. Derek Anderson, if he
comes, will help. As of now, the Spurs and Trail Blazers remain the
most viable alternative in the West to the Lakers, with Phoenix
closing in on the rail. Portland's pursuit of Shawn Kemp has to be
part of its ``closing window'' mentality, as in, ``We've got two
more years left before we have to blow it all up.'' The Kemp
situation is interesting. Only two weeks ago, a Western Conference
coach said this about Kemp: ``Untradeable. He's a walking luxury
tax.'' But Paul Allen doesn't care about such trivial things and
Portland must feel it somehow can work both Kemp and Rasheed
Wallace together, even though they play the same position. Kemp
also hates playing center and he'd have to play against real
centers in the West. But he'd also be doing it for a title
contender, not for Cleveland. If you look back at Portland's Game 7
collapse against the Lakers, it would have been nice to have Kemp
around when Sabonis picked up his fifth foul (and the game turned).
But isn't that when guys like Steve Smith and Scottie Pippen also
are supposed to step up? Orlando failed to land Duncan, who would
have altered the landscape in the East. The Magic added Hill and
McGrady (and, don't forget, rookie Mike Miller) both of whom, you
would think, would want the ball. Darrell Armstrong needs the ball.
Hmmm. Meanwhile, you have John Amaechi at center and a power
forward-in-waiting (Fortson would fit here). They also lost some of
their valuable ``dirty-work'' guys in Ben Wallace and Chucky Atkins
(who signed for $24 million over six years with Detroit).
</P>
<P>
   Does that make you wonder if Hill and McGrady might have taken a
starting salary of, oh, a paltry $7 million so Orlando could have
kept its team intact? It continues to amaze me why teams feel they
have to ``max out'' players when the money is so staggering anyway
and when there might actually be a benefit in taking slightly less
for the overall betterment of the team. Isn't that why they went
where they did? To win? The Lakers needed four years and Phil
Jackson to recover from Shaq's signing in 1996. He later said he
would have taken less had he known it would have meant that the
Lakers could have retained some of their players. Then again, the
next player who does that will be the first. Still, you'd like
Orlando's chances a lot better if at least Wallace stuck around.
He's tough and he rebounds and blocks shots. The Magic right now
look like about a 45-50 win team, but we were all wrong about them
last year. Doc Rivers is now officially on notice.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the NBA sent out a directive last week, informing
teams of several figures, the most prominent of which is the early
estimate for next year's salary cap. As of now, it is projected to
rise to $42.7 million next season, an increase of almost 20
percent. (The Celtics will still be over.) The maximum starting
salary for players in years 1-6 rose from $9 million to $9.658
million and for players at the second level from $11 million to
$11.589 million. The maximum starting salary for players with 10 or
more years remains at $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bulls get the horns
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls and GM Jerry Krause, meanwhile, are taking a serious
beating in the press for their inability to land a big-name free
agent. One reason being offered: players don't want to go to
Chicago because of Michael Jordan's legacy. That seems to be a
reach. A more plausible explanation is that the Bulls are a
horrible team, will continue to be a horrible team, and that the
only player who might have made a difference _ Duncan _ did not
want to go there.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard that players are upset over the way Chicago forced
out Jordan and Pippen. The last time I looked, Jordan chose to
retire because the only coach he'd play for decided not to return.
He also pocketed $60 million-plus in salary over his last two
seasons. We'd all like to be forced out like that. The Bulls could
have stood up to Pippen. Instead, they re-signed him to a maximum
deal and traded him to Houston for Roy Rogers and a draft pick.
They kept Rogers for nine days and the pick was a second-rounder.
Never mind that most of this ``mistreatment'' was in the minds of
MJ and Pippen, who simply don't like Krause. It stuck. Sure, Krause
could work on his people skills. Sure, he made some ridiculous
statements. Sure, he hired Tim Floyd, who is a good guy and
probably a good coach, but who knows after what he's been through?
But why would a free agent coming out of a bad or mediocre
situation, as was the case with Hill and McGrady, not try to go to
a better one? Why go through the same thing, or something even
worse, in a different city for the same money?
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have been 30-102 over the last two seasons and may be
lucky to win 30 games this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some free agents look at the way Michael left, and the
way Scottie left, but I think most of them are looking at the
talent that's there,'' said Brown, an ex-Bull. ``These guys want to
win and they want to win now. The Bulls are just not a very good
situation right now.'' Don't rule out the Bulls from still being a
player, provided they keep some cap space. Come this fall, when
rosters start getting squeezed, and again at the trading deadline,
they may be in position to take on someone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rocket launcher
</P>
<P>
   Another team that could be in an interesting position is
Houston, which has a trade exception that expires in early October,
courtesy of the Pippen deal. The Rockets could get $8 million to
$12 million under the cap next summer depending on what they do
with Olajuwon. Their thinking is that they will use the exception
only if they can acquire a legit keeper. Otherwise, they'll do what
Indiana did, which is let the exception expire. The Pacers had to
use theirs by midnight Tuesday, but after shelling out all the
money to Jalen Rose and Croshere, and with Miller still out there,
they probably figured they'd spent enough. Or, as we noted above,
they might have looked around and simply decided there was no point
spending any more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The good news
</P>
<P>
   While it's still way too early to project anything for the
upcoming season, a quick glance at the Celtics schedule is
revealing. Seventeen of their first 25 games are at the FleetCenter
and here are some of the opponents: Detroit, Toronto, Washington,
Atlanta, Houston, Vancouver, LA Clippers, Denver, and Chicago. They
have a decent shot to go no worse than 10-5 in November, and one
might suggest they have to go no worse than 10-5 given what lies
ahead. In other words, we might know by mid-December what sort of
season they are going to have.

BALL WAS DROPPED ON SOME PICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 36 Hall of Fame voters did a dangerous thing last week. They
selected an all-time NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they made mistakes, but that is a given when anyone
tries to do such a thing because it is impossible to take the
thousands of men who have played in the National Football League
and select the best 27 and think you can get away without an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, fueling arguments is probably the idea.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the selectors did an admirable job with the
exception of picking the wrong quarterback, wrong tackle (in one
case), wrong center (twice over), wrong outside linebacker, wrong
cornerback, and wrong safety.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start at quarterback, where Johnny Unitas was chosen over
Joe Montana. One could argue that Unitas helped create the modern
frenzy that is pro football by his play in the historic 1958 NFL
championship game. And there is no arguing his greatness. It is
just that Montana was greater.
</P>
<P>
   He won more frequently, which is the measuring stick of a
quarterback. He also made more plays in the final moments. In fact,
Unitas was not as great a thrower as Dan Marino (neither was
Montana) nor as great an athlete as John Elway, who may really have
been the greatest quarterback of all time.
</P>
<P>
   But for me, it is Montana because every time he got his team to
the biggest game _ the Super Bowl _ he won. Unitas cannot make such
a claim.
</P>
<P>
   The tackles selected were Anthony Munoz of the Bengals and
Roosevelt Brown of the New York Giants. I am old enough to remember
Brown, faintly. I remember he was big, fast, athletic and got out
in front of Frank Gifford and Alex Webster to name two.
</P>
<P>
   But has everyone forgotten how dominant a tackle Art Shell was
for nearly his entire career with the Raiders and how overpowering
Forrest Gregg was when he anchored the Packers offense of the
1960s?
</P>
<P>
   I watched Shell play throughout his career, so I can assure you
this: He may not be better than Brown, but he wasn't any worse. And
neither was Gregg.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that the selectors opted for Mike Webster
at center. He was a force for those great Steelers teams of the
1970s, but I would argue Miami's Dwight Stephenson was more than
his athletic equal and the Raiders' Jim Otto was as good as anyone
who ever played the position. Given those three, I would select
Stephenson, even though his career was cut short by knee injuries.
He was the best athlete and tough as nails.
</P>
<P>
   Let's move to defense. It is impossible to quarrel with the
selections of ends Deacon Jones and Reggie White, but I will
anyway. How do you keep Willie Davis of the Packers off any
all-time team? That is especially true when you consider not a
single player from those superb Green Bay squads made the list
despite the fact the Packers won five NFL titles under Vince
Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   At outside linebacker, Jack Ham and Lawrence Taylor were the
selections. No one can quarrel with Taylor, but I'd take Dave
Robinson over Ham and I'd take Jack Lambert over both, even though
he was a career middle linebacker. For my money, a linebacking
corps of Dick Butkus, Taylor, and Lambert playing out of position
would be as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   In the secondary, I would replace Mel Blount with Mike Haynes or
Jimmy Johnson, the old 49er cornerback of the 1950s and '60s.
Blount was a great player and an intimidating force, but Haynes
covered people to death and also was a great return man.
</P>
<P>
   If you talk to old-timers, they'll tell you Dick ``Night Train''
Lane (the other selection) and Johnson were the best. So, forced to
choose, I'd go with Lane and Haynes on the corners.
</P>
<P>
   As for the safeties, the selectors went with Ronnie Lott and
Larry Wilson. I'm OK with Lott, but although Wilson revolutionized
the position (and hence may deserve the selection), I think
Minnesota's Paul Krause and Houston's Ken Houston were better.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at the Hall of Fame last week Krause and Houston said
Wilson was their idol but Krause conceded Houston was the best
safety ever. Nothing against Wilson, but I'll go with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the selections of Jim Brown, Walter Payton, Don
Hutson, Jerry Rice, John Mackey, Munoz, John Hannah, and Jim Parker
on offense, and Joe Greene, Bob Lilly, Butkus, Taylor, Lane, and
Lott seem right. Same is true of specialists Jan Stenerud, Ray Guy,
Gale Sayers, and Deion Sanders, and Steve Tasker on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the selectors did a good job, but my computer tells me
my team wins, 28-24, with Montana making a spectacular throw for
the winning score.

   Over before it started
</P>

   The quarterback competition ended early in Miami after
Dartmouth's Jay Fiedler injured his hip last week and will miss
most, if not all, of camp. That leaves the job of replacing Marino
to Damon Huard, although Fiedler is still hoping to get back in
time for the final week of camp. However, what difference does it
make? . . . Old friend Al Groh showed how relaxed a guy can be
replacing a legend last week when he spent part of one of his press
conferences suggesting the top seven storylines for writers
covering the team. To his credit, Groh put the return of
quarterback Vinny Testeverde from his Achilles' injury ahead of his
own first appearance Sept. 3 as Bill Parcells's replacement . . .
Life would appear tough on the surface for the Buffalo Bills after
losing Doug Flutie until next month and nine defensive players to
free agency or salary cap complications, including four starters.
They lost their best cornerback (Thomas Smith), best safety (Kurt
Schulz) and all-time greatest pass rusher (Bruce Smith) before
Smith's replacement, Marcellus Wiley, went down with a back injury.
But general manager John Butler has done a superlative job drafting
over the years and so the Bills' brass believes it can reload while
remaining competitive in the AFC East with people like Wiley, Sam
Cowart, Pat Williams, and Shawn Price. Price, in particular, is on
the hot seat because his playing time is expected to increase after
four years as a backup. Top draft pick Erik Flowers was considered
for Smith's right defensive end job after Wiley's injury but coach
Wade Phillips has decided to allow the rookie to focus on rushing
the passer from the left side. This leaves Price, a career backup,
to start in Smith's old spot. The only problem with that scenario
is Price lacks the speed to be a consistently effective outside
rusher, and the Bills know it. But until Wiley is healthy, Price
will have to hold the fort. ``A lot of people are saying we're a
second-rate defense now because of the players we lost, but we
believe we can be just as good as last year,'' Cowart said. ``We'll
be a little younger, but with youth I think we're faster than last
year.'' The Bills allowed the fewest total yards per game last year
and have been in the top 10 in fewest yards allowed for four
straight years . . . The injury to Flutie all but assures part of
the Bills' salary cap plans are out the window. With two
high-priced quarterbacks in Flutie and Rob Johnson, Buffalo planned
to have a third quarterback signed for the rookie minimum of
$193,000. The best they can hope for now is paying a veteran backup
the league minimum of $440,000, a difference of $247,000 in cap
money . . . What does the schedule maker have against the AFC East?
Five of the six teams facing the toughest schedules are in the AFC
East with the Bills' opponents having a .586 winning percentage a
year ago. Next is Miami, whose opponents have a .570 winning
percentage, Indianapolis at .563, the Jets at .559, and the Vikings
at .555. Right behind them comes the Patriots, whose opponents'
winning percentage was .539 last season. But the Patriots play the
most 1999 playoff teams, nine. The defending Super Bowl champion
St. Louis Rams have the second-easiest schedule with their
opponents having a 1999 winning percentage of .430. They face only
four 1999 playoff teams. Part of the reason is because their
division, the NFC West, is weak with San Francisco, New Orleans,
and Atlanta among the league's worst teams. AFC Super Bowl
representative Tennessee also caught a break. Its strength of
schedule is 24th . . . Rookies need to learn their place and
Dolphins offensive tackle Todd Wade was informed of his last week
after he criticized the antics of Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp for
taunting Dolphins players and a ball boy during joint practices.
``That would be like me talking about Reggie White the week before
Wade had to face Reggie,'' said left guard Mark Dixon, who faces
Sapp when the teams meet. When Sapp heard of Wade's criticisms, he
snapped, ``That kid has no idea who I am and what I'm all about.''
Chances are Sapp will find a way to let him know this season . . .
Indianapolis Colts running back Edgerrin James has lost none of his
edge. After a remarkable rookie season that earned him nearly $15
million in salary and bonuses, James had Reebok print him up
T-shirts that read ``Back to the Grind.'' Unfortunately, it's a
term James says one of his uncles used to use when referring to
returning to the streets to sell drugs. ``He was always saying,
`You've got to get back out there grindin' and hustlin' to make
your money,' '' James said. ``Now you know I'm not saying anything
about drugs, but you've got to have that mentality. Every year
you've got to be hungry.'' After rushing for 1,533 yards as a
rookie and earning $9.85 million in incentives and other bonuses,
James may still be hungry but he won't be missing any meals . . .
You can't blame Clay Matthews if he hopes brother Bruce sprains an
ankle this season. The retired Cleveland Browns linebacker played
in 278 NFL games over 19 years, the third-highest total in league
history. Bruce, the perennial All-Pro offensive lineman with the
Titans, can pass him if he starts 15 games this season. The younger
Matthews has played in 264 NFL games. The league record is held by
former quarterback/kicker George Blanda, who played 340 games . . .
Guard Will Shields got a break and a big raise when he signed a
one-year tender offer from the Chiefs last week worth more than $4
million. The five-time Pro Bowl performer carried the team's
franchise designation, which meant he had to be paid the average of
the top five salaries at his position. But fortunately for Shields,
offensive linemen are put in one pot, so the fact that the top five
salaries all belong to left tackles didn't affect him. In fact,
that quirk meant about a 20 percent raise over what Shields would
have made if paid the average of the top five guards . . . Of the
nine franchise players designated in February, five have signed
one-year tender offers, one (Joey Galloway) was traded, one (San
Diego defensive tackle Norman Hand) had the designation rescinded
and moved on to New Orleans, and two (Jacksonville's Tony Brackens
and Arizona's Simeon Rice) are holding out . . . Colts linebacker
Cornelius Bennett faces a big test Monday when his surgically
repaired knee will again be evaluated. Bennett failed to pass his
training camp physical and has been on the physically unable to
perform list since. The Colts hope he can begin limited work this
week . . . Some guys will do anything for a chance to play in the
NFL, including pass up a $7,000 work week. Wide receiver Ben
Clampitt already has been cut this year by the B.C. Lions of the
Canadian League and the Cincinnati Bengals, but he signed a
contract with the Seattle Seahawks last week rather than accept a
position on his father's fishing boat out of Edmonds, Wash., that
would have earned him $7,000 for a week's work . . . Rookie wide
receiver JaJuan Dawson continued to impress the Browns so much last
week that he was named a starter ahead of veteran Darrin
Chiaverini. Dawson was a third-round pick but he has sprinted ahead
of holdout second-round choice Dennis Northcutt and made life
miserable for Chiaverini, who caught 44 passes, including four for
touchdowns, last year. Coach Chris Palmer apparently is not
sympathetic to Chiaverini's claim that he hasn't had enough passes
thrown in his direction. ``Some receivers say, `I'm not getting the
ball enough,' '' Palmer said. ``Hey, I don't care if you get the
ball or not. All I have to do is turn on the film. Are you open?
The coach knows if you're open or not.'' . . . Veteran Browns
running back Terry Kirby was informed last week he would play some
backup fullback. That was after he came to camp 11 pounds lighter
because he was told they wanted him to be quicker. ``We're not
going to ask Kirby to isolate on (Steelers linebacker Levon)
Kirkland or one of those guys,'' Palmer said. ``That doesn't make
much sense. He'd come out faster than when he came in. What I'm
looking for is as many options as we can have.''

</P>
<P>
   Bargaining chip
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Darnay Scott (broken leg) for the season, the
Bengals' hard line on holdout running back Corey Dillon has to
change. For now, the Bengals are without their three leading
rushers of a year ago, their four most productive receivers, and 75
percent of their total offense. If that isn't negotiating leverage
for Dillon, then Bengals owner Mike Brown doesn't know the meaning
of the term. If Dillon isn't given an extension, the Bengals will
have a roster that does not have a single back or receiver who
amassed as many as 350 yards last year. And that's of total offense
. . . Scott was not only a deep threat but also a big target for
young quarterback Akili Smith, who will have to look hard for
Scott's replacement. Scott's spot will be taken by Craig Yeast, who
stands 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 165 pounds. Scott is 6-1 and
weighs 204, which is becoming the prototype for an NFL receiver . .
. Bengals running back Michael Basnight can do more than move with
the football. His first volume of poetry, entitled ``Deeper Than
The Game,'' will be published Sept. 9 . . . Some holdouts know how
to make friends in a hurry. Nine days and 15 practices after his
new teammates in Baltimore had gone to work, Ravens No. 1 pick
Travis Taylor agreed to a five-year, $7.67 million contract. After
scoring a touchdown on his first practice reception, Taylor then
improved his status by announcing he would take all 84 players out
to dinner. The only caveat was that they be restricted to $100 per
man. With a new $5 million signing bonus, Taylor's bank account can
handle the $8,400 charge . . . Here's how set the $100 million
Washington Redskins lineup is: The only real competition for a
position is between Adrian Murrell and Skip Hicks to back up
Stephen Davis at running back. That's unless anyone really believes
No. 1 pick LaVar Arrington is going to be beaten out by Greg Jones
. . . Minnesota Vikings linebacker Bryce Paup took some shots at
his old coach, blaming Jacksonville's Tom Coughlin for his lack of
production as a pass rusher while with the Jaguars. Paup said he
``hated'' playing in Jacksonville, where he went from being the
NFL's defensive MVP in 1995 to a guy who had 7 1/2 sacks in two
seasons with the Jaguars. Why the drop off? According to Paup, he
was misued by Coughlin and grew so bitter he nearly retired this
past offseason after becoming a free agent . . . Carolina Panthers
linebacker Lee Woodall was eating dinner recently in Las Vegas with
his wife and father-in-law when a woman approached and asked if he
was Evander Holyfield. Woodall, who is frequently mistaken for
Holyfield, insisted he was not but the woman persisted in her
search for an autograph so Woodall turned to his father-in-law for
support. He responded, ``Come on Evander, just give her your
autography, will you?'' It was not until Woodall produced his NFLPA
union card that she believed him. But now she wanted the two-time
Pro Bowler's autograph instead. He complied . . . The Vikings are
sticking with the move of former tight end Jim Kleinsasser to
fullback. He gives them a 278-pound blocking back in front of
Robert Smith. But word is Dennis Green also plans to give
Kleinsasser some carries and use him in the short-passing game even
though the shift was originally made after Kleinsasser fumbled
twice last year in a 2-point loss to the Bears . . . Robert McNair,
owner of the new Houston franchise, said last week he hopes to see
his team included in the AFC Central to rekindle some of the old
rivalries the Oilers had with the Steelers and Browns. Talk is the
Tennessee Titans will move to a new Southern Division, which could
open a spot for Houston, although Houston is also a good bet for
the Southern Division . . . After last week's loss to the Patriots,
San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia bemoaned the lack of
help he received last year from Steve Young, the man he replaced.
Although Garcia claimed to understand that Young ``was dealing with
a very difficult decision (to retire),'' he felt he should have
been given more support. ``I would have liked to have seen more of
the coach come out in him,'' Garcia said. ``If I was in his shoes,
I would have approached it differently.''

WEIS DECIDES NOT TO SHOW HIS HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the intention of Patriots offensive coordinator Charlie Weis
has been not to reveal any of his secrets, he's in the wrong
business. He should be the head of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   After two exhibition games, the Patriots have shown nothing.
They have revealed no secrets except that they are willing to run
the option with backup quarterback Michael Bishop. Other than that,
Weis's answer to the questions defenses have asked has been simply,
``I know nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   If Weis were a prisoner of war, all the enemy would have gotten
out of him would have been name, rank, and serial number.
</P>
<P>
   Troop movement plans? I have no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Secrets of the Patriots' attack? Beats me.
</P>
<P>
   Design of their offense? Wouldn't know a thing about that, sir.
</P>
<P>
   After two games, the Patriots have shown few signs of even
possessing an offense, although obviously they must because every
time someone gives them the football 11 men keep running onto the
field to play with it for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, against a fair and physical Detroit defense, they
didn't stay out there very long, very often. That was especially
(and alarmingly) true when the first offense was in place in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They did make cameo appearances a couple of minutes at a time,
though, so one has to assume the Patriots will have an offense to
go with their players before much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Or will they?
</P>
<P>
   Considering how poorly that offense produced in the dismal
second half of last season, one has to wonder. Certainly Weis must
be, although quiet counsel is his approach to these matters.
</P>
<P>
   One always needs to remember, of course, that this time of year
nothing you see really means anything when the ``games'' are being
played. That's why they're called exhibitions, although it is fair
to think a team would exhibit some offense eventually, just by
accident. That time may come Friday against the Washington Redskins
if it's going to come at all because one would have to assume the
Patriots are not going to show much in the fourth exhibition game
against Tampa Bay since they open the season against the Buccaneers
two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, it is the next-to-last exhibition game where
teams really try to play the way they will during the regular
season because by the final game they just want to keep their
players in one piece. But with the odd placement of the Tampa Bay
exhibition on the schedule, those plans may well be altered,
meaning if the Patriots have an offense you'd better hope to see it
against the Redskins. If you do, it will be saying something
because Washington has a highly paid and vastly improved defense
that includes Bruce Smith, Deion Sanders, and No. 1 draft choice
LaVar Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Patriots have the firepower to match up with the
Redskins is still difficult to tell, but each time the first
offense goes on the field and produces 9 yards in the first
quarter, as it did against the Lions, it is cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Not panic, mind you, but concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard to make judgments until we have all our guys
back,'' insisted quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who calmly was alluding
to missing tackles Grant Williams and Bruce Armstrong, guard Todd
Rucci, and rookie running back J.R. Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Bledsoe has a point. Having 60 percent of your
offensive line missing in action affects what you can do, but
Friday night against the type of physical defensive front that has
bothered them in the past, the Patriots' offense wasn't merely
limited, it was nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Of New England's 261 total yards, 111 came in the two-minute
offense. The offense, if it can be called that, failed to score a
touchdown, and even worse failed to score one after the defense
gave it the ball at the Lions' 9-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds familiar it should because that's the way it's
gone all too often for Bledsoe and Co. the past two years. Given
the ball in most situations, nothing has happened, especially on
third down when forward motion is most necessary. Given the ball
with time running out, a track meet breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   Just before halftime, the Patriots' second-team offense traveled
52 yards before Adam Vinatieri hit on a 50-yard field goal for a
10-3 lead. After nearly two more quarters of stasis on offense, in
the game's final 49 seconds the third-team offense marched 59 yards
to set up Vinatieri's winning 28-yard kick with two seconds on the
clock.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, real estate in California probably moved as
much as the Patriots' offense did Friday night, which is to say a
little bit but not noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a lot of consistency with any phase of our
offense,'' coach Bill Belichick said. ``Now we have to go back and
evaluate what to do (offensively) the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to step back, take a deep breath, and reevaluate what
we have to do to get going. But overall there has been a lack of
consistency and third down is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   If that last point also sounds familiar it should. In the first
two games of the summer season, the Patriots' offense has converted
on 7 of 25 third-down tries, a success ratio of 28 percent. Friday
night it was 3 of 14, a pathetic 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you recall, third down killed the Patriots last season, when
drive after drive would stall because of an inability to convert in
those situations. Perhaps Weis has an improved way to handle this
and is simply keeping it to himself until Sept. 3, when the
Buccaneers' manhandling defense arrives in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Then again . . . well don't think about ``then again'' quite yet
because it's too early for negativity. Rather try this instead.
</P>
<P>
   Remain faithful to the cause for now, residents of Patriot Land.
Remain as loyal to that cause as Mel Gibson, the cinematic Patriot.
</P>
<P>
   Remain steadfast in the belief that Friday when the Patriots
have the ball they'll do something more with it than give it back
to the Redskins. If they don't, continue to believe this is just an
effort to keep all matters offensive secret until the real B Day
(Bucs Day) invasion Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Like Charlie Weis, what other choice do you have?

STORY ON ARROYO IS LACK OF COMMAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time it was Rich Garces instead of Pedro Martinez who got
the nod as Rolando Arrojo's interpreter after Saturday's 7-5 loss
to the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez was late coming out of the shower, Garces, the
Venezuelan reliever, was called upon in a pinch to help translate
questions for the Cuban righthander from reporters. But given
Arrojo's lackluster performance in his Fenway debut, there wasn't
much need for Garces to translate.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish, Swahili, Greek, or German, it didn't matter. The
disappointment on Arrojo's face spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``How did you think you pitched today?''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo: ``Yo piche mal. Mi control no era como (yo) queria.''
</P>
<P>
   Garces: ``He pitched bad today. He just didn't have any command
of his pitches. He just threw bad today.''
</P>
<P>
   That was evident from the outset when Arrojo _ acquired July 27
in a trade with the Colorado Rockies along with infielder Mike
Lansing and reliever Rick Croushore in exhange for Jeff Frye, John
Wasdin, and Brian Rose _ struggled in the first inning, spotting
the Royals a 1-0 lead on three hits.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up leaving after 4 2/3 innings in which he gave up four
runs on seven hits and had two walks, one strikeout, and a wild
pitch in the third that allowed Johnny Damon to score from third,
making it 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuff-wise, he was good,'' said manager Jimy Williams.
``Control-wise, he was a little erratic. But stuff-wise, he's good.
We just need him to harness it a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Was it a matter of mechanics?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being honest with you, yeah,'' Williams said. ``Maybe he
needs a consistent release slot. He throws from different angles,
but he's trying hard. He's a great kid, he works hard, and he wants
to be successful. He's trying really hard out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff is good. Dang, his stuff is good and it's movin'.
But maybe too much, or out of the strike zone instead of into the
strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo faced similar problems in his Red Sox debut July 30 at
Oakland, Calif., where he walked the bases full and then served up
a two-out grand slam to Sal Fasano in the second inning that lifted
the A's to a 5-2 victory. Arrojo lasted 6 1/3 innings in that
start, overcoming his early shakiness and retiring 13 of the next
16 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only seen him pitch twice, so I have to come in and look
at the tape tomorrow before I can try to evaluate him,'' said
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``I mean, I know he doesn't throw that
first-pitch strike, it's evident in the two games here, because
he's always working from behind in the count. So we've got to do
something that will promote him throwing first-pitch strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``How are your mechanics? Is it a mechanical thing
right now?''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo: ``Es bastante bien. Mas mejor que la otra vez.''
</P>
<P>
   Garces: ``He said his mechanics were better than the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not quite good enough to help Arrojo win his second
start with the Sox. He recorded his sixth no-decision of the season
and matched a season low with his solitary strikeout. And so,
Arrojo's evaluation period continues as he tries to help fill a
growing void in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a new pitcher, you have to see for yourself,''
Kerrigan said. ``It takes you sometimes three, four, or five starts
before you get locked in on a guy. You have to study a lot of film
and try to find some key checkpoints in his delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Everyone will just have to be patient as Arrojo and
the Red Sox get through their adjustment period.

SPLIT DECISION ON COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What makes Bill Belichick such a good coach is the
unpredictability of his defense. And that unpredictability carries
over into other areas.
</P>
<P>
   His reactions, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   While quite concerned about his team following a 20-0 blowout of
the San Francisco 49ers Monday, Belichick seemed more understanding
in the aftermath of the Patriots' 13-10 win over the Detroit Lions
Friday, when there were big problems in the running game, passing
game, and offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   So understanding that after watching game film, Belichick
concluded it was time to give his players and coaching staff a
break Sunday. The players watched and analyzed their performances
Saturday, and will resume practice Monday with a light workout in
the morning and a tougher one in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a tough stretch,'' said Belichick during a media
teleconference. ``We've been going at it pretty hard both
physically and mentally. From a coaching standpoint we need a
chance to see what's going on in the last 10 days since some things
have been installed.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Belichick, who also acts as the defensive coordinator,
has to be pleased with his unit. He was slightly critical of his
safeties being perhaps ``overly aggressive'', probably referring to
a 61-yard pass on which safety Larry Whigham got burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think hard-hitting safeties are an important element of
defense,'' said Belichick. ``You want to control the middle of the
field. When (the receivers and backs) come in you want them
thinking about what happens after the pass and have to worry about
the bobbles and holding the ball. We have a problem with our
safeties maybe playing too aggressive. I told them if you guys want
to play linebacker, I'll switch you over, but don't expect Chad
Eaton or Bobby Hamilton to cover post-patterns; that's not their
job. There's a balance between knowing their coverages and being
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the licking Lawyer Milloy put on Lions quaterback Mike
Tomczak was the aggressive nature Belichick likes. Milloy forced a
fumble and gave the offense great field position, which it
squandered.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he didn't blame all of the offensive lapses on
the players, though they also took their share of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be some things . . . as we went through our
films that you see something and you say `this isn't really your
fault. We haven't covered this situation or it was different the
way we covered it.' OK. But when you have covered some things and
those mistakes occur, those are not acceptable. We had both. We had
a blitz that came a little differently than what we had prepared
for, but there are other times they brought people in and it was
our fault,'' said Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   The coach didn't seem overly concerned about quarterback Drew
Bledsoe, feeling he has three more exhibition games to get into a
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   He said of quarterback Michael Bishop's performance, ``He played
OK. He did a nice job with the 2-minute drive (at the end of the
first half) and got 3 points. He threw one pass he'd like to have
back (an interception by Corwin Brown). He did some good things but
overall offensively we didn't have a lot of consistency. He
contributed to that and so did a lot of people. The 2-minute drill
was a positive point.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach gave rookie signal-caller Tom Brady credit for his
poise, but also found room for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems in the San Francisco game is it was 20-0 and
Brady was handing the ball off when he was in there,'' said
Belichick. ``This is a much more realistic situation to evaluate.
Tom did some good things and some not so good. He handled himself
well. The more he sees the better he's going to get. He's had a lot
thrown at him. He's the type of guy that once he sees it, he either
gets it the first time or he reacts to it a lot quicker the second
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady led the Patriots to the go-ahead score late in the fourth
quarter, hitting Marshfield's Sean Morey in the middle of the field
for a 47-yard gain to set up Adam Vinatieri's 28-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick applauded Morey for his special teams play and the
long pass play, but added ``I think he needs to find a more
consistent performance. Some of it's good, but he still has a ways
to go toward being a good, consistent, polished receiver. You want
your quarterbacks to have confidence in those receiver routes.''
</P>
<P>
   What bothered Belichick most about the offense were the five
negative-yardage running plays. He said those led to the Patriots
having to rely more on the pass.
</P>
<P>
   He also thought his young coaching staff performed better than
in the last game. ``We did OK. I think there's a lot of newness and
there are some things we have to iron out. On the offensive side
there's more years of experience than the defensive side. In New
York I worked with Al (Groh) and Romeo (Crennel) and Eric (Mangini)
for years. Part of it is working our way through it for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belichick hopes to have rookie running back J.R. Redmond ready
to play Friday against Washington. Belichick said Redmond is
``close'' and thinks the first step was to have him practice Monday
. . . Belichick said there were only a few ``bumps and bruises''
from the game but nothing major. Linebacker Ted Johnson and
defensive end Brandon Mitchell should see action against
Washington. Bruce Armstrong is expected to begin practicing
sometime this week.

MLS to Houston no longer priority
<TEXT>
<P>
   City won't get team until at least 2004
</P>
<P>
   By BRIAN McTAGGART
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicl
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The checkered history of professional soccer in
Houston has seen teams and leagues blow through town like
tumbleweeds, leaving thousands of area soccer fans confused in the
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   From the Houston Stars of the 1960s to the present-day Houston
Hotshots indoor team, there has usually been an outlet for soccer
fans to show their support for the game. Unfortunately, the teams
or the leagues historically haven't lasted long enough to develop a
strong following.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotshots, who play in the World Indoor Soccer League, have
fielded a team for all but one season since 1994, and the
minor-league Houston Hurricanes of the outdoor United Soccer League
have filled a niche for some.
</P>
<P>
   But for diehard fans of the outdoor game, living in Houston in
recent years hasn't provided many opportunities to see the world's
most popular sport played at the highest level, and it might be
some time before it happens again.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, once thought to be a front-runner during the next wave
of Major League Soccer expansion partly because of its large
Hispanic population, won't get a team until 2004 at the earliest,
according to recent statements by MLS commissioner Don Garber.
</P>
<P>
   In his state-of-the-league address July 28, Garber said a second
team in the New York tri-state area and a team in Philadelphia or
Atlanta likely would land the 2002 expansion franchises. Garber
said Houston, Seattle, Rochester and Sacramento are potential
expansion cities in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   MLS chief executive officer Mark Abbott didn't want to handicap
Houston's chances of eventually landing an expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rate (Houston's) chances, other than it's a market
we care a lot about and we have an interest in and would like to
find a way to get there,'' he said. ``We've had on-and-off
discussions with (investors) who would have an interest, but
there's nobody imminent. We need to find an ownership group, but a
lot of things line up well.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Houston no longer being a priority to the MLS,
declining attendance and reported annual losses of $50 million have
forced local investors to back off their efforts to bring a team to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in limbo,'' said John Cape, president of Houston Soccer
Ventures, which was organized in 1996 by a local group of investors
in an effort to bring a team to Houston. ``We're still a factor in
the market and we could ultimately do this if it makes sense, but
the real burden is on Major League Soccer. They've got to deliver
in terms of increasing attendance or television ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   When the MLS was formed after the World Cup in the United States
in 1994, Houston was bypassed by the league because it lacked a
qualified facility and had no lead investor.
</P>
<P>
   Even though MLS is trying to move away from playing in large
football stadiums like the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and Rose Bowl in
Los Angeles, Abbott said MLS is interested in becoming a tenant in
the new NFL stadium under construction adjacent to the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, any kind of new facility is an exciting thing to be
a part of, and we're very excited about the facility that's being
built down there,'' he said. ``We are still taking a look at the
stadium situation. I would certainly say the NFL stadium could work
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous talk of an MLS team coming to Houston had the team
possibly playing at the University of Houston's Robertson Stadium,
which was last year expanded to an MLS-friendly 33,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   MLS officials visited the stadium last year and were concerned
about needed improvements to concession stands, locker rooms and
broadcast booths _ worries that have since been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   An MLS team might not be on the immediate horizon, but Houston
also is in the running for an expansion team in the Women's United
Soccer Association _ a new league that will kick off in April.
</P>
<P>
   The league, which has a cooperation agreement with the MLS, will
start with franchises in Tampa/Orlando, Fla.; New York; Boston; San
Francisco; Atlanta; San Diego; Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The WUSA, would like to add two teams by 2002 and another two by
2004. Houston, along with Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami, have been
tabbed by the league's board of directors as possible expansion
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expansion will happen,'' said Lee Berke, the acting president
of the WUSA. ``We've been blessed by the fact we have even more
potential owners than we have teams right now. There's strong
interest from a number of groups in various markets around the
country to have the WUSA play there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cape said Houston Soccer Ventures also has an interest in
getting a WUSA expansion team, but Berke wouldn't identify which
local investors have shown an interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But suffice it to say there is interest, there are
opportunities and things we'd like to pursue further,'' he said.
``From a marketing standpoint, there's interest and I know there's
potentially some facilities being developed (in Houston).
Obviously, if things progress over the next six months we'll take a
look at what's being developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary plans call for the country's top female players to
be assigned to cities in which they have a regional connection,
much like basketball's WNBA did when it began in 1997. The MLS and
WUSA will cross-market and promote each other and work to build
soccer-only stadiums in cities throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get our first eight markets going, which will take
place in April 2001, but very quickly beyond that we will
methodically begin to expand this league,'' Berke said.
</P>
<P>
   If and when Houston secures an MLS franchise, it wouldn't be the
first time the city took a shot at major pro soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Stars called the Astrodome their home when they
played one season in the United Soccer Association in 1967 and one
season in the North American Soccer League in 1968. The city
returned to the NASL from 1978-80 with the Houston Hurricane, which
also played in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   After the Hurricane came the Dynamos, who from 1984-86 competed
in the United Soccer League and played most of their home matches
at Delmar and Butler stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, poor attendance and league financial trouble spelled
doom for soccer teams in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But the MLS is hoping the city can become the professional
soccer hotbed that many think it can. Recent matches at Robertson
Stadium involving teams from Mexican leagues have drawn crowds as
large as 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It obviously has a large population segment that's come from
countries where soccer is a primary sport,'' Abbott said. ``The
television ratings, even though they don't have an MLS team, they
seem to be following the MLS. There are a lot of good things about
Houston that would argue for an MLS team to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for history.

HART MADE RIGHT MOVES FOR INDIANS

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Cleveland Indians have new life.
</P>
<P>
   Decimated by injuries, particularly to the pitching staff, the
Indians found themselves 10 games behind the surging White Sox in
the American League Central race before they knew what hit them.
But after a flurry of deals leading up to the trading deadline, the
Indians feel invigorated.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Charlie Manuel asked for another starting pitcher,
bullpen help and another bat. General manager John Hart filled
those needs, trading for starters Jason Bere and Steve Woodard and
closer Bob Wickman from the Brewers, outfielder Wil Cordero from
the Pirates and first baseman David Segui from the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Bere has already paid dividends. In his first two starts, he's
2-0 with a 2.40 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 10 years, I've seen him pitch about 20 times,''
Manuel said. ``The last two games are the best I have ever seen him
throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when times were tough, the Indians never fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is a very professional team,'' pitcher Chuck Finley
said. ``It's so even-keeled around here, it's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians won the AL Central five consecutive years under
manager Mike Hargrove, so Manuel could be on the hot seat if the
Indians miss the playoffs this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the focus is more on me, that's the way it's supposed to
be,'' Manuel said. ``That's how I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new faces did not come without a cost. The Indians
traded away outfielder-first baseman Richie Sexon and pitchers Paul
Rigdon and Kane Davis to Milwaukee, infielder Enrique Wilson and
outfielder Alex Ramirez to Pittsburgh, and outfielder Ricky Ledee
to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cleaning house: It stood to reason, with the Orioles out of
the race, going nowhere and having the third-largest payroll ($83.1
million) in the big leagues, that there would be some changes.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the trading deadline passed, the Orioles' roster was
without more than half the players that began the season with the
team on opening day. Gone are B.J. Surhoff, Will Clark, Mike
Bordick, Mike Timlin, Harold Baines, Rich Amaral and Charles
Johnson, all traded during a 72-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   The club will save more than $10 million in payroll because of
the trades.
</P>
<P>
   All the dealing means only five players _ Brady Anderson, Scott
Erickson, Alan Mills, Mike Mussina and Cal Ripken _ remain from the
1997 Orioles, who reached the American League Championship Series.
They haven't had a winning season since.
</P>
<P>
   __ Doesn't stink anymore: When Tim Salmon homered for the Angels
on opening night against the Yankees, it put him on a pace for 162
home runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous? Of course.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is a game of numbers, but we can get carried away when
it comes to figuring out what a player is ``on pace for.'' But now
here it is August, more than two-thirds of the way through the
season, the ``on pace for'' statistics carry a little more weight.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' Darin Erstad is having an incredible season and the
projected numbers reflect that.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable record Erstad is chasing is George Sisler's
mark of 257 hits set in 1920 with the St. Louis Browns. It's a
record older than many single-season marks.
</P>
<P>
   Including Saturday's game, Erstad is on pace for 255 hits. With
175 hits in 111 games, Erstad needs 82 hits in the Angels' final 51
games _ or 1.61 hits per game _ to tie the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The other records he is chasing are not as glamorous but still
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   No leadoff hitter in baseball history has driven in 100 runs in
a season. Nomar Garciaparra of the Red Sox set the record in 1997
with 98 RBI. Erstad has 79 RBI, a pace for 115.
</P>
<P>
   The home run record for a leadoff hitter is Brady Anderson's 35
for the Orioles in 1996. Erstad is short of record-pace, on track
for 27.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad is also looking to become only the third player ever to
get 700 at-bats in a season. Erstad's pace is 699. The all-time
record is 705, set by Willie Wilson of the Royals in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Erstad became the fastest player to reach
100 hits since Hall of Famer Heinie Manush did it in 1934 for the
Washington Senators. Manush got there in 60 games, Erstad in 61.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's reaction when informed of his achievement?
</P>
<P>
   ``So? . . . People can talk all you want about what you're doing
now. But at the end of the season is when it really counts. Every
day's important, but you have to keep it in perspective. There's a
lot of baseball left.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Erstad the meaning of a particular record, and he'll look at
you like you have a third eye in the middle of your forehead.
What's the big deal? After all, he hit .253 last season and he
won't let himself forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't stink anymore,'' he explained. ``I stunk for a
year- and-a-half, it's as simple as that. I wasn't any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad says he isn't superstitious, but he is maniacal about
maintaining his daily routine. He's at the park early every day. He
studies videotape of opposing pitchers. He plays cards with
teammates Troy Percival and Kent Merkcer. He stretches. He hits off
the tee. He hits in the cage. He's on a very tight schedule. If
anything is thrown off schedule, Erstad is not comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I battle to get myself in position to get ready to
play,'' he said. ``It's not like it's easy. You try to put a good
swing on the ball. Sometimes they fall, sometimes they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   About 37 percent of the time, they fall. He's hitting .365. To
understand how drastic Erstad's turnaround from last year to this
year is, figure this: If Erstad gets an average of four at-bats per
game the rest of the season and doesn't get another hit (0 for
204), he'll finish with an average of .256, three points higher
than his average last season.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's reaction? Go ahead, you ask him. __ Short hops: What's
behind the A's recent surge? Starting pitching. Their starters put
together a streak of seven consecutive games in which they went at
least seven innings. It is the longest streak by an A's staff in 10
years. During the streak, the starters' ERA was 1.90 and opposing
batters hit .161 off them. . . . Outfielder Dave Martinez tied a
major-league record by playing with four teams in one season. He
began the season with the Devil Rays, then was traded, in order, to
the Cubs, Rangers and Blue Jays. . . . Blue Jays assistant GM Dave
Stewart is back on the field as the club's pitching coach. Stewart
is continuing with his front-office duties, but the club felt its
younger pitchers weren't progressing under pitching coach Rick
Langford, who was reassigned to its Triple-A club.

TROUT FISHERMEN SERVE AS POLLUTION POLICE, FIGHTING TO PROTECT THE
WATERSHED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Wis.)   (For use with POLLUTION-POLICE-CREEK)  
 By ROBERT WORTH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a cloudless Saturday recently, George Nikitovich stood
shin-deep in the Cross River, surrounded by overhanging maple
branches. As he stroked his fly rod back and forth in the air with
a gentle whipping motion, his eyes were glued to the stream, where
his fly -- a size 14 Caddis made of elk hair and rooster feather --
floated gently down the gin-clear water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know how to read the water, to find out where the
trout will naturally hide,'' Nikitovich said.
</P>
<P>
   And watching the water alerts you to anything that may be wrong
with it.
</P>
<P>
   New York state's Westchester County still has some of the best
trout fishing in the state. Wild brown and brook trout swim in the
rivers and reservoirs that supply New York City with its drinking
water, luring scores of fishermen on summer days like this one.
</P>
<P>
   But a continuing development boom has threatened the city's
watershed as never before. Since trout, more than most other fish
species, require clean water to thrive, Nikitovich and other
fishermen have become some of the region's most alert and
aggressive environmental advocates.
</P>
<P>
   These fishermen are now leading a new offensive in the struggle
to protect the watershed. Focusing on stormwater runoff, which the
federal Environmental Protection Agency has called the greatest
threat to drinking water across the country, members of the group
Trout Unlimited have documented dozens of storm drains that are
channeling polluted water into the area's reservoirs and streams.
They are also planning to sue the owners of those storm drains, in
concert with Riverkeeper, the environmental watchdog group based in
Garrison, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitovich, 50, a somber-looking stock broker from Cross River,
doesn't exactly fit the profile of a tree-hugging activist. ``I
sometimes wonder -- why am I the one doing this?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he added, is that no one else is out in the streams
all day. When there is a threat to the city's water, fishermen are
usually the first to know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the lead lawyer for Riverkeeper, agreed.
``You can talk to state biologists all day, but the people who
really know what's going on in the watershed are the fishermen,''
he said. ``They have always been the mainstay of our
evidence-gathering capacity and our clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen have played a role in the watershed since its
creation. When the city began building a network of reservoirs for
its water supply in the 19th century, it created the ideal
environment for trout. Trout thrive in very cold water, and the
bottom water from the reservoirs, feeding into the shallow
tailwater streams below, is so cold that on summer days mist rises
from it.
</P>
<P>
   In return, fishermen helped to police the city's waters and
limit development in the forests that surrounded them.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Gordon, William Harris, and other founders of modern
fly-fishing also helped start the conservationist movement in the
Catskills at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Robert Boyle founded the Hudson River Fishermen's
Association, now known as Riverkeeper, one of the watershed's most
aggressive legal advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the water's purity was not in doubt. The city's
daisy chain of upstate streams and reservoirs acted as a vast
filter, cleansing the water as it flowed through forests and
tributaries into the aqueducts that supply what a succession of
mayors have called ``the champagne of city water.''
</P>
<P>
   But the city owns only 4 percent of the land that drains into
the watershed, and some of the city officials charged with
protecting the water supply had moonlighting jobs as consultants to
developers. As Westchester and Putnam Counties grew in the 1960s,
'70s, and '80s, pollution seeped into the water from septic fields,
sewage treatment plants, roads, and lawns.
</P>
<P>
   As threats to the water mounted, fishermen became some of most
active reporters of water violations, helping to fill the gaps in
the city's understaffed police unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had a real impact,'' said Tony Bonavist, an Ossining,
N.Y., native who worked for the state's Fisheries Department for 26
years until he retired in 1992. ``We didn't have people in the
field. If there was a problem in the streams, I'd get a call.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most serious concerns for trout fishermen has been
the more than 100 sewage treatment plants in the watershed. In
October, John Keane and several other members of Trout Unlimited
tested the water in Hallock's Mill Brook, a trout stream that
receives wastewater from the largest of the plants, in Yorktown,
N.Y. They used methods they had been taught by the state's Stream
Biomonitoring Unit in upstate Troy. Above the plant, 75 percent of
the aquatic insects they found were Caddis flies -- an indicator of
high water quality. Below the outlet, the figure was 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In April, Bonavist went to the stream in hopes of catching
trout. Instead, he saw foaming bubbles floating on it, not far from
the sewage plant outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Pierce, a senior aquatic biologist for the state, said an
official had tested the water in the stream in response to
Bonavist's complaint and had not found any evidence of serious
pollution. But the Yorktown plant has chronically violated its
permit in years past, and let raw sewage overflow at least four
times in 1999, said James Tierney, the inspector general for the
city's watershed.
</P>
<P>
   City and county authorities are now looking into ways to pipe
the Yorktown plant's waste to a site out of the watershed.
</P>
<P>
   But it is impossible to remove the largest threat to the city's
water, which comes from the countless miscellaneous pollutants that
collect on roads and fields and flow into rivers and reservoirs.
This kind of pollution tends to grow in direct proportion to the
amount of paved surface in a given area, as the land's natural
ability to filter out pollutants is diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Such diffuse or ``nonpoint'' pollution is hard to measure or
police, because its sources are so various. The federal government
has only begun to regulate it, and states and counties tend to
follow the federal lead.
</P>
<P>
   For fishermen, however, it is often impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   When a storm drain from a housing development in the town of
Carmel began shooting muddy water onto the west branch of the
Croton River seven years ago, Nikitovich noticed immediately. The
West Branch is one of the most beautiful streams in the watershed.
Every fall, brown trout as large as 10 pounds swim up the river to
spawn from the Croton Falls reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   The storm drain was a threat to those spawning grounds because
newborn trout live in streambeds; when the beds become silted up,
the trout cannot survive.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Keane and other Trout Unlimited members became
involved. They realized that the silt pouring into the river wasn't
just a threat to trout. Silt or mud -- turbidity is the the
technical term -- is a serious threat to drinking water, because
the mud can carry with it bacteria, heavy metals, and other
dangerous pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   Already, 10 of the city's 19 reservoirs are overloaded with
phosphorus, an unwanted nutrient carried in runoff, which can cause
algae blooms and elevate toxic elements in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential pollutants could be deadly. In 1993, an
intestinal parasite called cryptosporidium, which is carried in
animal and human waste, entered Milwaukee's water supply, killing
more than 100 people and making 400,000 ill.
</P>
<P>
   Even if pollution never causes similar disasters in New York, it
could cost the city a considerable amount of money. Because of
pollution in the Croton watershed, the city has already committed
itself to building a $1-billion filtration plant for the 10 percent
of its water that comes from east of the Hudson River. If the
pollution gets worse, the federal government has made clear that
the city will have to build what would be the world's largest
filtration plant for the 90 percent of the water that comes from
the Catskills and the Delaware River Valley. That plant would cost
at least $6 billion to build and more than $300 million a year to
operate, sending city water and sewer rates up even more than the
annual rise of 7 percent to 9 percent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid these costs, the city reached an agreement in 1997 with
federal, state, and local governments and environmental groups to
spend $1 billion over 10 years on watershed protection. That
agreement includes a commitment to buy more land as a buffer
against development, as well as modernizing septic fields and
sewage-treatment plants and carrying out new rules and restrictions
on development.
</P>
<P>
   But there are gaps in the current laws, and fishermen have been
among the most active in pointing them out.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Nikitovich and other trout fishermen have led a
campaign to bolster the laws protecting watershed streams. All
reservoirs in the watershed are rated AA -- the highest class of
protection -- but many of the streams that flow into them are rated
C or D, a rating that could allow developers to reroute them with a
backhoe. Under federal law, the state is supposed to review streams
for possible reclassification every three years. But that has not
happened in the watershed for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Post, a spokeswoman for the state, said
reclassification was a complicated and expensive process, and other
states had also taken decades to complete it. She also said that
hearings on the watershed's streams are expected to begin before
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen have also been among the most vocal opponents of new
development projects in the watershed, like the current proposal to
broaden Route 120, which runs along the Kensico Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the fishermen have focused on finding effective ways
to combat stormwater runoff, which has the most direct impact on
trout streams.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most effective methods, they say, can be seen on the
west branch of the Croton River, where runoff from a pipe once
threatened the brown trout's spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that runoff flows into a shallow bog known as a detention
basin, about 180 feet long and 75 feet wide, which the town of
Carmel built last year. The water accumulates in the basin, where
the sediment slowly settles out, and plants on the bottom help to
filter out toxic elements. At the basin's far end is a stone weir,
which regulates a slow flow of water through a pipe and into a
stone culvert, where it trickles gently and harmlessly into the
stream.
</P>
<P>
   That detention basin is a model for controlling stormwater
runoff, Keane said. But it took years of complaints and letter
writing by Trout Unlimited before city officials finally visited
the site and forced the town to build the basin.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city tried to combat the problem by mandating
stormwater controls for all new development in 1997, it has done
little to fix runoff problems caused by buildings constructed
before that time.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Keane organized a team to document other runoff
problems throughout the portion of the watershed east of the Hudson
River. They photographed each site from several angles. They took
samples of water before and after it rained. They did toxicological
tests. In a third of the sites, they found toxic elements in the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Their final report, recently released, includes a novel legal
threat. Instead of giving way to the conventional wisdom that
runoff is everybody's and nobody's fault, the report claims that
storm drains are ``point sources'' of pollution and their owners
can therefore be sued under the Clean Water Act. Already, Kennedy
has announced that Riverkeeper plans to sue the owner of every
storm drain listed in the report.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unusual strategy, and it is too early to tell whether
it will work. Some of the storm drains are owned by the state, some
by the city, some by the towns, some by private individuals, and it
is not always clear who is responsible for the pollution that flows
through them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: Keane and his fellow
fishermen have made clear that trout play a role in safeguarding
the city's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude is that trout are like canaries in the mine,''
Keane said. ``If trout can't live in the water, you've got to be
concerned.''

PITCHING COSTS RANGERS IN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates usually keeps meticulous
count of the number of pitches his pitchers throw in a game.
Yesterday, he couldn't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost count I got so frustrated,'' Oates said. ``I kept track
of \RDavid\S Wells. He was much more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates, seething in his SkyDome office, looked at his pitching
chart, shook his head and said, ``Way too many pitches. I hope some
of our guys were watching David pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   If they did, they would have seen Wells outmatch Rangers rookie
Doug Davis and pitch the Blue Jays to an 8-5 victory yesterday.
Davis gave up three runs in the first inning and the Rangers never
really recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Wells cruised through six innings as his teammates gave him a
7-1 lead off Davis and reliever Jonathan Johnson. Rusty Greer's
three-run double made it 7-4 in the seventh, but the Rangers got no
closer, falling to their sixth loss in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, in his first start since replacing Darren Oliver in the
rotation, allowed six runs on nine hits and a walk in five innings.
He is 1-2 with a 10.07 earned-run average in four starts this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had trouble throwing my fastball where I wanted it and I
didn't have my changeup at any point in the game,'' Davis said.
``Every time I did throw a good pitch over the plate, they seemed
to bloop it in or find a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oates, his frustration reaching the boiling point, made it
clear he wants to see more good pitches over the plate. Many more.
Not only from Davis, but from all his young pitchers. Oates was
still fuming yesterday about Matt Perisho, who walked Brad Fullmer
to start the seventh inning in Friday's game when he had a 5-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for improvement,'' Oates said. ``It's time. It's
time. You've got to throw strikes. Make them swing the bat.
Stuff-wise, you're telling me David Wells' stuff is better than the
guys we've got? His command, though, was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates watches pitch counts closely. Davis threw 43 pitches in
the first inning. Wells threw 42 pitches in the first four innings.
Oates believes his pitchers should average 15 pitches an inning and
throw less than 140 a game. He's getting tired of seeing pitchers
throwing more than 20 pitches an inning and 150 a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep throwing 20 pitches an inning,'' Oates said.
``Your arm can't keep doing that. We're trying to impress on them,
throw the ball over the plate and let them hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, when told of Oates' comment, said he totally agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get ahead in the count and challenge hitters,'' Wells said.
``That's what I tell our young guys, don't nitpick. That's the way
I've been my whole career. Go out and challenge hitters, that's
where I get my energy and success. Even on days when you don't have
your good stuff, you've got to do things differently, but you've
still got to challenge hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, 17-3 with a 3.85 ERA, threw 100 pitches in seven innings,
65 for strikes. Davis threw 107 pitches in five innings. Another
instructive statistic: Wells threw as many as five pitches to only
two of the first 24 batters he faced. He threw seven pitches in the
second inning and six pitches in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep the ball down and throw strikes, you're going to
have success,'' Wells said. ``Believe in your defense. Give them a
chance to make the plays. If you get ahead of hitters and throw
strikes, it sets the tone for the entire game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Oates is looking for from the Rangers' young
starters. His impatience is growing.

WHEN CREEK WATERS GROW MUDDY, THE TROUT DISAPPEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Ga.)   (For use with POLLUTION-POLICE)  
 By ROBERT WORTH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Local fishermen in New York state call it Yoohoo Creek for the
orange-brown clay that has muddied its waters for four years and
driven away trout. But Esopus Creek used to be one of the best
trout-fishing streams in the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the mud comes from the Shandaken Tunnel, an 18-mile
tube, which is operated by New York City and flows into the Esopus
from the Schoharie Reservoir to help maintain the city's water
supply.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Catskill chapter of Trout Unlimited, and several
other groups, teamed up with Riverkeeper, the environmental group,
to take their concerns to the city's Department of Environmental
Protection.
</P>
<P>
   They hired experts to help make their case: the muddy water
flowing into the Esopus was damaging the trout habitat and killing
the aquatic insects they feed on. Since the city owned the
reservoir that was creating the problem, it had a responsibility to
do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   The state's attorney general's office helped mediate discussions
between the fly-fishermen and the city. But after almost a year and
a half, the city refused to budge, and the fishermen filed suit in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the case is that under the Clean Water Act you
cannot discharge a pollutant from a point source without a
permit,'' said Karl Coplan, the Riverkeeper's lawyer, who is
representing the fishermen. ``It's clear under the law that
suspended solids are a pollutant.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has moved to dismiss the suit. Geoffrey Ryan, a
spokesman for the city, said: ``The allegations in the complaint
are without basis in law or fact.''
</P>
<P>
   But William W. Buzbee, a professor of environmental law at Emory
University, in Atlanta, said that some legal precedents suggest
that the law may be on the fishermen's side. In several earlier
cases, polluted water being channeled from one body of water to
another was found to be a violation of the Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   The Shandaken Tunnel was built by the city early in the 1900s to
take water from the Schoharie Reservoir to the Esopus, where it
flows southward to the Ashokan Reservoir and on through aqueducts
to faucets in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Water first began flowing through it in 1924, and muddy water,
known as turbidity, has been an occasional problem in the Esopus
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But it only became a serious threat to trout in 1996, when a
major storm damaged the clay stream banks in the Schoharie and the
streams that feed it, turning the water reddish brown for months on
end.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Esopus has often been crystal clear above the
Shandaken Tunnel outlet and reddish brown below it, said Burt
Darrow, who runs a fly-fishing guide service and has lived in the
area all his life.
</P>
<P>
   If it gets bad enough, the mud can be a threat to the city water
supply, because turbidity carries with it bacteria, metals, and
other dangerous pollutants and can interfere with the effectiveness
of chlorination.
</P>
<P>
   The water, however, is generally cleaner in the Catskill
watershed than east of the Hudson River. And if turbidity becomes a
serious problem, the city can use chemical treatments to help
clarify the water.
</P>
<P>
   But that is no comfort to the fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stream is literally dying,'' Darrow said. ``This used to
be the center of fishing in the Catskills. Now there are weekends
when you don't see a single fisherman on the river.'' His own
business as a guide has dropped significantly since the mud became
a problem, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Urban, the president of the Catskill chapter of Trout
Unlimited, a party to the suit, said: ``It's had a real impact on
the guides and on bed and breakfasts and motels up here.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several things the city could do to remedy the
situation, Coplan said. The intake of the Shandaken Tunnel is on
the bottom of the Schoharie Reservoir, where it is muddiest. The
city could build a multilevel intake, which would minimize the mud
flowing into the tunnel. It could also dredge the reservoir. And it
could restore stream banks in the Schoharie basin.

VAN DYKEN SWIMMING TOWARD GOAL OF A PORSCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was 27, and after her second shoulder surgery in 19 months,
Amy Van Dyken sat there, unable to brush her teeth or dress
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Her swimming career, she had decided, was done.
</P>
<P>
   That was January. Beginning this week in Indianapolis, Van Dyken
will attempt to again make the U.S. Olympic team in the 50- and
100-meter freestyles.
</P>
<P>
   Another inspiring saga of a great athlete willing herself to
overcome adversity, yes?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting there, my arm in a sling,'' Van Dyken recalled,
``and I'm telling my friends and family that I think I'm through.
No more swimming. And my fiance, Tom, says, ``That's too bad,
because if you had made the Olympic team, I was going to buy you a
Porsche Boxster.''
</P>
<P>
   The sling was off, and Van Dyken was back in the pool the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect this great story,'' Van Dyken said. ``But there
is none. I want that car.''
</P>
<P>
   If Van Dyken is embarrassed at the confession, she doesn't show
it. For one thing, her fiance is Tom Rouen, veteran punter for the
Denver Broncos, and he can afford the Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   For the other thing, it's time for the Olympics, and Van Dyken
has her ``attitude'' again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm still cocky and arrogant,'' said Van Dyken, who won
four gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. ``And the reason I
am that way is because you have to be. You're out there by
yourself. You don't have a team behind you, where if you screw up,
they're there to back you up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who's out there swimming wants to be the best. The
way I carry myself is that I deserve to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Van Dyken said, her friends will attest that it's a
good front.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not that cocky in real life,'' she added. ``I
completely change when I get to the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken's track record attests to the other side. Back in
Littleton, Colo., she works for both United Way and the Make-A-Wish
Foundation. She learned sign language for the hearing impaired and
says she wants to teach high school and work with deaf children.
</P>
<P>
   This was even before the tragedy that struck close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Columbine kids are very special to me,'' Van Dyken said.
``To hear the stories from these kids ... to hear from one kid, who
felt it was his fault that one of his friends was dead and another
friend was in a wheelchair. He said it was because he had told them
he wanted them to stay in the cafeteria instead of going outside
that day. These are things these kids have to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is another young boy, who works with my mom, who was in
the choir room when the shootings began. He was running out when he
tripped over one of his good friends' bodies. Another friend of
his, a basketball player, recently committed suicide. The boy said
it's hard to go on every day. He just doesn't see why this is
happening to him and his school. To look in his eyes, there's such
a sadness that comes over him.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken has volunteered a lot of her spare time to help the
teen-agers at Columbine High. On her swimsuit, she wears a ribbon
in honor of the 13 students and teachers who died. Her swim cap
bears the letters ``CHS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kind of adopted the school,'' she said. ``I will continue
to wear the `CHS' and the ribbon until I'm done swimming. And,
hopefully, if I make the team, the Olympic Committee will allow me
to wear that on my Olympic suit, because it's something I feel very
strongly about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who lost their lives and the lives that were
changed forever can't be forgotten. Once you forget, that's when
things like this happen again.''

TRIPLE-A OUTFIELDER EARNS PROMOTION TO RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Outfielder Pedro Valdes joined the Rangers yesterday.
Ruben Sierra remained at Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said the Rangers considered calling
up Sierra when they traded Dave Martinez to the Toronto Blue Jays
for a player to be named later. But he said his staff, including
farm director Reid Nichols, felt Valdes deserved the promotion
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reid said Valdes has done the better job and has been
consistent all year,'' Melvin said. ``There's a loyalty factor
involved too. Valdes has been with us all year. We felt he deserved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who was with the Rangers in spring training, was hitting
.333 with 16 home runs and 78 runs batted in for 91 games with the
RedHawks. Sierra, a former major-league All-Star who signed a
minor-league contract with the Rangers on May 1, is hitting .325
with 14 home runs and 80 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it yesterday,'' Valdes said. ``We've been
talking about it all season, whether one of us would get called up.
He wasn't disappointed. He understands. He's a nice guy, everybody
likes him down there. He's playing great and he's really helping
the young players.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said Sierra, 34, might be called up in September when the
rosters are expanded to 40 players, but ``I don't see where he'll
get at-bats. You can't have too many \Rdesignated hitters\S. He's
more of a pinch-hitter type. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes is likely to play a similar role with the Rangers for
now. He could be a candidate to be the team's DH next year, but it
is doubtful he will get a lot of playing time this season. His
defensive abilities are considered limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may get some at-bats that way; he has been a pretty
productive player the last couple of years,'' Melvin said. ``But he
probably won't get the same opportunities as the other guys. It's
up to Johnny \ROates\S to play him where he wants. We look at him
as an older player. He's not someone I told Johnny he has to play.
He'll probably play the same role David \RMartinez\S was playing, a
bat off the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes is a left-handed hitter. Right now, Oates is committed to
Frank Catalanotto as his left-handed designated hitter.
Catalanotto, who was benched yesterday with left-hander David Wells
on the mound for Toronto, is hitting .355.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cat deserves to play,'' Oates said. ``Very few players are
going to play every day. We'll see how it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes played in 23 games with the Chicago Cubs in 1997-98. He
signed with the Boston Red Sox as a minor-league free agent in
1999. The Rangers signed him just after the '99 season started, and
he hit .327 at Oklahoma with 21 home runs and 72 RBI. That earned
him a nonroster invitation to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good chance to show what I can do,'' Valdes said.
``I've got to be ready any time I get a chance to play, whether
it's coming off the bench or whenever I get into a game.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending July 29 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

<P>
   In 1972, Mark Spitz stepped out of the Olympic swimming pool in
Munich, West Germany, wearing a star-spangled swimsuit that wasn't
much larger than his moustache.
</P>
<P>
   Women swooned. The ensuing poster made Spitz, bound for dental
school, a lot of lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, it seems, the Olympic motto for swimsuits has
remained the same: ``modicus, stringius, citius,'' or something
like that.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller, tighter, faster.
</P>
<P>
   But wait until you see what they're wearing this time _
bodysuits. Neck-to-ankle suits made of space-age materials that are
alleged to knife through water in the same way a shark's skin does.
</P>
<P>
   Human sausage casings. Australian butterfly queen Susie O'Neill
reported that it took 15 minutes just to squeeze into hers.
</P>
<P>
   To bodysuit, or not to bodysuit? That will be the overshadowing
question this week as the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials begin in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the human melodramas, like Amy Van Dyken's comeback
attempt after two shoulder surgeries and 33-year-old Dara Torres
trying to become the first American to swim in four Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Ignore, if you will, the saga of backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg,
born in Ukraine and taken to the United States by his parents
because they wanted him to grow up in the land of the free.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind it all, because in these trials, the race may not go
to the swift, but to who has the best Speedo tailor.
</P>
<P>
   To get the best fit for one of the new bodysuits, the swimmer
has to undergo a 3-D scan of his or her entire body.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has gurgled ever since the first neck-to-ankle
bodysuit was worn in international competition at a July 1999, meet
in Istanbul, Turkey. The world governing body for swimming, FINA,
soon approved use of the suit for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments ensued, not the least of which was who was going to
get the new suits in time to make their respective Olympic teams.
At an estimated $250 per suit, clearly it isn't for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   But does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   FINA rules specifically outlaw any device that aids in ``speed,
buoyancy and endurance during a competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed enhancement is exactly one of the manufacturer claims of
the new suits.
</P>
<P>
   At the Short Course World Championships in Athens, Greece, in
March, 15 world records were broken, most of them by swimmers
wearing the bodysuits. At the Australian Olympic trials in May, the
bodysuit-clad O'Neill shattered Mary T. Meagher's 19-year-old
record in the 200-meter butterfly, even though head coach Don
Talbot had urged his swimmers not to wear the new suits.
</P>
<P>
   Olympian Rowdy Gaines has said that he thinks the bodysuits can
improve a swimmer's time by a half-second per 100 meters. The coach
of Dutch sensaton Inge DeBruijn, Paul Berger, estimates the
improvement as more like 1.5 seconds. Which is huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the new suit a lot,'' said Krayzelburg, who has assumed
the role of world's best backstroker. ``You can tell the
difference. It helps you swim with more proper technique. By
holding you in, it makes your body more compact. And that's the
whole idea when you swim, to be as efficient as possible to move
through the water.''
</P>
<P>
   After a June announcement banning use of the bodysuits at the
Olympic Trials, USA Swimming relented one month later and announced
July 18 that swimmers could wear the suits. The manufacturers _
Speedo, adidas, Tyr and Nike _ have promised to make enough suits
available.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, one suspects, is sponsor-driven. Imagine the
number of bodysuits that Speedo will sell if the world sees them
breaking records on the Olympic TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   As the saga of Spitz, his Speedo and his seven gold medals
remind us, swimsuits have always been a part of the Olympic story.
Once upon a time, the magic cloth was said to be Lycra. Four years
ago in Atlanta, 77 percent of the swim medalists wore Speedo's
Aquablade suits.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen and ladies, start your sausage casings. We have
another Olympic team to pick.

PRESEASON RANKING FIRST FOR TCU IN 40 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU football fans had been waiting for
yesterday since Jan. 5, the day The Associated Press poll anointed
Florida State the 1999 national champions.
</P>
<P>
   TCU free safety Curtis Fuller, however, had other things on his
mind. Working on a couple of summer-school papers, this graduate
student was stunned to hear the Frogs' standing at No. 20 in AP's
2000 preseason poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you serious?
</P>
<P>
   ``The AP poll?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, that is very shocking to me,'' Fuller said on the phone
during a study break. ``I don't know what to say. I don't know if
that will give us more confidence or more pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgive Fuller for being uncertain about how to handle the news.
It has been 40 years since TCU was ranked in AP's preseason poll,
checking in at No. 11 in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly as rare as having three college graduates still
eligible _ Fuller, Jeff Millican and Stuart Ashley are each in
graduate school _ are TCU appearances in the AP poll since 1960.
Only twice since then _ 1984 and '90 _ have the Frogs been ranked
during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But with consecutive bowl victories the past two years, 18
starters returning, a Heisman Trophy contender in LaDainian
Tomlinson and now a national ranking, the stage appears set for
TCU's greatest season in a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that there's a gesture of respect in being
acknowledged as a Top 25 team,'' Horned Frogs coach Dennis
Franchione said. ``We had hoped to get into the Top 25 after
\Rbeating\S East Carolina in the \RMobile Alabama Bowl.\S
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're flattered by that, but we also know that the 2000
team hasn't done anything yet. It's based on how your team finished
in '99 and how many returning starters you have in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs won their last five games in '99, including an upset
of No. 20 East Carolina in the Mobile Alabama Bowl, to finish 8-4.
Franchione hoped TCU would squeeze into the final Top 25, but the
Frogs found themselves four teams deep in the ``others receiving
votes'' category.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's previous preseason ranking also followed the last time the
Frogs played in consecutive bowl games. TCU limped to a 4-4-2
record in 1960 and would post only seven winning years until
Franchione took over in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Inheriting a 1-10 team from Pat Sullivan, Franchione led TCU to
a 7-5 record in 1998 and a stunning victory against Southern
Californa in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being ranked gets us started on something Coach Fran set out
to do when he came here two years ago, make us a Top 25 program,''
said Fuller, a Fort Worth Christian graduate who transferred to TCU
from Tyler Junior College before the '98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that note, when we look down the road at this 2000 team, we
want to make sure we left our mark. We may have started at 20, but
finished at 10. We want to keep building this for others to keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the 2000 legacy will be based on whether the
Frogs reach a third consecutive bowl _ that has never been done in
school history _ and which bowl that is. Winning the Western
Athletic Conference championship would ensure a return trip to the
Mobile Alabama Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little bit more of a target, but I don't know how much
more of a target we can be,'' Franchione said referring to TCU's
final season in the WAC. ``The only pitfall of being ranked is not
living up to expectations, which keep growing by each day.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, talk of a TCU berth in the Bowl Championship Series
has begun. Should the Frogs finish the season ranked among the top
six in the BCS standings, a berth in one of the four BCS games is
guaranteed. Franchione and Fuller realize starting at No. 20 makes
that climb a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it's attainable,'' Fuller said of a BCS game. ``But
for that to happen we would have to have a great season. No
injuries and we have to be flawless game in and game out, which we
can be if we set our minds to it. We don't hang our hats on that
goal, but we know it's in our grasp.''

TELEPHONE STRIKE LOOMS AS TALKS FALTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verizon Communications had failed to reach a contract agreement
with its unions late Saturday night, setting the stage for a
walkout by more than 86,000 telephone workers on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A walkout affecting about 25 million households and businesses
in an area stretching from Maine to Virginia might create delays
for Verizon customers who need telephone repairs, telephone
installation or directory assistance from service representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Basic dial tone and automated services would remain functional,
and emergency services like 911 would also operate normally. A
strike would not affect Verizon's wireless service, which has 26
million subscribers. Verizon did not establish any hot lines or
special numbers for customers having difficulties in soliciting
services.
</P>
<P>
   Because the walkout would start Sunday, it was not expected to
have as great an impact as it would have had if it were to begin on
a weekday, when the volume of calls would be greater. Both sides
appeared ready to continue talks Sunday in effort to reach an
agreement before the start of the work week.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, the company created when Bell Atlantic acquired GTE and
formed an alliance with Britain's Vodafone AirTouch for wireless
services, is the nation's largest provider of local telephone and
wireless services, with 260,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the dispute involves fairly ordinary labor
issues, including wages, benefits, stress levels on the job and
outside contracting of certain work.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps more important, Verizon and officials from the
Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers also failed to agree on how the union should
be allowed to organize workers in Verizon's fast-growing wireless
division. The union had sought to make it easier for wireless
workers to join a union.
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to the talks, Verizon submitted a new
proposal late Saturday altering an earlier proposal. The new
three-year contract proposal would raise wages 10.5 percent over
three years, compared with 17.5 percent over five years, and would
lower the percentage of the company's workforce which could be
affected by the migration of jobs as the result of the merger, from
6 percent to 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, separate negotiations were initiated Saturday over
the unions' request that organizing wireless employees be made
easier. But both sides were not optimistic of reaching an agreement
by 12:01 a.m. Sunday, the unions' deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect we'll get to midnight without an agreement, but we're
ready to continue talking past the deadline and throughout Sunday
to reach common ground,'' said Eric Rabe, Verizon's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the company's old wireline operations, providing
local and long-distance service, worry that the wireless arm will
soon eclipse the rest of the company in importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget about the stress level of my job, with things like
random monitoring of my calls by a supervisor or forced overtime,''
said Stephanie Harrison, 47, a customer service representative in
Westchester County. ``I'm worried that in five years I won't have a
job because wireless will be dominant and plain old telephone
service will be very small.''
</P>
<P>
   The communications workers have predicted that revenue for the
wireless division will grow by 86 percent between 1998 and 2003,
compared with a 25 percent increase in revenue for local services.
But while nearly 80 percent of the 120,000 employees in the
company's local telephone division are unionized, fewer than 50
percent of the 32,000 workers in its wireless unit are.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a strike could have broad implications for many
high-technology industries, which, in general, have not been
unionized.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless communications industry as a whole already has more
than 90 million subscribers and is adding 30,000 more a day. The
unions hope that if they win concessions that make it easier for
them to organize Verizon's wireless workers, and if they then
persuade the workers to join, workers at other wireless companies
will become more enthusiastic about unionization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But Verizon officials say that the wireless industry is so
competitive that increased union representation of its wireless
workers would put it at a critical disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way unionization wouldn't be a competitive
disadvantage to Verizon would be if all their competitors were
unionized, too,'' said Jeff Kagan, an independent
telecommunications analyst. ``If only one or two of the companies
are unionized and the rest are not, it will be like a ball and
chain around the ankles of the ones that are.''
</P>
<P>
   One way the company has limited union influence even in its
unionized local and long-distance divisions has been to contract
out work to nonunionized companies for services like the
installation of high-speed Internet lines. The unions strongly
object to this practice, and they are arguing for limits on
Verizon's ability to contract out certain tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The natural pressures of the market can be fierce, but a
fearful, non-union workforce does not necessarily enhance
competitiveness, said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor issues
at the University of California at Berkeley. At the core of this
issue is whether our companies will be able to compete in a human
way.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout comes at a delicate time for Verizon. The company is
in the midst of establishing an identity for its new brand name
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   And it was unclear late Saturday how long the strike might last.
In 1998, the two unions struck Bell Atlantic for only two days,
with little effect on customer service, winning a no-layoff clause
and improved pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1989, workers struck for 17 weeks against Nynex, which
later merged with Bell Atlantic. Thousands of union members
picketed, dozens of strikers were arrested and a backlog of nearly
250,000 installation orders built up. The unions succeeded in
reversing a company demand that workers pay monthly health
insurance premiums.

PERCIVAL, ETHERTON PUT ON DISABLED LIST

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Both closer Troy Percival (tendinitis, right elbow)
and starter Seth Etherton (tendinitis, right shoulder) officially
were placed on the disabled list Saturday, joining fellow Anaheim
Angels pitchers Tim Belcher, Jason Dickson, Al Levine, Kent Mercker
and Jarrod Washburn.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Alvarez and Lou Pote were called up from Triple-A Edmonton
to replace Percival and Etherton on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Wise will take Etherton's spot in the rotation and make his
first major-league start next Wednesday in Anaheim against the Red
Sox. Replacing Percival, who has 25 saves, will be another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia said the club will use a
closer-by-committee, but Shigetoshi Hasegawa will get most of the
opportunities. Mark Petkovsek might also get some chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a definite structure,'' Scioscia said. ``We'll just
run things like if Percy needed a day off.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushing Hasegawa and Petkovsek to the end of games means the
means the middle relief could suffer. And that makes it even more
important for the starters to go deeper into games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we haven't gotten production from key components
lately,'' Scioscia said. ``You can call it growing pains, put a lot
of labels on it. But we're in a rut.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Inflammation: Percival's elbow is inflamed because he has
been favoring his surgically repaired shoulder. The Angels hope
that 15 days off will calm the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to take a step back,'' Scioscia said. ``He's not even
a year from surgery. We have to put constraints on how he's used,
how much he's used.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival said his elbow was hurting him last Sunday when he blew
a 6-4 lead in the ninth against the White Sox. But the next day,
Levine was put on the disabled list, so Percival kept his mouth
shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to say something once Al went down,'' Percival
said. ``It's pretty tough to lose Al and myself at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival couldn't deny it after his second consecutive blown
save on Friday. He has nine blown saves this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the blown saves and I don't think he's pitched as
poorly as his record indicates,'' Scioscia said. ``But obviously,
they're on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More breakdowns: Etherton has been hit hard in two of his
past three starts and he says it's the result of a tired shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing I can't throw through,'' he said. ``It's just
fatigue, but I know the best thing for the team is for me to rest.
. . . It's frustrating more than anything. We're trying to win
games in the division race. We need good outings every time out and
I can't help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Sore Mo: First baseman Mo Vaughn was not in the starting
lineup Saturday because of a sore left biceps.

ANGELS SUFFER FOURTH STRAIGHT LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Anaheim Angels took the high road Saturday
against the Cleveland Indians. But when the game was over, all it
led to was a 6-3 loss and a catcher bleeding as a result of a slide
that would have made Ty Cobb proud.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Angels' fourth in a row, their longest losing
streak of the season. And while they say there is no reason to
panic (they've lost 10 of 14), they went down without a fight in
front of 43,162 at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   The game included a spikes-high slide by the Indians' Manny
Ramirez in the fourth inning. Ramirez ran through a stop sign from
third-base coach Jim Riggleman and tried to score from second on a
single to right by Jim Thome.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon's one-hop throw was on target and catcher Matt
Walbeck made the tag despite taking Ramirez's right foot in the
groin and upper thigh. The Angels thought the play was dirty, but
when Ramirez came to the plate in the following inning _ with two
out, a runner on second and first base open _ Angels starter Scott
Schoeneweis never came inside to Ramirez, who flied out to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He apologized to Wally and Wally was fine with it,''
Schoeneweis said. ``I haven't been in too many situations like
that. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm trying to keep the
team in the game. I didn't want to give them too many extra
baserunners.''
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck, who was hit by a pitch on the right knee later in the
game, suffered a cut high on his inner right thigh. ``A little
further to the left and it's goodnight,'' said Walbeck, who said he
never considered instructing Schoeneweis to throw at Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to throw at a guy in a tight game,'' he said.
``You play the game and you play hard. I don't think throwing at a
guy proves anything. Things like that happen. They shouldn't, but
unfortunately they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a play up the middle, our guy is going in hard.
Hopefully not with his spikes up.''
</P>
<P>
   From his vantage point in right field, Salmon couldn't see the
play well. But after talking with Walbeck, he got the message that
the play was dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, everybody's fair game now,'' Salmon said. ``You have a
chance to break up two, put 'em into left field. But keep it
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels can't seem to catch any breaks these days. In an
11-10 loss Friday night, the Angels got plenty of offense and good
work from the bullpen but no starting pitching. Saturday, they got
seven solid innings from Schoeneweis but little offense and shoddy
relief work.
</P>
<P>
   A reason for the Angels' lack of offense came as a result of
Indians starter Chuck Finley, who got a no-decision despite
pitching well. He gave up two runs (one earned) and five hits in
six innings, striking out six and walking four. Salmon, who
extended his hitting streak to 13 games, ended Finley's shutout bid
with a two-out homer in the sixth. Garret Anderson added an RBI
single later in the inning to tie the game at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was out of the game when the Indians took the lead for
good in the seventh on Kenny Lofton's RBI single. The Indians broke
the game open in the eighth inning off reliever Mark Petkovsek, who
was ripped for three runs and five hits in one-third of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Angels manager Mike Scioscia held a brief team
meeting. The Angels have fallen seven games out in the AL West,
matching their largest deficit of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little out of sync right now,'' Scioscia said. ``The
whole season is a challenge. There's no need to panic. We're in the
same position we were 10 days ago as far as the big picture of
things. We haven't played well the last two weeks, but I don't
think overall the picture has changed much.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of Schoeneweis' focus was on facing Finley, from whom
Schoeneweis learned much while the two were teammates in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited, there was a little added incentive,'' said
Schoeneweis, who hasn't won since May 25. ``I feel he's the top of
the lot. I respect him more than anyone in the game I've met so
far. I knew I had to have my A-game. He's a great pitcher. I
battled him inning for inning but came up short.''

<P>
   &UR; THE NAKED AND THE DEAD &LR;  By Norman Mailer. (Picador USA, $16.)
Norman Mailer was a young World War II veteran with a story to tell
in 1948 when this hefty novel, his first, was published. In The New
York Times Book Review, David Dempsey found it ``the most ambitious
novel to be written about the recent conflict'' and ``the most
ruthlessly honest.'' ```The Naked and the Dead' is not a great
book,'' this early evaluation concluded, ``but indisputably it
bears witness to a new and significant talent among American
novelists.'' The novel has been reissued in a 50th anniversary
edition with a new introduction by Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   Picador has also reissued  &UR; WHY ARE WE IN VIETNAM? &LR;  ($13), a
Mailer novel from 1967, when he was well established as a celebrity
writer. Vietnam itself is not mentioned until the last page of the
novel, which chronicles the Alaska hunting trip of two
soldiers-to-be, who set out to prove their virility in various
ways. Anatole Broyard said that it ``may be a third-rate work of
art, but it's a first-rate outrage to our sensibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ISAAC'S STORM &LR;  By Erik Larson. (Vintage, $13.) More than 6,000
people died in the hurricane that struck Galveston, Texas, in 1900;
the Isaac in question was Isaac M. Cline, chief of the U.S. Weather
Bureau's Galveston station. He ``survived his colossal misreading
of the situation on an impromptu raft,'' W. Jeffrey Bolster wrote
last year, adding that ``Larson never personifies nature, but he
sees poetry in weather.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALICE SPRINGS &LR;  By Nikki Gemmell. (Penguin, $12.95.) A footloose
young artist journeys into the Australian outback to find her
mysterious father. The novel ``offers a whittled-down portrait of
external and internal landscapes under pressure,'' Elizabeth Graver
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE VIEW FROM ALGER'S WINDOW: A Son's Memoir &LR;  By Tony Hiss.
(Vintage, $13.) The author was 7 years old when his father, Alger
Hiss, was accused of passing secrets to the Russians. By drawing on
hundreds of letters Alger Hiss sent from prison, the son takes up
his father's cause in what Ann Douglas last year called ``a
poignant, wonderfully written and deeply troubling memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THOSE DAMN YANKEES: The Secret Life of America's Greatest
Franchise &LR;  By Dean Chadwin. (Verso, $15.) The author, a New York
lawyer, sees baseball's perennial overdogs as a malign influence on
the sport. He ``tackles his topic with a zealotry worthy of any
Kennedy conspiracy theorist,'' Allen St. John wrote last year. But
St. John finds the author's larger point ``muddled by his
anti-Yankee animus.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' championship season of two years ago, along with
the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home-run derby, is celebrated in
 &UR; SUMMER OF '98 &LR;  by Mike Lupica (Contemporary Books, $14.95). The
book ``finds fresh ways of telling us history we have already lived
through,'' George Robinson wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RIVER OF DARKNESS &LR;  By Rennie Airth. (Penguin, $6.99.) Surviving
the carnage of the third Battle of Ypres in World War I, a sergeant
major returns to Surrey's green and pleasant land as a psychopathic
killer. The Scotland Yard inspector on his trail is himself a
battle-scarred veteran. The novel ``has balanced savagery and
civilization neatly, and given civilization just the barest edge,''
Christopher Dickey wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ACCIDENTAL BRIDE &LR;  By Janice Harayda. (St. Martin's Griffin,
$13.95.) In this comedy of contemporary manners, Lily Blair, a
newspaper reporter, is about to marry the third-richest man in the
second-largest city in Ohio when she is torn between the security
of married suburban life and following her career dreams to New
York. This first novel is ``devoid of the delicious tension that
infuses books like `Pride and Prejudice,''' Maggie Galehouse wrote
last year. But she praised the author as ``an astute social
commentator.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LATER AUDEN &LR;  By Edward Mendelson. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$17.) The work of W.H. Auden rather than the life dominates this
second of two biographical volumes by his literary executor and the
editor of his collected works. The author ``makes Auden dull, a
mere clerk of the emotions,'' William Logan wrote last year, though
he found that ``Mendelson's readings fathom the poem phrase by
phrase, and even the footnotes are lively with criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has also released  &UR; EARLY AUDEN &LR;  ($16),
covering the poet's life until he left England for New York in
1939. ``Mendelson is informative on the early influences,'' Denis
Donoghue wrote in 1981.
