<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors in northeast
China's Dalian City will enjoy more efficient services from
government organs, thanks to the city's latest action to improve
its investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The port city published a decision on further improving the
environment for overseas investment today, ordering all government
organs concerned to work more efficiently for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
For example, the decision orders industrial and commercial
administrative departments to finish registration work for a
foreign-funded firm within ten working days.
</P>
<P>
The decision also announces that foreign investors will enjoy
equal treatment with locals, such as paying the same fees for
accommodation, buying housing, children's education, travel and
inner-city transportation.
</P>
<P>
"We aim to create an ideal environment for foreign investment,
in accordance with international practice," said Deputy Mayor Li
Yongjin.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by some 30 government departments after
conducting a survey among foreign-funded enterprises late last
year.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure thorough implementation of the decision, the
city has set up a special team to take charge of supervision and
examination, Li said.
</P>
<P>
One of China's first coastal cities to open to the outside
world, Dalian has launched over 6,000 enterprises with overseas
businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Disappointed over Iran's Call for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today expressed its
disappointment over Iran's call for the withdrawal of Turkish
Ambassador to Tehran Osman Koruturk and Consul General in
Orumieh Ufuk Ozsancak, a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Iranian Ambassador Muhammed Reza
Baqeri with his speech in Sincan on February 1 and Iranian
Consul General in Istanbul Muhammed Reza Rasheed with his
statement to a news agency seriously violated international
principles of law.
</P>
<P>
Baqeri made a controversial speech on the occasion of marking
"Al-quds (Jerusalem) Night," an Iran-promoted anti-Israel event
in Sincan, 40 kilometers west of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Baqeri's remarks angered the Turkish Foreign Ministry, which
lodged a protest note against him, saying that he should not
comment on Turkey's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Embassy in Tehran later made initiatives to the
Iranian Foreign Ministry and called on the withdrawal of the two
Iranian diplomats, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Baqeri and Rasheed departed Turkey for home on February 19.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Iranian Charge d'affaires here said
that within the framework of an order from Iran, he called for
the withdrawal of Koruturk and Ozsancak as they could not
function in Iran any more.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that Turkey's call for the
withdrawal of the Iranian diplomats has strong and objective
reasons in accordance with international law and norms.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry declared Saeed
Zadeh, Iranian consul general in Erzurum, a city in eastern
Turkey, as persona non grata and asked him to leave Turkey within
48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Turkey made the tough decision as Zadeh, through a Turkish
private news agency and some television channels Wednesday,
accused Turkish Second Chief of General Staff Cevik Bir of
making "unfriendly" speeches against Iran in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Bir called Iran a supporter of terrorism during a joint
U.S.-Turkish Council meeting in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iran issued a protest Monday, saying that what Bir said was
"irresponsible, unacceptable and similar to those by the U.S. and
Israel."

HANGZHOU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A number of enterprises in
east China's Zhejiang Province are making an effort to access
international markets through a new channel.
</P>
<P>
The first on-line international exhibition in the province has
been set up and gone into operation this year.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, set up by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, is open to Internet users
around the clock through a server set up on the trunk line in the
United States.

So far, a number of foreign trade enterprises in Hangzhou and
Xiaoshan, two of the most rapidly developing areas in the
province, have logged on to the service, where they are connected
to the world's most famous import and export electronic billboard
and UN trade information bulletin.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Second-oldest Canadian Retailer Claims Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A time-honored department store
chain of Canada, the T. Eaton's Co. Ltd., has sought and received
bankruptcy protection, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
George Eaton, president of the family-owned company, the
second-oldest retailer in Canada, called the move a "temporary
measure" that will allow Eaton's to keep creditors at bay until it
works out a plan to turn the company around.
</P>
<P>
The company, which claimed insolvency in court documents filed
Thursday in Ontario Court, has until June 15 to file a business
plan and has protection from creditors until June 30.
</P>
<P>
The retailer reportedly owns banks 118 million U.S. dollars
and about the same amount to its suppliers. It has lost close to
190 million dollars since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Eaton's said it would probably close up to 40 of its 87 stores
across Canada and shed a good portion of its 16,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
The company is the latest to suffer from the country's highly
competitive and troubled retail industry, resulting from low
consumer confidence and a sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Last September, the retailing Consumers Distributing Inc. went
bankrupt after failing to manage its 190-million-dollar debt.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said today after his party losing a key by-election that the
Tories would still be returned to power.
</P>
<P>
However, he said in an interview with ITN television that "if
opinion does not change, then we are going to have a Labor
government."
</P>
<P>
On an unusually high turnout for a by-election of 73 percent,
Labor candidate Ben Chapman received 22,767 votes in Wirral South,
7,888 votes more than the 14,879 of his Conservative rival Les
Byrom.
</P>
<P>
Immediately knowing the result, a Labor spokesman said, "No
party has ever lost a by-election so close to a general election,
in a seat they had won at the previous general election, and gone
on to win the general election."
</P>
<P>
Labor's deputy leader John Prescott said the result was "a
major shift in politics."
</P>
<P>
Liberal Democratic Party leader Paddy Ashdown asked Prime
Minister Major to call an election. "The longer you leave it, the
harder you fall," he said.

JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was
killed and three others wounded in fierce fighting between
Israeli troops and Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon this
morning, the state-run Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
The casualties were inflicted when pro-Iranian Hezbollah
(Party of God) fighters attacked an Israeli outpost in the
eastern sector of the Israeli occupied "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-square-kilometer zone was established by Israel in
1985 as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The wounded were evacuated by helicopters to the Rambam
Hospital in the northern Israeli city of Haifa. One of them was
reported in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces responded with heavy bombardment from tanks
and artillery. A few hours later, Israeli Air Force planes
raided suspected Hezbollah targets north of the "security zone."

Today's Hezbollah attack was the third fatal one since the
beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Jilin Controls Industrial Pollution Effectively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Province in northeast
China has achieved fruitful results in reducing industrial
pollution by controlling the total volume of pollutants discharged
and launching a "blue sky, clean water" project.
</P>
<P>
The province has adhered to the principle of giving priority to
preventing pollution and combining precautions with combating
existing pollution, bringing 757 sources of pollution under
control and closing down or removing 163 enterprises guilty of
serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
The province's overall capability of preventing and fighting
against pollution has improved a lot, with more than 70 percent of
industrial waste now treated, a rate nearing the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Its environmental protection drive is mainly focused on
industrial pollution, which has been the province's environmental
scourge due to its backward industrial technology.
</P>
<P>
It invested 518 million yuan (about 61 million US dollars) in
treating 327 pollution sources in the petrochemical industry
sector, and has built corresponding anti-pollution facilities
whenever it built, rebuilt or enlarged industrial projects.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Discuss Work Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's top
advisory body today regarded a work report delivered by its
vice-chairman Thursday as substantial and encouraging.
</P>
<P>
The members, separated into 49 groups, said that the report by
Ye Xuanping, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), is
comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
They gave high credits to the CPPCC National Committee's work
last year and raised proposals for the handling of China's two
major events this year, namely, China's resumption of the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong in July and the convocation of the
15th national congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
The members also discussed how the CPPCC can play a greater
role in China's political and economic life.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinbei, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central
Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said
that efforts should be made to strengthen links between inland
members and members in Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC should do more in promoting socialist ethical and
cultural progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Members from ethnic minority areas and from religious circles
said they are inspired by the fact that the report mentions the
question of great unity among all ethnic groups several times.
</P>
<P>
Han Shenggui, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC
National Committee and president of the Islam Association of
Qinghai Province, said consolidating unity among ethnic groups is
an issue of overall importance and reflects the central
government's consistent policy.
</P>
<P>
"China is a big family composed of more than 50 ethnic groups,"
he said. "To make the people of such a big family happy and to
ensure a sustained and stable growth of the national economy,
there must be unity among all ethnic groups."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shirao, a former vice minister of commerce, said that how
to further develop agriculture on the basis of an increase in
grain output last year is a very important study subject.
</P>
<P>
Many proposals made by CPPCC National Committee members last
year have been adopted by relevant government departments, said
Jin Chongji, who called for realistic proposals for state-owned
enterprise reforms and re-employment of displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Guang, a song writer, said: "I support Vice-Chairman Ye's
report and agree on great unity and alliance of all ethnic groups
for a common objective."
</P>
<P>
He also proposed for an increase in financial input in
advancing ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fen, a professor of Qinghua University, said that the
realization of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the
long-term goal for the year 2010 calls for the cultivation of a
large number of people with knowledge about basic sciences and
about management and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Members from Hong Kong said that they now feel even more of the
heavy task on their shoulders as Hong Kong will return to the
embrace of the motherland in over 100 days.
</P>
<P>
Wong Ker Lee, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC
National Committee and Chairman of Taiching International
(Holding) Co. Ltd, said that the overall situation is favorable
for a smooth return of Hong Kong to China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that CPPCC National Committee members
from Hong Kong try all possible means to mobilize and unite with
all people that love the motherland and Hong Kong to support the
first chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region and the future Hong Kong SAR government.
</P>
<P>
More should be done to spread the Basic Law in order to bolster
the confidence of Hong Kong residents and of international
investors, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC National Committee members from Hong Kong should improve
their efficiency in participating and deliberating government and
state affairs and reflect popular will to the chief executive or
relevant departments, in order to guarantee social stability and
economic development in Hong Kong, he said.

BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Two senior Party officials
today joined discussions of members of the Eighth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), which is having its fifth session in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, state councillor and a member of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
and Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau, and a
member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee,
respectively joined people from the sports circle and the science
and technology circle in group discussions.
</P>
<P>
After listening to members from the sports circle, Li expressed
appreciation for their precious suggestions, which he said would
be very helpful to China's sports work.
</P>
<P>
"The years since the beginning of reforms and opening up in
1978 have witnessed a rapid progress in the field of sports in
China, which is a major component of socialist ethical and
cultural progress," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that sports reform should be carried out on the basis
of adherence to socialism, and must be compatible with a socialist
market economic structure.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion in the scientists' group, Wen called on
all people of the science and technology circle to have a clear
understanding of their eminent responsibilities, and play a
significant role in promoting socialist material, ethical, and
cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
"We should try to improve the general quality of the national
economy and raise the quality and efficiency of economic growth
through the application of science and technology," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the government should pay special attention
to and show great concern for scientists and technicians in
money-losing enterprises, rural areas, and other disadvantaged
regions and sectors, while supporting middle-aged and young
scientists and awarding science and technology workers having made
outstanding contributions.

<HEADLINE> US Economic Growth in 4th Quarter Revised Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at a
quick 3.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1996, but
much slower than the first estimated rate announced last month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department revised down today the economic
expansion in the last three months of 1996 from the initial
estimate of a seasonally adjusted 4.7 percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The down revision of 0.8 percentage points produced a change in
the growth estimate for all of 1996, pulling it down to 2.4
percent from 2.5 percent, the Commerce Department report said.
</P>
<P>
The revision in the gross domestic product (GDP), the economy's
total output of goods and services, was almost entirely due to a
slower buildup in inventories of unsold goods, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that a slimmer backlog of surplus stocks means
that any pickup in consumer demand is more likely to create
production increases at the nation's factories.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the
U.S. economic activity, rose at a 3.4 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
In other areas, business investment in new plant and equipment
grew at a 5.5 percent annual rate. Residential construction, a key
source of strength in the first half of 1996, edged lower at a 0.4
percent rate in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit, which had detracted from economic
growth during the first nine months of the year, added 37.4
billion dollars to growth in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
The report said measure of inflation tied to GDP -- prices paid
by U.S. residents -- rose at a moderate 2.5 percent annual rate in
the October-December period, the same as first estimated.
</P>
<P>
Last year's growth marked an improvement over the 2 percent
registered in 1995 but was much slower than the robust 3.5 percent
advance in 1994, the best in six years.
</P>
<P>
The final revision to the U.S. economic growth rate is expected
next month.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Envoy Reports Slow Progress on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Angolan president Jose Eduardo
Dos Santos today sent a special message to Zimbabwean president
Robert Mugabe briefing him on latest developments on the peace
process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by Dos Santos' special envoy Lopo Do
Nascimento to Mugabe at Zimbabwe house in Harare. Mugabe chairs
the southern African development community's organ on politics,
defence and security.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is going on but very, very slowly... and
the problem is with UNITA," Nascimento told journalists after
meeting Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said UNITA has not yet dispatched its four members to join
the national unity and reconciliation cabinet heading the
ministries of tourism, commerce, health and mines.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the government, scheduled for January 25, was
postponed after negotiators failed to find an acceptable role for
Savimbi, who still controls much of Angola, including
diamond-rich areas in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi has rejected a MPLA offer to become vice-president in
a national unity government demanding he be made the official
leader of the opposition in parliament or a special adviser to
Dos Santos.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Hails Opening of NPC Annual Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper,
People's Daily, will carry an editorial, hailing the opening of
the annual session of the National People's Congress (NPC),
China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that the Fifth Session of the Eighth NPC,
which is convened shortly after the Chinese people suffered the
loss of their beloved Deng Xiaoping and in this important year in
the history of China, is of an extraordinary significance, and has
arrested the attention of the world.
</P>
<P>
During the session, the editorial says, NPC deputies will hear
and review the government report, examine and approve reports on
the implementation of the 1996 plan for national economic and
social development and budget, the draft plan for national
economic and social development and budget in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Also heard and examined will be a Draft Criminal Law and a
Draft National Defence Law, a motion on the establishment of the
centrally-administered Chongqing municipality, work reports of the
NPC Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme
Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
The deputies will perform their rights empowered by the
constitution and laws to air views on matters of national
importance as a way to help realize the goals set forth in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan and Long-Range Objectives Through the Year
2010, thus making new contributions to the cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics pioneered by Deng Xiaoping,
the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the first year for the Ninth Five-Year Plan and
Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2010, people of various
ethnic groups went all out to score new achievements in reform,
opening-up and modernization drive, ensuring a good beginning for
the trans-century target, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the country maintained rapid economic growth,
along with effective control of inflation, steady progress with
economic restructuring, furthering opening up to the outside
world, and fresh achievements in science and technology, education
and various social undertakings, the editorial cites.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Defense Minister: Israel Uninterested in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Defense Minister
Mustafa Tlass has said that Israel's persistence in building
Jewish settlements and changing the demographic features of the
occupied Arab territories in Jerusalem and the Golan heights
showed its lack of interest in realizing peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Today's Damascus press quoted Tlass, who is also Deputy
Commander-in-Chief of Syria's armed forces and Deputy Prime
Minister, as making the remarks during an inspection tour of
certain Syrian Army units Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tlass said that Israel's call for the resumption of
unconditional negotiations was a mere attempt to deny any previous
agreement and to take the peace process back to square one. This,
he said, is unacceptable to Syria or any other Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister reaffirmed that such practices would not
help Israel reap any benefits. They would rather prompt Syria and
the Arabs to adhere to their legitimate rights and further
entrench their commitment to a just and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Syria's adherence to the peace process in line
with the principles upon which the process was initiated. Syria,
he added, is keen on maintaining the peace process in accordance
with relevant U.N. resolutions and the land-for-peace formula.

"All these have proven that the Party's basic theories, the
basic line and policies, are completely correct, and the goals set
forth in the Ninth Five-Year Plan and Long-Range Objectives
conform with China's realities," says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that "the collective leadership of the
Party central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is a
strong one, which has won the support and trust of people of all
ethnic groups of the country."
</P>
<P>
The editorial defined the year of 1997 as very important in the
development of China, for the country will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, which is of far-reaching significance
to the reunification of the motherland and to the reinvigoration
of the national spirit, while the Party will hold its 15th
National Congress, an important meeting convened at an important
juncture of history when China is carrying forward the cause of
socialist reform, opening-up and modernization drive, and forging
ahead into the future.
</P>
<P>
The system of the people's congress represents China's
fundamental political system as well as the best form to realize
people's right as masters of the country, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The article quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying that the one house
system of the national people's congress China practices best
suits the country's realities. With a correct policy and
direction, the system has many advantages, for it benefits the
prosperity of the nation by avoiding unnecessary problems, Deng
said.
</P>
<P>
Practice over the past decades has proven Deng's theory to
be fully correct, as the system best suits China's actual
conditions, and facilitates the accomplishment of major
undertakings, by uniting people of all ethnic groups, bringing
into full play of the initiatives and creativity of all quarters,
and mobilizing all forces, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls on the nation to hold high the banner of
Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
and rally closely around the CPC Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core to achieve new victories in reform, opening up
and modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> US Existing Home Sales Increase in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned
homes in the U.S. increased by 2.1 percent in January following a
banner year in 1996, the U.S. National Association of Realtors
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that previously owned single-family homes sold
at a 3.94 million annual rate last month, up from a 3.86 million
rate in December,
</P>
<P>
Russell K. Booth, the Realtors' president, said that the
increase resulted from warm temperatures and low mortgage rates in
the month.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, existing home sales rose by 8.4 percent in the West
and 3.6 percent in the South. But the sales fell by 1 percent in
the Midwest and 4.8 percent in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
The national median price of an existing home in the U.S. was
120,500 dollars last month, up 5 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
For all of 1996, existing home sales in the U.S. totaled 4.08
million, the best in 18 years. The sharp increase of sales last
year was spurred by moderate economic growth and relatively low
mortgage rates.

<HEADLINE> Data Poverty Hampers Intra-African Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Increased intra-African trade
is being hampered by lack of adequate information about existing
commercial opportunities, an international trade expert said
today.
</P>
<P>
In a paper presented at a two-day meeting organised by the
COMESA bankers association in Harare, Carlo Cattani, senior
adviser on trade financing at the Geneva-based international
trade centre, said such lack of information was hampering efforts
to redirect trade flows from traditional partners in the west.
</P>
<P>
"It is usually easier to gather information on business
opportunities, market access conditions and rules and regulations
concerning industrialised countries than about your neighbouring
country," Cattani told the meeting, which is discussing
international trade finance.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which ends today, has been called to discuss ways
of facilitating intra-African trade through different financing
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Cattani said experience had shown that it was often difficult
for many african firms to trade with their partners from the
region than with major markets abroad because relevant trade
information was scarce.
</P>
<P>
"Such lack of information has the effect of reinforcing the
trade flows directed to traditional partners in the north, at the
disadvantage of profitable intra-African trade opportunities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said another major constraint was the lack of cheap
finance, as evidence showed that banks and other credit
institutions preferred to assist companies from the west rather
than African countries.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Economy Grows 1.5 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada's real gross domestic
product (GDP) grew 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996,
bringing the annual growth rate to a modest 1.5 percent,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter of 1996 was the second consecutive quarter
of relatively strong growth after six weak quarters. The real GDP
was 2.3 percent above the fourth quarter level of 1995.
</P>
<P>
"While growth was relatively weak throughout 1995 and the first
quarters of 1996, economic activity picked up significantly in the
second half of 1996," the federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
Its figures show that real GDP growth for the fourth quarters
of 1996 was 0.3, 0.4, 0.8 and 0.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
"The sources of strength were equally balanced between domestic
and foreign demand," the agency said. For the year, merchandise
exports increased 4.6 percent, while imports rose 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Canada saw notable increases in investment in
machinery and equipment (up 11.0 percent), construction (up 11.5
percent) and personal expenditure (up 2.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, government expenditure and non-residential
construction declined 1.8 percent and 3.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the year, Canada's personal income increased 2.0
percent, while personal income taxes grew by 7.1 percent. "As a
result, disposable income grew by only 1.0 percent," the agency
noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
In more than 100 days, he said, Hong Kong will return to the
embrace of the motherland, and six million Hong Kong compatriots
will exercise the democratic rights as masters of their own
destiny.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to the motherland signifies the end of over
one-century-old national humiliation for the Chinese people, and
another major step in the course of achieving national
reunification.
</P>
<P>
He added that Macao will also return to the embrace of the
motherland in 1999, which is a great event shining through the
history of the Chinese nation. All the Chinese people, including
Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, are encouraged and inspired.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council and
people across China, Jiang expressed his gratitude to the members
for the contributions they had made in promoting Hong Kong and
Macao's successful return to the motherland and smooth transition
of power, maintaining Hong Kong and Macao's prosperity and
stability, and helping to promote the motherland's reform and
opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The successful settlement of the historical problems of Hong
Kong and Macao by peaceful means is that "we have unswervingly
adhered to the important principles and policies defined personally by
Comrade Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems" is an integral
part of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and the unique, major contribution by Comrade
Deng Xiaoping to the accomplishment of the great cause of the
motherland's reunification.
</P>
<P>
It not only chartered the correct path and provide the basic
guarantee for the settlement of the Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
issues, but provided a fine example for the settlement of similar
problems internationally left over from history, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Although Comrade Xiaoping has left us, he pledged, the basic
line of "one focus, two basic points" and a series of major
principles and policies he set forth will be adhered to
unswervingly, and the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics be implemented steadfastly.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today held talks with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
focusing on the tension in Greek-Turkish relations and efforts to
restructure the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Simitis first held private talks with Solana, the meeting
subsequently being attended by Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos
and Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, Solana's proposals for defusing
the tension in Greek-Turkish relations were discussed at length.
</P>
<P>
Solana said that what was important was to work on the issue
before the NATO summit on July 8-9.
</P>
<P>
The same sources said during today's talks Solana underlined
that in view of the forthcoming NATO enlargement, the problems
which exist between alliance members must be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Solana appeared to insist on his proposal
concerning an extension of the moratorium on Greek and Turkish
military exercises in the Aegean during the summer months.
</P>
<P>
At the present time, the sources said, the Greek side does not
appear willing to discuss the issue, given Ankara's general stance
towards Athens.
</P>
<P>
For this reason Solana intends to return to Greece and Turkey
after the July NATO summit while insisting that a solution be
found by July.
</P>
<P>
Solana described his talks here as "extremely constructive"
since he had ascertained that Greece's positions were very
positive concerning the building of the new NATO, in a reference
to proposed new military structures, new missions, new members and
the alliance's new relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
In these sectors, Simitis underlined that important decisions
must be taken at the Madrid summit in July, and he added that
talks would continue.

HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Singaporean Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong said here this afternoon his government
and the nearly 40 businessmen accompanying him would, during
their three-day stay in Zaimbabwe, explore investment potential
in the country's various economic sectors.

</P>
<P>
"My purpose is to create awareness of opportunities available
in Zimbabwe and those will be the start of investment in Zimbabwe

</P>
<P>
He said his government was committed to assisting Zimbabwe
with airport management and monetary policies.

<HEADLINE> WHO Vows to Reduce Maternal Morbidity by 50 Pct by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Deaths of women in childbirth
or during unacceptable abortion methods continue at a rate of
close to 600,000 a year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said
here today.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held at the WHO headquarters in Geneva Monday and
Tuesday, the Fifth Global Commission for Women's Health (GCWH) set
out a comprehensive agenda on the issue of maternal morbidity. WHO
has set a target of reducing maternal morbidity by 50 percent by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable and shameful that women die in childbirth
today," said Hillary Rodham Clinton, First Lady of the United
States of America, in a special message to the GCWH.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Clinton pointed out that since the women's conference in
Beijing in 1995, there have been tangible accomplishments in
important areas of women's health. She cited the elimination of
the practice of female genital mutilation in Egypt and guarantees
of stay for mothers in U.S. hospitals as concrete examples of a
change in health care practices.
</P>
<P>
In its press release, WHO also listed important progress made
on other key issues: increased literacy and reducing anemia.
</P>
<P>
Noting that many of the health problems of women and young
girls can be solved by literacy and education, the delegates
endorsed WHO plans to hold a top level roundtable discussion with
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) on the subject of "Education for the
Promotion of Health in Women and Girls."
</P>
<P>
Anemia is one of the greatest threats to the health of women of
child-bearing age around the world. Studies indicate that iron
deficiency is prevalent on every continent. Who's objective is to
reduce this significant health problem by one third by the year
2000.

<HEADLINE> US Investors Pour More Money Into Mutual Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tremendous fund investing in January far surpassed the 24
billion U.S. dollars that the mutual-fund industry's trade group
had predicted and handily beat the record of 28.9 billion monthly
inflow set in January a year ago, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
But some analysts expressed their worries about duration of the
influx of funds. The Federal Reserve chairman has twice warned now
that the stock market may be rising too fast.
</P>
<P>
But there's no evidence the deluge will ease soon, the paper
said. Fund executives say February is turning out to be a massive
month, too, though it likely won't match the rate of inflow during
January. Large-company funds, growth-and-income funds and in
particular index funds are taking in lots of cash, as investors
pursue soaring big company stocks.
</P>
<P>
Not all the money is going into stock funds in the U.S., the
paper said. But the 23.4 billion U.S. dollars that poured into
U.S. stock funds in January was a record, according to the
Investment Company Institute. The second biggest month for U.S.
stock funds was last May, when such funds took in a bit more than
21 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A lot of the money in January was new money to the stock
market and helped sustain the continued rise in stock prices,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Not to Overproduce Oil After Lift of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rashid said here today that his country will not
overproduce oil after the U.N.-imposed sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held at the Oil Ministry, Rashid said
Iraq will not overproduce oil and will observe strictly the OPEC
quota.
</P>
<P>
"Our leadership is very responsible for the stability of the
oil market and its prices, because overproduction will do harm
to the oil market as well as the iraqi people," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq plans to raise its oil output to 6 million barrels per
day after the U.N.-imposed sanctions are totally lifted, which
almost doubles the amount of oil produced before the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Iraq will ask for compensation for its
losses during the period of sanctions, Rashid said although
certain OPEC members have been overproducing oil at the expenses
of Iraq, his country has no intention to ask for any
compensation.
</P>
<P>
On cooperation in the development of Iraqi oil fields, the
minister reiterated that Iraq will give priority to those friendly
countries such as France, Russia and China, which support the
Iraqi people and call for the lifting of sanctions imposed on
Iraq more than six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Iraqi officials and newspapers strongly criticized
U.S. for creating obstacles and deliberately delaying the
implementation of the oil-for-food deal, which allows Iraq to
sell 2 billion dollars worth of oil to buy food and medicine
badly needed in the country.

LUANDA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Angola will shortly sign
framework agreements with Romania, Yugoslav and Poland in order
to resume bilateral relations of cooperation with the three
east European countries.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Angolan vice-foreign minister
Sebastiao Isata to press circles at the airport upon his return
from his 7-day visits to these three countries. The agreements
will be signed within two to three months, he said, adding that
the main purpose of signing these agreements was to resume the
relations of cooperation with these countries which were severed
amidst the drastic changes in east Europe.
</P>
<P>
During his recent tour of these countries, he said, he had
had talks with leaders of these countries, and they all held
that is was necessary to resume their bilateral relations of
cooperation under the conditions of market economy.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, he said, he had also briefed leaders of
these countries on the peace process of Angola, and they all
hoped that peace will be realized in Angola as quickly as
possible so as to create more favourable conditions for the
development of cooperation.

<HEADLINE> 1997 Crucial for Cyprus: EU Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) External
Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek said here today that
1997 remains a crucial year for Cyprus and the EU has committed
to assisting efforts toward a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of his three-day
visit to the island, the EU official said he detected a
willingness to cooperate toward a political settlement on the
part of the Cyprus government.
</P>
<P>
"President Glafcos Clerides has underlined again on several
occasions that he has made efforts for negotiations," the
commissioner said, adding that Clerides also stated he is
prepared to "resume negotiations if there is good preparation
and some convergence of mind that makes it worthwhile to
negotiate."
</P>
<P>
The EU official said he conveyed this message to Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash and called on him "to lift the
isolation of his community."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also reaffirmed the EU commitment that
Cyprus' EU membership negotiations will start unconditionally by
the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"What we are adding to that now is what boost should be given
to those accession negotiations and how much smoother they could
develop and lead to a successful end in case the political
process here shows the necessary progress", he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of Turkish Cypriot participation in
the accession negotiations, the EU commissioner said the EU, as
a whole, would like to see that "circumstances and progress
toward a political settlement will permit an involvement of both
communities in accession talks."
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot participation, he noted, will depend on the
state of political settlement talks. "If the parties
here could agree to a formula, the EU would not stand in their
way," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, who arrived here Wednesday, had separate
meetings with President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
He said earlier that he came to Cyprus to convey two main
messages: the EU will honor its commitment to the accession
talks, which means that 1998 will be the year when negotiations
begin in earnest, and that 1997 is the year when direct
negotiations on the Cyprus problem under U.N. auspices should
receive the highest priority.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Mediterranean island applied for the full EU
membership in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Current Account Remains in Red in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada's current account
continued to be in the red in 1996, this time with a deficit of
1.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Buoyed by a record merchandise trade surplus, Canada's current
account deficit declined for a third consecutive year," Statistics
Canada reported today, saying that the deficit was by far the
lowest level since 1984.
</P>
<P>
It had been expected that Canada would reap a current account
surplus last year.
</P>
<P>
However, lower exports and higher imports in the fourth quarter
reduced Canada's goods surplus to its lowest level in a year and a
half, which rendered the surplus target out of reach.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Canada did quite a good job at exporting last year.
Its surplus on trade in goods climbed to a record high of 25.2
billion dollars, which was 4.5 billion dollars over that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the capital account front, the figures show that foreigners
continued to invest in Canadian bonds and stocks. But these
inflows were largely offset by record investment by Canadians in
foreign stocks.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Canada's deficit on services stood at 6.9 billion
dollars. The deficit on commercial services increased slightly,
and the travel deficit showed a small increase after steadily
narrowing since 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan official today
called on the World Bank to provide water harnessing
technologies to combat periodical drought in the country.
</P>
<P>
Wamatu Njoroge, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of
Research, technical training and technology, was speaking when
World Bank Technical Manager for African region Sushma Ganguly
today paid a courtesy call on him.
</P>
<P>
Both officials agreed that the problem of drought and the
resultant food shortage facing Kenya can be eliminated through
the provision of water harnessing technologies and simple
micro-irrigation systems at farm level.
</P>
<P>
Njoroge noted that although Kenya periodically experienced
severe drought, a lot of rain water was lost and some times
resulted in devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
He called on the World Bank to assist Kenyan farmers in
providing water harnessing technologies to enable them to produce
enough food for domestic consumption and export.
</P>
<P>
In response, Ganguly agreed to actively pursue the request of
fund with the bank's headquarters for the provision of suitable
technologies.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also discussed the implementation of the
National Agricultural Research Project phase two which the World
Bank has provided about 50 million U.S. Dollars credit to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The project will foster food security, poverty reduction and
environment protection by raising agricultural productivity and
farmers' income through improved technologies.
</P>
<P>
During the phase two, a pilot scheme will develop a
sustainable national seed system that can ensure timely
availability of quality seeds to farmers.

<HEADLINE> Job-Guarantee Deal Sealed at Mercedes-Benz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Amid waves of job cuts in a
sluggish German economy, the management and labor organization of
the German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz reached a deal today to
guarantee the 134,000 company workers' jobs in Germany through the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, which both sides hailed as an effort to cut
costs and assure the company's competitiveness, employees signaled
a readiness to accept restrictions on their future wage increases
as a tradeoff for the job guarantee.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would help to achieve cost savings of 250 million
Deutsche marks (148 million U.S. dollars) in the truck
manufacturing division which currently is operating in the red,
company sources said.
</P>
<P>
The deal could be received as good news for the German economy,
which is plagued by a record high unemployment of nearly 4.7
million in January, the highest since 1933.
</P>
<P>
"The workers council and company management have done more for
Germany as a production site than the federal government, which is
idly watching how unemployment is rising from year to year," Karl
Feuerstein, head of Mercedes' labor organization in Germany, was
quoted by the German news agency DPA as saying.

ADDIS ABABA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's National
Meteorological Services Agency today advised local farmers to
cultivate drought-resistant crops during the small rainy season
amid scarce rainfall and varied distribution.
</P>
<P>
Based on the weather forecast for this year's small rainy
season which began in mid-February, the agency said farmers must
carefully apply fertilizers and use plain land that can hold
water for cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Since no rains came this month, farmers should also prepare
animal fodder and farmland for cultivation during the season, it
urged.
</P>
<P>
According to the weather forecast, rainfall distribution in
the coming month or March varies from 50-100 millimeters to 20-30
millimeters.
</P>
<P>
During Ethiopia's small rainy season, which lasts from around
mid-February to May, farmers, mainly cultivating maize and

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A formal hand-over and
completion ceremony of the Uganda National Stadium, built with
Chinese assistance, was held today at Nambole, eight km from
capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, visiting Chinese assistant minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation, Yang Wensheng, and
Ugandan minister of education and sports Amanya Mushega signed
the hand-over and completion certificates for the stadium on
behalf of their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
Then the Chinese technical team leader of the stadium project
handed over Mushega a ceremonial key to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the occasion, Mushega expressed his deep gratitude
to the Chinese government for helping the people of Ugandan in
building such a "modern sports complex of magnificence".
</P>
<P>
Yang Wensheng said the completion of the stadium is a new
achievement of Sino-Uganda friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the completion of the stadium will greatly
contribute to the development of sports activities, improvement
of people's health and enrichment of people's cultural life.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his gratitude toward the concerned
departments of the Ugandan government for providing great support
to Chinese technicians during the construction of the stadium.
</P>
<P>

between the two countries in 1987. It includes a stadium with
40,000 seats for spectators and 200 seats for VIPs, a hotel for
120 athletes and another five practising grounds around the
stadium for sportsmen to practise football, basket ball, volley
ball, tennis and track and field sports.

<HEADLINE> Ontario to Lead Canadian Economic Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The provinces of Ontario and
Albert will lead the Canadian economic growth this year, a private
think tank said today.
</P>
<P>
Ontario will lead growth with overall gross domestic product
(GDP) reaching 3.8 percent this year and 3.0 percent in 1998, the
Conference Board of Canada said in its Provincial Outlook.
</P>
<P>
The board is predicting that Canada's economy will grow 2.9
percent nationally in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Low interest rates are paying off, especially in the housing
sector; and the fundamental ingredients for a strong pick-up in
consumer spending are now in place" in Ontario, the board said.
</P>
<P>
The only drag to overall growth in the province will come from
the deep public spending cuts, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Albert's economy will be close second to Ontario in terms of
GDP growth with 3.6 percent growth in 1997 and 2.9 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The Quebec economy will lag the national average, with sluggish
growth of 0.7 percent, while the conclusion of major megaprojects
in Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island will weaken their
economies this year.
</P>
<P>
The projected growth rates for the other provinces are British
Columbia, 2.5 percent; Manitoba, 2.6 percent; Saskatchewan, 2.1
percent; New Brunswick, two percent; and Nova Scotia, 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the jobless rate is expected to remain high over
the next two years, as many discouraged workers will re-enter the
labor force, lured by improving job markets, the board said.
</P>
<P>
"Improving government fiscal and external trade balances should
lift the dollar to 0.765 U.S. dollar by the end of 1998," it
added.

<HEADLINE> US Govt Under Attack for Stalling Land Mine Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Humanitarian groups and
non-governmental organizations from the United States today
slammed the U.S. administration for stalling a proposed
international ban on the production and sales of land mines.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing International Conference on Mines, the American
group, comprised of 25 experts and NGO members, urged Washington
to join over 50 other countries, including some NATO members and
most African states, in supporting such a ban.
</P>
<P>
However, a U.S. diplomat claimed it should be a "gradual
process" to reduce the production and sales of the mines, adding
that instead of imposing a ban now, the issue should be discussed
within the framework of the U.N. disarmament conference.
</P>
<P>
Michael Mckinley, counselor of the American Embassy in
Mozambique, argued that the Clinton Administration has been
supporting the mine removal campaign by providing 140 million
U.S. Dollars to 15 countries during the last five years.
</P>
<P>
The argument was immediately refuted by delegates who in turn
called for more support from the U.S. government which they
pointed out has been making much huger profits in producing and
selling land mines.
</P>
<P>
"This is really apathetic on the part of the U.S. government
to human sufferings caused by land mines, especially in Africa
and Asia," said an American delegate at the conference.
</P>
<P>
"I regret to see that a big land mine-producer such as the
United States, could not contribute more financial support to
those land mine victims in Africa who are penniless, denied
necessary medical treatment and see no hope of health recovery,"
said Jerry White, director of the Network of Land mine Survivors.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth International Conference on Land mines, attended by
400 delegates from 60 countries and originally scheduled to last
for three days, entered into the fourth day today.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Deaths Drop Substantially for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- For the first time since the
AIDS epidemic began in 1981, the number of deaths from the fatal
disease has dropped substantially across the United States, the
New York Times reported today, quoting Federal health officials.
</P>
<P>
The overall decline was about 12 percent--to 22,000 in the
first six months of 1996 from 24,900 in the same period of 1995--
in all regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
The national decline was less than 30 percent drop reported in
New York City where health officials announced last month that
their figures for all of 1996 showed the first documented drop in
AIDS deaths anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted in its
weekly report that Deaths from AIDS for women rose 3 percent in
the national data while AIDS deaths of women in New York City
dropped 24.5 percent. But the reasons are unknown.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials attributed the overall drop in deaths in part
to the benefits of combinations of anti-H.I.V. drugs used over
recent years, as well as to better access to care and increased
financing for AIDS treatment.

<HEADLINE> France, Annan Call for Multinational Force in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- France and the United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan today relaunched a call for the
deployment of a multinational force in eastern Zaire, after a
genocide against Hutu refugees reportedly took place there.
</P>
<P>
After holding talks today with French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette, Annan said that he would ask the member states of the
United Nations to study the deployment of a multinational force in
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian situation (in eastern Zaire) is very grave. I
hope that it will be possible for me to convince the member states
of the United Nations to come to help the refugees and displaced
population in eastern Zaire. There is a great emergency," said
Annan.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that it appears that there is a big tragedy
going on in that region, and he said that it is "indispensable to
stop the hostilities."
</P>
<P>
He again called for the launching of an investigation into the
reported genocide against Hutu refugees in the rebel-controlled
area of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
French television have shown films shot by amateurs portraying
pictures of massacred refugees, including women and children, in
the eastern part of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Some children were seen mutilated and laid dead in refugee
camps overrun by unspecified armed groups.
</P>
<P>
A witness's report published in Belgium this week said that
500,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees are missing and some mass graves
were found near the refugee camps of Mugunga and Katale.
</P>
<P>
The report was "categorically" denied by Filippo Grandi, a
representative of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
in Goma, eastern Zaire, although he said that killings did take
place against refugees.
</P>
<P>
France proposed the deployment of a multinational forces in
Zaire after fighting broke out in eastern Zaire between the
Tutsi-led rebels and Zairean government forces in October last
year.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was reluctantly accepted by the United States in
early November and was voted into a resolution by the United
Nations Security Council on November 15.
</P>
<P>
But it was scrapped by the United States and some other Western
countries after some 600,000 Rwandan refugees suddenly returned
home from Zaire in December.

<HEADLINE> Makinen Leads in First Day of Safari Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Reigning world champion Tommi
Makinen overcame punishing conditions on Saturday to take the lead
in Kenya's Safari Rally, round three of the World Rally
Championships.
</P>
<P>
World championship leader Carlos Sainz was forced out midway
through the second stage when he swerved to avoid an animal. He
had been in third place at the end of the first stage.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard's Ford car plunged off the road and suffered a
puncture. Although he managed to repair it, dust damaged the
wheel nuts, forcing him to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Makinen, who won the event last season, fought back from a
first stage crash that caused a puncture and left him down in
fourth place in his Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
German Armin Schwarz was only 33 seconds behind after more than
220 kilometers of competitive stages through some of the most
difficult terrain faced on the world rally calendar.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions are unbelievable. This year the rally is very,
very dry, but it still makes the conditions incredibly tough and
unpredictable," said Swede Kenneth Eriksson, who was the first
high-profile retirement from the event.
</P>
<P>
The winner of this year's Swedish Rally dropped out at the end
of the first stage after leaving the service area too late
following accident damage repairs.
</P>
<P>
Despite being 50 kilometers from the end of the stage, Eriksson
was able to continue on the run with three wheels on his Subaru,
even reaching speeds of up to 120 kph, but the repairs took too
long at the end of the stage.
</P>
<P>
His Subaru team mate Briton Colin McRae, in fourth place at the
end of the second stage, also encountered difficulties in that
first leg. He suffered two punctures and, with only one spare,
was forced to complete that opening stage with a flat tyre.
</P>
<P>
With two stages left on Saturday, the most obvious threat
remains home favourite Kenyan Ian Duncan, who lies in fifth place
at the end of the second stage and could repeat his victory from
the 1994 rally.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Senior Party leader Hu Jintao
today stressed the importance of promoting economic growth and
firmly safeguarding China's social stability, national unity and
ethnic solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau,
and a member of the Secretariat, of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, today took part in a group discussion
attended by deputies from the Tibet Autonomous Region to the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which is having its fifth
session in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Calling 1997 "a special year in the Chinese history," he said
it is of critical importance to do a successful job in various
fields this year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that economic development, center of all work of the
Party and the nation, is also a fundamental task for a new
socialist Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"We should always focus on economic development," he said,
adding that, proceeding from its specific conditions, Tibet should
further strengthen the fundamental role of agriculture and animal
husbandry and actively develop pillar industries with local
characteristics and advantages.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that the autonomous region should make
greater efforts to strengthen infrastructural construction,
promote the two fundamental shifts in a down-to-earth manner, and
speed up the pace of opening up.

He told the deputies that it is necessary to pay close
attention to, and effectively maintain, social stability in Tibet,
which is of great significance not only to the autonomous region
itself, but also to the overall situation of state security and
modernization process of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
"We must take a clear-cut stance to resolutely and firmly
oppose separatism, safeguard unity of the motherland, and work for
solidarity among various ethnic groups," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to correctly understand and handle
contradictions among the people, and eliminate in time any factors
that could lead to instability, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We shall give full play to the Party organizations' leading
role, and do a solid job in cultivating a contingent of
highly-competent cadres, with an emphasis on the building of
grassroots Party organizations in rural and pastoral areas," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We must closely rely on the people of various ethnic groups,
bring into full play the initiatives of cadres from all ethnic
groups and people from all walks of life, and work with one heart
and one mind, so as to accelerate economic development, achieve
long-term stability and common prosperity for all ethnic groups,
and build a new socialist Tibet that is united, prosperous, and
civilized," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Tibetan people to carry work forward at the
behest of Deng Xiaoping, who enjoyed love and immense respect in
the whole Party and the whole army, and among people of all ethnic
groups across the country, continue to push ahead with the great
cause of socialist reforms, opening up, and modernization drive
Deng initiated, and do a good job of everything in Tibet.

"Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with

correct, so are all major decisions and arrangements made by the
Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core for promoting
the great cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, including a series of instructions and principles
on work for Tibet," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Chinese people should unswervingly
adhere to the fundamental theories, basic line and principles of
the Party, work hard to promote economic development, and firmly
safeguard social stability, to welcome Hong Kong's return and the
15th Party national congress with deeds.
</P>

Before Hu spoke, deputies discussed the government work report
delivered by Premier Li Peng at this morning's opening ceremony of
the current NPC session, and praised it for making a comprehensive
and objective summary of last year's work and reflecting the
spirit of seeking truth from facts.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers attending the
fifth session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) here
expressed views on a wide range of subjects before the session
began this morning.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ye Gongqi, who is also chairman of the standing
committee of Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, expressed
appreciation for China's economic performance in the past year.
</P>
<P>
He said, "For the first time the Chinese economy enjoyed a high
growth rate and low inflation, laying an extremely good foundation
for its future development; the margin of income increase for
peasants was greater than that for urban residents; and the
country's foreign exchange reserves increased. These indicate that
the central government has made an step forward in its ability to
regulate the national economy on a macro scale. I'm full of
confidence about the future."
</P>
<P>
Ye's view was shared by other deputies to the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Many of them talked about two major events that are to take
place in China this year -- the return of Hong Kong to China in
July and convocation of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Peter M.K. Wong, vice chairman of the Chinese General
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, expressed high appreciation for
the principles of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" and "a high degree of autonomy" for Hong Kong
put forth by the late leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"Though Mr. Deng Xiaoping has passed away, I believe the
principles he laid down for Hong Kong will endure. Only when the
motherland is strong and prosperous can Hong Kong's sustained
prosperity and stability be really guaranteed. Hong Kong will
have even broader space for development," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Advisory Body Contributes to Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's top advisory body, the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), has taken an active part in the country's
endeavor to eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
Latest official statistics available show that the population
of the needy in China had dropped to 58 million by the end of 1996
from 250 million in 1978.
</P>
<P>
"The CPPCC National Committee has made a positive contribution
to this historic achievement," said Yang Rudai, vice-chairman of
the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC, which is in session here in the Chinese capital, has
attached overriding importance to providing the people in need
with the daily necessities and and helping them to become
better-off, said Yang, who is also president of the China Poverty
Relief Foundation.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, ten of the CPPCC's 25 survey reports were related with
economic and social development in the poor areas, he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The proposal of the CPPCC National Committee on accelerating
development of grassland-based animal husbandry was raised
precisely to help herdsmen in grassland areas across China to get
rid of poverty and become better-off, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the CPPCC National Committee last year
submitted 1,069 proposals concerning economic matters and most of
them were related to central and west China, where herdsmen of
national minorities are relatively concentrated.
</P>
<P>
"Our proposals and opinions have drawn the attention from the
central and local governments and concerned departments," Yang
said, adding that some of these proposals have been accepted by
some policy-making bodies.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the CPPCC National Committee will go on
submitting motions or bills or suggest ways or means, so as to
contribute to the Chinese government's poverty-relief effort.
China plans to enable another 10 million relatively poor farmers
to have enough to eat and wear this year. "Although China's task
to eliminate poverty is still arduous, I believe the goal will
certainly be achieved by the end of this century," Yang said.

borders and higher living standards for the people. And the
Tibetan people are full of confidence about China's future."
</P>
<P>
Li Youwei, secretary of the CPC Shenzhen Municipal Committee,
has been one of the most sought-after figures whenever the NPC
is in session.
</P>
<P>
Again surrounded by reporters, Li said that Shenzhen has made
remarkable progress in building a socialist market economy in
accordance with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and will continue to pursue reform and
opening policies under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
For Economist Zhang Zhongli, it is the 15th NPC session he has
attended. The three-time NPC deputy from the Shanghai Academy of
Social Sciences said he especially felt "the significance of his
responsibility" since this will perhaps be the last NPC session he
will attend.
</P>
<P>
"I have witnessed the NPC playing an increasingly important
role in China's political, economic and social life over the past
15 years," the 76-year-old deputy said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that the current session and the Ninth
NPC to be elected next year will increase the pace of legislation
and strengthen supervision over law enforcement, to make China a
more prosperous, democratic and civilized nation.
</P>
<P>
In the past 15 years, Zhang has submitted more than 30 bills or
proposals, of which more than one third were enacted as law.
He has again submitted four to the current session,
which concern financial reform, social relief, business operation
system, and international leasing business.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China (CPC)
and the Chinese people will unswervingly hold to the course
initiated by Deng Xiaoping, said Li Tieying, member of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, here today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Miroslav Grebenicek, chairman of the
Communist Party of the Czech and Moravia, Li said the CPC and the
Chinese people will continue to rally closely around the CPC
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
Expressing condolences over Deng's death, Grebenicek described
the late Chinese leader not only as a great man of his country,
but a great statesman renowned the world over.
</P>
<P>
Deng passed away on February 19 at the age of 93.
</P>
<P>
Deng was the architect of China's reform and opening-up policy,
Grebenicek noted, and the Czech delegation has seen the miracles
resulting from the country's efforts to build socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a state councillor, thanked Grebenicek for the
condolences. He said Deng was a great Marxist and a "remarkable"
leader of China.
</P>
<P>
To boil Deng's multi-facet contributions down to one sentence,
according to Li, socialist China's present prosperity would be
impossible without Deng Xiaoping, just as there would be no New
China without Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
Li said Deng's series of economic concepts are a new
contribution to Marxist political economy, an important part of
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and
a significant guideline for the reform and opening-up and the
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Grebenicek arrived here February 23 at the invitation of the
CPC.

(APU) today lashed out the Israeli decision to build new Jewish
neighborhood in the occupied Arab city of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The move comes in the context of Israel's persistence in
judaizing the holy city and stamping out its Arab and Islamic
identity," a statement issued by the Damascus-based APU said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Ministerial Committee on Jerusalem Affairs
approved Wednesday the construction of new Jewish settlements of
6,500 homes in Har Homa of east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the Arab governments to adopt a unified
position against the Israeli settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
It also requested all the parliamentarians worldwide to call on
their governments to condemn the Israeli move and bring pressure
on Israel to stop its settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
The APU document pointed out that all the recent Israeli
measures have constitute a flagrant breach of the UN resolutions
on the occupied territories and showed the Israeli aggressive
expansionist tendency.
</P>
<P>
The measures have made light of all the international
resolutions and conventions and the will of the international
community and constitute a grave threat to the Middle East peace
process, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli act may bring the region back to "furnace of
violence and tension" which are likely to explode at any time, it
warned.
</P>
<P>
The APU asked the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution
immediately barring the Israeli persistence in its expansionist
policy and changing the identity of the holy city.

<HEADLINE> Scientist: Studying Bacteria By Genes Rather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- "Today, microscopy is outdated
as a major technique to study organism," reported The Jerusalem
Post today quoted a famous scientist as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Holloway, a senior researcher of Monash University of
Australia, made the statement at the recent annual meeting of
the Israel Society for Microbiology, which was held at
Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan.
</P>
<P>
Holloway, who has been studying disease-producing Pseudomonas
bacteria for decades, said that he used to look at the
bacteria through a microscope. But nowadays, he said, he "looks
at their DNA and studies how they grow and their other
biological functions."
</P>
<P>
He said microbiology is speeding the understanding of diseases
and their causes on the genetic level. "Previous technologies
going back to the '50s didn't allow us to look at the
whole genome."
</P>
<P>
Among the techniques for studying the structure of genes is
polymerase chain reaction, a way of magnifying base pairs to
make them recognizable, which has been standard procedure for
nearly a decade; another technique is pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis, in which the genome is split up. "You take the
whole gene and split it into pieces, some of them large and
some small. Then you put them together again, like Humpty
Dumpty or a jigsaw puzzle, and learn much in the process
about the genetic makeup," Holloway said.
</P>
<P>
Pseudomonas bacteria, which cannot be easily controlled by
antibiotics, are frequently found in wounds, burns and
urinary-tract infections. When a cystic fibrosis patient dies, it
isn't due to the genetic lung disease itself, but due to the
spread Pseudomonas in the body and overcoming the immune system,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Cancer patients whose immune system is weakened can also
succumb to Pseudomonas infections, thus the study of how they
function and replicate is very important, he said. "They have
broad metabolic abilities. I've used them throughout my career.
Their applications are not only in medicine -- including the
development of vaccines and diagnostic tests, and the
understanding of bacterial resistance to drugs -- but also in
biotechnology and agriculture; the genetic techniques we've worked
on are also applicable for other types of bacteria as well."

<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Islamic Solidarity
Committee today strongly condemned Israel's decision to set up new
Jewish residential areas in East Jerusalem and urged the UN
Security Council to take strict measures against it.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic group said the decision may thwart comprehensive
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council must exercise pressure on Israel, which
has not even once complied with all the decisions or resolutions
of this world body," Chairman of the Committee Lukman Karun said
here today.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel not only had disobeyed UN resolutions but had
also unilaterally violated all its commitments to the jointly
agreed peace deals.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of new Jewish residential areas is a
provocative act and is very much in conflict with the substance of
the peace deal and UN resolutions, which require that Israel leave
East Jerusalem, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, despite strong international censure, the
Israeli government approved the building of 6,500 homes for Jews
and more than 3,000 houses for Arabs in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, South Africa to Strengthen Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and South Africa
today agreed to strengthen their economic and trade ties by giving
each other most favored nation status and establishing a joint
trade committee.
</P>
<P>
A wide-ranging trade agreement to this effect was signed after
a meeting between Philippine President Fidel Ramos and his
visiting South African counterpart Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement which is the first between the two
countries, both sides agreed to give each other
most-favored-nation treatment in accordance with the principle
contained in the World Trade Organization Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to grant most-favored-nation
treatment to merchant cargo vessels, cargo planes and their crew.
</P>
<P>
A joint trade committee will be established to discuss measures
for the expansion of direct trade between the two countries and
oversee the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
This agreement, which will come into force soon after gaining
approval from the two countries' parliaments, will be valid for
three years and, thereafter, automatically be extended for another
three years if neither party wants to terminate it.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting, both Ramos and Mandela pledged to
further boost trade and economic cooperation, which have developed
significantly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Trade between South Africa and the Philippines reached close to
100 million U.S. dollars in 1996, increasing greatly over the 1991
level of only 4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also asked for Philippine assistance in developing
South Africa's electronics industry and promised to send mining
experts to the Philippines to help it develop its mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived here this morning on a three-day visit,
today also met with Speaker of the Philippine House of
Representatives Jose de Venecia and Senate President Ernesto
Maceda.
</P>
<P>
After his visit to the Philippines, the first by a South
African head of state, Mandela will leave for Brunei to continue
his five-nation Southeast Asia tour which will also take him to
Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, business leaders from the two countries will hold a
seminar to seek ways of boosting bilateral trade and economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Direct Shipping Across Taiwan Strait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators express full
confidence in the establishment of direct shipping links across
the Taiwan Strait with efforts from both sides of the Strait.
</P>
<P>
The legislators, or deputies to the National People's Congress
(NPC) from east China's Fujian province and those of Taiwan
origin, are here attending the ongoing session of the Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Since the central government issued management regulations on
shipping services and on agency arrangement for cargo transport
between the island and the mainland, some Fujian deputies say,
preparations for direct regular cargo container shipping services
between Fuzhou and Xiamen ports in the province, and Kaohsiung
port in Taiwan have entered a stage where attention is being paid
to specific matters.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiuji, chairman of the standing committee of the Xiamen
Municipal People's Congress, said that, with Hong Kong's return to
the motherland a short time away, direct shipping across the
Strait is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Cargo shipping between Fujian and Taiwan has been conducted
through transshipment in countries like Japan and the Republic of
Korea since the 1970s. With the rapid development of cross-strait
economic and trade ties, the amount of cargo transport between the
mainland and the island reaches tens of millions of tons each
year.
</P>
<P>
It takes eight hours for a cargo ship to sail the
160-nautical-mile-wide strait from Xiamen to Kaohsiung, a sea
link that has been cut off for half a century.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that direct shipping will slash 30 percent of
the current cost and a large amount of time.
</P>
<P>
Direct shipping will not only benefit cross-strait economic
exchanges, but promote national reunification, said Fan
Zengsheng, a deputy of Taiwan origin and vice director of the
Shanghai Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
"If this major step (direct shipping) is taken, cross-strait
ties will be closer," Fan said, adding that direct mail, trade and
shipping links across the Strait will bridge feelings first, and
then facilitate national reunification.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Fujian province has made a lot of
preparations for direct shipping. Fuzhou and Xiamen ports, as
pilot ports designated by the Ministry of Communications for
direct shipping, have been adequately equipped for direct shipping
in terms of port conditions, ships, navigation and communication
facilities, and maritime affairs management.
</P>
<P>
The deputies urged the Taiwan authorities to give up the policy
of impeding national reunification by setting obstacles to the
establishment of direct shipping links, to comply with popular
will, and to take a cooperative attitude in solving technical
problems involved.
</P>
<P>
"We Chinese are very smart people. So long as both sides show
sincerity, all so-called technical problems can be solved," said
Fan Zengsheng.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Taiwan's shipping industry has also shown
enthusiasm for direct shipping, and several shipping companies
there have applied for consent from relevant government
departments on the mainland to run direct shipping services.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Many of the Hong Kong-based
newspapers continued their reports on the on-going session of the
8th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) with a focus on Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's speech on Hong Kong affairs.
</P>
<P>
In the form of commentaries, interviews with dignitaries and
special columns, the newspapers noted that Jiang Zemin's
attendance at the group meeting of the CPPCC members from Hong
Kong and Macao Friday showed emphasis from the central government
on Hong Kong's transition.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao pointed out in a commentary that Jiang's speech
fully displayed the Chinese central government's resolution in the
implementation of the concept of "One Country, Two Systems" and
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
It said that Jiang Zemin's speech has greatly encouraged the
Hong Kong people and it will promote Hong Kong's smooth transition
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
It said that with the support of the Chinese central government
and efforts of the Hong Kong people, the preparations for the
formation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
are making progress.
</P>
<P>
With the framework of the HKSAR government being produced, the
Hong Kong people are increasingly becoming confident of Hong
Kong's future, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Hong Kong people will unite to contribute to
the formation of the HKSAR and to a smooth transfer of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Expels Turkish Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran today asked Turkey to call
back its ambassador to Tehran in a retaliation for action taken
by the Turkish government against the Iranian ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry also declared in its statement
that Ufuk Ozsancak, Turkish Consul General in Iran's northwestern
city of Orumieh, as persona non-grata for having engaged in
undiplomatic acts within a period of one week.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Iran's official Persian daily Iran disclosed
that Turkish Ambassador to Tehran Osman Koruturk and the consul
general to Orumieh may be expelled from Iran.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the move is in retaliation for the attitude
of Ankara towards Iranian ambassador in Turkey Mohammad Reza
Baqeri.
</P>
<P>
Some sources said that the Iranian ambassador was asked to
leave Ankara because of his strong statement about Islam and
fundamentalism, which aroused anger from the Turkish authorities
and mass media.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Iranian consul general in Turkey was expelled Thursday
and its ambassador also returned to Tehran from Ankara reportedly at the
request of Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Last April Turkey and Iran had expelled four diplomats from
each side on charge of espionage activities.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Iranian Foreign Ministry said in the statement
that the Iranian government would like to consolidate the
bilateral relations with Turkey on the basis of internationally
recognized principles.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng listed 10
model workers emerging in recent years, in his government work
report at the opening ceremony of the Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Following is a brief introduction to one of them, Ma Enhua, a
model entrepreneur from north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
In July 1984, Ma, who had spent most of his life in the textile
industry, was appointed manager of the Baoding Cotton Mill, a
state-owned enterprise on the verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
He tried every means to foster the workers' affection and
enthusiasm for the factory, and gave full play to the workers'
collective wisdom through the introduction of democratic
management.
</P>
<P>
The factory was later turned into the Baoding No.1 Cotton
Textile Group Company, a leading cotton textile enterprise across
the country, of which Ma was director of the board, general
manager, and secretary of the Party committee.
</P>
<P>
Ma, a representative of outstanding managers of large and
medium-sized state enterprises, was reputed as "the socialist
entrepreneur."
</P>
<P>
He was bestowed with the title of "National Model Worker" in
1995, and died of stomach cancer in November of the same year. He

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Kong Fansen is one of the 10 model
workers commended by Premier Li Peng in his report on the work of
the government delivered at the opening meeting of the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Kong, of Han nationality and a household name in China, is
known for his life's dedication to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He was brn in 1944 of a poor farmer's family in east China's
Shandong Province. He joined the army and, after demobilization,
worked in his hometown before being twice assigned to work in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
He died on duty in 1994 when he served as secretary of Ngari
Prefecture's Communist Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
He worked tirelessly for Tibetans and won their affection and
respect. Local Tibetans saw him off with tears in their eyes when
he left Tibet after serving his first three-year term.
</P>
<P>
In spite of many difficulties at home -- his mother was too old
and weak to be self-reliant, and his wife suffered from diseases,
a situation requiring him to look after his three children at home
-- he chose to work in Tibet again in 1988, because he was needed
there.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his leadership, Ngari Prefecture produced 180 million
yuan in gross domestic product in 1994, an increase of 37.5
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Kong died in a car accident on his way to inspect border trade.
Things left by him included 8.6 yuan, his entire monetary
possession, and a letter he wrote four days before his death with
a 12-point proposal on developing the local economy in Ngari area.

</P>
<P>
Li, a regimental commander serving under the Beijing Military Area

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Local residents, who have had access to drinking water and shed
poverty thanks to Li and his soliders, call Li a "source of
water." In times of peace, the Chinese People's Liberation Army
has the responsibility to help local people develop their economy.
</P>
<P>
Li, 50, has led a water-supply regiment in looking for and
finding water in many desert areas where experts had asserted no
water existed.
</P>
<P>
Tianshuijing, or "Sweet Well," is a new place name added to the
map of China. It is named after a well dug by Li and his men.
</P>
<P>
But Li's health deteriorated in the midst of his strenuous work
and he finally had to recuperate in hospital.
</P>
<P>
He was received by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in 1993, who
highly praised him for carrying forward the fine qualities of the
Chinese Communist Party.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Hold Tete-a-tete Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today held talks with Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat to coordinate steps on the Mideast peace
developments before their upcoming visits to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here before noon on a brief visit to Egypt,
where he will also address an opening session of the Arab League
emergency meeting on the repercussion of the Israeli new housing
plan in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial committee of Israel endorsed an agreement
Wednesday on establishing 6,500 housing units for the Jewish
settlers in Gabal Abu Ghoneim region, known in Israel as Har Homa,
a tree-covered hill taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The PNA says the envisaged housing project flagrantly violates
relevant U.N. resolutions and the Oslo agreements, signed between
the Palestinians and the Israelis, and stumbles the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has attacked the envisaged project as a serious breach
of all agreements and regarded it an attempt to cement Israel's
hold over East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want to have as
the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Advisor to the Palestinian leader Nabil Abu-Rudaina said today
Arafat was keen on consulting Mubarak before heading to Washington
this week to discuss the latest developments in the region and
moves in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Voice of Arab radio, Abu-Rudaina said
Arafat will discuss during his Washington trip on March 3 the
future of the Mideast peace process in the light of Israel's
decision to build up new Jewish settlements in addition to
Palestinian-U.S. relations, Abu-Rudaina said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side will ask the U.S. administration to put
into effect all agreements signed by the parties concerned with
the peace drive, sponsored by Washington, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's Washington trip precedes Mubarak's set for March
10. Jordan's King Hussein is next in line and will be in the
U.S. capital one week after Mubarak. The series of visits followed
the meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Netanyahu in
February.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Clinton meeting is expected to focus on reviving
the stalled talks between Israel and Syria and the opening next
month of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to determine the final
status of the Occupied Territories.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mubarak will meet with Netanyahu on the future of
Mideast peace which is in danger of the deteriorating situations
and increasing complications.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first country to make peace with the Jewish state,
in 1979, is a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause and a key
negotiator in the peace talks.

PYONGYANG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States must cease the
broadcasting of "Radio Free Asia" and stop its "ideological and
cultural infiltration into the Asian countries", official news
agency of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said
today.
</P>
<P>
In an article in response to recent reports that "Radio Free
Asia" had formally started broadcasting in Asian languages, the
Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the radio is
aimed at spreading the policy of strength and to "paralyze the
national consciousness of the people of the Asian countries for
independence, to obliterate their national culture and realize the
U.S, domination of them."

<HEADLINE> Sainz, Eriksson Retire in Safari Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Carlos Sainz and Swedish
Kenneth Eriksson, both among the top world drivers, retired today
in a sensational start to the 555 Safari Rally Kenya, the third
round of 1997 World Rally Championships due to mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
Sainz, a double world champion and leader of today's
competition, was out of on the first leg of the three-day rally as
he swerved to miss an animal and had his car's wheel punctured.
</P>
<P>
A wheel of Sainz's reddish orange Ford car was changed and
tightened within two minutes, but dust trapped between the rim and
the hub allowed nuts to work loose and wheel studs were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Ford Team has confirmed Sainz's quit and crew were lifted out
of section by a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Sainz's incident took place 40 kilometers into section when he
got going 300 meters ahead of Eriksson, the winner of the latest
round in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Eriksson hit a large rock at 130 kph, ripping
out his right rear wheel assembly. He motored on three wheels to
drop only 16 minutes on the fastest car.
</P>
<P>
However, the consequent damage to Eriksson's Subaru car was too
extensive to repair in the very restricted service time allowed
and thus forced Eriksson out of the rally.
</P>
<P>
"The mechanics performed miracles," said Eriksson's navigator
Staffan Parmander, "But we were just outside the time limit -- a
matter of a few seconds."
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi's Tommi Makinen also punctured and ripped out a
brake line, then crashed into a bank. But he still just managed
to hold off the Ford Escort Cosworth of Armin Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
Colin McRae, who carried only one spare wheel into the section,
punctured twice and had to battle on with one flat tyre. So local
driver Ian Duncan's Toyota Celica, which had started six minutes
behind him, was right on his tail at the end of the section.
</P>
<P>
Duncan had also gambled with only one spare -- "the section was
so rough, we tried to save weight," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, at the next service park he took a second spare wheel
on board.
</P>
<P>
Today's route, the same with the third leg on Monday, covers
584 kilometers and 406.10 of them are competitive sections.
</P>
<P>
There are lots of boobytraps and a large sandy river in the
first competitive section, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Safari Rally will run over 13 competitive sections and
2,400 kilometers of Kenya's spectacular terrain.
</P>
<P>
As many as 63 cars has listed for the main event and 24 for the
parallel Classic classes in the rally, representing a total of 22
motor makers with crews from 19 countries.
</P>
<P>
After two rounds of the 1997 WRC, Sainz leads the drivers
standing with 12 points, Eriksson and Italian Piero Liati have 10
each and Makinen has eight.
</P>
<P>
Subaru led the manufacturers' standing with 23, Ford was second
at 16 and Mitsubishi third 10 points.

<HEADLINE> Feature: International School of Lusaka (by Wang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 900 students with different
skin colors are studying in the Interntional School of Lusaka
(ISL).
</P>
<P>
The students are from 55 countries throughout the world
including Zambia itself, the primary school principal E. Ballard
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The students are children of rich Zambians, of those of Indian
origin, foreign diplomats, representatives of international
agencies and foreign businessmen living in the country.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1963, the international school is one of the oldest
international schools on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Teaching staff consists of over 70 professional educators from
12 countries.
</P>
<P>
The school is managed by a Board of Governors, nine of whom
are elected by ISL association. The association is composed of
the parents of students and of professional teaching staff.
</P>
<P>
The primary school program follows a standard English language
medium program and curriculum materials are mostly from Britain
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Reading, language, scence, social studies and mathematics are
taught in primary school. Specialist teachers provide instruction
in music, art, physical education and computer studies.
</P>
<P>
The secondary school program offers a broad international
curriculum in Forms 1-3 (Grades 7-9) with courses in art,
computer studies, english, health, humanities, mathematics,
music, physical education, science and either French or Spanish.
</P>
<P>
The U.K. based International General Certificate of Secondary
Education (IGCSE) is a two year curriculum offered for Forms 4
and 5 (Grades 10 and 11). There is a separate English as a second
language program for those who require it before entering the
main school program.
</P>
<P>
During the course of the year there is a number of occasions
for interviews between parents and teachers, and there is also
regular written reports sent home. Parents can also contact a
teacher at other time to discuss about their children.
</P>
<P>
But the school fees are very expensive. Tuition fee for a
primary school student per term is as high as 1,000 U.S. dollars
and a secondary school student of Form 6 pays 2,000 dollars.
Many zambians can only get a salary of about 50 dollars monthly.
</P>
<P>
Primary school has no class in the afternoon and the students
can go to school three times a week to choose the activities such
as swimming, creative writting, draughts, extra French, field
hockey, language games, remedial maths, creative crafts, musical
production, football and cooking.
</P>
<P>
The ISL has a 33-acre campus and nine main buildings housing 63
classrooms, five laboratories, two libraries, three comuter rooms,
three art studios and staff recreational areas.
</P>
<P>
In view of the diversity of its students, the international
school of Lusaka tries to prepare its students to be world
citizens, free of prejudices of race, culture, national and
economic background, or religious belief. enditem

<HEADLINE> Bore Wells Drilling Project Starts In Dar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The newly formed Dar es
Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) had embarked on the
project of drilling 300 bore wells in the city for five weeks,
the project Coordinator, David Songea said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Songea from the Ministry of Water noted the 300 wells
being drilled are spread in all the three districts of Dar es
Salaam, and would cost 3779 million Tanzania Shillings (Tsh)
(about 6.3 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The money constitute the initial funds for phase one drilling
programme.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the government's ambitious and mostly disputed
drilling project set to drill 4,500 wells to alleviate the water
crisis in the city.
</P>
<P>
Songea added that a well drilled in a deep bore costs about 4
million Tshs (about 6,666.6 USD), while the tubes cost 700,000
Tshs with the deep bore generating 72,000 litres an hour.
</P>
<P>
He further said the street water committee would suggest to
the consumers to contribute to the utility of water.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the board of DAWASA chaired by Mr. Nerei
Msimbira with nine other members had the role to educate the
public on water conservation and take legal measures against
defaulters.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK To Further Weather Forecast Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Observatory is
expecting further cooperation with the Guangdong Meteorological
Bureau in weather forecast by jointly setting up their 4th
automatic weather station (AWS) on Dangan Dao, an island to the
south of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Located at the Pearl River Estuary, the AWS will transmit data
on wind direction, wind speed, air temperature, air pressure and
rainfall to the observatory every 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The data will then be transmitted to Guangzhou through a
network for exchange of meteorological data.
</P>
<P>
Ng Kin Fai, leader of the Electronic Maintenance Team of the
Observatory, said that in this way, valuable meteorological data
are provided to both the Hong Kong and Guangdong meteorological
authorities, facilitating the accurate forecast of hazardous
weather and issue of timely warnings.
</P>
<P>
He said that site selection, communication test and civil work
will start soon and installation work is expected to commence in
the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong and Guangdong began their cooperation in weather
forecast in 1985 when they built an AWS on Huangmaozhou, a remote
island in the south China coastal waters about 50 kilometers
southwest of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A renovation for the AWS on Huangmaozhou will start soon by the
members of an electric maintenance team of the Hong Kong
Observatory including installing state-of-the-art hardware and
software.
</P>
<P>
Apart from this station, the Hong Kong Observatory and the
Guangdong Meteorological Bureau had jointly established two more
AWSs, one at Tuoning Island to the east and another at Neilingding
Island to the west of Hong Kong. Both were completed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the same year, two such AWSs were set up at Sek Kong and Tai
Mo Shan, providing weather watch for the central part of the "New
Territories."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is operating one of the most intensive weather watch
networks in the world.
</P>
<P>
Altogether there are more than 60 AWSs in Hong Kong which
transmit data on wind direction, wind speed, air temperature, air
pressure and rainfall to the Hong Kong Observatory every
minute.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Police Shoot Dead Three Hired Killers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Police today shot
dead three Indonesians identified to be members of a hired killer
gang in a shoot-out in Shah Alam near here.
</P>
<P>
Police recovered a .38 special revolver, two kitchen knives,
several flashlights and a pair of handcuffs from them, the
Malaysian news agency Bernama reported quoting a senior police
officer.
</P>
<P>
Police investigations showed the killers, aged between 20 and
40, collected a fee of between 1,000 Ringgit (about 400 US
dollars) and 4,000 Ringgit (about 1,600 US dollars) to kill fellow
Indonesians, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The group, which had many sycophants who are being tracked
down, were high on the police wanted list for armed robberies and
rape of Indonesian women, the police officer said, adding many of
the rape cases were not reported to the police by the victims.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, the gang active in the last two years
was involved in at least three murders of Indonesian nationals.
</P>
<P>
The killers, whose modus operandi differed from one incident to
another, were known for their brutal killings including severing
the neck and crushing the heads of victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
A police party in a patrol car spotted four men on two
motorcycles this noon and ordered them to stop but one of the man
fired a shot at the police.
</P>
<P>
Police returned fire and hit one of the man who fell to the
ground while the other three sped off.
</P>
<P>
Police gave chase and in the ensuing shoot-out, two others were
killed while another accomplice, who is armed with a revolver,
managed to escape on his motorcycle, he said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the red identity cards recovered from them, two dead
were identified as Azahari Mustam and Sadli Abdul while the third
did not have any personal identification documents.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, police are tracing the Indonesians who
hired the gang to kill others, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Central Asian States Vow to Save Aral Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state of the five
central Asian nations met here today to step up their rescue
efforts for the world's largest inland lake known as the Aral Sea.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan said in the Alma Ata Declaration that
the lake's ecological safety is part of their national security.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 million U.S. dollars have been earmarked since 1993 for
improving the living condition of the people around the devastated
lake bordering the five former Soviet republics, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The Aral Sea's average water level was down by 16.5 meters from
1960 to 1996 as it lost up to 850 cubic kilometers of water.
</P>
<P>
It was the result of a deep reduction of fresh water poured
into the lake from contributory rivers as the former Soviet Union
developed some large-scale irrigation systems at upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
That has led to a sharp increase of salt content in the
remaining water in recent years, and has put plants and animals
there and around on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
In addition, salt that has been deposited on the large areas of
dry lake bed is turned into dust and blown to nearby regions,
seriously damaging the ecological environment there.
</P>
<P>
The calamity of the Aral Sea has been a great concern across
the five newly independent republics, which established in 1993 an
international fund for saving the Aral Sea.
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, the participants from the five
countries finalized the fund's institutional structure and elected
Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov as its second president after
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
The heads of states noted that the most urgent task at present
is to extend humanitarian assistances, such as medical services,
drinking water and food, to people living around the lake.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the use of water resources in the region
should be coordinated, and that efforts must be made to curb the
fast growing salinization of soil.
</P>
<P>
The Aral Sea protection fund has also won a 380 million dollars
aid from the World Bank, they added.

HONG KONG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police have smashed a
vehicle crime syndicate following the recovery of about 20
suspected stolen vehicles in Yuen Long recently, a police
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
The recovered private cars, most of which are luxury left-hand

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 1 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will make his first state visit to Malaysia for
five days beginning from March 6, it was officially announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela would be accompanied by his companion Graca Machel, a
30-member official delegation and 85 representatives of South
Africa's private sector, a foreign ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he will have an audience with the Malaysian
King Tuanku Ja'afar and a delegation meeting with Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
"The delegation meeting will focus on bilateral, regional and
international issues of common concern," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is expected to deliver a keynote address at the
Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations on "South Africa and
Malaysia -- A Joint Vision Towards the 21st Century" and another
address at the Second South Africa-Malaysia Business Forum.
</P>
<P>
The president will also deliver a speech at a luncheon hosted
by the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia.

region with total trade amounting to 883 million Ringgit (about
353.2 million US dollars) in 1995 with South African exports to
Malaysia almost doubling to 388 million Ringgit (about 155.2
million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Census Shows Iran Has 59.5 Million Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A 1996 national census showed that
Iran's total population stood at 59.5 million, the Persian daily
Salam reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Abbas Ali Zali, head of the Statistical
Center of Iran, as saying that there are 12.4 million families in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure seems much less than predictions made by
the United Nations population specialists who claimed that Iran
has about 65 million population.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Minister of Health Ali Reza Marandi said earlier
"There are a large number of children under 16 or 17 who are
reaching gradually the age of marriage. In other words, 25
million youngsters mean 12.5 million couples in the future. If
each couple have two children, still they will add 25 million to
the population."
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Iran witnessed a fast growth of
population. Specialists warned that the population would be
doubled again in 20 or 25 years.

PARIS, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In the second half of 1996, the number of deaths caused by
HIV lowered by 20 percent in France. In the United States, a
comparable evolution has also been observed. Therapeutic
progresses, such as anti-proteasis and tritherapies, have
contributed to this decrease, the first since the appearance of
the AIDS disease in early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
-- The Pentagon announced Friday that nearly all classified
documents on the using of chemical arms during the Gulf War have
disappeared. The documents include a report on the explosion of an
arsenal of Iraqi chemical weapons, which caused the contamination
of 1,000 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Boris Yeltsin Friday asked the Russian
Ministry of Justice to ``prepare for measures'' aimed at
abolishing death penalty. Fifty-two people were executed in
Russia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The number of jobless people in France increased by 0.6
percent in January, or 18,600 more people as is compared with
December last year. The unemployment rate of France now stands at
12.7 percent with a legion of 3,099,800 unemployed people, which
represents a 3.1 percent increase over the same month of 1996.
</P>
<P>
-- Belgium remains under a shock after the French auto producer
Renault announced Thursday that it would close a factory in
Vilvoord, Belgium, where 3,100 people are employed.
</P>
<P>
Burdened with heavy deficits since 1995 and threatened with
fierce competition in the European auto market, Renault is
starting a profound restructuring of its industrial sector which
could result in 60,000 more lay-offs in France.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Paris Bourse Friday welcomed the decision by
Renault by pushing up the value of its stocks by 13
percent.

<HEADLINE> Monthly Review on Manila Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Manila stock market
consolidated its gains last month after a three-day bull-run
fueled by the country's favorable economic figures for January.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the announcement of the 6.8-percent growth in the
country's gross national product and the 5.5-percent expansion in
the gross domestic product by the government in January propelled
the composite index to a new all-time high on the first trading
day last month.
</P>
<P>
But after the government announced robust economic growth and
strong corporate earnings of publicly listed companies last year,
the market started to correct from its new record of 3,447.60
points on February 6.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the market later consolidated, sending the
composite index (Phisix) down 106.63 points or 3.12 percent to
close at 3,315.28 last month from January's 3,421.91 points. The
all-shares index likewise lost 22.63 points or 1.99 percent to
1,116.46 points from 1,139.09 points.
</P>
<P>
The sub-indices closed mixed. The C-I and property indices
closed down while the mines, oils and financial services ended up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the volume of shares traded went up by 60.61 percent
to 572.77 billion shares traded last month from January's 356.61
billion shares but value turnover amounted to 72.87 billion pesos
(2.78 billion U.S. dollars) or 4.89 percent less than the previous
month's 76.62 billion pesos (2.92 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
"February was a month of correction as investors opted to take
profits after hitting an all-time high on the first trading day of
the month," DBS Securities Philippines Inc. research manager Jun
Trinidad said.
</P>
<P>
He said the market moved sideways with a downward bias for the
rest of the month. But he pointed out that the market's 3,300
major support level survived the decline as it continued to trade
above the psychological barrier.
</P>
<P>
He said speculative stocks stole the limelight from
fundamentally sound blue chips and second line issues as all 1996
corporate earnings have already been released.
</P>
<P>
Trinidad said attention shifted to speculative stocks due to
the lack of buying incentives for blue chips and second line
issues.
</P>
<P>
"Rumors on possible backdoor listings and corporate takeovers
of dormant and penny stocks dominated the trading last month," he
said.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Have New Patrol Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 1 (Xinhua) The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is to
have six new Ocean Capable Patrol Boats (OCPB) to strengthen its
fleet in the Gulf, UAE's official newspaper Emirates News said
today
</P>
<P>
The vessels, estimated to cost around 600 million U.S. dollars
are to replace the UAE Navy's aging fleet of six 33.5-meter
Ardhana class patrol craft supplied by Vosper Thornycroft of the
Britain, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Seven international shipyards mainly from Germany, France,
Britain and the United states have been asked to submit technical
and commercial bids for the vessels, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The 65-meter-long vessels will be able to accommodate a small
size Eurocopter helicopter and to deploy a Super-Puma helicopter
on the deck, the paper quoted a defense source, who required not
to be identified, as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that the boats will enhance the UAE Navy's
capability of surface surveillance and interdiction missions and
will also enable the UAE to counter a perceived threat from Iran's
acquisition of two kilo-class submarines from Russia last year,
the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko Calls for More Power to Russia-Belarus Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexandr
Lukashenko urged today the expansion of the mandate of the
standing executive committee of the Russia-Belarus union to speed
up the integration of the two neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
The committee, currently headed by Russian Prime Minister
Victor Chernomyrdin, should be turned into a supra-national
institution with special jurisdiction, an Interfax news agency
report quoted the president as saying in Minsk.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko made the remarks after meeting with Russian Minister
for Cooperation with Commonwealth Independent States (CIS)
Countries, Aman Tuleyev, who visited the Belarussian capital to
prepare the two states' Moscow summit on March 7.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the union treaty signed by the two Slav nations
on April 2, 1996, to create a "Community of Sovereign Republics"
with coordinated foreign and military policies failed to build a
mechanism for the implementation of bilateral agreements.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Belarussian president proposed that the standing
executive committee of the Community be given the mandate to make
decisions with binding forces on the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Under the union treaty, besides foreign and military policies,
the two neighbors will also link their economic and political
systems, and create a common market by the end of 1997 to allow
the free flow of commodities, capital, labor and services.
</P>
<P>
However, Lukashenko said today that it is too early to discuss
whether the Community should be a loose confederation or a close
union, and that the institutional structure is pending the
development of bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Tuleyev said he shared the same view with
President Lukashenko, adding that he had brought along some
proposals for the two states' integration during his visit.
</P>
<P>
If approved and implemented, the Russian minister said, the
proposals will bring down the two countries' energy price index by
half and that of some other commodities by 17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Anti-Fundamentalist Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's National Security
Council (NSC) has urged the coalition government to take
measures against "fundamentalist" activities in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A communique, issued by the NSC following its nine-hour
meeting Friday night, said: "We will not give any concessions
from the contemporary and democratic values of the Republic of
Turkey set up by Ataturk (founder of Turkey)."
</P>
<P>
It added that the nation should not be divided into secular
and anti-secular poles.
</P>
<P>
The NSC meeting, attended by powerful military and civilian
leaders under the chairmanship of President Suleyman Demirel,
discussed the threats directed at the secular Turkey and
intelligence reports which warned that the activities of Muslim
fanatics were aimed at establishing an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
The Welfare Party's recent proposals on ordering women civil
servants to wear Islamic-style head covering and building a mosque
in one of Istanbul's main commercial squares triggered criticism
from Western-oriented Turks.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Welfare Party headed by Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan came to power last July in a coalition with the secular
True Path Party led by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller. This is the first time that an Islamic-inspired
party was part of government in Turkey's modern history, which
marked by strict secularism since 1923.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a Muslim nation but has a secular system and lacks
the religion-based restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Government Troops Learn Law of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Both junior and senior officers
of Ugandan government troops now are taking their turns in a two
day seminar to learn the law of war, reports from both the north
and the west said today.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is sponsored by the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) in accordance with the high command of Uganda
People's Defence Forces (UPDF), local English daily "the Monitor"
said.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the seminar is "Basics of Humanitarian Law
Applicable During Conflict". Trainees are also acquainted with
the activities and mandate of the ICRC done on behalf of victims
of war.
</P>
<P>
In northern town of Gulu, such trains were held for 4 turns.
Similar courses are under way now in western Kasese district,
Uganda red cross society reported from the district.
</P>
<P>
Both of the north and the west are rebellion-affected areas in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said there were some indisciplines among
soldiers acting in the western district of Kasese. The high
command of UPDF had ordered to create an office under resident
district councilor in Kasese to deal with the complains from
local residents.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber closed the week all lower.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals were lower with March south dipping by 33.50
Ringgit (about 13.4 US dollars) to close the week at 1,310 Ringgit
(about 524 US dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals are expected to continue to be lower next
week on expectations of higher palm oil production this month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said February was regarded as a short month for palm
oil production following the long holiday break which slowed down
oil palm fruit harvesting.
</P>
<P>
The weak performance of the market would be also due to the
lack of market direction in the absence of fresh tenders which
prompted players to liquidate their positions, especially towards
the weekend, they said.
</P>
<P>
Cargo surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) on Friday
put Malaysia's palm oil February exports at 453,2 87 tons against
586,046 tons in January, leaving no significant impact on the
market.
</P>
<P>
ON the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), the price closed the
week at 14.25 Ringgit (about 5.7 US dollars) per kg, 39 sen lower
from last week's 14.64 Ringgit (about 5.856 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover for the week stood at 514 tons as against
655 tons last week with European, local and Japanese buyers
accounting for the bulk of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
The price differential between the KLTM and that of the LME
stood at a premium of 20 US dollars per ton this Friday against 35
US dollars per ton previously.
</P>
<P>
The tin price on the KLTM might extend its downtrend next week
if the metal's price on the London Metal Exchange (LME) does not
improve, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market's sentiment this week was weak as
both buyers and sellers have been sidelined to a wait-and-see
attitude despite some buying interest from China, Australia and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
March RSS One closed the week one sen lower to 302.00 sen
(about 120.8 US cents) per kg while SMR 20 added half sen to
296.50 sen (about 118.6 US cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market is expected to maintain their current
price levels next week following the lack of fresh leads, dealers
said.
</P>
<P>
The steadier Ringgit against the US dollar during the week
under review also dampened market sentiment as most foreign buyers
shifted to other markets like Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Ringgit stood around the 2.4700 level against the US dollar
early this week from 2.4800 last week.
</P>
<P>
The lack of demand for rubber was also attributed to the fact
that most of the motor vehicle manufacturers have bought enough
rubber for their stocks.

TEHRAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The toll of victims in an
earthquake in northwest Iran rose Saturday to at least 200 people
killed and 1,000 injured, the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake hit the towns of Ardabil and Meshkinshahr at
4:27 p.m. (1257 GMT) Friday, causing widespread damage in the
surrounding district and toppling houses in some 52 villages, the
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Emergency rescue teams were rushed to the scene on the edge of
the Talish Mountains some 590 kilometers (365 miles) northwest of
the capital Tehran, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian TV reported the quake had a 5.5 magnitude. But some
other foreign research agencies reported the quake measuring
magnitude around 6.0 with its epicenter 20 miles (30 kilometers)
west-southwest of Ardabil.
</P>
<P>
Iran is earthquake-prone and is rocked by hundreds of tremors
every year, some of which are deadly and cause widespread damage.

of the country left at least 79 people dead and more than 260
injured.
</P>
<P>
On June 21, 1990, a quake in Iran with a magnitude estimated at
7.3 to 7.7 left 50,000 people dead.

<P>
TEHRAN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government lodged a
protest against the United States for its forces creating
nuisance for Iranian ships and vessels in the Persian Gulf,
an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the protest
was made by Maji Takht-Ravanchi, Iran's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the letter by the Iranian government
to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was circulated as a
document of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Takht-Ravanchi stressed that the U.S. warships and helicopters
positioned in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman
repeatedly created a nuisance for Iranian ships and vessels.
</P>
<P>
On December 9, 1996, after the ship "Iran-Shojaat" left
Bandar-e Imam and Khour Mussa region of Iran, it was inspected by a
U.S. warship.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the U.S. warship contacted the Iranian
ship and ordered to reduce its speed and directed the ship
to a specific position.
</P>
<P>
It then inquired about the specific contents of the ship.
Following a thorough investigation, the ship was then allowed
to sail toward Bandar Abbas, it noted.
</P>
<P>
On January 8, 1997, two U.S. helicopters positioned in Buoy
two of Khour Mussa channel flew over the ship "Iran Matin"
which was navigating from Bandar-e Imam Khomeini to Bandar
Abbas, and through a VHF channel ordered the ship to change
its course toward Kuwait's waters.
</P>
<P>
After the Iranian ship contacted the control office in
Kharg island, it proceeded toward Bandar Abbas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
An American helicopter flew over the "Iran Tabriz" oil
tanker, which was leaving Buoy six of Khour Mussa channel on
the same date and ordered the ship to change its course,
said the letter adding after the oil tanker received a proper
course to follow from Kharg island, it sailed toward Bandar
Abbas.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian envoy voiced Iran's protests toward illegal
measures taken by the U.S. government and called for an end
to such actions.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan wants to have
meaningful bilateral discussions with India in a bid to solve the
pending problems between the two countries, a foreign ministry
spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly news briefing here, the spokesman said
that "Pakistan has always been in favor of a peaceful and
negotiated settlement of the problems" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan honestly believed that it was very important to have a
normal and good-neighborly relationship with India, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Indian Prime Minister Deve Gowda has sent a
letter to his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif in response to
Sharif's proposal earlier for holding foreign secretary level
talks with India on the pending bilateral issues including the
Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Gowda had reiterated in his letter the offer for holding the
bilateral talks, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister has again made "a very positive
reply" to Gowda's letter and "has made a definitive proposal for
the commencement of the negotiations between the two countries,"
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the response from India will be positive and it
will be possible to resume the negotiations at an earlier date,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the forthcoming visit to Pakistan by Iranian
Deputy Foreign Minister Morteza Sarmadi, the spokesman said
Sarmadi is to visit Pakistan as a special envoy of the Iranian
government.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports suggested that Sarmadi is coming to
Pakistan "to investigate attack on the Iranian Cultural Center in
Multan," east of Pakistan's Punjab province on February 20.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, denied the reports, saying that "no
team from Iran is visiting Pakistan for the purpose of
investigation."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that during his stay here Sarmadi is
expected to hold talks with high ranking Pakistani government
officials on the tragic Multan incident in which an Iranian
official and six other Pakistanis were killed.

<HEADLINE> India's New Budget Proposals Receive Mixed Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP), the major opposition party in the country, and its allies
sharply attacked the 1997-98 budget proposals presented to
Parliament Friday evening by union Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram.
</P>
<P>
"The proposals would not help development but would only fuel
inflation," BJP leader and former prime minister A. B. Vajpayee
warned.
</P>
<P>
The proposed hikes in the service, railway and postal sectors
would add to the existing burden of the common man and lead to an
overall increase in prices which are already rising, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling United Front's constituents and its outside
supporter, the Congress Party, have voiced their reservation on
certain counts though broadly supporting the finance minister's
effort.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of India (Marxist), another constituent of
the 13-party United Front, however, has come down heavily on what
it called the pro-rich bias of the government and its failure to
depart from the liberalization policy initiated by the Rao
government in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Some press reports said that the new budget for 1997-98 is
characterized with a thrust on economic reforms and pro-poor tilt.
It has brought about a big relief for income-tax payers and
corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
The corporate sector has expressed its full support for the
budget. Its euphoric mood was reflected in the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE) sensitive index which shot up by 176 points in the
post-budget session.
</P>
<P>
"The markets will now zoom upwards. Just wait and see what
happens in the next few days. This budget will have a great
psychological impact," said an economic analyst.
</P>
<P>
"I will give 9.9 points out of 10 to Mr. Chidambaram. This
budget has exceeded our expectations," said industrialist Rahul
Bajai.
</P>
<P>
"A strong signal has been sent that India is firmly on the path
of continuing the reforms process," industrialist Hari Shankar
Singhania said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Economy Set for Soft-landing in 1997, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The South Africa's economic
growth in 1997 is expected to slow down but achieve a "soft
landing", setting the scene for higher potential growth in 1998
and beyond, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A local daily The Citizen today quoted the Governor as saying
that the economy would not slide into recession in 1997 but
growth was likely to be "slightly lower" than the 3.1 percent in
1996 and 3.4 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Stals said the structural adjustments were taking place in
economy but "we are heading for what economists will refer to as
a soft landing".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most economists in the country are also looking for
growth of two to three percent for the current year.
</P>
<P>
Stals believed that if the key elements of the structural
adjustments, including privatisation, further trade
liberalisation and the gradual removal of exchange controls, went
on smoothly, good growth could be expected for the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
With the Rand slowly regaining its lost ground since the
beginning of the year, the financial stability would be restored
without creating too many hardships so far as real economic
activity was concerned, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Rand, lost about 30 percent of its value in 1996, achieved
quite a good performance in the financial market so far in the
year, reaching a six-month high of 4.457 against the Dollar in
early February.

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to further improve and

Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Chinese Premier Li Peng
said today.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report delivered this morning at the Fifth

state-to-state relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is opposed to all acts of interfering in the internal
affairs of other countries, and stands for seeking common ground
while setting aside differences and for lessening differences and
expanding cooperation through more dialogue and exchanges, he

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA,March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian capital Lusaka is to
have a better water supply with the completion of phase one of
the Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) infrastructure
rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
LWSC supply manager Tenthani Banda told the local press on
Friday that the completed phase includes the refurbishment of
reservoirs, boreholes, pumps, pinelines, a thorough cleaning up
of the database and the installation of a state-of-the-art
computer system.
</P>
<P>
The project was funded with a loan of 40 million U.S. dollars
from the African Development Bank (ADB) and it started in 1989.
</P>
<P>
For years, particularly in 1996, there was water suspension
here and there in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
"With the ADB and other projects, there has been remarkable
improvements which have satisfied our management. We are quite
sure that by the year 2000, people should be talking about a
different LWSC," Banda said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ongoing efforts to improve water
reticulation in Lusaka has helped his firm make available 60
percent of the commodity needed in the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, he appealed the Lusaka city council to stop issuing
land indiscriminately without recourse to service provisions like
water supply and sewer systems as his company always finds it
difficult to provide water after plots have been issued and
developed.

<HEADLINE> CPP Reiterates Position to Boycott NUF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) today reiterated its position to boycott the newly-launched
National United Front (NUF) led by the Funcinpec Party, CPP's
partner in the coalition of the Royal Government.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the spokesman's office of the CPP said, "The
CPP boycotts such a front and this is CPP's common position
already stated by Hun Sen (CPP's Vice-Chairman and Cambodia's
Second Prime Minister) on behalf of the CPP."
</P>
<P>
The statement came in reaction to an interview, carried on
today's local newspaper "Reaksmey Kampucha", which was given by
NUF President Norodom Ranariddh" on NUF's failure to invite CPP to
NUF's founding congress on February 27.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, Cambodia's First Prime Minister, was quoted by
the newspaper as explaining that CPP was not invited because he
had heard Hun Sen had declared CPP would not join the Front.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh was also cited as saying he will choose appropriate
time to meet CPP's Chairman Chea Sim and hand over the NUF's
platform.
</P>
<P>
The CPP statement said the CPP has no need to examine the
political platform of this NUF as the CPP already adopted its own
platform for national reconciliation and development at its
national congress held from January 24 to 27.
</P>
<P>
The statement lashed at the published interview for inciting
split inside the CPP, saying "The CPP considers the above saying
as an action aimed at causing split inside the CPP at a time when
a number of politicians unceasingly provoked the CPP."
</P>
<P>
"It is unique that ruling parties in the coalition ally
themselves with the opposition party that cursed the Royal
Government as one making Cambodia into a mafia state and causing
troubles," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Students Told Not to Resort to Violent Methods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's higher education
minister Ignatius Chombo yesterday said tertiary students should
desist from methods of protest that violate the basis of academic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed in academic freedom and there was need to
protect non-violent forms of protest, including demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
"I am opposed to methods of protest, especially the criminal
element that has invaded student protest in recent years and
manifests itself through the destruction of property and the
abuse of ordinary citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was officially opening the first Zimbabwe national students
union three-day congress in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The escalations of demonstrations and strikes at universities
and colleges was not a mere manifestation of the rejection of
parental authority, nor a weakening of state power or immaturity
of students but was reflective of the conflict of generations, he
said.
</P>
<P>
There is therefore need to expose means of minimising the
degree of intolerance in the institutions of higher learning, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Stamp Market Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- To boost local stamp trading,
Shanghai has moved a roadside stamp market into a nearby building.
</P>
<P>
The center, which is among the four-biggest in China, was
relocated in Yunzhou Mansion and has become a multi-functional
transaction market with first-class equipment, according to local
stamp trading officials.
</P>
<P>
It includes 120 transaction rooms and more than 400 counters,
totaling more than 3,000 sq m.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s stamp collectors spontaneously gathered at
certain places to exchange items from their collections, and a
garden around central Shanghai's Taiyuan Road was soon chosen as a
permanent stamp trading center for the public in October 1988.
</P>
<P>
In addition to stamp trading, the center also offers various
kinds of lectures and activities to spread knowledge of philately.

JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is ready to host the
2006 Asian Games but is doubtful of its chance of hosting the

</P>
<P>
The National Sports Council had promised to prepare to stage

<HEADLINE> Large Coal Base Planned for Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province is to build a coal base with an annual output of 50
million tons of raw coal in the southern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
The five cities in the area have a combined proven coal
reserves of 8.2 billion tons, accounting for 66 percent of the
province's total.
</P>
<P>
Local officials have predicted that the coal-deficient province
will lack five to 10 million tons of coal each year in the 21st
century. So it deems the development of the local coal industry as
an urgent matter.
</P>
<P>
In the next five to 10 years, priority will be given to the
development of the Junlian and Guxu coalfields, a government
official said.
</P>
<P>
The former has a designed production capacity of 8.7 million
tons per year. Its development will require an investment of 14.7
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Guxu coalfield, near Luzhou City, will turn out one million
tons of coal annually.

<HEADLINE> Report on Local Autonomy Approved in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
approved in principle a report on decentralization recommending
for giving more authority to local administrations in the country,
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The report was submitted to the government last year by a
high-level decentralization committee formed with the objective of
making local bodies able and efficient under the concept of local
self-governance, according to the Local Development Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary bills concerning local bodies on village,
municipality and district level have been drafted on the basis of
the recommendations of the report, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being made to reach an agreement on these draft
bills through discussions with representatives of major political
parties in the country, it added.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the government will present the
decentralization bills to the Winter session of parliament which
is to convene from Monday.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming local elections, which elect chief officers and
representatives for local administration bodies across the
country, will be held after the parliament approves these
decentralization bills.
</P>
<P>
The government last month decided to postpone the local
elections, which were originally scheduled to conclude by
mid-April, till the introduction of the decentralization acts for
more autonomous rights of local bodies.

<P>
BELGRADE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia and the Bosnian
Serb Republic of Srpska signed an agreement here on Friday to
establish cooperative relations between the two.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic and
the Bosnian Serb member of the Bosnian Presidency, Momcilo
Krajisnik.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace accord which ended the three-and-half-year
Bosnian war allows the Bosnian Moslem-Croat Federation to
establish such a special tie with Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides will strengthen their
friendship, trust and cooperation on the basis of independence,
equality, respect for human rights and freedom, and
non-interference with each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also make efforts to keep peace and
stability and maintain mutual understanding in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Both Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serb Republic insisted on
solving the international conflicts and confrontations by peaceful
means. They agreed that neither side would allow its territory to
be used for aggression against the other.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also set up a Cooperation Council, with Lilic and
Krajisnik as its heads, to implement the agreement as well as to
accelerate all-round cooperation in economy, trade, culture,
technology, communications and so on.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will need to be ratified by the Bosnian
parliament before it comes into force.

recently benefited from "overweighing" by foreign funds, there
were concerns that market might stage another pullback in prices
if foreigners cashed out from their gains.

However, most analysts viewed that a correction on the KLSE was
imminent as the CI had climbed substantially over the past few
days.

temporary, given the country's strong economy fundamentals and

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ASEAN to See Rosier Map of Transport Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Southeast Asian nations could
expect a rosier prospect for subregional transport links in the
future as their transport ministers have agreed to push ahead a
Thai proposal to build an ASEAN highway network.
</P>
<P>
Transport ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) Friday in northern Thailand agreed to expand the
Thai idea when they hold their next meeting in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the two-day ASEAN transport ministers'
meeting in Chiang Mai, Thai Transport Minister Suwat Liptapanlop
said that Thailand will go into the details of the project, which
would explore both existing national highways and build new routes
to serve as a link among ASEAN nations and its future members.
</P>
<P>
Measures for forging the highway network, which is designed to
facilitate the flow of goods and people within the region, include
recognizing the driver licenses and vehicle inspection
certificates issued by ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ASEAN now is considering details of a study on a
trans-Asian railway through Indochina and the ASEAN subregion
compiled by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
The ESCAP study proposed four possible routes from Singapore to
Kunming city, capital of Yunnan province in southwestern China,
all of which will pass through Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Two of the four routes will go through Myanmar, extending 4,794
kilometers and 4,263 kilometers respectively and requiring the
construction of 880 km and 1,293 km of new track.
</P>
<P>
The third will go through Cambodia and Vietnam with a distance
of 5,290 km, within which 288 km of new track will be built.
</P>
<P>
The fourth will run through Laos and cover a distance of 4,105
km with the construction of 1,293 km of new track required.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia also has undertaken to study a trans-Asian rail
network looking at similar routes, which is expected to be
completed in nine months.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will focus on three components -- economic benefits,
engineering standards and transport facilitation.
</P>
<P>
The economic component includes the number of passengers and
volume of goods.
</P>
<P>
The engineering component will consider rail standards, train
speeds and engineering costs, including the construction of
tunnels and bridges.
</P>
<P>
The third component will focus on the cross-border
transportation of goods and passengers and training of customs and
immigration officers.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said that Malaysia
will not duplicate existing work and it will collect the results
of other studies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the road to integrate the region's road or
rail links is long as more talks are needed to coordinate each
country's positions, but they stressed the process is still
advancing.

<HEADLINE> WB Provides Aid to Sri Lanka for Road Rehabilitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank have agreed to provide 87.72 million US dollars
to Sri Lanka to help it upgrade its road network islandwide,
Transport Department sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that this is being done mainly to
improve the country's infrastructure facilities so as to attract
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
They said that although Sri Lanka carried out an open economy
in 1977, it has failed to meet the requirements of foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign investors complained that the Sri Lanka's road
network islandwide was undeveloped, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
There are over 12,000 kilometers of roadway islandwide but most

<HEADLINE> NATO Holds Back on Command Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic treaty
Organization (NATO) has decided that no change will be made to its
command structure until the NATO reform begins, and a balance
between the United States and Europe is attained.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be announced in coming days, a source from
the Italian Foreign Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
France suggested in January that the South Command be split
into two, with a European officer in charge of NATO's
ground-stationed forces in southern Europe, and an American
admiral in charge of the U.S. Sixth Fleet and some air and navy
forces in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
But the United States intended to maintain its control over the
South Command, saying it would accept neither a "double command"
for South Command, nor a division of the command into two separate
entities, as had been suggested by France.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it suggested that a NATO "specialized command" be
created for the Mediterranean region under the Naples-based South
Command.
</P>
<P>
The difference between the U.S. and France was put aside by
making no change to NATO's command structure until NATO's reform
began, to avoid turning the structure reform into a dispute
between the U.S. and Europe, said the sources.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tea Output Reaches New Record in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Tea production figures in Sri
Lanka last year established a new record of 258.9 million kgs,
registering an increase of 5 percent compared with the figures in
1995, according to the Tea Board sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the increase was entirely from the low
grown sector which recorded a substantial increase of 16.3 million
kgs over its previous record whilst production from the high and
medium grown sectors have declined marginally.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 60 percent of this production comes from the
smallholder sector which is a great achievement since 1980's.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the Sri Lankan government has taken
several measures to increase productivity and profitability of
tea. Sri Lanka has begun a process of modernizing the tea industry
with the infusion of new capital, new technology and improved
management standards.
</P>
<P>
They added that the private sector with large plantations as
well as the smallholdings plays a dynamic and central role in this
development effort.
</P>
<P>
Tea is one of Sri Lanka's major export items and the source of
26 percent of its export earning. Total tea exports in 1996
recorded 244 million kgs, bettering its pervious record of 240
million kgs in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Global Issues Should Not be Decided by Any One Power: Premier-32 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Global issues should be handled
through equal participation by all countries instead of being
decided by any one power, Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress
(NPC), which opened this morning, Li said at the turn of the
century, the international community faces many problems in
safeguarding world peace and promoting common development. The
settlement of these problems demands the common effort of all
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese Government and people are ready to work
with all the governments and peoples of the world for a peaceful,
stable, prosperous and progressive new world.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the world situation as a whole is becoming
even more relaxed. International relations are undergoing major
adjustments, with the trend towards multi-polarity developing
further. The position and role of developing countries in
international affairs continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
The premier noted that it is the common aspiration of people of
all countries to establish a new international political and
economic order of peace, stability, fairness and justice.
</P>
<P>
However, he said hegemony and power politics still seriously
threaten world peace, stability and development, and local
conflicts and regional tensions still exist. The world economy is
growing steadily, but the gap between the poor and rich countries
is widening. It remains the major task of the international
community to safeguard world peace and promote economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, China has pursued an independent foreign
policy of peace and has achieved positive results in its
diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
China has actively participated in multilateral diplomatic
activities organized by the United Nations and regional
organizations and has made positive contributions to the
maintenance of world peace and the promotion of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has actively participated in and
promoted the process of the signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty. As a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council, China has always adhered to principles and stood
for justice on major international issues, which has won extensive
praises and applause from the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has fought resolutely against actions aimed at infringing
on its sovereignty and interfering in its internal affairs, and
has effectively safeguarded its state sovereignty and national
dignity.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are ready to work with all
governments and people's of the world for a peaceful, stable,
prosperous and progressive new world, he said.

He said, "We should turn grief into strength, carry on with our
work at the behest of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and, under the
guidance of his theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the basic line of the Party and under the
leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin
at its core, keep in mind our fundamental interests, continue our
efforts, unite and work as one, and advance in a pioneering spirit
to further the great cause initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and
achieve new successes in reform, opening up and socialist
modernization."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua)-- China will expedite the shift of
the economic structure and the mode of economic growth
conscientiously to ensure stability and maintain a sustained,
rapid and sound development of the national economy and promote
social development in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng made this remark at the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, which falls in 36 pages and 14,500 Chinese
characters, is divided into seven parts. Based on reviewing the
government work last year, Li Peng concentrated on such topics as
economic development, reform of the state-owned enterprises and
social development.
</P>
<P>
The report also elaborated such issues as to ensure smooth
transfer of political power and a smooth transition in Hong Kong,
to promote the reunification of the motherland and the foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said the year 1996 was the first year in implementation of
the Outlined Ninth Five-Year Plan and Long-Range Objectives
through the Year 2010. Under the leadership of the Communist Party
of China, he said, the people of all nationalities in China
united, worked hard and achieved fresh success in the reform,
opening up and the modernization drive, making a good start for
the accomplishment of the magnificent cross-century program.
</P>
<P>
A salient feature of China's economic development in 1996 was
the continued growth in national economy and inflation under
control. The gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 9.7 percent
over the previous year and price rises dropped from 14.8 percent
to 6.1 percent, much lower than the planned target for
macro-control.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China's economic restructuring progressed steadily and
the country continued to open wider to the outside world. New
achievements were recorded in science, technology, education and
in all other social undertakings. The standard of living of urban
and rural people continued to improve.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese premier also pointed out there still exist
quite a few conflicts and problems in the midst of economic
development and public activities, and there are also shortcomings
and deficiencies in the work of the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
The problems referred to by Li Peng include: the foundation on
which macro-economic stability relies is still not consolidated
enough and unsound aspects of the economic structure are eminent.
The basis of agriculture is still fragile and the quality and
performance of the national economy as a whole remains relatively
poor.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a fairly big pressure from population and
employment issues. Some state-owned enterprises are having
difficulties in production and operation and losses are on the
rise," he added.
</P>
<P>
Li also said that some more enterprises have completely or
partially suspended production, leading to a rise in the number of
laid-off workers. Central finance is confronted with considerable
difficulties; the relationship between income and distribution has
yet to be straightened out; corruption and other undersirable
phenomena remain serious problems, and bureaucratism, formalism
and proneness to boasting and exaggeration are spreading among
some government functionaries; public security is not good in some
areas. Li Peng called for attention to these issues.
</P>
<P>
After citing the above problems, Li Peng devoted two thirds of
his report to elaborating the goals set by the Chinese government
for this year's economic and social development and measures to be
adopted to solve the existing problems.
</P>
<P>
China has fixed the economic growth rate for the year 1996 at
eight percent as the target for macro-economic control and make
sure that price rise ranges are lower than they actually were last
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
To this purposed, Li said, China will continue to give priority
to strengthening agriculture, maintain a reasonable scale of
investment and intensify structural readjustment and strive to
continue carrying out appropriately tight financial and monetary
policies. Moreover, efforts will be made to open the country wider
to the outside world and keep improving the standard of living of
the people in urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The reform of state-owned enterprises has been listed as the
priority task in economic restructuring in 1997 and a pressing
task for the Chinese government, he said. The Chinese premier
dedicated more than one sixth of the report to this issue, which
has been rarely seen in government reports in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Li acknowledged that China will closely combine reform,
reorganization and upgrading with better management, manage large
enterprises and conglomerates well and adopt a flexible policy
towards small ones and take different measures for deal with
varied situations. "All this should be done in order to achieve
pragmatic and effective results in reforming and developing
state-owned enterprises," he said.

The six measures set forth by the premier include: concentrate
on rejuvenating large enterprises and enterprise groups; give
small state-owned enterprises still greater freedom; standardize
bankruptcy procedures, encourage merger of enterprises and promote
re-employment; increase capital and reduce debts through various
channels; conscientiously strengthen the operation and management
of enterprises; strive to help enterprises eliminate losses and
increase profits and vigorously promote the reform of the social
security system.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to improve socialist culture and socialist
ethics with a view to promoting coordinated economic and social
development," said Li, who also vows to make great strides in
science and technology, education, culture, public health and
sports as well as environmental protection and family and
development of socialist ethics.
</P>
<P>
Safeguarding social and political stability is indispensable to
the modernization drive in China, he said. In 1997, China will
improve all facets of public security, make greater, in-depth
efforts to combat corruption and to keep government employers
honest and industrious. Efforts will also be made to consolidate
and develop great ethnic unity, accelerate the modernization of
national defense and develop socialist democracy, improve the
socialist legal system and run state affairs according to law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Hong Kong issue, Li Peng urged to ensure a
smooth transfer of government and a smooth transition in Hong
Kong, and said that all preparations for Hong Kong's return to the
motherland are being made in an orderly way.

<HEADLINE> Honduras, El Salvador Settle Border Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The border crisis between
Honduras and El Salvador has eased following the exit of 16
Salvadoran trucks loaded with timber, and the payment to Honduras
of a 10,000 U.S. dollars fine.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by an illegal timber operation
performed by Salvadorans living in Nahuaterique and Sabanetas, a
Honduran zone bordering El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran Foreign Relations Ministry said today that the
settlement was arranged by the special follow-up commissions made
up of delegates from both countries. On Thursday they went to the
conflict zones of Pasamanos and El Zancudo in the former
Nahuaterique Bolson.
</P>
<P>
The commission will meet again in San Salvador on March 3 and
in Tegucigalpa on March 5 to continue negotiations in a bid to
reach an agreement to solve the problem in a definitive way.
</P>
<P>
Both delegations agreed to promote, through the Honduran Forest
Development Corporation, the implementation of a immediate, just,
and fair solution, taking into account the special circumstances
of the area in the exploitation of forestry resources.
</P>
<P>
They also exhorted the 5,000 Salvadorans living there to abide
by the solutions to be recommended, and to cooperate with Honduran
forest authorities.
</P>
<P>
Honduras and El Salvador staged a "100-hour war" in July of
1969, which was prevented from developing into a serious conflict
by the Organization of American States (OAS).
</P>
<P>
It resulted from an incident with similar characteristics to
the present one: the movement of troops, provocations, and lack
of respect for authorities.

<HEADLINE> 1996 Good Beginning for Achievement of Trans-Century Goals (37) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A sustained and rapid economic
growth and the effective curbing of inflation highlighted China's
economic development in 1996, indicating a good beginning for the
execution of the country's plan for trans-century goals.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng made the remark when he delivered his
government work report today at the opening meeting of the ongoing
Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), the
Chinese legislature.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that last year's government work report set
forth the target of bringing down the inflation rate from 14.8
percent to about 10 percent in 1996. The actual inflation rate in
1996 dropped to 6.1 percent, remarkably lower than the government's
macro-economic control goal.
</P>
<P>
He added that China's GDP exceeded 6,770 billion yuan in
1996, an increase of 9.7 percent over the previous year as
calculated in terms of comparable prices.
</P>
<P>
The financial situation was stable, and currency issue was kept
under control. And state foreign exchange reserves exceeded 100
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China's total grain output amounted to more than 480
billion kg, and its steel output broke the 100-million-ton mark,
according to the premier.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets came to 2,360 billion yuan, an
increase of 18.2 percent over the 1995 figure, with investment
structure improved and construction of key projects further
strengthened, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
China's central and western regions received more than 43
percent of total state investment in newly-started key capital
construction projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, economic restructuring progressed steadily and China
continued to open wider to the outside world, Li said.
</P>
<P>
While lowering the general level of tariffs, the government
modified its policy on import tax reductions and exemptions, and
lowered the rates for tax refunds on exports, he said. And rural
banking reform was initiated throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the government stepped up efforts to reform
state-owned enterprises and experimentation was carried out in
an all-round way, and 58 cities experimented with optimizing
their capital structure, said the premier.
</P>
<P>
He said the ratio of production to marketing and the amounts of
profit and taxes of large enterprises and enterprise groups, a
major concern of the state, rose to some extent; enterprises made
progress in increasing capital and reducing debts; the debt ratio
in some enterprises was lowered; many small enterprises improved
production and operation after they were allowed greater
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
With realization of convertibility of the RMB under current
accounts, the premier observed, China further improved its
investment environment last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
In spite of sharp competition on the international market and a
drop in the rate of domestic tax refunds on exports, China's trade
volume exceeded 289 billion US dollars in 1996, representing an
increase of 3.2 percent over the 1995 figure, and a balance
between imports and exports was maintained.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, international tourism brought more than 10 billion US
dollars, while direct foreign investment continued to grow, with
actual investment amounting to over 40 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Talking about new achievements China made in science and
technology, education and other aspects of social development,
Li said that over 2,000 major scientific and technological
advances were officially recognized by the ministries and
commissions concerned.
</P>
<P>
He added that continued efforts were made to expand compulsory
education. By the end of 1996, the goal of nine-year compulsory
education had been accomplished by and large in 50 percent of the
counties (city districts and cities at the county level)
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the living standards of urban and rural people
continued to improve last year. Rural poverty-stricken population
decreased by seven million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita income for living expenses reached over
4,300 yuan for city dwellers, an increase of 3.3 percent over 1995
in real terms; while the average per capita net income of rural
residents exceeded 1,900 yuan, an increase of nine percent over
1995 in real terms, the biggest increase in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that savings deposits of urban and rural
residents topped 3,850 billion yuan at the end of 1996, an
increase of more than 880 billion yuan from a year before. Urban
employment rose by over seven million people, while new housing
for urban and rural inhabitants totaling 1.1 billion sq m of
floor space was completed.
</P>
<P>
After summarizing last year's achievements, Li pointed out that
there still exist quite a few conflicts and problems in the midst
of economic development, and there are also shortcomings and
defects in the work of the government.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the foundation on which macroeconomic
stability is built is still not solid, and unsound aspects of the
economic structure are apparent. And the agricultural
foundation is still fragile.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that a certain number of state-owned
enterprises are experiencing difficulties in production and
operation and losses are on the rise. There was an increase in the
number of enterprises which suspended production completely or
partially, causing an increase in unemployment. And corruption and
other undesirable phenomena remain serious problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier called on governments at all levels to do their
utmost to find solutions in days to come.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said in Beijing
today that the Chinese government will continue to gear the work
of science and technology to the main arena of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to do a successful job in the development and
application of technology, in research on high and new
technologies and their related industries, and in basic scientific
research, to help bring about a shift in the mode of economic
growth," Li told the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress, which opened here today, in his government work report.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government would focus on the research
and exploitation of applied technology, decide on key scientific
and technological projects in light of market demand and the needs
of key state projects, and accelerate the development of new
technologies and products and the formation of new industries, so
as to meet the demand of technical upgrading in enterprises,
readjustment of the industrial structure, and social development.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that China would propagate the use of advanced
and applicable technology in all aspects of agricultural
production, develop high and new technologies and related
industries, and speed up the research and development of
electronic information, biology, new materials, new sources of
energy, the sea, the environment, astronautics, aeronautics and
other fields.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government would also work for promoting the
commercialization and application in production of scientific and
technological achievements, and for upgrading the country's
traditional industries with high and new technologies, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would strengthen basic research, particularly in fields on
the cutting edge of science and technology, and strive to make
breakthroughs in fields where we have been doing well," he said,
adding that continuous efforts should be made to deepen the reform
of management systems in science and technology, optimize the
structure, and encourage the flow of talented people, so as to
give full play to the role of China's existing scientific and
technological contingents.

<HEADLINE> China Keen on Re-employment of Displaced Workers (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China will make keen efforts to
resolve the re-employment of displaced workers and to promote
reforms in the social security system, Premier Li Peng said today.
</P>
<P>
"Actively solving the re-employment problem is an important
channel to improving people's living standard and safeguarding
social stability," Li told the Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress, which opened today in the Great Hall
of the People.
</P>
<P>
As China'a restructure of its state-owned enterprises,
enterprise mergers and bankruptcies have displaced some workers,
prompting the government to take earnest measures for
re-employment of reduced workers.
</P>
<P>
"For some enterprises operating at a loss, provided they employ
workers in accordance with production needs and provided they can
increase efficiency while reducing their staff, we shall reduce or
exempt them from interest on government loans as appropriate,
assist the redundant workers in finding placement in other trades
and assist those who are laid off in finding new jobs," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In light of specific conditions, all localities should
establish re-employment funds out of contributions from local
finance, enterprises and social security funds, the premier urged.
</P>
<P>
"We should create more job opportunities, provide better
vocational training for employment, assist the laid off employees
in revising their job-seeking ideas and encourage them to find new
jobs on their own," he said.
</P>
<P>
And we should continue to encourage and help private and other
sectors of the economy to grow soundly and ensure that they play a
positive role in the modernization drive."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China shall introduce a unified system for basic
old-age insurance for employees and expand coverage.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we shall study ways to establish
supplementary old-age insurance for employees in enterprises and
trades where conditions permit," Li told the session. "In the
reform of the medical security system, we should focus on the
experiment in over 50 cities and continue to improve unemployment
insurance and work injury insurance."
</P>
<P>
Effort should be made to properly manage all types of social
security funds and improve services, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
At present, a system for ensuring a minimum standard of living
has been instituted in over 1200 cities, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major step taken to guarantee the basic needs of the
people, a form of social security that conforms to China's
conditions. We should improve the system step by step," He said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua)-- China will expedite the shift of
the economic structure and the mode of economic growth
conscientiously to ensure stability and maintain a sustained,
rapid and sound development of the national economy and promote
social development in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng made this remark at the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, which falls in 36 pages and 17,000 Chinese
characters, is divided into seven parts. Based on reviewing the
government work last year, Li Peng concentrated on such topics as
economic development, reform of the state-owned enterprises and
social development.
</P>
<P>
The report also elaborated such issues as to ensure smooth
transfer of political power and a smooth transition in Hong Kong,
to promote the reunification of the motherland and the foreign
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said the year 1996 was the first year in implementation of
the Outlined Ninth Five-Year Plan and Long-Range Objectives
through the Year 2010. Under the leadership of the Communist Party
of China, he said, the people of all nationalities in China
united, worked hard and achieved fresh success in the reform,
opening up and the modernization drive, making a good start for
the accomplishment of the magnificent cross-century program.
</P>
<P>
A salient feature of China's economic development in 1996 was
the continued growth in national economy and inflation under
control. The gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 9.7 percent
over the previous year and price rises dropped from 14.8 percent
to 6.1 percent, much lower than the planned target for
macro-control.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China's economic restructuring progressed steadily and
the country continued to open wider to the outside world. New
achievements were recorded in science, technology, education and
in all other social undertakings. The standard of living of urban
and rural people continued to improve.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese premier also pointed out there still exist
quite a few conflicts and problems in the midst of economic
development and public activities, and there are also shortcomings
and deficiencies in the work of the government.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Disagrees on How Fast to Free Air Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN transport ministers have
failed to agree at a meeting held Friday in Chiang Mai, northern
Thailand, on the pace by which they will liberalize air service
policy in the region, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Transport and Communications Minister Suwat Liptapallop
was quoted as saying that Brunei and Singapore pushed for faster
liberalization, probably by the year 2000, while Malaysia, the
Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand wanted a more gradual
approach.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of air service was the dominant issue at the
meeting of ASEAN transport ministers.
</P>
<P>
Suwat said there are shortcomings to liberalize air service.
That is, for example, one member state that has only one airport
would benefit from flying to others such as Indonesia where there
are many airports, he said.
</P>
<P>
A conference source said Vietnamese officials, whose country
joined ASEAN only two years ago and is in the very first step of
economic liberalization, did not want the issue to be discussed at
all.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement issued at the end of the
meeting, the ministers assigned senior officials to study and
recommend "appropriate levels and a timeframe" for the free flow
of air service within and between ASEAN sub-regions to promote
tourism sectors.
</P>
<P>
A Thai official said that the first stage of cooperation should
be "limited" open sky policy, which designates certain airports
for take off.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the transport ministers agreed with Thailand's
proposal to establish a linkage of national highways among ASEAN
states to facilitate freer trade in the region, Suwat said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the issue will be officially discussed when they
meet next time in September in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal initiated by Thailand, national highways,
some of which are not yet connected throughout the ASEAN and
Southeast Asian mainland in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, should be linked.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also agreed to assign economic and transport
officials to look into matters concerning the freer flow of goods
into the region, Suwat said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The problems referred to by Li Peng include: the foundation on
which macro-economic stability relies is still not consolidated
enough and unsound aspects of the economic structure are eminent.
The basis of agriculture is still fragile and the quality and
performance of the national economy as a whole remains relatively
poor.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing a fairly big pressure from population and
employment issues. Some state-owned enterprises are having
difficulties in production and operation and losses are on the
rise," he added.
</P>
<P>
Li also said that some more enterprises have completely or
partially suspended production, leading to a rise in the number of
laid-off workers. Central finance is confronted with considerable
difficulties; the relationship between income and distribution has
yet to be straightened out; corruption and other undersirable
phenomena remain serious problems, and bureaucratism, formalism
and proneness to boasting and exaggeration are spreading among
some government functionaries; public security is not good in some
areas. Li Peng called for attention to these issues.
</P>
<P>
After citing the above problems, Li Peng devoted two thirds of
his report to elaborating the goals set by the Chinese government
for this year's economic and social development and measures to be
adopted to solve the existing problems.
</P>
<P>
China has fixed the economic growth rate for the year 1996 at
eight percent as the target for macro-economic control and make
sure that price rise ranges are lower than they actually were last
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
To this purposed, Li said, China will continue to give priority
to strengthening agriculture, maintain a reasonable scale of
investment and intensify structural readjustment and strive to
continue carrying out appropriately tight financial and monetary
policies. Moreover, efforts will be made to open the country wider
to the outside world and keep improving the standard of living of
the people in urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The reform of state-owned enterprises has been listed as the
priority task in economic restructuring in 1997 and a pressing
task for the Chinese government, he said. The Chinese premier
dedicated more than one sixth of the report to this issue, which
has been rarely seen in government reports in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Li acknowledged that China will closely combine reform,
reorganization and upgrading with better management, manage large
enterprises and conglomerates well and adopt a flexible policy
towards small ones and take different measures for deal with
varied situations. "All this should be done in order to achieve
pragmatic and effective results in reforming and developing
state-owned enterprises," he said.

<HEADLINE> Albania's Economic Situation Serious, Says PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister
Aleksander Meksi on Thursday described the country's economic
situation as serious.
</P>
<P>
Meksi made the remark at a special meeting of the People's
Assembly (parliament) which was discussing the bad social and
economic situation which had arisen from fake fund raisings
beginning in 1992 when the Democratic Party came into power.
</P>
<P>
Albania's situation was deteriorating because of the fake fund
raising. It had led to increases in budget deficits and the
inflation rate, and the fast devaluation of the country's
currency, said Meksi.
</P>
<P>
Albania hoped to get financial aid from the European Union
(EU), and was eager to sign three year loan agreements with the
International Monetary Fund, which should have been signed last
November.
</P>
<P>
But visiting EU officials said that aid to Albania would depend
on the development of the country's political and economic
situation.

<P>
The six measures set forth by the premier include: concentrate
on rejuvenating large enterprises and enterprise groups; give
small state-owned enterprises still greater freedom; standardize
bankruptcy procedures, encourage merger of enterprises and promote
re-employment; increase capital and reduce debts through various
channels; conscientiously strengthen the operation and management
of enterprises; strive to help enterprises eliminate losses and
increase profits and vigorously promote the reform of the social
security system.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to improve socialist culture and socialist
ethics with a view to promoting coordinated economic and social
development," said Li, who also vows to make great strides in
science and technology, education, culture, public health and
sports as well as environmental protection and family and
development of socialist ethics.
</P>
<P>
Safeguarding social and political stability is indispensable to
the modernization drive in China, he said. In 1997, China will
improve all facets of public security, make greater, in-depth
efforts to combat corruption and to keep government employers
honest and industrious. Efforts will also be made to consolidate
and develop great ethnic unity, accelerate the modernization of
national defense and develop socialist democracy, improve the
socialist legal system and run state affairs according to law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Hong Kong issue, Li Peng urged to ensure a
smooth transfer of government and a smooth transition in Hong
Kong, and said that all preparations for Hong Kong's return to the
motherland are being made in an orderly way.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the issue of Taiwan, Li Peng said China will settle
disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits through
political negotiations between the two sides and gradually achieve
the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report, the Chinese premier also set
forth China's basic policies in diplomatic work and the
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
To conclude his report, Li said, China will carry forward at
Deng Xiaoping's behests under the leadership of the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at is core, unite as one and advance in
a pioneering spirit to carry forward the great cause initiated by
Deng Xiaoping and achieve new successes in reform, opening up and

At 9:10 a.m., Premier Li Peng started delivering his report on
the work of the government.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1996 was the first year for implementing the ninth
five-year national plan for economic and social development and
the long-term goals for the year 2010, when new progress was made
in China's reform, opening up and modernization drive, and a good
start was made for the accomplishment of the cross-century
program.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1997, China will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong and the Communist Party of China will
convene its 15th national congress. These are two events of
far-reaching significance. Guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and adhering to
the basic line and policies of the CPC, Chinese people should
speed up economic restructuring and a shift in the mode of
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
China should ensure stability and maintain a sustained, rapid
and sound development of its national economy, and promote social
development in an all-round way, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report, Li Peng set the rate of economic
growth in 1997 at eight percent. He said efforts should be made to
ensure that inflation in 1997 will be slightly lower than that of
last year.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these objectives, Li stressed that the government
will continue to give priority to agriculture, maintain a
reasonable scale of investment, intensify structural readjustment,
keep carrying out appropriately tight financial and monetary
policies, strive to open wider to the outside world and further
improve the living standards of people in urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng listed reform of state-owned enterprises as another
priority this year and a pressing task for the government, saying
that greater stride must be made to reform the state-owned
sector.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the state-owned sector takes up more than one sixth
of the government work report, unprecedented in history.

Giving a comprehensive consideration to the need to
accelerate economic growth and to the feasibility in terms of
financial and material resources, Li noted, the central
government has set the following objectives for macroeconomic
control this year: a total investment of 2,530 billion yuan in
fixed assets at an investment rate of 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the investment should continue to favor
agriculture and water conservancy projects, to favor
infrastructural facilities, basic industries and pillar
industries which receive major support from the state, to favor
the central and western parts of the country, to favor
technological upgrading, and to favor the fields of science,
technology and education.

avoid "large and all-inclusive" or "small and all-inclusive"
projects as well as duplicated construction.
</P>
<P>
"No project should be approved if production capacity in that
field is already excessive, and those already under construction
shall be carefully checked," he said, adding that reform of the
investment system should be accelerated and more effective
measures be taken to minimize investment risks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would work out plans for
structural readjustment and technological upgrading, and provide
guidance for enterprises so that they may adapt their production
to market needs and enhance their market competitiveness.
</P>

"Emphasis should be placed on expansion of the service
industry, and on tourism and the information industry, while

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said today in
Beijing that China in 1997 will continue to maintain a sustained,
rapid, and sound development of the national economy, fix the
economic growth rate at 8 percent as the target for macroeconomic
control, and make sure that price rises are a little lower than
they actually were last year.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report to the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress, which started here today, Li
told the legislators that in order to maintain a good momentum of
growth in the national economy, the Chinese government will focus
on scoring success in the following five aspects of work:
</P>
<P>
-- Continue to give priority to strengthening agriculture in
the economic work.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the government would try to stabilize the area of
land sown to grain and cotton, take precautions against droughts
and floods, prevent grain production from decreasing, and promote
the all-round development of farming, forestry, animal husbandry,
sideline production, and fishery to increase farmers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
"We should maintain and improve the household responsibility
contract system with remuneration linked to outputs as well as the
two-tier operation system that combines unified management with
independent management," he said, adding that the grain
circulation system should be further reformed and the protective
pricing system further improved with a view to encouraging farmers
to produce.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will make every effort to
facilitate a system of grain circulation, try by every means to
use as little land as possible in urban and rural construction,
and strictly control non-agricultural use of farmland.
</P>
<P>
He also said that it is an urgent task to strengthen the
construction of water conservancy facilities, establish central
and local water conservancy construction funding to increase input
in this field.
</P>
<P>
"We should also strengthen the development, comprehensive use
and management of water resources, vigorously develop water-saving
irrigation and dry-land farming, and combine flood control with
drought-relief," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Strong Earthquake Shocks Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- At least 47 people were killed
and about 125 others injured in the earthquake which jolted
central Pakistan early Friday.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, which measured 6.3 and 7.3 on the Richter scale
and hit Quetta valley and other parts of northern Baluchistan
province at about 2:10 a.m. Friday, was one of the worst in 62
years.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the Pakistan Meteorological, the
epicenter of the earthquake was 140 kilometers east of
Baluchistan's capital city of Quetta and it was felt in most of
the province and some parts of Sindh province.
</P>
<P>
Emergency was declared in Quetta immediately after the shocks
which lasted for over one minute.
</P>
<P>
Hernai, a sub-division of Sibi division of Baluchistan, is the
worst affected area with 38 people dead and dozens injured.
</P>
<P>
The falling boulders from the mountains after the earthquake
have blocked the Sibi-Hernai road, cutting off Hernai's road links
with other areas.
</P>
<P>
Army troops have been called out in Quetta city to carry out
rescue operations along with the civil administration.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari and Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Friday expressed their profound grief and shock over the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
They asked the federal and provincial governments to take all
possible relief measures and provided urgent medical aid to the
victims.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations are still going on.
</P>
<P>
Loss of lives and damage to property could be much more as some
of the affected areas are inaccessible.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Reform a Focus of Economic Restructuring: Li Peng (44) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- State-owned enterprise reform is a
focal point of China's economic restructuring this year and a
pressing task for the government, Premier Li Peng said today.
</P>
<P>
China will make greater strides to reform state-owned
enterprises this year, Li told the Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress, the country's top legislature which
opened its annual meeting in the Great Hall of the People this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of the state revenue comes from state-owned
enterprises and two-thirds of the employees in cities and towns
work in state-owned enterprises, according to Li, who said that
state-owned enterprises dominate the fields of infrastructure,
basic industry and high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
"The state sector of the economy has made a tremendous
contribution to the reform, development and stability of the
country," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
However, a number of state-owned enterprises are confronted
with difficulties and problems to varying degrees, he told the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He added that one major cause is the management system, the way
the state firms operate and the concepts held by the managerial
staff are not compatible with a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Other major reasons for the difficulties and problems of the
state-owned enterprises include: structural readjustment does not
conform to changes in market demand and state-owned enterprises,
especially old enterprises and old industrial bases, have become
less potent in the market competition owing to heavy liabilities,
social burdens and over-staffing.
</P>
<P>
Li cited President Jiang Zemin as pointing out that the reform
and development of state-owned enterprises is not only a major
economic issue having a bearing on the overall development of the
national economy, but also a major political issue which is of
vital importance for the destiny of the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has stepped its effort aimed at
reforming state-owned enterprises and some measures have begun to
produce good results, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
"Our economic development is gaining momentum, economic reform
is deepening, and all sectors of society have recognized the
urgency and difficulty of the task of reforming enterprises," he
said.
</P>
<P>
We are convinced that we will be able to do a good job in the
reform and development of state-owned enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Li revealed that one major step China will take this year to
reform the state-owned enterprises is concentrating first on
rejuvenating 1,000 large state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 of the enterprises were given special financial
support by banks last year. This year the number of such
enterprises will reach 511.
</P>
<P>
The government has been experimenting with 57 enterprise groups
and will expand the experiment to 120 groups this year in order to
develop trans-regional and inter-trade enterprise groups which
combine industrial production, technological development and
trade, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Other substantial measures for state-owned enterprises include
giving small state-owned enterprises greater freedom,
standardizing bankruptcy procedures, encouraging merging of
enterprises and promoting re-employment, raising the number of
cities to experiment with capital structure optimization from 58
to 110, increase enterprises' capital and reduce their debts
through various channels, and strengthening the operation and
management of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"It should be our long-term basic policy to retain a dominant
position for public ownership and to develop diversified economic
sectors simultaneously," Li said, adding that the public sector of
the economy is comprised of state and collective enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"While reforming and developing state enterprises, we should
actively develop different forms of collective enterprises in
urban and rural areas. We should continue to encourage and help
private and other sectors of the economy to grow soundly and
ensure that they play a positive role in the modernization drive,"
he said.

and economic problems which immediately affect the people's
interests, and do their best to help relieve the people's worries

BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The policy of "one country, two
systems" will be crowned with success, Hong Kong will maintain
long-term prosperity and stability, and the future of Hong Kong
will be even brighter with the support of all the Chinese people
and through the joint efforts of the more than six million people
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This remark was made by Premier Li Peng at the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government will resume the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong and establish the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This will mark the beginning of a new era in the history of
Hong Kong, which is a great joy for our compatriots both at home
and abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980's, Deng Xiaoping proposed the concept of "one
country, two systems", pointing out clearly the direction for the
settlement of the Hong Kong issue. For over ten years, the Chinese
Government has done a great deal of work on the return of Hong
Kong to the motherland, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, he said, the Chinese and British governments
officially signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration. In 1990, the
Third Session of the Seventh National People's Congress adopted
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of
the People's Republic of China. The Preliminary Working Committee
of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region was established in July 1993. The
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region was established in January 1996 to take charge of affairs
regarding the establishment of the HKSAR.

of the HKSAR. The Provisional Legislative of the HKSAR was also
elected and established.
</P>
<P>
There are only 122 days left until Hong Kong is returned to the
motherland, and all preparations are being made in an orderly
fashion. After China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong, he said the Chinese government will adhere to the policy of
"one country, two systems" and implement the Basic Law
conscientiously, so as to ensure that the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong people will govern Hong Kong, and the current social
and economic systems and way of life in Hong Kong will remain
unchanged. Hong Kong will retain its status as a free port and as
an international financial, trade and shipping center," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng pointed out in a little over two years, on December 20,
1999, the Chinese Government will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao. Preparations for the transfer of
government in Macao are progressing smoothly. He expressed his
belief that on the basis of friendly cooperation between China and
Portugal, a smooth transfer of government in Macao will surely be
realized.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Taiwan Issue (28) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng called on the
Taiwan authorities to return to the principled position of one
China, stop all activities in the international arena aimed at
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and refrain from
creating any new obstacles to relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC), which opened this morning, Li said over the past
year, personal contacts have increased and economic and cultural
exchanges have continued to develop between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits, with significant results achieved in the struggle
against the splitting of China and the "independence of Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
However, he said, due to obstruction and sabotage by forces
trying to split China, there have been some twists and turns in
contacts across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government will adhere to the basic policy
of "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems" and
carry out in an all-round way the eight-point proposal on
developing relations across the Taiwan Straits and promoting the
peaceful reunification of the motherland put forward by President
Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the one-China principle, the Chinese government
will settle disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits
through political negotiations between the two sides and gradually
achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland. It will
continue to promote personal contacts and all kinds of exchanges
and cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits and
try to realize direct links for postal, flight and shipping
services and trade at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out regardless of how they change the political
system of Taiwan, the Taiwan authorities should be aware that they
cannot change such a fact generally recognized by the
international community that Taiwan is a part of China.
</P>
<P>
He said the reunification of the motherland is an irreversible
historical trend, and any attempt at splitting China or at the
secession of Taiwan from China will meet with the firm opposition
of the entire Chinese people, including the compatriots in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that so long as we persist in reunification, oppose
splitting, increase understanding and iron out differences in
compliance with the fundamental interest of the Chinese nation,
the relations across the Taiwan Straits will develop continuously
and the great cause of reunification of the motherland will
definitely be achieved," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Made Quicker Steps in Application of Scientific Results(30) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China has quickens its steps in
applying scientific and technological results into industrial
production, and the development of the high and new technology
sector.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists produced more than 2000 scientific and
technological results recognized as key national ones in 1996,
said Premier Li Peng when delivering the government report to
the opening meeting of the ongoing Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress today.
</P>
<P>
The results focused on agriculture, natural resources
prospecting, chief raw materials, major equipment, energy,
transportation, new technologies, the light and textile
industries, and social development.
</P>
<P>
Eighty out of ten new seed varieties in use are the results of
scientific and technological projects, which add more than 30
billion kg of rice, wheat, and corn. And the productivity medium-
and low-yield fields in the dry land in north China, the Loess
Plateau, areas troubled with soil erosion, and hilly land in south
China were improved.
</P>
<P>
Scientific and technological development created the condition
for China to have an autarkic grain supply.
</P>
<P>
Energy shortage is a major problem long troubling the Chinese
economy. Advanced technologies were applied in coal mining, oil
exploitation and power generation with nuclear energy, which
remarkably improved the general standards of energy utilization.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to scientific and technological progress, China has made
new breakthroughs in oil and gas exploration and comprehensive use
of non-ferrous metals. Nine large and medium oil and gas fields,
with reserves amounting to 500 million tons and 600 billion cu m
respectively, have been discovered in the Tarim Basin in northwest
China.
</P>
<P>
New technologies are being used on some railways, and the speed
of passenger trains has been elevated to 140 km per hour; while
tremendous economic efficiency have also been achieved in light
industry, with new techniques applied in production of integrated
circuits, computer systems and softwares, telecommunications
equipment and program controlled systems.
</P>
<P>
Adoption of new technologies has doubled the sewage disposal
capacity of Chinese cities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China hopes to further improve and
develop its relations with Western countries on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, Chinese Premier Li Peng
said today.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report delivered this morning at the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), Li said
relations between China and Western countries have improved in
general, and positive results have been achieved in China's
mutually-beneficial cooperation with European countries in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-U.S. relations had undergone relatively large
setbacks but are now evidencing a trend towards improvement and
development.
</P>
<P>
He said Sino-Japanese relations were once obstructed and
expressed the wish to see a normal development of relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said China wishes to see further improvement in Sino-U.S.
relations and the strengthening of Sino-European relations.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Western countries will benefit from an improved
and further developed relationship, and different views and
divergences on some issues should not become an obstacle to the
development of state-to-state relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is opposed to interfering in the internal affairs of
other countries, and stands for seeking common ground while
setting aside differences and for lessening differences and
expanding cooperation through more dialogue and exchanges, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Calls on People to Vote in May 29 Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto has
called on people to vote in the May 29 general election,
describing it as an opportunity to determine the course of the
nation's development, including its leadership.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with prospective Haj pilgrims in Boyolali,
Central Java, Friday, he said that he was prepared to step down,
if that was what the people wanted, The Jakarta Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that any move to unseat him must be made
through the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), and that he
would "clobber" anyone who tried through unconstitutional means.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said that according to the 1945 constitution,
sovereignty lies in the hands of the people, through their elected
representatives in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
People who do not cast their votes, will have no one but
themselves to blame, he said. "It's their own fault if they regret
it later that they cannot influence the course of development."
</P>
<P>
His remarks came amid a debate over whether or not it was
obligatory for people to vote in the general election.
</P>
<P>
While there is no law compelling anyone to vote, a high turnout
has always been considered a success for the government.
</P>
<P>
Turnout in past elections has always exceeded 90 percent of the
total registered voters in the country.
</P>
<P>
This year, 125 million people have been registered as voters in
the election that will be contested by the dominant political
group Golkar, the United Development Party (PPP) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI).
</P>
<P>
The three political parties will contest 425 of the 500 seats
in the House of Representatives. The remaining 75 seats are
reserved for the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> China to Reduce Illiteracy by Four Million (18) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China will reduce illiteracy by
four million among the young and middle-aged in 1997, Li Peng,
premier of the State Council, said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report delivered at the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which opened this
morning, Li said the Chinese government will continue to lay
stress on elementary education, devote major efforts to expanding
nine-year compulsory education and enhance literacy work.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, half of all counties (city districts
and cities at the county level) throughout the country had
basically popularized nine-year compulsory education by the end of
1996.
</P>
<P>
The NPC in 1986 enacted Compulsory Education Law, which
provides that nine-year compulsory education be basically
popularized and illiteracy basically eliminated throughout the
country at the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Li said China also recorded gratifying progress in vocational
education. Students in vocational schools account for 56.8 percent
of those eligible for senior secondary school education and the
number of vocational training institutions came to more than
400,000. New strides were made in the reform of the higher
education management system, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Follow Environment, Family Planning Policies (19) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said today
that China will conscientiously carry out the basic state policies
of environmental protection and family planning.
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between economic development and the
environment, population and resources must be correctly handled,"
Li said at the opening of the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
China should tighten environmental supervision and management
according to law, cope with serious pollution in major valleys,
regions and industries and improve the quality of drinking water
for people and livestock, he said.
</P>
<P>
" We should pay great attention to building urban pollution
control facilities to reduce pollution caused by waste water,
waste gases, other wastes and noise. We should protect and
appropriately develop sea, forest, grassland, mineral, biological
and other natural resources in accordance with the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for efforts to actively expand afforestation, speed
up the plantation of shelter forests by the Yellow River, Liaohe
River, Pearl River, Haihe River and Taihu Lake valleys, and carry
on with the Northeast, North and Northwest China Shelter Forest
Project and the similar project in the upper and middle reaches of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"We should not slacken our efforts in family planning as the
years go by," Li said, adding that China's goal in birth control
is to keep the total population under 1.3 billion by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China will adhere to and improve the system under
which governments at all levels are responsible for attaining
given objectives in birth control, give priority to family
planning in rural areas and among the floating population and
combine family planning with efforts to assist farmers to shake
off poverty, the premier said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Tradition of Diligence and Frugality (20) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today called
on the Chinese people to "vigorously develop the fine tradition of
building the country thriftly and diligently," which he said is a
"major guarantee" for the country's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report to the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress, which opened in Beijing today,
Li said that the development of socialist ethics is essential to
promoting the cultural and ideological progress, and plays a
tremendous role in promoting our modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said that in building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, apart from a thriving economy and a perfected
democracy and legal system, it is also necessary to foster a good
moral character among the people.
</P>
<P>
"We should persist in conducting education in patriotism,
collectivism and socialism in a down-to-earth manner, do
ideological and political work well, carry forward revolutionary
traditions and the fine traditions of the Chinese nation,
emphasize the importance of education in social, occupational and
family ethics, and foster the common ideal of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on people across the country to learn from a dozen
model figures including Kong Fansen, Ma Enhua, Li Guo'an, Xu Hu,
Qiu Eguo, Li Suli, Wu Jinyin, Tian Peifa, Tan Yan and Wu
Tianxiang.
</P>
<P>
"We should learn from their spirit of devotion to work and
their lofty values, and help foster a fine climate of learning
from role models, stressing the importance of devotion to duty,
and encouraging healthy trends in the whole society," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China is a developing country that needs a long period
of hard work to overcome backwardness. However, phenomena of
extravagance, waste and ostentation have become worse, and
constituted serious problems.
</P>
<P>
"We must vigorously develop the fine tradition of building the
country and running everything thriftly and diligently, which is
an important aspect of our endeavor to promote cultural and
ideological progress, and a major guarantee for pushing forward
our modernization drive," he said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Crime Crackdown (21) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said in Beijing
today that China will continue its current crackdown on crimes,
which has lasted nearly a year, to achieve the further improvement
of the social security.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report to the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress, which started here today, Li
said that the comprehensive control of public security is an
important issue that must be seriously dealt with.
</P>
<P>
"The past year has witnessed fairly good results in the
large-scale struggle to severely crack down on criminal
activities. The current situation in public security, however, is
not so gratifying," he said, adding that the central government
would continue to take effective measures to concentrate on
combating violent crimes, drug-related crimes, hoodlums and
underground gangsters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would resolutely wipe out social
evils, such as pornography, gambling, and drug abuse and
trafficking, and punish those who organize, operate or protect
prostitution activities and the production or peddling of
pornography.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he noted, there has been a rising trend in the
number of cases of economic crimes, which should be guarded
against and severely cracked down upon.
</P>
<P>
"We should also punish according to law such crimes as
smuggling, manufacture and distribution of fake or shoddy
products, financial swindling and other crimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to point out that it is necessary to analyse the new
situations and problems encountered in public security work,
correctly handle contradictions among the people, and mediate
various kinds of civil disputes and disputes on economic matters
according to law, so as to eliminate factors contributing to
social instability.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that personnel in the procuratorial,
judicial and public security departments must improve their
competence politically and professionally, observe discipline,
handle matters impartially, and strictly enforce the law.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue Fight against Corruption (22) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China will make greater endeavors
to combat corruption and to keep government employees honest and
industrious, Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the government work report he delivered to the Fifth Session
of the Eighth National People's Congress, Li said that leading
cadres should take the lead in strictly following the relevant
regulations requiring them to perform their duties honestly, to be
self-disciplined and to conscientiously subject themselves to
supervision and examination.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that public servants should foster the concept of
serving the people whole-heartedly and raise their ideological and
political level and their professional competence.
</P>
<P>
"They should plunge deeply into the realities of life, do
investigative work, work diligently, improve their efficiency,
avoid a bureaucratic work style and become public servants with
whom the people will be satisfied," said the premier.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that more efforts should be made to handle criminal
cases, and major ones in particular.
</P>
<P>
He added, "we should concentrate on investigating and
prosecuting leading organs, law enforcement departments, economic
management departments and leading cadres at and above the county
(section chief) level that violate the law or discipline.
</P>
<P>
"We should seriously handle cases involving leaders in
state-owned enterprises who squander and embezzle state property
as well as cases involving legal persons who violate laws and
discipline or grossly misappropriate state assets. Those who abuse
their power for personal gain, commit bribery or accept bribes
must, without fail and regardless of rank, be punished according
to law."
</P>
<P>
The premier voiced the government's determination to handle
harshly with malpractice in government departments, trades and
professions, which are particularly repugnant to the people, and
to achieve fresh results in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts should be made to strengthen supervision over law
enforcement, and we should prosecute those who seriously neglect
their duties," said the premier.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Coffee Still Over 2-Dollar Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Colombian coffee
continued its "mini-boom" Thursday when it passed the two-dollar
mark on the New York Stock Exchange, to be quoted at 2.02 dollars
a pound.
</P>
<P>
The domestic price of a 125 kilo load last Friday increased to
310,230 pesos (a little more than 310 U.S. dollars), and another
considerable rise is expected today, after the good results
obtained in the market in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The last time the Colombian bean was quoted above the
two-dollar mark on the international market was November 10,
1994. Then the prices presented considerable recoveries following
a cold spell in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
International quotations during the first two months of 1997
show that a rapid recovery started January 15.
</P>
<P>
Coffee market analysts consider this price rise is due to a
supply shortage among several of the main suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has faced serious difficulties since last January
because of a labor conflict in the port of Buenaventura, which
developed into a labor stoppage until February 23.
</P>
<P>
New York Stock Exchange operators were alarmed by the stoppage
of state workers in the second week of February, and prices rose
again.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the market has been influenced by a supply
reduction by Central American countries, as well as by the drop in
the coffee harvest of Brazil, the first producer of the grain in
the world.
</P>
<P>
It has been observed too that the announcement made by coffee
producing countries about reducing the world offer supply by 1.3
million 60-kilo-bags for this half year, was reflected in a
reaction to the rise in the prices of the grain of coffee.
</P>
<P>
The National Coffee Growers Committee (CNC) decided to increase
by 12 percent the domestic price for the 125 kilo load, compared
to what had been in force since the first week of December. With
that the internal price rose from 221,000 pesos to 248,125 pesos
and the internal price was readjusted at 16.87 percent when it
passed from 248,125 pesos to 290,000 pesos. On that occasion the
CNC announced that starting Friday 21 the weekly automatic
fixation system would start to operate.

performance of the Chinese economy in 1996, Chinese Premier Li
Peng told legislators here today.
</P>
<P>
Li made the assessment when delivering his government work
report at the opening meeting of the Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
China's inflation rate, which reached 14.8 percent in 1995,
dropped to 6.1 percent last year, four percentage points lower
than the initial target, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that price hikes had been a major problem for
the Chinese economy for years, and the falling inflation rate last
year showed that the government has improved the environment for
economic performance as a whole, safeguarded the interests of
consumers and created conditions conducive to lowering interest
rates, reducing production costs for enterprises and decreasing
financial subsidies by the state.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, the government should by no means
relax control over price rises, as pressure from inflation still
exists. To rationalize prices is a long-term task which requires
both a positive attitude and a reliable approach, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should rigorously limit the number and range of items
subject to this year's price readjustments and set objectives by
taking into consideration the financial capability of all sectors
of the society so as to avoid significant untoward repercussions,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will continue to implement the
responsibility system to attain objectives in price readjustment
and control, and further tighten supervision over and control of
market prices.

<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC), the supreme organ of power in China, started
convening its fifth general session, the last during its term of
office, in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Close to 3,000 deputies to the NPC from across the country
gathered in the Great Hall of the People to hear a report on the
work of the government by Premier Li Peng of the State
Council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li

</P>
<P>
Following the ceremony, Qiao said that on the eve of the
session, China's respected and beloved Deng Xiaoping passed away
unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
The passing away of Deng Xiaoping has been an immeasurable loss
to the Party, the army and people of all ethnic groups, Qiao said.
He called for all the NPC deputies to turn grief into strength,
carry work forward at the behest of Deng Xiaoping and unite
closely around the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core, hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
adhere to the Party's basic line, in order to advance steadily the
great undertakings of socialist reform, opening up and
modernization drive pioneered by Deng.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Qiao, all present stood up in silent mourning
for Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,800 members of the National Committee of the
Chinese people's Political Consultative Conference and those in

<TEXT>
<P>
China's GDP exceeded 6,770 billion yuan in 1996, according to
the premier, an increase of 9.7 percent over the previous year as
calculated in terms of comparable prices.
</P>
<P>
He noted that government revenue increased considerably last
year, with local revenue exceeding expenditures and central
deficits kept within budgetary targets. The financial situation
was stable, and currency issue was kept under control. State
foreign exchange reserves exceeded 100 billion US dollars and the
exchange rate for the RMB remained stable.
</P>
<P>
Reporting on agriculture, Premier Li told the deputies that
total grain output amounted to more than 480 billion kilograms.
</P>
<P>
By tapping the potential and upgrading technology, Li told the
deputies, the iron and steel industry improved its product mix,
and the steel output topped 100 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Investment in fixed assets came to 2,360 billion yuan, an
increase of 18.2 percent over the 1995 figure, and the investment
structure was improved, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said that construction of key projects was further
strengthened. Investment in the central and western parts of the
country accounted for over 43 percent of total state investment in
incipient key projects.
</P>
<P>
Citing progress made in the construction of key national
projects, Li said that the Beijing-Kowloon Railway running through
north and south China was put into operation; expressways with a
total length of more than 1,100 km were completed and opened to
traffic; more than 15 million kw of power-generating capacity was
added and the number of telephone lines increased by over 20 million;
the Nanning-Kunming Railway will soon be completed; and
construction of the third-phase expansion project of the Baoshan
Iron and Steel Company and other important projects was
progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
These projects will play an important role in readjusting the
industrial structure, promoting coordinated regional development
and increasing staying power for continued national economic
development, the premier said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Reform and Opening Up  (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said today in
Beijing that in 1996 economic restructuring progressed steadily in
China, and that the country continued to open wider to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Li made these remarks in a report on the work of the government
he delivered at the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year China continued to deepen the reform of
the foreign trade system and the foreign exchange management
system, implemented the proxy system step by step, and gave more
productive enterprises the power to engage in export
independently.
</P>
<P>
"We also realized the convertibility of the RMB under current
accounts and further improved our investment environment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
While lowering the general level of tariffs, he noted, the
Chinese government modified its policy on import tax reductions
and exemptions, and lowered rates for tax refunds on export goods.
</P>
<P>
He said that, despite sharp competition on the international
market and a drop in the rate of domestic tax refunds for export
goods, China's total volume of imports and exports exceeded 289
billion US dollars, an increase of 3.2 per cent over the 1995
figure, and a basic balance between imports and exports was
maintained.
</P>
<P>
"International tourism brought in more than 10 billion US
dollars, and direct foreign investment continued to grow, with
actual investment amounting to over 40 billion US dollars," he
said, adding that more investment was channelled into
infrastructural facilities, basic industries and projects in the
central and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that in 1996 the government stepped up
efforts to reform state-owned enterprises and carried out
experiments on the optimization of the capital structure in 58
cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
"We also accelerated merger and bankruptcy procedures for
enterprises and the dispersion of redundant employees, and stepped
up efforts to rid enterprises of social service functions. The
rates of production and marketing and the amounts of profit and
taxes of large enterprises and enterprise groups rose to some
extent. Enterprises made progress in increasing capital and
reducing debts, with the debt ratio in some enterprises lowered,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about reform of the circulation system, he said that
the state encouraged the development of various modes of operation
and marketing, thus dovetailing production with marketing and
promoting the sale of commodities.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we raised grain purchase prices. The grain reserves
of the state, local authorities and farmers increased
considerably, which will play an important role in making up for
shortages caused by crop failures and in guaranteeing a stable
supply of grain in the future," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Highlights Agriculture (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that China will continue to give priority to strengthening
agriculture in its economic work despite an all-round development
in the rural economy last year.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report to the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress, Li said China will continue to
pay keen attention to agriculture and to the construction of water
conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
"We can never neglect agricultural production, as our country
has a large population but limited arable land and frequently
suffers natural calamities," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the acreage for growing grain and cotton must be
stabilized, adding that China must take precautions against
droughts and floods, prevent grain production from decreasing and
keep up a steady increase in cotton, oil-bearing crops, sugar
crops, meat and aquatic products, so as to promote the all-round
development of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline
production and fishery and increase farmers' incomes.
</P>
<P>
China should maintain and improve the household responsibility
contract system with remuneration linked to output as well as the
two-tier operation system that combines unified management with
independent management, the premier noted.
</P>
<P>
He told the session that the grain circulation system should be
further reformed and the protective pricing system further
improved with a view to encouraging farmers to produce.
</P>
<P>
"We should do a good job in the manufacture and supply of the
means of agricultural production and stabilize their prices," Li
said, adding that China should persist in implementing the system
of provincial governors assuming responsibility for the "rice bag"
and city mayors assuming responsibility for the "market basket".
</P>
<P>
He urged all local governments to earnestly carry out the basic
farmland protection system and to try by every means to use as
little land as possible and strictly control non-agricultural use
of farmland.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is an urgent task for China to strengthen the
construction of water conservancy facilities.
</P>
<P>
"There have been quite severe droughts and floods over the past
few years, " Li said. "Therefore, we should be determined to do
well in water conservancy construction."
</P>
<P>
China shall establish central and local water conservancy
construction funds to increase input in this field, he said.
</P>
<P>
The system of divided responsibility should continue to be
implemented with the state mainly in charge of the treatment of
the main streams of big rivers, local governments in charge of
medium-sized and small rivers and lakes, and municipal governments
in charge of flood prevention in cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, farmers should be organized to involve
themselves in farmland improvement and water conservancy projects
as well as improvement of small drainage areas, the premier added.

<HEADLINE> Rural Poverty-Ridden Population Down Seven Million (5) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-poverty program,
aimed at meeting people's basic need for food and clothing, scored
a major success last year as seven million poor rural residents
bid farewell to absolute poverty, Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest reduction brought China's rural poverty-stricken
population down to 58 million by the end of last year. In 1978,
250 million rural Chinese were living in destitution.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita net income of rural residents last year
exceeded 1,900 yuan, an increase of nine percent over 1995 in real
terms, the biggest increase in the last few years, Li said at the
Fifth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress, which
opened today.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the government's important duty to relieve
poverty in the countryside and provide poverty-ridden rural
residents with necessary help.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's financial allocations for poverty
relief and for development in rural areas will increase
considerably this year, Li promised, urging local governments to
increase their part of financial input.
</P>
<P>
"All the funds must be allocated to their designated places on
time and in full and be used for the benefit of poor villages and
poor farmers," the premier urged.
</P>
<P>
The country's ongoing anti-poverty program aims to let all
poverty-ridden rural Chinese have enough to eat and wear by the
end of this century.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China will maintain a reasonable
scale of investment, pool more funds for major projects and
intensify structural readjustment so as to avoid duplicated
construction.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Premier Li Peng at the Fifth Session of
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Li said China will give all-round consideration to the need to
accelerate economic growth and to the feasibility in terms of
financial and material resources.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China will pour a total investment of 2,530 billion
yuan in fixed assets at an investment rate of 32 per cent. The
investment, he said, will continue to favor agriculture and water
conservancy projects, to favor infrastructural facilities, basic
industries and pillar industries which receive major support from
the state, to favour the central and western parts of the country,
to favour technological upgrading, and to favour the fields of
science, technology and education.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese premier, more funds will be pooled for
key projects in order to ensure the completion of these projects
and the commencement of production. A number of major state
projects essential to the restructuring of the economy and a
number of projects which are of great importance for optimizing
the industrial structure and improving regional distribution will
be launched.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 will witness the damming of both the Three Gorges
and Xiaolangdi projects. In his government work report, Li called
for meticulous care in organizing the construction work of the two
projects and properly handle the issues of resettlement in the
dams areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Chinese government will also speed
up the construction of ordinary housing, which is not only
urgently demanded by urban residents, but also may help boost the
development of related industries, thus nurturing new areas for
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li Peng urged localities to conscientiously implement
the policy of shifting the mode of economic growth, strictly
control the launching of ordinary projects in the processing
industry, and avoid "large and all-inclusive" or "small and
all-inclusive" projects as well as duplicated construction.

Feasibility studies will be conducted carefully before
launching any new construction projects to ascertain whether or
not they are in line with the state industrial policies and plans
for the development of specific trades, whether their products
will be marketable, and whether there will be reasonable returns
from the investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will accelerate the reform of the investment system and
take more effective measures to minimize investment risks, he
said. A certain proportion of funds will go to profit-making
construction projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged to remove barriers between regions and
departments, vigorously developing diversified joint investment
and cooperative operation in order to avoid redundant
construction.
</P>
<P>
Li noted China will work out plans for structural readjustment
and technological upgrading and provide guidance for enterprises
so that they may adapt their production to market needs, actively
restructure their product mix, improve the quality of their
products, develop new products and new name brands and enhance
their market competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to vigorously develop markets,
especially rural markets, and offer more marketable products to
consumers in cities and the countryside.
</P>
<P>
He said China will also support the development of those
enterprises which produce marketable products and enjoy relatively
good economic returns, and cut down or adjust excessive production
capacity in some trades.
</P>
<P>
The central government will place emphasis on expansion of the
service industry, and on tourism and the information industry. It
will also provide sound guidance for consumers so that production
and consumption may develop in a coordinated manner and promote
each other, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Increase Financing to Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of Trade
and Industry has planned to increase government financial loans to
the country's small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) by 50
percent to 150 billion pesos (5.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report issued by the department, today's newspaper
Malaya said the extra financing will create 550,000 more jobs
across the country.
</P>
<P>
With the new loans, the number of the SMEs will rise to about
280,000 and more local firms will be attracted into the country's
regional growth centers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the banking system released a total of 100 billion
pesos (3.8 billion dollars) to the SMEs, a 25 percent increase
from 80 billion pesos (3.1 billion dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year's financing assistance represented 13.9 percent of
total loan portfolio of 722.7 billion pesos (27.6 billion dollars)
reported by the country's 563 banks.
</P>
<P>
This rate is 3.9 percentage points higher than the 10-percent
mandatory allocation from banks to lend small enterprises under a

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Commits to Tight Fiscal, Monetary Policies (9) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that China this year will continue to follow appropriately
tight fiscal and monetary policies to rein in price rises.
</P>
<P>
The state, especially the Central Government, is still
experiencing financial difficulties, Li told the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress, which opened in the Great
Hall of the People today.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, on the one hand, China must improve its taxation
system by levying taxes fairly and tightening tax collection and
management, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must collect taxes in strict accordance with the law, plug
loopholes such as tax evasion and tax fraud, making sure that all
that is taxable is actually taxed," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China must strictly control expenditures to
ensure that expenditure increases do not exceed revenues.
</P>
<P>
In preparing their budgets, governments at all levels should
make sure that they can make both ends meet and that budgeted
expenditures cover both material and construction costs, the
premier said, urging local governments to maintain a balance
between revenue and expenditure.
</P>
<P>
China should maintain a measured increase in the money supply,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
"To improve benefits from loans and to support production and
construction, we must restructure loans in accordance with the
state industrial policies, regional policies, policies for
technological development and the rules for granting loans," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called state banks to reduce costs and increase
economic returns and said that effort will be made to standardize
the securities and futures markets and heighten people's awareness
of the financial risks therein.
</P>
<P>
On prices, the premier said: "We should by no means relax
control over price rises, as pressure from inflation still
exists."
</P>
<P>
He also highlighted the urgency to reinforce financial and
economic discipline and standardize procedures relating to
financial revenue and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Financial management of enterprises should be strengthened and
efforts be made to gradually usher in professional auditing
services and strengthen supervision over auditing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must resolutely investigate into and punish all kinds of
acts of random and illegal fee-collecting and illegal monetary
apportionment and fund-raising," the premier said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, premier of the State
Council, said China will open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report delivered at the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here
today, Li said China will continue to encourage the special
economic zones, the Pudong New Area of Shanghai and other open
areas to play a more prominent role in reform, opening up and
economic development throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
China will make better use of both domestic and international
markets and resources in order to promote continued growth in
foreign trade and maintain a basic balance between import and
export, he said.
</P>
<P>
While consolidating and enlarging existing markets, China will
strive to open new markets and encourage the export of products of
high added value, especially complete sets of machinery and
electrical equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
More productive enterprises will be entitled to export
commodities on their own, and the system of export tax refunds
will be improved; the proxy system in foreign trade will be
improved; and efforts will be made to make the "Visit China '97" a
big success, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said China will continue to use foreign funds actively,
rationally and effectively, and encourage foreign businesses to
invest in a comprehensive development of agriculture,
infrastructural facilities, a comprehensive utilization of
resources, industries using high and new technologies as well as
in the central and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to draw on methods compatible with
international standards to keep domestic market competition in
good order. The government will improve services for, and
strengthen administration and supervision of, foreign-funded
enterprises with an emphasis on tax collection and management,
fulfillment of contracts and protection of workers' rights and
interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China will unswervingly pursue the policy of opening to the
outside world and will further strengthen its trade and economic
relations with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit. China's entry into the World Trade Organization accords
with the needs of both China and the world. We shall continue our
negotiations with relevant countries in accordance with the
principle of balanced rights and obligations," he said.

</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Bulgarian caretaker government

<HEADLINE> Beijing's First Wholesale Center for Electronic Publications Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's first wholesale center
for electronic publications and software products opened in
Zhongguancun, China's "Silicon Valley" Friday.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the center represents a major step forward
in the standardization process of the country's electronic
publications market.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the center, sponsored by the
Beijing Municipal Copyrights Protection Association, the center
will come under the close supervision and direction of the
Beijing Municipal Copyrights Bureau and the government of
Haidian District.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 2,000 square meters, the center sells
electronic publications and software products from 63 publishing
houses and computer companies.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhijun, Deputy Party Secretary of Beijing said that only
legally produced and quality electronic press products can obtain
access to the wholesale center.
</P>
<P>
Although China's total sales revenue reaches 843 million
U.S. dollars, the country's software market is still in its
infancy.
</P>
<P>
The lack of established sales channels and supervision
mechanism in the past decade has resulted in the spreading of
pirated and pornographic products in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Shen Rengan, deputy director of the National Copyrights Bureau,
said big efforts have been made in the country to crack down on
illegal software products and electronic publications, yielding
marked progress.
</P>
<P>
He added that "but a fully developed and mature supervision
mechanism is an efficient measure int he campaign to standardize
the electronic press market."

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Reform of State-Owned Enterprises (11) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- To improve the economic
performance of China's state-owned sector, the Chinese government
will focus on rejuvenating large state-owned enterprises and
enterprise groups and giving small ones more freedom of operation,
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng made the remark in his government work
report delivered at the opening meeting of the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress held here today.
</P>
<P>
With over 60 percent of state revenue deriving from state-owned
enterprises, two-thirds of all employees in cities and towns
working in state-owned enterprises, and with state-owned
enterprises dominating the fields of infrastructure, basic and
high technology industries, the premier said, the state sector of
the economy has made tremendous contributions to reform,
development and stability of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Li pointed out, some state-owned enterprises face
difficulties and problems as a result of irrational management and
operational systems, and due to the impact of structural
readjustment.
</P>
<P>
"Since large state-owned enterprises are the backbone of the
national economy, the Central Government has decided to
concentrate first on rejuvenating 1,000 state-owned enterprises,"
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, banks provided financial support to approximately
300 of these enterprises and intensified supervision over the use
of these credit funds, achieving fairly good results, and the
government will extend that practice to 511 enterprises this year,
said Li.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has been experimenting with 57
enterprise groups and will expand the experiment to 120 groups
this year in order to develop trans-regional and trans-industry
enterprise groups which combine industrial production,
technological development and trade. The reform measure is meant
to make them more competitive and stimulate other relevant
enterprises to develop, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
He said,"These selected enterprise groups will enjoy more
decision-making power and will be entitled to import and export
independently, and we should take the initiative to accelerate and
standardize the reform aimed at establishing a joint stock system
in enterprises and promote their sound development."
</P>
<P>
He called for all localities and departments to cooperate with
each other and support key competitive enterprises which achieve
good economic returns.
</P>
<P>
The premier also mentioned that efforts should be made to make
a success of experiments on the establishment of state-owned
holding companies in aviation, petrochemical and non-ferrous
metals industries.
</P>
<P>
Systems of management in electric power, metallurgical and
other industries will also be reformed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about smaller enterprises, Li said that most of the
more than 240,000 small state-owned enterprises throughout the
country are managed by city and county governments and reform is
carried out under the guidance of those governments.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the premier noted, some localities have
revitalized a large number of these enterprises through
re-organization, association, merger, joint stock partnership,
leasing, contract operation and sell-off.
</P>
<P>
"This year we shall quicken the pace of reform in this regard,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li told the deputies that joint stock partnership has been
introduced into small state-owned enterprises in some areas,
allowing employees to hold some shares while other shares remain
public.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the practice is beneficial to the
re-organization and upgrading of enterprises and helps change the
way they operate, the premier nevertheless stressed that great
attention should be paid to tightening the examination and
assessment of state assets to prevent losses.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Bankruptcy and Merging of Enterprises (13) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- China will standardize bankruptcy
procedures, encourage merging of enterprises and promote re-
employment while readjusting and reorganizing state-owned
enterprises to promote re-arrangement of assets and raise the
overall quality of the state sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the government report delivered at the Fifth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) today, Li
Peng, premier of the State Council said the Chinese government
conducted an experiment in 58 cities to optimize the capital
structure of enterprises, providing these enterprises with
preferential policies over the recent few years.
</P>
<P>
"This facilitated the re-organization and restructuring of
those enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the deputies present this year that the experiment will
be expanded to 110 cities. Enterprise merger and the declaration
of bankruptcy are important ways of selecting the superior and
eliminating the interior, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China will increase capital reserves to be used in
selected cities to clear the bad debts of merged and bankrupt
enterprises. In declaring enterprises to be bankrupt, the Chinese
government will act strictly according to the law. The proceeds
from sell-off of the assets of bankrupt enterprises will be used
first to make arrangements for the employees and then to repay
debts.
</P>
<P>
"Bankrupt enterprises shall be closed and no enterprises shall
be allowed to evade payment of debts through declaring
bankruptcy," he said.
</P>
<P>
China will encourage the merger of enterprises. In selected
cities, merged enterprises will be allowed to repay the principal
on their bank debts within a fixed period of time and will be
exempt from paying the interest.
</P>
<P>
China will encourage the association of enterprises so that
they will be able to expand their scale of operation through
complementing one another with respect to their unique advantages.
The merger and association of enterprises should proceed on a
voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
For some enterprises operating at a loss, provided they employ
workers in accordance with production needs and provided they can
increase efficiency while reducing their staff, China will reduce
or exempt them from interest on government loans as appropriate,
assist the redundant workers in finding placement in other trades
and assist those who are laid off in finding new jobs.
</P>
<P>
In light of specific conditions, he said, all localities should
establish re-employment funds out of contributions from local
finance, enterprises and social security funds.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese premier, China will create more job
opportunities, provide better vocational training for employment,
assist the laid off employees in revising their job-seeking ideas
and encourage them to find new jobs on their own.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Interior Minister
Anatoly Kulikov said Friday the government is tightening security
on the border with Chechnya, to guard against possible terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kulikov told Interfax news agency that the interior ministry
had put important targets under heavy guard in light of statements
from the rebel commanders that they would continue the war against
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said the eastern border would be closed to bandits but the
ministry would not send more troops to reinforce the region.
</P>
<P>
Chechen rebel commanders, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev,
Thursday threatened to attack Russian targets. They said they
would launch terrorist activities, involving 5,000 people, against
Russia until Moscow recognized the independence of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen interior ministry has set up a special department
to investigate kidnappings, the Itar-Tass news agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Newly elected President of Chechnya, Aslan Maskhadov, ordered
that kidnappers be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Armed Chechen rebels have detained hundreds of Russian hostages
in return for heavy ransoms or the release of imprisoned Chechen
criminals.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Reducing Debts for State-Owned Enterprises (14) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The unduly high rate of debt in
China's state-owned enterprises is an important factor sapping
their vitality, and the government will adopt a series of policies
and measures to assist them in reducing their debts, said a top
Chinese leader today.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, premier of the State Council, said the government will
gradually write off debts enterprises have incurred when
government appropriations have become loans, by converting them
into state capital funds in the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report delivered at the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), he said the
conversion will be completed in the coal, water conservancy,
hydropower and defense industries this year. Other industries
should lose no time in doing the same, he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the government will write off debts enterprises have
incurred since they began receiving capital construction operating
funds from the government in 1989 by gradually converting them
into state capital funds in the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, some large enterprises and enterprise groups will be
allowed to raise funds by issuing stocks or convertible bonds.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, when conditions permit, local governments may use
local finance to support some of their key enterprises which are
insufficiently funded with capital.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, enterprises should take the initiative to supplement
their accumulated funds and capital funds with their own financial
resources, make better use of these funds and reduce liabilities.

<HEADLINE> China to Help Eliminate Losses for State-Owned Enterprises (15) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Central government and local
governments will continue to help enterprises under their charge
to eliminate losses for state-owned enterprises in an effort to
conscientiously strengthen the operation and management of
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng made this remark in the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Scientific management is an important component in the
establishment of a modern enterprise system, and poor management
is a major factor contributing to current poor economic returns in
many enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said enterprises should change their concepts, and truly
gear up production to market demand and establish a management
system which is responsive to the competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the enterprises to handle well their basic work in a
down-to-earth manner, improve the management of production,
technology, operational costs, product quality, financial affairs
and marketing and speed up technological progress and provide
better after-sale services and expand their markets.
</P>
<P>
Competent administration is essential in revitalizing
enterprises, he said. It is, therefore, necessary to give top
priority to rectifying and improving enterprise administration.
This should be done by promoting to leading positions those who
have a pioneering spirit, are career-minded, good at operation and
management, and ready to share the joys and sorrows of other
employees.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier called on officials at various levels to
bear in mind the need to rely on the working class wholeheartedly,
strengthen democratic management and give full play to the role of
workers' conferences in democratic appraisal and supervision.
Efforts should also be made to pay great attention to safety in
production, tighten control over hidden perils and prevent and
reduce all kinds of accidents.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, most of the enterprises which are
operating at a big loss or experiencing great difficulties belong
to the textile, coal, machinery, forestry and military industries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, because the state has set quotas for subsidies
and provided loans at discounted interest rates, the coal industry
has actively diversified its operations, assisted surplus
employees to move on to other trades and reduced losses, thereby
achieving marked results.
</P>
<P>
Li noted this method will be tried out in other industries this
year as a means to extricate them from financial straits. He said
the Central Government and local governments will continue to be
responsible for helping the enterprises under their charge to
eliminate losses.
</P>
<P>
He said there exist a number of well-operated and well-managed
enterprises in various trades whose economic returns keep
increasing. "Their experience must be carefully summarized and
propagated," he said. "If more enterprises can outdo themselves
and even their counterparts in terms of economic returns, the
state sector of the economy will greatly improve."

office, in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Close to 3,000 deputies to the NPC from across the country
gathered in the Great Hall of the People to hear a report on the
work of the government by Premier Li Peng of the State
Council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li

Qiao Shi, executive chairman of the current NPC
session and chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, opened the

</P>
<P>
Following the ceremony, Qiao said that on the eve of the
session, China's respected and beloved Deng Xiaoping passed away
unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
The passing away of Deng Xiaoping has been an immeasurable loss
to the Party, the army and people of all ethnic groups, Qiao said.
He called for all the NPC deputies to turn grief into strength,
carry work forward at the behest of Deng Xiaoping and unite
closely around the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core, hold high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
adhere to the Party's basic line, in order to advance steadily the
great undertakings of socialist reform, opening up and
modernization drive pioneered by Deng.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Qiao, all present stood up in silent mourning
for Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,800 members of the National Committee of the
Chinese people's Political Consultative Conference and those in
charge of party, government and military organizations were
present at today's opening meeting in a non-deputy capacity.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 28 (Xinhua)-- Belorussia plans to speed up
negotiations on the border division with Ukraine, the visiting
Belorussian Foreign Minister, Ivan Antonovich, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries would sign the border agreement as soon as
possible, said Antonovich, who arrived here Thursday for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
"Border division concerns not only our two countries, but also
the whole of Europe," Antonovich said during talks with his
Ukrainain counterpart, Gennady Udovenko. "The sooner the agreement
is signed, the safer Europe will be."
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said Ukraine and Belorussia had different attitudes
towards the eastwards expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), but this would not affect bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers agreed that NATO's expansion should not create a
new Berlin Wall. "We have common interests over building the
European security system," Antonovich added.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed regional cooperation between
Ukraine, Belorussia and Poland. They told a press conference
regional economic cooperation could be a successful model for
other European countries.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Demands Cooperation in Anti-Drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Foreign Relations
Minister Jose Angel Gurria said today his country demands more
cooperation from the affected nations in Mexico's fight against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
He urged fuller recognition for Mexico's anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government made big efforts to eradicate drug
trafficking and money laundering, and it spent 1.5 billion U.S
dollars a year on this, Gurria said in a television statement.
</P>
<P>
Each year many men and women lost their lives in their fight
against drug trafficking .
</P>
<P>
For this reason, drug affected countries, especially United
States, should acknowledge Mexico's efforts.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. certification system, Gurria said that
what should be done was to cooperate, not certify, since drug
trafficking was a global phenomenon that needed international
cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Anyone who has paid a recent
visit to this scenic city in east China might wonder where the
flashy cigarette advertisements which used to dot the city have
gone.
</P>
<P>
This month the capital city of Zhejiang Province was listed
among the country's first cigarette ad-free cities by the Ministry
of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
The city has experienced several debates in recent years as to
whether cigarette ads should be allowed in scenic areas of the
city. As a result, "Drive cigarette ads out of Hangzhou" became a
slogan jointly launched by government departments and citizens.
</P>
<P>
In the past year all the open-air cigarette ads in the city
have been eliminated. Many hoardings and bulletin boards which
used to carry cigarette commercials now carry anti-smoking
messages.

<HEADLINE> South China City to Charge Dog Raisers Large Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Dog raising will become a very
expensive hobby for residents of south China's Shantou City
as a result of the local government's attempts to reduce
dog-biting cases by charging dog keepers huge fees.
</P>
<P>
A set of regulations on restricting keeping dogs, which was
approved by the standing committee of the ninth Municipal People's
Congress, the local legislative body, went into effect as from
today.
</P>
<P>
Dog owners who live in major urban areas will have to pay local
police departments 10,000 yuan (about 1,200 US dollars) each as a
registration fee and 3,000 yuan in annual examination fee, which
far exceeds an ordinary wage-earner's income, for each dog.
</P>
<P>
Those in other areas of the city will have to pay 5,000 yuan
and 1,000 yuan per dog, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dog walkers must now keep their pets on leads, while savage dogs
are not allowed to be taken to public places, according to the
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Shantou, one of five Special Economic Zones (SEZ) in China, is
China's fourth city to officially restrict the raising of dogs in
urban areas by charging enormous license fees, following Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more and more well-off Shantou people have
taken to raising dogs and other pets.
</P>
<P>
"However, some dogs harm public hygiene and are even a danger
to people," the regulation says.

NEW YORK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Coffee futures prices in New

concern about dwindling supplies still lingered over the market.
</P>
<P>
Green, Arabica coffee for May delivery rose 5.75 cents to 1.768

the March contract rose 7.30 cents to 1.904 U.S. dollars a pound,
the highest since October 26, 1994.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Brazilian coffee fields could
yield 27.5 million 132-pound bags of coffee this year, higher than
previous estimates of a 20 million bag crop. Some even predicted
the harvest would fall as low as 17 million bags.
</P>
<P>
But investors still worried about the quality of coffee beans
for this year and pushed prices higher.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey in Shanghai
showed that the young people here in China's largest city are more
broad-minded and career-minded and see eye to eye with their
international counterparts about life and work.
</P>
<P>
Facing reality and pursuing personal interests has become a new
fad among the city's six million people aged 15 to 39, about 45
percent of urban residents.
</P>
<P>
In response to the question of "What do you think is the most
respectable way to life?" 44.5 percent of those surveyed said
they prefer to live in accordance with their individual interests.
</P>
<P>
Just over 65 percent said they want to live according to their
own will, showing an amazing similarity to statistics among the
same group of people internationally.
</P>
<P>
Most of Shanghai's young people like to eat out in
fashionable, neat, but inexpensive restaurants rather than in
crowded and untidy snack bars that line the city's lanes.
</P>
<P>
Also like many other foreign young people, 66.13 percent of
Shanghai's younger people said they favor a job that combines a
sense of responsibility with hard but challenging work.
</P>
<P>
More closer economic ties with the outside world have made the
city's young people aware of different cultures. International
marriages probably reflect this trend of cultural exchanges.

U.S. Secretary of State Madelaine Albright had not achieved any

Russia is strongly opposed to the eastward expansion of NATO

WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- After some breakthroughs in
the trade wars with Japan, President Clinton will seek elimination
of more barriers in a second term, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said today.
</P>
<P>
Calling Japan a "uniquely difficult place for foreign firms to

in its efforts to attack unfair Japanese trade practices both
before the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in direct
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Japan's credibility in the United States and with its other
major trading partners as well depends on following through on its
commitments," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that U.S. government has "an elaborate process in
place to monitor these agreements" and U.S. "will continue to see
that they live up to the initial promise."
</P>
<P>
Japan has said that the WTO is the proper place for U.S.-Japan
trade disputes rather than head-to-head talks.
</P>
<P>
But Summers said while the WTO would be the proper venue for
many disputes, "wherever necessary, we will be prepared to pursue
our interest directly with the Japanese government."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Summers said the Clinton administration's policy
aims with Japan over the next four years would also focus on
prodding the Japanese government to continue efforts to spur its
sluggish economy by promoting increased domestic demand, rather
than exports, and to reforming its financial system.
</P>
<P>
Summers will travel to Tokyo next week for talks with Japanese
officials and lead a U.S. delegation to the first-ever meeting of
finance officials and central bank presidents from six Pacific Rim
countries and regions.

<P>
Mahugu told reporters that the Arab request was raised briefly
during Friday's morning session, in which the council discussed
the situation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has expressed his concern to
the move.

<HEADLINE> UN Examines Role of Energy in Development, Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) on Friday released a report entilted
Energy After Rio: Prospects and Challenges, which examined the
critical role of energy in development and environment.
</P>
<P>
"No issue lies at the intersection of development and
environment, more prominently and uneasily than energy," said
James Gustave Speth, UNDP Administrator.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that his report can serve to foster the international
debate and consensus process concerning the importance of
sustainable energy and refocus international commitment on these
critical issues during the 1997 Review of Rio," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, more than 1.5 billion people lack
access to electricity and two billion people still use traditional
fuels such as firewood and animal dung for cooking.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, fossil combustion today generates 76% of the
world's primary energy, the reliance of which has had severe
environmental consequences in the form of air pollution, acid rain
and increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. With
consumption growth, the situation is getting worse, the report
warned.
</P>
<P>
Then what should be done? "Sustainable energy can be used as an
instrument for creating rural jobs, e.g. through bioenergy, and
new technologies offer opportunities for affordable and vastly
improved energy services," said Thomas B. Johansson, Director of
the UNDP Energy and Atmosphere Program.
</P>
<P>
Increased access to energy is essential to providing improved
health care, education, housing, water and sanitation services for
people living in poverty, the report said. Decentralized sources
of electricity would make possible entrepreneurial and small-scale
business ventures, the report added.
</P>
<P>
"Wind power is technologically ready to be deployed as a major
option for providing electricity," said the report. Photovoltaic
cells in small-scale, stand-alone power applications and solar
thermal electric power today provide important renewable energy
supply options. Fuel cell, devices that convert hydrogen fuel
directly into electricity without first burning it to produce
heat, offer high thermodynamic efficiency, low maintenance
requirement, and zero or near-zero pollutant emissions.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the annual energy investment requirements worldwide
are projected to rise to 750 billion U.S. dollars by the year
2020, up from 450 billion U.S. dollars, the reports said that
renewable and higher efficiency energy systems would enable
developing countries to meet their growing energy needs at a lower
cost.

<HEADLINE> Burns: Shanghai Communique Is A Milestone in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman of the U.S. State
Department Nicholas Burns said today that the first Sino-U.S.
Communique, known as the Shanghai Communique, was "a key
milestone" in U.S. relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Burns said that the Shanghai
Communique and the other two communiques the United States signed
with China are "the foundation of U.S.-China relations".
</P>
<P>
Today is the 25th anniversary of The Shanghai Communique, which
opened up the path to the normalization of relations between China
and the United States. The communique laid down the principles for
relations between the two countries with different social systems
and ideology.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that since the signing of Shanghai Communique in
1972, the relationship between the United States and China "has
become significantly deeper and more extensive."
</P>
<P>
"For the future, we need to work to build a more constructive
relationship with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to a schedule of high-level visits during 1997
and 1998, and we hope to build on the record of the past to
achieve a more stable footing for U.S.-China relations over the
next several years, certainly more stable that we have had in the
last several years," he added.

<HEADLINE> France Asks Russia to Return Archives Moscow Keeps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- France today asked Russia to
return the French archives it has kept since the end of World War
II, but said that it is not clear how many objects of arts France
lost during the war are in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning the French public and private archives kept in
Moscow in the wake of World War II, the French government asks the
Russian government in a constant way that the application of the
agreement of restitution concluded on November 12, 1992, should be
resumed and carried through," said French Foreign Ministry vice
spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
He said that French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette raised
the issue recently with his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
The French archives were first robbed by Nazis from France, and
were then seized and brought home by the Soviet troops from
Germany at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
"In absence of all publicity from the Russian authorities of a
list of their `war trophies,' France does not have any knowledge
of the presence on the territory of the Russian Federation of
clearly identified French works of arts," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Le Figaro said today that some French cultural
properties robbed by Nazis and then seized by the Soviet troops
are now lying in "the cellars of Russian museums."
</P>
<P>
The daily said that France does not want to raise the issue
with Russia, because it does not want to add one more dispute with
Moscow besides that over NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Russian State Duma voted in early February that all
cultural properties seized by Soviet troops during World War II
are Russian properties.

to Congress, cautioned that the central bank may increase interest
rates even before a measurable increase in inflation is evident.
</P>
<P>
The concerns over a Fed rate hike continued today after another
Fed official issued some more cautionary comments.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices steadied after a two-day pullback, leaving the yield
on the 30-year Treasury unchanged at 6.80 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Recertifies Mexico as Anti-drug Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today decided to recertify Mexico as a fully cooperating ally in
fighting against narcotics smuggling, the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to certify Mexico was recommended unanimously by
top Clinton aides from the State, Defense, Justice and Treasury
departments and the National Security Council," the news agency
quoted a senior official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had a late morning
meeting Friday with Clinton on the matter, was expected to
formally announce the decision later today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was acting on the eve of the congressionally mandated
deadline for evaluating the anti-narcotics records of dozens of
drug source and drug transit countries.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the recertification despite 40 Congressmen demand
for decertification after Mexico had unearthed corruption in the
anti-drug battle.
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials had warned that decertification could lead to
reduced cooperation on anti-narcotics cooperation with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also renewed for another year his 1996 decision not to
certify the counter-narcotics program of Colombia.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Despite some congressional
opposition, U.S. President Bill Clinton today recertified Mexico
as a fully cooperating ally in the battle against drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also renewed for another year his 1996 decision not to
certify the counter-narcotics program of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's decisions were announced by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright this afternoon at a State Department news
conference after meeting with Clinton..
</P>
<P>
Clinton chose to recertify Mexico "with firm expectations of
further progress in the near term," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
But she added that Mexico's anti-drug effort would be
constantly monitored by senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 Congressmen signed a letter to Clinton urging
decertification after Mexico unearthed corruption in the battle
against drugs. But Mexican officials warned that such a decision
could lead to reduced on anti-drug cooperation with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The decision to deny certification to Colombia was based on a
judgment that "corruption remains rampant at the highest levels of
the Colombian government," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was acting on the eve of the congressionally mandated
deadline for evaluating the anti-narcotics records of dozens of
drug source and drug transit countries.
</P>
<P>
Mexico was among the 23 countries or regions that Clinton has
given certifications. But Clinton decertified Colombia,
Afghanistan, Burma, Nigeria, Syria and Iran and granted Belize,
Lebanon and Pakistan a waiver.

<HEADLINE> Intl Conference on Land Mines Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The four-day International
Conference on Land-mines ended here today as delegates urged all
governments to make formal pledges for the total ban on mines.
</P>
<P>
A final declaration issued by the conference also urged the
International Campaign for the Ban on Mines, all governments and
relative non-governmental organizations, to actively participate
in the negotiation process aimed at signing a treaty to ban the
production, sales, use and transfer of mines worldwide.
</P>
<P>
It called for creating a mine-free area in southern Africa
which is among the regions worst hit by the land mines in the
world.
</P>
<P>
African countries should abide by all the resolutions passed
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) concerning the ban on
mines in the continent, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
It also called on African states to follow the step of the
Mozambican government which on Wednesday declared a ban on the
use, storage and transfer of mines in the country.
</P>
<P>
Julio Mapote, coordinator of the Mozambican Anti-Mine
Campaign, said the basic objectives of the conference have been
met while noting that it is not enough to just sign an agreement,
which must be followed by concrete measures to implement it.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting, organized and attended mainly by
non-governmental organizations, is a way to bridge a dialogue
between the civil society and the government to bring consensus
on the mine issue.
</P>
<P>
The conference have been attended by 400 delegates from 60
countries.
